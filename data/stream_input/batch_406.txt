B000002B2T|5.0|When most people think of Mad Season, they think oh Matchbox 20's second album, but only the people with great music taste will tell you that Mad Season was a Seattle Supergroup, featuring the late-great Layne Staley, and Pearl Jam's Mike McCready, and Screaming Tree's John Baker Saunders and Barrett Martin. This album is nothing like you think this line-up would produce, you have the deep moving intrespective &quot;All Alone&quot; which showcases Staley's ablitiy for making one sentence into a powerful statement. The bluesly rocker &quot;Artificial Red&quot; and the hit- you in the head rocker &quot;I Don't Know Anything&quot; to the dark,senaster, and moody &quot;Long Gone Day&quot;. Truley a radical departure from anything all the other seattle bands were doing at the time, and nothing done really ever since! Mad Season was truley ahead of their time and unfortunately we will never get to see how or if this band would have really unfolded. A Rock Tragedy!!!!!!!!
B00004Z459|5.0|Itz been more than 3 yrs since Hybrid Theory came out. However we are yet to see an album which can beat it. The phenomenal success of Hybrid Theory is yet to be surpassed and it would definately be another LP album which would do this job. All the songs on this album are masterpieces and anyone who gets bored listening to them doesn't really know what music is. My advice to you, buy this album right now if you haven't yet. Linkin Park is definately the most talented band out there. Keep up the good job LP and keep coming out with such albums.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|This is a great effort from the supergroup known as A Perfect Circle.  Sorry it took me so long to write this review but I had no idea to react when it came out.  This cd has everything rock, metal, alternative, and just good tunes.  My favorite that took me the longest to get use to but it is a great track which of course is &quot;The Package&quot;.  Probably the hardest song on the cd and gives you a hint of Tool.  My other favorites &quot;Blue&quot;, &quot;Weak And Powerless&quot;, &quot;The Outsider&quot;, and &quot;Pet&quot;.  There may be some mainstreams songs on here but this is a great follow-up to there debut.  I will be looking forward to there next release.  Check out there debut its pretty d$mn good as well.
B0001ENY6M|3.0|This is a fine album--almost as good as Gabriel's Passion soundtrack. However, many of you seem to be interested in using music to 'transport yourselves to the time of Christ while meditating on scripture.' For those people, I must reccomend that you immediately buy a copy of Passion Sources, which showcases the actual artists from the Holy Land, to transport you to an actual time of Christ rather than a modern film maker/star's idea of what the actual time of Christ would sound like if it were in a movie.
B0001HAHXW|5.0|Don't listen to the other negative reviews about Me and Mr. Johnson.  This CD rocks, and I've got to give Clapton props for doing such a great job with this latest album.  Go get this bad mofo now...
B0000BYM3K|4.0|I have been a fan of Iron Maiden for 20 years.  I saw them at Radio City Music Hall on the &quot;Powerslave&quot; tour, which yielded &quot;Live After Death,&quot; as well as the &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; tour, and I have every album from the both the Paul Di'Anno and Bruce Dickinson eras.  In other words, I have perspective on their music.  As heretical as it sounds, I think the song &quot;Dance of Death&quot; is as good as any song they have ever recorded, excepting (but perhaps even including) &quot;Hallowed Be Thy Name.&quot;  It is that good.  &quot;Paschendale&quot; is also first-rate and sure to be a classic both on tour and in Maiden history, and there are several other good songs on the disc.  On the whole, though, it is a fairly uneven effort, as most of their CDs have been (though Piece of Mind and Killers are pretty close to flawless).  But that title track, &quot;Dance of Death&quot; is just about as close to perfect as a song can get.  It is an epic in the Iron Maiden mold--as is Paschendale--but more complex, melodic, catchy, and intense than even ordinary Maiden epics.  It's just a great, great song, elevating an otherwise good album to a great one.  If you like songs like Hallowed Be Thy Name, Where Eagles Dare, Revelations, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, Phantom of the Opera, and Sign of the Cross (especially the &quot;Live in Rio&quot; version, which is amazing), you will love this dancing-with-ghouls-in-the-fire classic.  It's lyrically like Number of the Beast, but structurally like Rime of the Ancient Mariner--and it has an orchestra that totally enhances the sound.  Excellent, excellent, excellent.
630521610X|2.0|I`m not really into this type of movie, but for its genre &quot;Scream&quot; definitely isn`t too bad. Unfortunately, it`s not that great either, presenting a decent plot with a couple of convincing twists. Director Wes Craven manages to deliver some suspenseful situations here, yet the overall result never rises above average and not too surprising material. At least, &quot;Scream&quot; is still better than most of its clones that appeared everywhere during the late nineties, offering a competent and watchable entertainment. But it`s just that, a disposable and forgettable entertainment, far from a truly remarkable cinematic experience.<br />I`ve seen worse.
B00005KFUM|5.0|Just buy the damn album. <BR>You may be hearing alot about 'Absolution', seeing as it is the first North American release of this power-driven band, but this is the album purest of energy. <BR>The feeling of this album is hard to display in words, you can only experience it -- so do so.
0446677450|1.0|Before you waste your money, see what the REAL real estate moguls have to say:<br />[...]<br />I really hate seeing people getting wealthy talking about something they have little to no understanding of.
1878424319|5.0|The Four Agreements is truly a living document.  This book speaks to me each time I open it, in ways always relevant to what is going on in my life.  An amazing work of art. <br />Another excellent Toltec book is \\"The Power of Belief\\" by Ray Dodd.  This is the best &quot;how to&quot; description of the Mastery of Awareness, and the Mastery of Transformation that I have ever come across.  I highly recommend it be read in conjunction with The Four Agreements.
B0001EFTVA|5.0|Before I saw it, I read in one of customers' reviews that while watching this animation people tend to believe the characters being under impression that this is a live movie with real actors. I watched it today - it is totally true! I could see realistic emotions of drawn characters, which I never experienced watching animation.<br /><br />And I loved the story. Don't believe to trailer; what you saw there is not what you expect to find in the movie... the story develops in a very dynamic way with absolutely unexpected result! That was really entertaining, and thanks to other customers for not disclosing the plot in their reviews! Intrigued? Watch it!<br /><br />By the way, please keep your children out of this DVD, as there are some violence, a few explicit talks, and lots of serious social problems, which you would not be able to explain them....
B00018D44U|3.0|I really, really liked &quot;Come Away With Me.&quot; I like this album because it's more of the same. On the other hand, I am unimpressed with this second album because... it's more of the same. Moreover, somehow, this second time around, the sound and the lyrics seem trite in a way that they did not on the first album.<BR>And for gods' sake, who ever thought that people who like Norah Jones' voice and singing style would appreciate Dolly Parton's shrill caterwauling?!?
B00004ZAV3|4.0|Because a lot of the Beatles' albums were inconsistent in terms of song quality (like Magical Mystery Tour), this CD offers a chance to get the better songs without having to buy one of the group's average albums.  This is also a great way to get the good singles like Paperback Writer and Lady Madonna that are not on the British releases. Probably one of the best ways to listen to the Beatles. Recommended, 4 stars.
B0001BKAEE|2.0|I feel obligated to let you know how awful this movie is. I am not going to bash the Matrix as a whole (even though it might deserved it), and I am going to try not to belittle the series' dedicated fans, but this movie stunk it up.<br />It seems as though the Wachowskis completely ignored logic, and decided that things would happen in this movie simply because they decided they would. Why else would Smith inexplicably die after defeating Neo? Why else would the machines just simply decide to comply with Neo's request for peace after (again) inexplicably defeating their common enemy? <br />This movie is the height of incoherent, mindless action dreck. Those fans that try to look for the deeper meaning here ignore the fact that there is no emotional depth to any of the struggles, they exist only fo their own sake. So what if we are all in a machine? I don't know, so it doesn't matter. For all I know, we are all just imaginings in the mind of God, but how does that make me any less real, or my life any less important? If anything, the humans brought themselves out of a computer generated utopia into a miserable reality.<br />For people who don't like this movie, don' t let the fans con you into feeling stupid or guilty. A bad movie is a bad movie. This CGI junk is getting way out of hand (a computer generated wolf man in &quot;Van Helsing,&quot; a cgi Storm Trooper talking to the queen in &quot;Episode 2.&quot;) I am weary of it.<br />Also, note the pathetic similarities between that annoying kid in the matrix and jar jar binks. Mind numbing comic relief? Inexplicable goofiness?<br />Wachowski's, you left me far behind with this one.
B00018D44U|3.0|Ok, so all the critics ripped apart this CD... they don't know what they're talking about... it's just as good as the first... it's just not a novelty any longer... I did notice that Hitcooper.com just chose her as their artist pick for May... that proves that some people out there have some clue into music... i would definitely recommend the CD if you want something that is chill and has some definite artistic/musical value...
0800177177|2.0|I am somewhat perplexed by all the wonderful reviews for this movie, especially since \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" is nothing of the sort.  For all that director Francis Ford Coppola made this film out to be a loyal adaptation of Stoker's classic, it radically alters the source novel and is no more faithful to the spirit of the book than it is the letter.  Turning Dracula into a vampirized Romeo is a bad joke, and the love affair between the Count and the all-too-willing Mina turns Stoker's gothic nightmare inside-out.  And where did this version of Van Helsing come from?  Gone is Stoker's scholar-crusader, replaced by a scene-chewing clown who badly needs some rehab. More's the pity because Anthony Hopkins is a great actor, and indeed the all-star cast of Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder, Keanu Reeves, et al, could have really shone with better material.  The film is justifiably praised for its outstanding cinematography and the special effects are likewise excellent, so that the picture is good eye-candy if nothing else--and indeed, there is nothing else. Naturally, Coppola exaggerates the story's sexual component, which is typical of a post-Hammer vampire film but adds nothing of value to the plot--unless you count all the bare-chested damsels in distress, none of whom seem to know how to keep their clothes on. To top it off, the ending is a hurried anti-climax which closes with Annie Lennox's \\"Love Song for a Vampire,\\" a totally out of place pop song barely a notch above \\"Lust For a Vampire's\\" infamous \\"Strange Love.\\"  If only they had actually adapted the novel.  They didn't, and the result is a visually appealing but otherwise frustrating and sometimes insulting movie.  Sorry, but if you want to see Dracula brought to life your best bets are still the Max Schreck, Bela Lugosi or Christopher Lee versions.  This one just doesn't have the bite.
B000002JSJ|5.0|I found it unbelievable that this album has actually recieved some reviews that classify it as &quot;sub-par&quot;.  As a true Zeppelin fan I'll give you the truth, that this album is pure classics.  People don't like this album as much because it is less mainstream and different but anyone who tells you this  is no Zeppelin fan.  &quot;Achilles last stand&quot; is yet another epic 10 minute-plus rock masterpiece, although I'd say it falls second in my mind to &quot;Tea for One&quot;. I couldn't believe people were knocking Tea for one, or some people saying it was &quot;good&quot; or &quot;acceptable&quot;.. What is this?  I guess these people haven't listened to the song or do not appreciate the bluesy-rock Zep tunes.  The guitar is simply outstanding and is practically a second vocalist, as there are not many words and many, many quality guitar riffs.  This album also features some excellent &quot;out there&quot; or &quot;different&quot; tracks like &quot;Royal Orleans&quot;, &quot;Candy Store rock&quot;, and &quot;Hots on for nowhere&quot;.  &quot;Nobody's fault but mine&quot; would have to be my third favourite track on the album, starts off with a phaser and breaks into a feel-good guitar driven rhythm, later including a Plant harmonica solo and a quality Page guitar solo at the finish.<br />In conclusion, if you're not a big fan I wouldn't advise you to buy this album opposed to the classics, but if you love Zeppelin you definately must have it.
B000092Q8C|4.0|I was a bit spooked by the album cover when I hesitantly bought this album when it was re-released in remastered form in 2002. However I was absolutely blown away at how dark and powerful it was, not to mention a far cry from any of the more well-known material of his.<br />His 1978 self-titled album aka the \\"Scratch\\" LP is an incredibly weird, eccentric, and surprisingly adventurous album and had a very raw and somewhat undercooked production style to it. The closing song \\"Home Sweet Home\\" is a lyrically very dark and morbid song even though musically, it's quite nice but even as morbid as it was, that song had no evidence to what his third album aka \\"The Melting Face\\" LP would bring along. This album completely throws his first two albums into the back and boy oh boy, this album is SCARY as hell! Any signs of his search for a sound are completed on this 1980 masterpiece and the results are not just amazing but also immensely though-provoking and really powerful. By 1980 standards, PG3 is unbelievably innovative, groundbreaking and unbelievably powerful.  Most of the songs on this album have a very disturbing undertone to them, even on a musical scale but it is done so well that the result is one of Gabriel's most outstanding achievements of his career.<br /> This album could very well be considered a socially conscious album but this album differs from almost every other album in this topic where as most are just addressing the wrongs of the world and societies, PG3 delves much further and aims to tell the story from the perspective of the people who do these wrongs. (I.E. Family Snapshot)<br /> This CD also uses mental illness as a theme as well and the results are just phenomenal and I can't even justify how this album really is with that word. The album cover alone vividly expresses what you are in for.<br /> \\"Intruder\\" gets my nod as one of the scariest tracks that Gabriel has ever recorded, or even the scariest song from the 1980s. Courtesy of his longtime friend and former Genesis band mate on the drums, the song begins with really loud and metallic drums with no cymbals, the creaking sounds of wires being pulled or something like that and then a really terrifying distorted melody not to mention some of the creepiest vocals I've ever heard but the results are not just a great track, but one of the most vividly terrifying musical experiences I've ever had but it's a really awesome kind of scare! Only Peter Gabriel could so something like that: Making scary music sound good. In all honesty, \\"Intruder\\" is a really disturbing track as it's about sung from the perspective of the intruder in a house.<br /><br /> \\"Family Snapshot\\" is disturbingly powerful and really a chilling track that tells the story of the assassination of a popular political figure (Not necessarily Kennedy) from the perspective of the assassin. The song begins with a mellow piano beginning that has a very dramatic and serious tone and does some interesting melodic changes before it builds and becomes a heavy-rock song like something out of an action drama and then everything culminates at the \\"Let the bullet Fly!\\" lyrical line! Immensely disturbing but really an amazing track this is. The last part of the song which is mellow but very sad is almost like a biographical flashback of when that assassin was a child and witnessing his parents relations turning ugly and the child turned sad and angry and picks up his `toy gun' on the floor. Such a heartbreaking song this is but it is really excellent and one of the best songs on this album. I would almost say that this is almost like a mini-epic song. It perfectly transitions into the electrifying \\"And Through The Wire\\" which is a more upbeat rock-oriented song and one of the most `pop' sounding songs on this album but even then it's a far cry from anything mainstream!<br /> There are no real ballads on this album so if you are aiming for something slow and happy, look elsewhere. The closest thing to a balladis \\"Lead A Normal Life\\" and even then, while the song is calmer than the others, it's more like a hazy, and unpleasant calm like after an explosion or disastrous event. The song is very eerie and hazy in tone and tells the story of a mental patient at a decrepit hospital trying to lead a normal life again. I especially am chilled at the part where he sings the lone lyrical line about the song's theme. This disturbing masterpiece ends on an uncertain note with the song \\"Biko\\" which is a powerful tribute to the late South American Civil Rights activist Stephen Biko. The song is very intense and has African drums and the lyrics are really powerful and moving. It closes the album with the sounds of a protest happening and then fading out into the night. In all honesty, \\"Biko\\" is the perfect closing track for an album. I could never imagine this not being the closing track for any album, compilation or `proper studio album'.<br /> I strongly urge that you go out to the nearest CD store and purchase this powerful and riveting masterpiece. Fans of \\"Sledgehammer\\" and \\"Big Time\\" will be thrown off by the monochromic nature of PG 3 but if you appreciate PG2 or \\"Security\\" then welcome to PG 3! If you love this album, then I highly recommend his most recent album \\"UP\\" as well!is \\"Lead A Normal Life\\" and even then, while the song is calmer than the others, it's more like a hazy, and unpleasant calm like after an explosion or disastrous event.

B0000026UV|5.0|There is something irrepressably endearing about this odd combo of old & new guitar wizards, each with obvious delight in the other's playing. They lay down grooves that simmer with restrained elegance and precision licks more akin to swing music than country/rock. Absolutely engaging, toe-tappin' fun for music fans of all tastes and ages (my 87 year old father likes it). I have most of the Mark Knopfler/Dire Straits albums, but this is my favorite. Sgt. Pepper says: \\"Guranteed to raise a smile\\".
6302517052|5.0|OK, what can I say about critters...CULT CLASSIC OF THE 80'S! <br />Critters is a horrific story of carnivorous aliens who come to Earth in a feeding frenzy for human flesh. Although i said its &quot;horrific&quot; there really is only one scary part, the rest is hilarious! this movie is seriously one of the best out there! you can normally find it really cheap at places like wall mart or shopko or hastings! if you like this one get the second one and maybe the third one...but skip the fourth one! Its crap!
B0000C8AQM|5.0|They got the kids version of its a long way to the top, but so other AC/DC and they have AC/DC in the movie. That was what made me disappointed.
B00005K9LN|5.0|This is not the best Judas Priest album. It is in the top 3 of all the album's they have done.<BR>1.Rapid Fire: 8/10 Super fast and overall good song.<BR>2.Metal Gods:7/10 Cool guitar solo and a wierd sounding chorus.<BR>3.Breaking The Law:9/10 Never gets old but, needs a Guitar solo.<BR>4.Grinder:7/10 I like the vocal's and lyrics. <BR>5.United:5/10 I like the verse's but, the chorus is lame. The drums are really lame.<BR>6.Don't Have to Be Old to Be Wise:8/10 Best pre-chorus ever. Cool riffs.<BR>7.Living After Midnight:7/10 Fun song but, the verse's get old <BR>8.The Rage:7/10 Decent but, nothing great<BR>9.Steeler:5/10 Not a favorite of mine.<BR>Overall this is a great album. Not has heavy as other stuff. Still any new fan should get this one. I bet all long time fans have this album.
B000002JPA|4.0|Images &amp; Words is the first Dream Theater album with James LaBrie, the singer that has since worked very well for the band. Many fans still regard this as DT's best album. I disagree, but it is still very good. It's definitely the album responsible for putting them on the map, with &quot;Pull Me Under&quot; getting occasional radio play, and &quot;Learning to Live&quot; and &quot;Metropolis Pt. 1&quot; finding their places as regular concert favorites even to this day.<br />Pull Me Under (7/10): This one builds up nicely to the main riff, which is undoubtedly one of Dream Theater's better metal riffs. As a whole, the song is somewhat standard. It follows a very standard song progression (verse 1, chorus, verse 2, chorus, bridge, chorus), which is unusual for a song this long. The guitar solo is decent but not one of Petrucci's more innovative ones.<br />Another Day (9/10): A lighter song that has a very 80s sound to it (some may see this as a negative; I happen to like the 80s). It has some of Petrucci's better guitar playing on the album, with a lot more than just shredding. The keyboard parts are not intrusive at all. There's also a saxophone! Prog-metal needs more saxophone use. The song is a little bit short, but it seems to go as far as it should. This has always been one of my favorite DT songs.<br />Take the Time (8/10): This one does insane timing changes during the intro, and it's amazing how well the band pulls it off without making it sound forced. Some of the vocals here feel a little bit harsh, and there's a bit too much instrumental wankery in the middle section (as opposed to instrumental stuff that goes somewhere). The ending where it gets slowed down is very nice.<br />Surrounded (7/10): Another light song that has a very mainstream feel to it. It's based mostly on LaBrie's vocals, though there is a short guitar solo. It's a perfectly decent song, but nothing spectacular.<br />Metropolis Pt. 1 (7/10): One of the longer songs, this has been a fanfavorite for a long time. There are parts of it that are very good, but it has far too much needless wankery. Long instrumental passages are fine as long as there's some kind of vision of where it is going, and I don't get the feeling that there was in this case. It feels like they just wanted to try and inject some complicated stuff to impress the listener with.<br />Under a Glass Moon (7/10): For some reason that I still don't understand, the guitar solo in this song is ranked by many as the best of all time. It is very fast and complicated, but it doesn't have a whole lot of feeling to it beyond the speed. Petrucci is much better than just a speed player, and he proves this with later albums. It's a decent DT song overall.<br />Wait for Sleep (9/10): This is essentially a prelude to Learning to Live. It stands quite well on its own, however, with the beautiful piano arrangements and LaBrie at his very best. The band really ought to play this first whenever they play Learning to Live live, because it is a great song and it goes so well with the latter epic.<br />Learning to Live (10/10): Perhaps one of the band's top 5 songs of all time. Everyone here shines, but the real gem is the long instrumental section that comprises the middle part of the song. I should be clear; it is not a guitar solo. Quite different from the instrumental parts I have complained about in other songs, this part goes somewhere. This section relies heavily on all instrumental musicians in the band, and it hits several climax points along the way. At one point, it repeats the piano theme from Wait for Sleep in a lower octave, which follows very smoothly into a great little solo bit by Petrucci. The song finishes up with a repeat of the chorus, and a short finale bit by Petrucci that fades out gradually. It's a great way to end the album.<br />That comes out to 8/10, or 4 out of 5 stars. What, I didn't give it 5 stars? It's really hard to get 5 stars from me. I do like this album a lot, butit's not the best, or even DT's best.
B00005Y1Z4|4.0|This album is filled with hazy,seductive and danceable songs, so much more than just tainted love!
B000002JKA|4.0|Awake is a slightly heavier release than the classic Images &amp; Words. This album has a great dark feel to it, exemplified by songs like &quot;Voices&quot;, &quot;The Mirror/Lie&quot;, and &quot;Space Dye Vest&quot;. Despite some stellar numbers, there are also a few mediocre tunes that bring the overall rating down.<br />6:00 (7/10):There's a cool groove to the riff that starts this song off. One of the problems I have with this song, which Dream Theater does far too often, is the spoken voice-overs that occur at certain points. This is a very typical, good DT song. Nothing too out of the ordinary here.<br />Caught in a Web (6/10): Catchy chorus with good output from LaBrie, decent main riff, uninspired solo. Not much else to say, a pretty average DT song overall.<br />Innocence Faded (8/10): This song is a great throwback to the 80s. I've said in other reviews that I love the 80s, so it gets points for that. LaBrie does some great work doing both gentle vocals and his high power shrieks. Petrucci offers good stuff throughout the whole song, and solo has a sort of Journey-like feel to it (at least I see it that way).<br />Erotomania (9/10): A blistering instrumental with fast and slow parts. Petrucci takes center stage on this song, of course, but you do hear input from the rest of the band (minus LaBrie, of course). He even does a short but impressive rendition of a classical piece during the most intense part of the song. This song is a great combination of speed, technicality, and feeling. It is made even more potent by the seamless transition into the next song (Erotomania is the first of a 3-part suite).<br />Voices (9/10): The intro to this song is a great riff that breaks suddenly into the most gentle vocals from LaBrie with just piano in the background. This song is loaded with emotions, on the soft parts and on the more intense parts. Even the guitar solo, while being incredibly fast, manages to maintain a sense of the feeling surrounding it at the sametime. The song is dark and haunting, and certainly one of the best on the album.<br />The Silent Man (8/10): This is a short acoustic song, but it is quite well-done. It ends the trilogy suite that Erotomania and Voices are a part of, and it also echoes part of Erotomania during a short bridge.<br />The Mirror (7/10): The heaviest song on the album. There's not a lot that stands out on it, but it picks up a nice melody where James starts singing &quot;Let's stare the problem right in the eye...&quot;. It also segues flawlessly into Lie, the next song.<br />Lie (8/10): The vocals have such a cool sense of rhythm that is quite rare for the band. When the song returns to the same segue that ended The Mirror, expect to hear John Petrucci's best speed solo, which is fast, complex, and still loaded with emotion.<br />Lifting Shadows off a Dream (6/10): The vocals are nice, and there are some good non-guitar instrumental sections. It feels like something is lacking, though.<br />Scarred (9/10): Probably the best song on the album. There are so many ranges of emotion and musical intensity wrapped up in this song. It starts with a fantastic blues solo by Petrucci, some gentle vocals by LaBrie, and then on to the metal part. There's a part where LaBrie sings &quot;Do you feel... you don't know me anymore...&quot; that conveys such a strong feeling of understanding that the listener can relate to. It's my favorite part of the whole song, and possibly of the whole album. The guitar solo (not the intro) is fairly run-of-the-mill, though.<br />Space Dye Vest (8/10): One of the most unique songs the band has ever done (it is mostly regarded by the band as Kevin Moore's song, which is why they won't play it live without him). There is a lot of voice-over in this song, but unlike the other songs which have voice-over, it feels like part of the song, so it isn't distracting. There are some fine piano parts here and there, especially towards the ending. <br />7.73/10, or 4/5. I don'trecommend this as your first DT album, but you will definitely want it once you have gotten into some of their other work.
B0001Z53AQ|4.0|First off this cd is defintitely an improvement over the last one( although that on was great also). D12 world definitely seems a little repetitive at first but afetr taking the time to listen almost anyone can appreciate it. The only downside to this cd ar the skits which make you smile at the most and the already ( though not suprising) played out &quot;My Band&quot;. Also many of the beats if you are a hardcore fan seem a little familiar beacause of eminems beat making style but this is really nothing to downgrade the cd.  With songs like 40oz, Just like u, and get my gun, this cd is sure to be a chart topper. All together I would give this cd a 9/10. Sure to be loved my fans and definite to recruit some new ones.
0449227421|2.0|I haven't read anything else by Ken Follett, and based on this book, I don't plan to.  The story line was unbelievable, the plot full of holes, and I didn't care about the characters.  Don't waste your money buying this book.
B0000YB7Z8|5.0|This album represents, for lots of Tull fans, their best era. I like them all, but it is obviously a great era. And what a great end of that era is this record. They were on their best form, and the selection is perfect. Just the small SFTW version could be better. But it's amazing, nevertheless. Martin Barre rocks along Ian Anderson and all those wonderful musicians of the time.     Having the album is a must for fans. No doubt about it.
0671015206|5.0|The Millionaire Next Door<BR>By, Thomas J Stanley, Ph.D. &amp; William D. Danko, Ph.D.<br />The distorted picture most Americans have of who has wealth and who doesn't is repainted by the strokes of genius Dr. Stanley and Dr. Danko put into their book, The Millionaire Next Door.  Among \\"the surprising secrets of America's wealthy,\\" are descriptions of how real millionaires acquired their wealth.  The book analyzes everything from what and how much you consume to how your children will be affected by your wealth.  The book teaches everything from how wealthy people avoid losing large amounts of money to the IRS to what field people should consider working in.  <br />The authors spent a great deal of time and energy researching people with more than a net worth greater than one million dollars.  The people that they interviewed were not the celebrities and professional athletes that many people would imagine as a part of a research project like this one.  The answers came from the people \\"next door.\\" The answers provide the readers with a good foundation, seven rules, for a way to acquire wealth. <BR> <BR>The book will analyze how likely you are to become wealthy based on your actions and your ancestry.  Anyone interested in becoming wealthy during his or her lifetime would find this book to be a great read and a great education.
B00011RPB0|3.0|I had high expectations for this film.  I'd heard good reviews and thought that the theme offered a lot of potential.  But I was disappointed to find it very slow moving.  Perhaps it's fitting for the title.  Not only were the characters, a young female and a middle-aged male, lost in their lives and alienated from their spouses, but they were lost in the linguistic and cultural world of Tokyo.  And to impart that lack of rootedness to the viewer, we have to wander with them, feeling the same lassitude and confusion.  I give it a few stars for taking a unique angle, but I didn't feel what I got from the movie was worth the time being lost.
B00005JMEW|4.0|His style of overexagerating nearly everything, leaves a crick in your side, and covering your face the next.  Funny, and beautiful.  Tarintino obviously honing his skills.  People shouldent have the right to look down on someone elses artistic abilities; Ill bet that any one of the other dolts who gave this STUNNING video a bad review couldent do half of what this man can do.  Id recommend it to nearly anyone.  With the exclusion of those with heart problems, those allergic to orange spores, and those who suffer from retardism.  Its a good movie, makes you laugh, makes you cry.  Makes you cheer for The Bride.  Dont let others intimidate you, fool you, or steer you clear of this movie.
B000002HPT|4.0|Falling Into Infinity is the often-maligned album by Dream Theater. Hard-core DT fans will tell you that this is the sell-out album, the one where they abandoned their roots and tried to make radio-friendly music. So it may come as some surprise that this is one of my favorite albums by Dream Theater. It's not perfect, and there are a few rotten apples. It has a lot less technical prowess than many of DT's other albums, but it does feature the best of John Petrucci's guitar playing, and many of the best vocal melodies written by the band. My opinion about technicality is that it is a route towards expression of what the band might aim for, if they choose to take that route; it is not in itself successful music. Fortunately they realized that when they wrote this album.<br />New Millenium (7/10): The keyboard intro is a little whacko, but the guitar/bass parts that follow are great. Overall, it is an okay song. <br />You Not Me (5/10): James LaBrie's attempts to sound rough aren't convincing. The song as a whole is very uninteresting.<br />Peruvian Skies (9/10): Beautiful chorus, a good mix of heavy and light moments, and a great guitar solo.<br />Hollow Years (8/10): Call it mainstream, call it sell-out, call it catchy... I don't care. This is a great song, and even greater live. It does have a very mainstream sound to it, with a mostly accoustic guitar and catchy chorus line.<br />Burning My Soul (6/10): Has some good riffs, but the vocals are annoying, and the lyrics cheesy.<br />Hell's Kitchen (9/10): An instrumental with some great soaring guitar work and weird but good key changes. One of DT's best instrumentals.<br />Lines in the Sand (10/10): Starts off with some back and forth change between a lonely synthesizer and a lonely distorted guitar. From here it builds to make a true Dream Theater classic. It features a phenomenal bluesy solo. Petrucci has never poured as much emotion into a solo as he does in this song. If it were much longer, it could well be thegreatest guitar solo of all time. There are some other great instrumental parts which follow later in the song.<br />Take Away My Pain (8/10): The vocal melody here is great, especially the bridge which then leads into another gem of a Petrucci solo.<br />Just Let Me Breathe (6/10): It has some decent riffs, but other than that the song strikes me as too direct with its intent, and often cheesy. I don't particularly like the vocal melody either.<br />Anna Lee (9/10): This song is so gorgeous. A lot of people seem to hate it though. It's another one with a somewhat mainstream sound, but who cares about that? The vocal melody is breathtaking, and Petrucci pulls off a great guitar solo full of feeling.<br />Trial of Tears (10/10): Dream Theater's best song ever? It's debatable; it certainly has some competition with a few other songs. What I will say is that this song is an incredible epic, and one of the few songs to feature lyrics written by the bassist, John Myung. It's a shame, because it shows he should clearly be given more opportunities to write lyrics. The vocals are great, and carry a sadder emotion than most of the rest of the album (even Take Away My Pain, which sounds more upbeat than it should). The guitar solo is out of this world, and probably my favorite solo ever by JP. It is loaded with emotion, but not only that, it feels as though it drastically changes emotion every time the solo changes from one key to the next. And when that's over, you get a great keyboard solo by Derek Sherinian. Normally I really don't like what DT has tended to do with synthesizers, but this part is great, and it continues much of the same emotional turmoil that the previous guitar solo accomplished.<br />Other DT fans will surely disagree, but I tend to recommend this album first for people looking to start getting into Dream Theater. So many potential fans are turned off by the pretentious wankery that overflows many of DTs other albums. This album is all about the songs.7.9 / 10, or 4 out of 5 stars. Could have been a 5 star album if a few of the bad apples in the bunch were just a little more inspired.
B0000025DI|5.0|The recording is muddy. The imagery is mostly dark. The last album before the born again phase. The backup singers are annoying at times.

I never understood why everybody loved Will Ferell (sp?) so much but now I do.  Watch this!!
B0000AQVCL|1.0|Jet annoy me.  <br />Maybe it's the way they brag about their partying lifestyle in Rolling Stone magazine; sniffing coke and boasting about it to thousands of impressionable readers.  Big deal, guys, you do blow.  Or maybe it's that annoying song that gets played on about a thousand commercials every day.  Or, more specifically, maybe it's because they ain't that original and never will be.  Cold Hard B#*@%^, indeed.  <br />Learn to play a worthy guitar solo, boys, then come back to the States.

Queens of the Stone Age the Screaming Trees still get minimal radio or television play.In my opinion this is the definative grunge album, as well as one of the best rock albums of the nineties.Just buy it I promise you won't be disapointed
B000069HK2|5.0|This is an excellent CD! Every song is great. I will never get tired of these songs.
B00006X06U|5.0|Genius...absolute genius.<br />That is what I thought the first time I heard this album, and it is what I think as I listen to it right now.  Yes, it isn't the Joni Mitchell of the glory days...it isn't that ethereal, innocent voice that sang to us of being homesick in Europe, and of the destruction of nature for the sake of progress.  It is the voice of a woman who has eaten from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, and has left innocence behind...and as we all get older, we do the same thing...it is called growing up.  <br />In fairness to those who gave this album negative reviews, they did not question the brilliance of Joni Mitchell the lyricist...they have just questioned the platter the songs have been served up on...and the quality of the service...which is petty, really.  Honestly, how can anyone expect a woman in her fifties who has smoked most of her life to sound the same as she did 35 years ago?  <br />I remember hearing &quot;Turbulent Indigo&quot; for the first time...I too felt that I was being robbed of that distinct Joni Mitchell sound...but then I actually LISTENED to the qualities of this new voice and I was as taken with it as with the young singer on &quot;Clouds&quot; and &quot;Blue.&quot;<br />So Joni re-worked her songs and has made them different then the originals...and why shouldn't she?  Her perspective has changed with age, so she has taken the opportunity to be reflective...and who are we to question her wanting to do so?  One reviewer commented that Joni's ego must have grown to the point where she thinks she can walk on water without getting her feet wet, and that this album shows how pompous she is...which causes me to ask: how pompous is the person who thinks that they are more of an authority on the creative path of Joni Mitchell, than Mitchell herself?<br />Yes, it is an album perfect for a rainy Sunday morning...but there is a lot to be said for a great album that brings you relaxation and contentment in a world where things move too fast most of the time.<br />I wish I could have given it another star...not the early one that you can wish upon, and not the Northern one that guides in the sailors.
B000002UAX|5.0|Why is there such animosity between Zeppelin fans and Beatles fans? Just curious. Someone email me at JMcNamara09@aol.com and explain.<br />By the way, great album. Glass Onion, Helter Skelter, Julia, I Will, Dear Prudence, Happiness Is a Warm Gun, While My Guitar, and I'm So Tired are worth the price alone.
B000002G7E|3.0|Is this the &quot;Coolest Album Ever,&quot; as one magazine asserted?  Maybe it is, but that shouldn't have anything to do with the quality of the music herein--we basically get a lot of droning arrangements with mumbly vocals, and cool or not, they are not masterpieces.  I guess if you right an endlessly monotonous, driving-down-the-freeway-at-2-AM dirge and pepper it with lyrics about ding-dongs (&quot;Sister Ray&quot;), you're just a genius!  Anyway, I will concede that it is hard to imagine Sonic Youth or JMC without this cesspool of noise, but I have a difficult time calling &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; the better work than &quot;Psycho Candy&quot; or &quot;Daydream Nation.&quot;  There are just too many gaps here--the slasher solo on &quot;I Heard Her Call My Name&quot; highlights the album's best tune, an engaging, vicious rocker, but the remainder of the material is boring, rather unremarkable rock that fiddles with itself too much and lacks vitality.  I mean, how are the title track and &quot;The Gift&quot; any more &quot;revolutionary&quot; or well-crafted than the music put out by VU's contemporaries or even their disciples?  Find something more interesting than this--however, if you still live in the 1968 &quot;underground&quot; scene and feel a bit bored, maybe this &quot;music&quot; is for you.
055357342X|4.0|I thought that A Storm of Swords was a very interesting and engaging book. I liked the fact that everything didn't always turn out perfect and that bad things can happen to the good characters. Most fantasy novels make their heroes invincible and impossible to kill even though they have many weaknesses. This was a refreshing dose of reality. Not all of the characters were appealling. But i guess that is just another element of this book that makes it more realistic. However, Jon was a very interesting character to read about. He seems very charasmatic, but again he isn't perfect, he's just like everyone else. I found myself pulling for him through the whole book. However, I only gave this book four stars because some of the more grotesque and perverse scenes were focused on in a little too much detail. Please leave a little to the imagination Martin.

On May 5, 2004 at 7:30 CT, this DVD was ranked at #1845. 5 hours later it is ranked #760. Many people will be waiting for this to come out. It sounds like it has lots of enhancments that will be enjoyable. I can't wait to get it. I know many fans of Clay Aiken will buy it if he records the long lost song from the vault-\\"Proud of Your Boy\\".

B0001BKAEY|1.0|The original Matrix (1999) is superb! Had this sequel been released first, I don't think any others in this series would have been made. This sequel was boring, disjointed and lackluster. What a waste of talent, money and (often boring) special effects. Save your money, just rent it if you haven't already seen it. An interesting observation is that the Matrix series is inversely related to the Lord of the Rings series, specifically, The Lord of the Rings gets much better with each sequel while the Matrix degenerated to an abyss of muddled storyline and rehashed special effects. Something to do with karma balancing out? Beats me. Just an observation I made, that's all.
B0000CNY27|5.0|Another Carpenter film gets a deluxe DVD treatment.  This is a very nice set, and far superior to the bare bones DVD released by MGM a while back.<br />The film looks and sounds great.  Dean Cundey's photography is given justice here; the nighttime shooting, the greens and blues, all look much cleaner and clearer than previous releases.  The sound is given nice treatment as well; Escape is one of Carpenter's best scores, more fully realize than previous work, and ahead of its time.  There's a 2.0 mono mix, a 5.0 surround mix, which doesn't provide a big boost, and a commentary track as well.<br />John Carpenter generally gives good commentaries.  Once again he teams up with Kurt Russell to revisit the film, as they did with The Thing.  Carpenter is very frank about his films and often explains how particular shots were done, what locations were used, and what was done to get around the low budget.  Russell sounds like he's having a good time as well; he clearly loves the film and its cult status.  (This is the film that helped him break his Disney type casting mold.)<br />There's a much welcome documentary, return to New York, featuring Carpenter, Russell, producer Debra Hill, Carpenter's ex-wife Adrienne Barbeau, and others.  We also get to finally see the deleted opening of the film.<br />On the whole, this is a very nice DVD set.  There's a slipcase for the digipak, and there's a little Snake Plisskin comic book inside. This is a nice job for a cult classic and highly recommended.  It is way beyond the previous bare-bones DVD that was out.

B00005JMSE|5.0|What can I say?  Ron Perlman is so perfectly cast as the title character in this film that I have to give it 5 stars.  The way he manages to toss off one-liners that could be really corny and make it all seem completely natural and in character is fascinating.  It is also mind-boggling to see how he can emote from under all of that make-up and be menacing, sexy, and goofily romantic all at the same time. And even though the plotting is at times lacking in continuity, it is not too confusing for someone like me who had never even heard of the comic strip it is based on.<br /><br />I liked the other actors, especially John Hurt as the older Prof. Trevor 'Broom' Bruttenholm.  His character's deep affection for the creature he calls 'son' and Hellboy's return of this paternal affection is apparent.  So it's too bad that for reasons of the plot Hurt and Perlman don't spend much time on screen together.  There is also good interaction between Perlman and most of the other cast members.  However, for some reason the interesting character of Abe Sapien is not made enough use of.  Unfortunately, the evil characters are much less developed.  They are the most 'comic-book' of the characters in the movie if you take that term to mean superficial and under-developed.<br /><br />The only real problem I had with the film is the virtual lack of monsters for Hellboy to defeat.  The trailer, which was what attracted me to this film in the first place, made me expect \\"things that go bump in the night\\".  These \\"things\\" essentially end up being only one thing and something that should have been a surprise related to Hellboy's last fight was already given away in the trailer.  Frankly, there are more monsters to be had in the 1984 film \\"Ghostbusters\\" which certain plot elements in Hellboy reminded me of.<br /><br />Despite this quibble with the plot, what makes me love this film is that the character of Hellboy actually has some depth to him that takes him far beyond recent comic-book based films like the 2003 films \\"Hulk\\" and \\"Daredevil\\".  Perlman's Hellboy, similar to Tobey Maguire in the 2002 film \\"Spider-man\\", actually develops and changes.  There is also something in this film, whether deriving from Del Toro's script alone or from Mike Mignola's original \\"Hellboy\\" comic strip as well, that moves beyond the superficial use of relics, Crucifixes, and Holy Water to make a point that to my mind is essential to my understanding of Catholic faith.  It is a person's choices that determine who they become and not who they are born.<br /><br />I ended up leaving the theater being much more impressed with the heart and soul of Ron Perlman's Hellboy than with his huge punch.  I am now planning to read Mignola's original \\"Hellboy\\" comics to get more of an idea of how his creation differs from this film adaptation.  I can't wait for the DVD and hope that any sequels improve the script without, at the same time, taking away the wonderful freshness of Perlman's performance.3 films \\"Hulk\\" and \\"Daredevil\\".

B000089RVX|4.0|In the neverending quest for music worthy of a good listen, I have happened upon Evanescence and I hereby recommend them to you. Beyond melancholy, this band bridges on sheer darkness. However, all is not lost, and beams of light can be seen piercing the shadows. A surprisingly original mixture of strings, piano, tight guitar, crisp, stutter-step drumming, and powerful, richly feminine and haunting vocals of lead singer Amy Lee, Evanescence delivers a forceful and captivating first album. The lyrics, equally dark, convey tried and true hope for redemption and salvation. Note these two selections:<br />Bring Me to Life<br />&quot;how can you see into my eyes like open doors, leading you down into my core, where i've become so numb without a soul. my spirit sleeping somewhere cold, until you find it there and lead it back home<br />wake me up inside, wake me up inside, call my name and save me from the dark, bid my blood to run, before i come undone, save me from the nothing i've become.<br />now that i know what i'm without, you can't just leave me, breathe into me and make me real, bring me back to life . . . etc.&quot;<br />Tourniquet<br />&quot;i tried to kill the pain, but only brought more, i lay dying and i'm pouring crimson regret and betrayal, i'm dying, praying, bleeding, and screaming, am i too lost to be saved, am i too lost?<br />my God my tourniquet, return to me salvation, my God my tourniquet, return to me salvation . . <br />do you remember me, lost for so long? will you be on the other side, or will you forget me . . .&quot;<br />This band, rumored to have exclaimed something akin to &quot;we're not a f***ing Christian band!&quot; was subsequently hacked from the Christian market, for obvious reasons, hehehe. my suspicions, however, still abound. the band's mastermind, Ben Moody, begins his thanks with &quot;Jesus-all the life left in me is you.&quot; Judge for yourselves, get ahold of this record. You can always throw it away if you don't like it. But I think you will. Album title is Fallen.
B0001CCXGG|5.0|Far too many pundits are critical of Yngwie Malmsteen (similar to how most baseball fans hate the Yankees).  I suppose this is the plight of being best of breed.  Some of the comments are actually quite amusing.  Basically, anyone who thinks Yngwie is talentless knows as much about guitars and music as President Bush does about spelling.  Keep the amusing anti-Yngwie banter flowing!  Hopefully it enlightens folks unfamiliar with Yngwie to go and check him out and form their own opinions.  <br />The G3 concert DVD featuring Yngwie Malmsteen is the best of the G3 concerts yet because, well, Yngwie is the best guitarist Joe and Steve have played with so far.  While some critics inapproriately claim that Yngwie is all speed and flamboyant neo-classical riffs, most fail to listen to the entire concert and notice how well Yngwie can blend his style to fit with the other 2 guitarists who are playing with him (or they have never heard Yngwie before during his live concerts where he can shred, then go classical, and wrap it up with some blues).  After playing guitar for 15 years, I can safely say I have finally found a collaborative album featuring what I consider the BEST THREE CONTEMPORARY ROCK GUITARISTS, each bringing to the table something unique.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the G3 concerts with Petrucci and Johnson and even Sheperd, but I never really considered any of them on the same level as Malmsteen, Vai, and Satch.  <br />Let's face it.  None of them can sing mellifluously.  But, going there to hear them sing is like going to a Alyssa Milano modelling show to see the clothing (\\"Wow, did you see that great pair of jeans!\\").  The funny thing is, I bet Joe and Steve would both agree that Yngwie Malmsteen is unquestionably one of the best overall guitarists in the world (which is why they obviously played with him).  Most guitarists are jealous of how genuinely good Yngwie really is.  Ostentatious talent ALWAYS draws criticism...<br />IMHO, the ONLY concert that could top this would feature Steve, Joe, and either Dave Navarro or Tom Morello on guitar, Les Claypool on the bass, and Dave Lombardo on the drums (with Mike Patton singing).  Now THAT would be a lineup!<br />The Boogyman

Another song that I cannot praise enough is &quot;the Acid Queen&quot; which is just pure intensity.  Overall &quot;Tommy's&quot; strength lies in its willingness to break the mold and be different, and the result is an astounding success.
B00005V0X5|4.0|Well, here we go, time to buy another version of a classic album you already own. Don't get me wrong, this album is excellent, and provides a stunning document as to what a band can do when they don't yet see the potential profit to come. But that aside, I noticed some bitching about how the sound quality isn't what was expected. So they took the same master tracks they recorded WAAAAAY back in 1985, mixed them together digitally instead of analogously, pooped it out on a CD that I bet was &quot;digitally mastered&quot;, and here we are. A long time ago (not as far back as 78s), LPs were recorded in one track mono. Along came two track stereo LPs, and record companies started reissuing mono recordings as &quot;stereo&quot;, and would cheese it up by echoing the mono track in the second &quot;stereo&quot; track, to &quot;enhance&quot; the recording. Well, what do you think this is? Record companies reissuing albums on CD, and claiming they sound better when really, all you're hearing is the wider, flatter dynamic range inherent of CDs over their antiquated analogous counterparts. In other words, THIS IS WHAT THE MASTER TAPES SOUND LIKE. You can't change that. You can't make that better. You can't add detail that isn't there. Don't be duped by orwellian terms. Buy it if you don't own it, or you want the bonus tracks, not because you think it's going to sound better than your record or tape, or older CD.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I have always been a Tim Burton fan but i never expected to be so moved by his latest film so much, i had no idea what this movie was about when i bought the dvd, i just knew that it was directed by Tim Burton, to my surprise by the end of the movie i had gone through a full box of tissue, i had not cried during a movie since the Lion King back when i was a child but this movie did the trick, it has since become my favorite Tim Burton movie

0618526412|4.0|The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter is by far her best. The book has a very depressing side to it, many people enjoy reading books that are cushy and have melodramtic endings where the 'goody' defies belief and destroys the 'baddy', but this is great 'real life', easy to relate to stuff.<br />The way in which each character is portrayed is special, you really feel as if you know them. McCullers methods are unlike many others and among the best in the world.<br />The book explores the spiritual side of the more or less 'rejected' beings, which is an instant put off for many. But what world do we live in? Not a perfect one. This book grapples the harshness of social decline, and never ceases to the lure of perfect people or a perfect place. The book is above all a great piece of literature by a 23 year old, which is quite an achievement.<br />If you want a seriously good piece of literature unlike the happy ending mainstream we read all the time, this is the book for you.
0316666343|4.0|A good read. It was written from an unusual perspective. Ever so slightly morbid, but still a good read.

Wu-tang kicks so much ass.
B00005JMEW|5.0|With Quentin Tarantino you cannot tell whether you will like his movies or not care for them. I saw every Quentin picture and I can honestly say that their is a mixed sense for me.<BR>Reservor Dogs was alright, but I didn't particularly care for it, Pulp Fiction was a masterpiece which in my mind is the greatest action movie of all time, Jackie Brown which was a slight letdown from &quot;Pulp&quot;, but satisfying for Quentin fans and a damn good follow-up to the masterpiece, and last Kill Bill Vol.1 &amp; 2, both of which I thought along with my friends and fellow Quentin fans thought was a very good picture. This movie starring Uma Thurman, Michael Madsen, Lucy Liu, Darryl Hannah, Vivica A. Fox, and David Carradine as &quot;Bill&quot;. These two movies balanca out the sets of actors in each of the movie and make for a great movie experience for both fans. The first one, in my and many peoples opinions thought was better. If you like action packed bloody movies rather than explanitory movies you will prefer 1 to 2. In 1 you will get the raw action, while in 2 you get the glimpse of the moments leading up to them.<BR>Some may love this movie, and some may hate this movie, but either way you must respect Quentin Tarantinos vision and bravery in releasing movies that everyone might not like, and shows just who his fans really are.
068483605X|5.0|This book, pages torn and cover long gone, has been the staple of my library for 15 years.  I read it for pleasure long before I was given it to read in school. The story of these simple rabbits tells so much about human society - from our inability to accept what we cannot change, to the basic need of a warm, safe place to call our own.  I cannot recommend this book enough; it does not matter if you are 12 or 32 or 102, this book shows us all how simple life can be, how even our greatest adversaries are not invincible, and how the the faintest of inklings can lead to the greatest wonders of all. Their friendship, love and loyalty endears these rabbits to every reader who follows their adventures, marvels at their simplicity, and falls in love with their story.
B000001ELR|3.0|After the concept album \\"MUSIC FROM THE ELDER\\" which was sort of a failure , Kiss were in need of redemption. Peter Criss (drums) was already out of the band and Ace Frehley (lead guitar) who was totally against the idea of recording the previous theme album seemed just sick and tired of it all. Frehley's face is shown on the cover to \\"CREATURES OF THE NIGHT\\" (1982) but he didn't actually play on the album - the lead guitar was handled by Vinnie Vincent who later became an official member and Frehley's replacement.<br />The album starts with the rocking \\"Creatures of the night\\" which is the best song in this collection. It shows that the band (i.e Simmons &amp; Stanley) realized the importance of regaining the early hard rock approach in order to please the fans and secure record sales. The song titles on \\"CREATURES OF THE NIGHT\\" can also be seen as some kind of proof of a calculated strategy towards displaying Kiss as a true rocking and rebellious band - \\"War machine\\", \\"Killer\\", \\"Danger\\", and \\"Rock and roll hell\\" are all chosen titles to present Kiss in a certain way. There's no doubt that \\"CREATURES OF THE NIGHT\\" isn't as good as most of the band's albums from the 1970's but that doesn't mean that this album is bad, weak or lousy because there are in fact good moments. And this album is a lot better than both \\"LICK IT UP\\" (1983) and \\"ANIMALIZE\\" (1984).
0767827791|5.0|In a decade of conformity and great prosperity William Inge and Tennessee Williams tackled subjects ahead of their time. Of course they in some cases had to veil the subject matter but that lead to some wonderful revelations in writing and reading between the lines. In this DVD from Colombia of Inge's Pulitzer Prize winning `Picnic' we have one of the best films of this genre of sexual repression, animal heat, and desperation in small town America.<br />  Most reviewers of this film might begin with the leads but I must start of with the wonderful Verna Felton as Helen Potts the sweet old lady who is caretaker of her aged mother and lives next door to the Owens family.  This gifted and now forgotten character actress sets the tone of the picture as she welcomes drifter Hal Carter (William Holden) into her house. At the end of the film she glows in tender counterpoint to the dramatic ending. She is the only person who understands Hal, even more than Madge (Kim Novak). Her speech about having a man in the house is pure joy to watch.  It is a small but important performance that frames the entire story with warmth and understanding.<br />  Betty Field turns in a sterling performance as Flo Owens, Mother of Madge and Millie. She is disapproving of Millie's rebellious teen and smothering of her Kansas hothouse rose Madge. A single Mom trying in desperation to keep Madge from making the same mistakes she did. She becomes so wrapped up in Madge's potential for marriage to the richest boy in town she completely ignores the budding greatness that is bursting to get out in her real treasure. Millie.<br />  Susan Strasberg creates in her Millie a sweet comic oddball. She is the youngest daughter who awkwardly moves through the landscape nearly un-noticed, reading the scandalous \\"Ballad of the Sad Caf&eacute;\\" being the only one who is different and can't hide it. Her yearning to get out of the smallness of small town life is colored with the skill of a young actress with greatness her.<br />  Rosalind Russell nearly steals the show as the fourth woman in the Owens household boarder, Rosemary, a frantic, hopeless and clutching spinster. In the capable hands of Miss Russell we have a real powerhouse of a performance. She imbues Rosemary with all the uptight disapproval of a woman who knows that her time has past and there are very few options left. She is electric in her need for love. Every nuance of her emotions is sublime in her presentation. Just watch her hands alone.<br />  Floating above all of this is Madge Owens, the kind of girl who is too pretty to be real. The kind of girl who in a small town like this is not understood to have any real feelings or thoughts other than those that revolve around being beautiful and empty.  Enter Kim Novak, who is just such a girl. Who could ever expect such a beauty to be anything more than just pretty? But Miss Novak, a vastly underrated actress in her day paints a knowing and glowing portrait of Madge. Her explosion of sexual heat upon meeting Hal for the first time is internal and barely perceptible until she looks at him from behind the safety of the screen door the end of their first scene.  That screen door is a firewall protecting her from the flames. She fights in the early part of the film to keep her sexual desire for Hal in check. That night she loses her fight at the picnic and we watch as she opens to reveal a woman of feelings and dreams so much deeper than the prettiness of her eyes or the luminosity of her skin. This is one of Kim Novak's early great roles and one she fills out with lush and deep emotion.<br />  The lives of all of these women of Nickerson Kansas are changed one Labor Day when Hal comes steaming into town.  William Holden gives a raw and wounded portrayal to Hal, a man at the edge of his youth and on the verge of becoming a lost man.  He lives as he always has, on the fading glow of his golden boy charm and his muscular magnetism.  Holden was 35 when he made Picnic, a real golden boy at the edge of his youth. He was perfect for the part. Some reviewers say he was too old to play Hal, but I disagree. Without being thirty-five in real life as well as in the story Rosemary's \\"Crummy Apollo\\" speech would not be so effective or devastating. Hal is a man who never bothered to grow up, a man who never let anyone get too close for fear they might see through is bravado and discover his fears of feeling something, anything before it's too late.<br />  Holden also brings a sexual heat to the film that is eons beyond the time it was filmed. He is presented almost like a slab of meat. He struts around in a pre-Stonewall dream of sexy hotness. Not only the girls in town notice him but a few boys too. (There are several layers to Nick Adams paperboy if one bothers to look.)  When finally Holden sparks with Novak they blow the lid off of the uptight code bound studio-strangled world of Hollywood in the Fifties.<br />  The film is photographed magnificently in lush color and cinemascope by famed cinematographer James Wong Howe. The famous score by George Durning is classic not only for the famous reworking of the old standard \\"Moonglow\\" but for his virtuosity in dramatic power.  This is a giant of a score from the silver age of film music.  The direction by Josh Logan is perfect in every way and stands among the best of his work.l golden boy at the edge of his youth.

B000001ELP|3.0|Producer Bob Ezrin (who also produced the excellent \\"DESTROYER\\" in 1976) came up with an idea of a concept album. While Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons loved the idea, Ace Frehley really hated it. After the flirt with disco on both \\"DYNASTY\\" and \\"UNMASKED\\", Frehley wanted to return to hard rock but could not stand up against Stanley and Simmons. With growing tension in the band, Frehley refused to leave New York in order to record \\"MUSIC FROM THE ELDER\\". Tapes were sent between Ezrin's studio and Frehley's studio and according to Simmons, they eventually hired other guitar players to finish the album (as they had done several times in the past and also would do for the follow up \\"CREATURES OF THE NIGHT\\" on which Frehley doesn't play at all).<br />When the album was released in 1981, the main reaction was very negative, but with hint sight it's obvious that \\"MUSIC FROM THE ELDER\\" is much better than its reputation. Some songs are actually very good, and there's a lot of variety since both rocking numbers like \\"I\\" and \\"The oath\\" as well as slower ones like the beautiful \\"A world without heroes\\" are present. My suggestion is that you stay open minded and decide for yourself if this album is good or bad.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|This disc is worth it for the remastering job alone.  From a strictly musical standpoint, all you need to do is buy &quot;Destruction&quot; &amp; the two &quot;Illusion&quot; albums to cover all the bases.  However, the sound here is just soooo good, any G'N'R fan just has to add this to their cart now.  Anytime you can crank up Slash, Izzy  &amp; the boys  louder and clearer, it's pretty much a no brainer.  Plus the price is pretty reasonable.
B00000AF98|4.0|In 1978, I discovered Kiss and I was really hooked. They were mystical and cool in the eyes of a young boy, and they actually had great songs too. So it really hurts to see how bad they have taken care of the band. When Peter Criss, and later Ace Frehley left Kiss it sure was a tough blow even though Gene Simmons try to deny the impact from both Criss and Frehley. \\"CREATURES OF THE NIGHT\\" (1982) was alright but \\"LICK IT UP\\" (1983) and \\"ANIMALIZE\\" (1984) were rather lame. With \\"ASYLUM\\" (1985), Kiss got a bit better, but they were still very far from former heights.<br />\\"CRAZY NIGHTS\\" (1987) is really a good album. Most of the songs are very appealing even though it's harmless pop metal most of the time. \\"I'll fight hell to hold you\\", \\"My way\\", \\"Good girl gone bad\\", and \\"Hell or high water\\" are all strong tunes, and there are in fact no real low marks on this album. Gene Simmons seem more focused than in a long time, and Paul Stanley have finally gone for a less strained singing style. I would say that \\"CRAZY NIGHTS\\" is the best effort since the classic years.<br />Since the musical climate, what's a fashionable and up to date change all the time, one must put every single album in its context. By 1987's standard this is a very good effort.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|_Big Fish_ has a lot to offer: humor, romance, whimsy, drama... something for everyone.  The movie itself is like looking into a story book, or a mythology text.  The stories are so fascinating, so unbelievable that the viewer is immediately sucked in.<br />Tim Burton did a superb job directing the film, creating a nostalgic, almost other-wordly look at the life story of Edward Bloom.  The acting was spectacular as well.  Ewan McGregor captured the young charasmatic Edward, and Albert Finney (although he spends the majority of time in a hospital bed) portrayed a very convincing older Edward.  Billy Crudup gave a good performance as Will, Edward's son.  Unfortunately Jessica Lange, a wonderful actress, was relegated to a small role in the film, and did not get as much face time as she deserved.  Her younger self, played by Alison Lohman, received more screen time, and she proved herself to be a strong young actor with a bright future.  Another note on the casting: there were many notable smaller roles played by well-known actors.  Steve Buscemi, Danny DeVito, and Helena Bonham Carter added great depth in their small, yet very important roles.<br />The beauty of _Big Fish_ is how it portrays love and family relationships.  Edward Bloom lays dying, while Will and his wife are preparing to become parents themselves.  The movie is beautiful, poignant, and heart-warming.
B000001EUN|4.0|\\"ANIMAL MAGNETISM\\" from 1980 is one of Scorpions better albums. It continues where the previous \\"LOVE DRIVE\\" left off, and this time the band managed to do the best of the material they got. On this album you'll find some of Scorpions strongest tunes like the groovy \\"Only a man\\", the furious \\"Don't make no promises\\", the catchy \\"Make it real\\", and the heavy \\"The zoo\\". Maybe Scorpions developed into a pop metal band along the way (at least according to some people) but that is not the case when it comes to \\"ANIMAL MAGNETISM\\". And this album is certainly not a sell out, but a very fine link in the chain towards the excellent \\"BLACKOUT\\" and \\"LOVE AT FIRST STING\\". Turn it up and enjoy!
0316548189|4.0|After reading LONG WALK TO FREEDOM, I came away with a sense of awe for a man who spent 27 years in prison but never gave up the hope for his freedom and the freedom of his country.<BR>  <BR> Communicating was key to keeping the &quot;freedom fighters&quot; on the outside informed and encouraged.  One way this was done was to write in tiny, coded script on toilet paper.  The paper was so small and easily hidden that this became a popular way of smuggling out messages.  When the authorities discovered a number of these communications, they took the extraordinary measure of rationing toilet paper.  After awhile, only eight squares of toilet paper were given to each prisoner each day.<br />To live under such conditions where you can be so isolated from the world (For 27 years), that you contemplate conversing with a cockroach, is a test of the human spirit.  To sacrifice  the obligations of family so that a nation of people can breath in freedom is nothing short of courageous with a fiercely determined spirit. Here is what Nelson Mandela writes about in his struggle for family and nation:<br />I did not in the beginning choose to place my people above my family, but in attempting to serve my people, I found I was prevented from fulfilling my obligations as a son, a brother, a father, and a husband.<br />In that way, my commitment to my people, to the millions of South Africans I would never know or meet, was at the expense of the people I knew best and loved most.  It was as simple and yet as incomprehensible as the moment a small child asks her father, &quot;Why can you not be with us?&quot;  And the father must utter the terrible words:  &quot;There are other children like you, a great many of them.....&quot; and then one's voice trails off.<br />Nelson Mandela is a man that has a spirit and determination that is above and beyond most people or leaders today.  READ THE BOOK!!  It will open your eyes and in the end, it'll make you feel good about the human spirit.
B00000AF95|2.0|Although Kiss had a new guitar player (Mark St. John), they continued in the same musical vein as the previous and weak \\"LICK IT UP\\". With the help from hit maker Desmond Child, Kiss managed to get a major hit with \\"Heaven's on fire\\" - a song that stands for everything connected to MTV-metal. The material on \\"ANIMALIZE\\" (1984) range from very lame to decent, with the exception of \\"I've had enough\\" and \\"Thrills in the night\\" which are the only good songs here. Gene Simmons had got really rich by the time of this release and it doesn't take a genius to notice how little effort he put in - the songs written by Simmons are just plain weak. There are a lot of songs that should not have made it to the final album but since Kiss chose to include the awful \\"Burn bitch burn\\", \\"Get all you can take\\", and \\"Murder in high heels\\" it's clear that they had no self respect left at all.<br />It's just too bad that Kiss lost it all along the way, and if you compare the albums recorded by the original line up (including Ace Frehley and Peter Criss) to those from the 1980's you'll discover how much they differ in regards of quality and creativity. In the mid 1980's, Kiss were really living on borrowed time, and loyal (deaf?) fans was the only thing that kept them alive. Get this album if you want a complete Kiss album collection, otherwise you will do just fine without it. **
B000002J09|3.0|First of all, the production is shoddy at best, on the acoustic songs such as The Battle of Evermore and Hotel California the guitar is so damn loud that i can barely make out robert plant's banshee vocals, which is rare. On Rock N Roll, a potentially good song, the sound is incredibly muddled. The drums off When The Levee Breaks sound like they were recorded in a garage.<BR>  Production aside, there are some good songs, and some that are just boring. Black Dog is a song that grows on me, except i think the solo sucks. The Battle of Evermore is well written tale about The Lord of The Rings. Stairway to Heaven is majestic masterpiece, but you probably already know that. Misty Mountain Top is forgettable as well as Four Sticks, Going to California is a nice tune and When The Levee Breaks is a dull plodding adventure through mediocre musicianship.<BR>   All in all, decent, worth a listen, for educational value at the least.
0060930187|5.0|The Bell Jar is definitely a book that I could read more than once. It's an intriguing tale of a young college-aged woman dealing with suicidal insanity and attempting to cope with society. The way Sylvia Plath tells the forlorn story of Esther Greenwood in the first person makes you enter the psychotic world of the book and makes you feel as if its your story that you're reading. She places you inside Esther's mind and you feel like you are actually there experiencing all of her incidents with Buddy Willard (her should-be lover), all of her blind dates, and all of her unbelievable loneliness that leads her to be suicidal. This book is said to be based on Sylvia Plath's own life just before she committed suicide, so that could explain the incredible vividness of depression and desolation throughout the book. <br />The story begins with Esther in New York City working for a magazine as a summer job. She gets to know a few of her female co-workers but never truly fits in with them. She attends many banquets and parties for the magazine and has a few adventures of her own, but all this time, she refuses to let herself give in to the artificial feminine stereotype that all of the women around her fulfill. Esther begins to take notice of all of her faults and the faults of the people surrounding her. As the novel progresses, Esther's mind seems to grow more and more incoherent and she seems to be disconnected from the world.<br />Once her summer job is over, she moves in with her mother in a suburban Boston town. For the first few days, she relaxes and observes the neighborhood from a house window while pondering about what she will do with the rest of her summer. She quickly gets bored with that and attempts to write a book but her mind just keeps getting more and more fragmented to the point where she cant sleep, read, write, or eat. This goes on for a whole week before her mother realizes what is happening to her daughter and forces her to see a psychologist. This leads Esther into intensive shock therapy and more thoughts of suicide. It is then that she realizes that she's been viewing life from a different perspective, as if surrounded by an opaque encasement... like a bell jar surrounding her.<br />I could without a doubt relate to this book in so many ways. I shared an abundant amount of the same opinions about society as Esther did and could relate to some of the incidents. I'm pretty sure that everyone could relate to what Esther is feeling at some point in their lives.<br />From her excursions in New York City to her terrifying shock therapy, Sylvia Plath will most definitely keep you interested in Esther's life until the very end and will leave you craving more. I recommend this book for everyone who enjoys reading about the twists and turns of the human mind.
B00003CXTG|1.0|...movies out there about Pearl Harbor.  If you are interested in the events surrounding Pearl Harbor, pick up a copy of Tora! Tora! Tora!.  If you are interested in a love story set during Pearl Harbor, pick up From Here to Eternity.  If you are interested in World War II, pick up anything else (even U-571).<br />I think this movie would have been much better if it were set in a sci fi setting with a space port named Pearl Harbor that is attacked by aliens.  For all pratical purposes, the Japanese in this movie might as well have been aliens.  You don't get any background story to their goals other than they are going to split up the love triangle.  Speaking of which, could we have gotten a more predictable finish to that story?  No.<br />One more note, why did it have to end with the Doolittle Raid?  And for that matter, why did our intrepid heroes have to fly it?  They had a hard enough time training B-25 pilots to do it.  I can't imagine that they would use pilots who never flew bombers to do it.  Ah well.
B00005QGAX|4.0|Of Michael's first 4 albums at epic (Off The Wall, Thriller, Bad, Dangerous), Bad is probably the weakest.  There's no denying that it is still a fantastic album.  What is interesting to note is the quality of the omitted songs &quot;Streetwalker&quot; and &quot;Fly Away&quot;.  The album would have been much better if these two songs had made the cut rather than the corny &quot;Just Good Friends&quot; (Nothing against Stevie Wonder but the song just sounds silly) and &quot;Speed Demon&quot; (ok so the chorus is cool but as a whole the song sounds too wierd).  &quot;Fly Away&quot; would have made a perfect closing track, because IMO &quot;leave me alone&quot; is such a good song it leaves you craving for more and always leaves me dissatisfied at the end of the album. &quot;Bad&quot; is very good.
B0000E64TR|5.0|Made even more awesome with 5.1 sound and in SACD.  From the opening track to Harmony, this is on the list of my favorite albums.  Funeral For A Friend sounds cool as the winds circle around the room.  The warmth of the piano and stuff comes out perfectly in SACD.<br />As much as I hate the idea of replacing my music collection with ANOTHER format, I love SACD.  The sound is so real that it sounds like the musicians are in my living room.  I really hope that Sony doesn't screw this one up because I want to see Floyd and the Beatles come out.
0066620996|5.0|This is a very insight, readable book.  The author and his research team starts with two very basic questions.  1) Are there companies which were merely average for a long time, but then turn themselves around and become great companies with a sustainable track records?  2) And if so, what key factors do these companies have?     The research team worked through several decades of stock market data and find eleven companies which for more than 15 years have close to average returns, but then the companies change to have way above average returns for a long period of time.     The main focus of the book is what do these eleven companies have that other companies don't have.  The research team took a very scientifc attitude of what does the data say, instead of trying to force various theories to fit the data.  They come up with seven key factors.  The meat of the book is the seven chapters covering each of these key factors.       The author does a very good job of explaining the seven key factors, how they work, and why they work.  The book is a fairly quick read and is packed with a ton of good ideas.       All of the principles mentioned were explored in terms of how they helped businesses do better.  Many of these principles can also be applied to individuals: develope integrity, figure out your hedgehog concept, be disciplined, and just keep on plodding.     If you are interested in business, this is a good book to read.
B000060P79|1.0|No originality. No talent. Poorly crafted songs. If you are above the age of 13 and/or have actual knowledge of REAL music, I highly recommend you overlook this album. The sad thing is that these talentless posers fly the punk rock flag, doing nothing but tarnishing the hard-earned reputations of such great bands as the Descendents and the Dead Kennedys. If you buy this album and think you're punk rock, you either need a dictionary or a smack in the face. It's bands like these that make me thank God I am not into the radio-friendly garbage most record labels are throwing in our faces these days.

6305313687|5.0|Family relationships represent some of the most important relationships one creates in a lifetime.  These connections shape personalities, thoughts, and actions.  American History X depicts the life of one family involved with racism and how Derek's (Edward Norton) actions affect Danny's (Edward Furlong) life.  Although American History X examines other issues such as racism and hate crimes, the movie clearly intends to show the importance of sibling relationships.<BR> The prevalence of racism within the movie leads some critics to think that the theme somehow ties to racism.  Richard Corliss, a movie reviewer for Time, draws the conclusion that, \\"you've got to be taught to hate.  Derek's father makes racist remarks, so the liberal minded lad turns into a Neo-Nazi; then Derek sees his beliefs are wrong, so skinhead Danny does too\\" (100).  Certainly both Derek and Danny had some influence from their father (William Russ) regarding their racist feelings.  However, their mother (Beverly D'Angelo) remained neutral about her feelings toward races throughout the movie, and their sister (Jennifer Lien) clearly did not condone her brother's thoughts and actions.  Also, Mr. Sweeney (Avery Brooks) endlessly tried to make the brothers change their ways.  If one can learn to hate, why can one not also learn to accept?    <BR> The entire movie depicts how Derek's life affected Danny's.  The fact that Derek greatly affected Danny's life is not so farfetched.  According to Erica Goode and Betsy Wagner, authors of the article, \\"The Secret World of Siblings\\" claim that, \\"Sibling relationships shape how people feel about themselves, how they understand and feel about others, even how much they achieve\\" (44).  Derek's only worry after leaving prison is how to get Danny away from this hate filled life.  Although he never got Danny away, he did succeed in changing Danny's views towards racism.  When the audience can determine that Derek helped to turn Danny racist and then can turn around and also say Derek helped Danny stop his racist ways, the movie really shows the strong bond between two brothers.  <BR>Another reason why the importance of sibling relationships represents the theme of American History X refers to the fact that we see most of the movie from Danny's standpoint.  Edward Norton was quoted in the Detroit Free Press as saying, \\"The flashbacks are quite clearly viewed through his little brother's eyes, and he has idealized him\\" (Lawson).  If Tony Kaye, director, had made this movie any different way, perhaps the fact that Derek helped to change Danny would not stand out as much.  But because the flashbacks take place in Danny's memory, the audience can see how much Derek means to him.  <BR> One film reviewer, James Berardinelli, states, \\"American History X is in no way a comprehensive look at racism, hatred, or inner city violence.  Instead it examines the various ways these elements tear at the fabric of a family\\" (Berardinelli).  Berardinelli is right.  If screen writer David McKenna wanted to make a movie on racism, why would he incorporate a family?  The inclusion of a family plays an emotional angle.  When viewers finish watching this movie, they have sympathy for the family that lost a son.  They do not feel animosity towards Derek.  Derek tried to do everything possible to remove Danny from the environment.  If this movie meant to discuss racism, including the brother relationship and its impacts would be unnecessary.  <br />Director Tony Kaye makes picking out the theme of the movie difficult for the audience.  The overwhelming amount of hate and violence displayed within the movie begins to overshadow the importance of Danny and Derek's relationship.  However, as reported on the Hollywood Jesus website, screenwriter David McKenna said the following when speaking about the inspiration behind the script, \\"While American History X was made with a no-holds-barred look at the very real underbelly of racism, this is not a film about skinheads or white power. This is a searing contemporary tragedy that grips one working-class family\\" (Bruce).  This movie clearly intends to reveal the strength of a relationship between two brothers.  <BR>American History X takes a broad look at the issues surrounding a family stuck in the middle of racist thoughts.  The final presentation of the movie forces the audience to take a deeper look into Danny and Derek's relationship.  As long as Derek plays the hero type in the end, the audience forgets the racism aspect of the film.  American History X simply uses the aspect of racism in order to explore the bigger issue, the importance of sibling relationships.  <BR> <BR>Works Cited<BR>Berardinelli, James.

B00005JLKB|5.0|As far as most tv shows go, this one has been a great hit for the WB from the beginning. Like many other viewers, i was hooked since the pilot and sure can't wait to find out more about Clark's still developing character. There are many faults with teh show however, as this season is very repetive. Heres why. Each episode, except for the first and last have a villain who is affected by the kryptonite. If you are a viewer who can watch a show and not be bothered by the fact that a guy stung by an &quot;infected&quot; swarm of bugs turns into a bug himself and a guy sitting in a sauna with kryptified steam turns into a pyromaniac, then this is the show for you. Im a guy who has no problem with that or the fact that 20 something actors are actually trying to portray 14 and 15 year old kids. Thats right, Clark and his friends are freshmen and high school, yet with all the other stuff that goes on in the episodes, you'll forget about that pretty quickly. If you're a girl, then you're gonna like the show for tom welling and all the times he appears as the knight in shining armor. For guys, there's krisin kreuk and her pool scene and of course there's clark kickin some major tail. Its really easy to be pulled in and for a show like this i say why not. It does have something for everybody, but if youre out of the 13-30 demographic, you might want to pass. The real draw of this episode for me was Clark finding himself and his powers. Every couple of episodes or so, Clark finds that he has x-ray vision or is immune to bullets. The season finale and an earlier episode lead us on to his flight abilities. For guys, this will probably be a good present for your girl, but for girls, make sure you know ure man before you give him this teen drama. If he read comic books as a kid, he'll probably like it though. And for parents... well it'd be a great gift for your kid who's still tryin to figure out who they are. Another words, its closer to 24 than seventh heaven, but its got some major similarities to both. This show has charm and wit, and the Man himself, and if you're not gonna be that geek who's always whispering in the back of a movie theater about how tie fighters shouldnt be able to go faster than x-wings or some crap like that then you should give this a try. Worst case, you dont like it and you give it to someone who definitely will.

0312954468|5.0|\\"River god\\" is one of those books that you will remember long after finishing it. It is set during the beginning of the Second Intermediate Period of Ancient Egypt, when the Hyksos dominated the region for some centuries. The plot of the book is the struggle of the Upper Egypt Dinasty against the usurper of the Lower Egypt, and then against the foreign invaders, all seen through the actions and thoughts of the members of the ruling clan.<br />The main character is Taita, an eunuch slave to the important family of the Pharaos' dinasty. I've read and heard some people complain about Taita's cleverness, wisdom and resourcefulness. I don't think so. I like to think of Taita as the Leonardo da Vinci of his age. From time to time such people are born, illuminating their epochs, and legating their achievements to humanity. Taita is obviously a fictional character, but he could have existed. Taita is a good friend, teacher, physician, general, and he knows it. And yet, the reader can't help but liking him, even admirign him, and wonder wht he'll accomplish next.<br />Wilbur Smith's book may not be the most historically accurate, but this time I didn't care. Aside from Taita, his other characters (the Queen Lostris, the Prince Memnon, Tanus, among others), the descriptions of the Nile and its surroundings, and the incredible fast pace of the book, all of that added to make this reading a great pleasure. It is, in fact, better than its sequel, \\"The seventh scroll\\".<br />Grade 8.9/10
630027120X|1.0|The Mission<br />The Mission directed by Roland Joffe is the story of the struggle between theocracy and theodicy.  Ironically the church has the mission to bring theodicy to the world and it does this through the message of God's Love and Forgiveness.  It tries to accomplish this through the sending out of missionaries, in this case the Jesuit priests, to tell the story and bring others to the knowledge of God's Love and Forgiveness.   Tragically politics and greed for power in the hierarchy of the church (in this case the Roman Catholic Church) brings about a situation where the people of God are killed supposedly in the name of God.   This story opens and ends with Cardinal Altamirano (Ray McAnally) dictating a letter to the Pope informing him of the events that had transpired after giving church missions in South America over to the Spaniards and Portuguese.    The nature of the setting is beautiful.  Views of the waterfalls are breath-taking and spectacular.   <br />The message of theodicy is played out in the story involving two main characters Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons) and Rodrigo Mendoza (Robert De Niro).   Father Gabriel brings theocracy to the Natives of South America.   At the beginning of our story Rodrigo is a slave trader who undergoes a traumatic conversion experience and serves those whom he had sold into slavery before.   His story of transformation is one of heartache, murder, repentance and extreme penance which he imposes upon himself.   It is the forgiveness and acceptance of those who he former hunted that sets him feel to serve both God and the Natives.  Another film that shows a similar vein of acceptance after tragedy is the classic movie Hawaii (1966) based on James Michener. Rev. Hale accepts the Native Hawaiians as he begins to mellow in the aftermath of his losses.   In Rodrigo's case is his acceptance by the tribe that helps them to fight against the imposed theocracy of the Cardinal later on.   <br />At issue here, in spite of thebeautifully portrayal of conversion to Christianity of the Native people of South America, is the imposed will of governing forces of politics around greed ownership of land.  Yet this was done under the auspices of the Church as God's Will, which is called theocracy.   The people of the land had no say, they were the conquered, to be exploited and were considered as chattel, for them there was not theodicy.   Their willingness to share and work for the common good of all, even though a principle of Christianity was considered a threat to the economy of others with political clout.   Because they would not give up that which they had worked for, they were condemned to death.    When Cardinal Atlamirno orders them to leave the Mission; they wanted to know why?  His answer was that they had to submit to the will of God.  Their answer was had God changed his mind?   They were doing what they had been taught was God's will for them.  Theodicy was not served as there was no justification in this case.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|This is an ensemble film with romance, comedy, and loose ends. I'll start off with the negatives.  There are simply too many stories going on at once to make a complete film.  There were plenty of moments when I was wondering what happened next in another sub-plot, side-story, whatever.  Also, there were a few scenes where I was shaking my head.  Then I realized that this is a movie, so I let it slide.  One such moment comes when a 10-year-old boy is running through the airport looking for his one true love, and he is being chased by at least 4 security guards.  At one point the guards are apparently running at top speed (a mere 4mph--excuse me, this is England--try 10kph) with the child blazing ahead of them at a jog.  I know, I know, it's a movie!  But scenes like that that made the film falter.  As for the positives, and there are a lot here, the ensemble acting is refreshing and very well done.  Two performances stood out for me.  Emma Thompson, as usual, is excellent, showing once more her wide range of emotions and able to spin around and change direction on a dime(okay, a schilling).  The other great performance here comes from Laura Linney, and her situation is truly heartbreaking.  She finds love, but circumstances and timing just don't allow the great possibilities to unfold.  I wanted to give her a hug.  There are many other, fairly believable scenarios between other characters, some of which take a turn toward Hollywood sensationalism.  But overall, the emotions, and the universal need to be loved is present in nearly every frame of this film.  As for that aspect, this film is remarkable.  There are many humorous situations, a few emotionally difficult character moments, but the end result is one of hope.  As I said before, there are simply too many plots going on for a complete film to be possible, leaving many frayed and/or loose ends like, &quot;What ever happened to that character?&quot;  But that alone should be dully noted.  Why would I have caredabout those characters if they hadn't been rendered so convincingly?  There are some over-the-top Hollywood moments, but they are forgivable because the heart of this film is in the right place.  Thank you.
0618526412|4.0|I like to discover gifted authors who challenge me with their work to see interesting characters and things I might not encounter in my day-to-day life. As a city person, I enjoyed learning about her setting and people. This is not a happy story, but what's great about Carson McCullers is how she portrays those who are considered low or worthless and makes us feel compassion and understanding for them. I think there's a lot of Mick in all of us , and a need to escape from our own social isolation, into a world of inner spiritual fulfillment, whether it's some hobby or interest or something else. Another great novel about social isolation and finding escape and relief in depravity is the now-forgotten but intriguing &quot;Bedeviled&quot; by Thomas Cullinan, or the odd and shocking but incredibly gripping debut &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot; by another rather very young author David Rehak. I highly recommend it!!!
B000002KO3|5.0|polyrhythm(n): the simultaneous combination of contrasting rhythms in a musical composition<br />polyrhythmic(adj): 1: having many rhythms  2: having two or more rhythms proceeding simultaneously in different musical parts<br />Keep those definitions in mind when listening to this masterpiece from one of the most interesting bands I have ever had the pleasure of hearing.  From the galloping multi-rhythmic opening song, &quot;Born Under Punches(The Heat Goes On),&quot; it becomes glaringly obvious that this is very original music.  After pushing the Polyrhythmic Threshold with their previous albums, with varied success, Talking Heads shatter all their previous efforts with this epic and wholly amazing album.  Along with their concert DVD, &quot;Stop Making Sense,&quot; owning this album is absolutely essential to reach a full appreciation of this remarkable band.  Both are exceptional experiences.  My favorites from this CD are the faster tracks but the last two songs close the album with a somber, ethereal tone.  The song &quot;Listening Wind&quot; is haunting, while &quot;The Overload&quot; is like walking around in a daze amid the ruins of some cataclysmic event.  For the beginning fan I would suggest buying the DVD &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot; first, but soon after you should purchase this excellent album in a state of euphoria.  I wish more bands would embrace polyrhythms and incorporate them in their songwriting.  The songs on this album are crammed with them.  Thank you.
0743243307|3.0|I really looked forward to reading this book, having read so much about it. It is also a subject close to my heart, because I am a Bengali woman who doesn't live in her homeland. It began promisingly enough,(but what on earth was that about the rice stalks as tall as skyscrapers?)but doesn't keep it up. Most reviewers have complained about Hasina's letters to her sister. My understanding of them at the start, having tried to translate them back into Bengali, was that they were a literal, word for word translation from Bengali. They don't continue that way, but I think this is what the author intended.<BR>The characters could have been fleshed out so much better. They felt cold and one-dimensional. I felt more of a connection with Zadie Smith's Samad and Alsana than with Nazneen. Chanu comes across a pompous, sorry figure...I know many men who are like Chanu, but they are usually less benign than he; men who know everything are usually more aggressive- it doesn't fit. Nazneen is not really shown growing as a person; all at once, she seems to acquire the courage to speak her mind. The ending-this is England, you can do anything- is reminiscent of Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni and Bharati Mukherjee,; that the West equals freedom. and it is impossible to be free in the Third World. Of course, she reminds us that women in Bangladesh get acid thrown on their faces; this is horrifying and has  been going on for several years, though many of her readers will have heard of it for the first time.So, you are meant to think, isn't Nazneen lucky, that she escaped that? Ali also misses the fact that immigrant communities are usually steeped in the values of their homeland at the time they left, so that Bangladeshis in London might be more conservative than those in Dhaka or Mymensingh.<BR>For Westerners, maybe this book is a bit of exotica, but I don't see what the fuss is about. It's not a bad book, but I doubt I'll remember it in 5 years time.
B0000AZAUQ|4.0|That's how you'll feel when you crank up the bass on this SACD.  This is a hybrid disc, so you can play it on regular CD players as well, but to get the full audio range you'll need a SACD player.  I'll say it again - SACD and DSD remind me of playing a brand new audiophile vinyl record - there's just something else there that CD can't provide, and SACD blows the doors off of DVD-A.  So even if you don't have a SACD player, buy this copy now and hang on to it until you do get one.  You can't go wrong with a disc that has &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; and &quot;Fashion,&quot; and the incredible guitar work of Robert Fripp.

0689835604|5.0|This book was pivotal in my daughter's new-found passion for books.  It has taught her to lift flaps and turn pages at her own pace, rather than simply when me, the reader decides. That was when she was 6 months old. Now we go at her chosen pace (sometimes fast and furious - barely reading the words or seeing the images, and sometimes slow and methodical - studying each picture). She is in charge of turning all pages in all books we read together and understands natural pauses in my reading as cues to \\"Turn the page\\" and \\"The End\\".  Recommend this for any parent ready to make books and reading an integral part of playtime and together-time.
0553573403|5.0|I am a huge fan of epic fantasy, but sometimes find myself wondering why so many authors make their stories so predictable. I was pleasantly surprised by a &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, since not only Martin's writing style is superior to most, the characters are complex and engaging, there is political intrigue, alliances and treason, but also because the author surprises the reader several times throughout the novel. There are plenty of twists and turns that add a great deal to the interest of the book, and the reader is kept on his toes by the death of characters that in other series would &quot;never die&quot;.<br />There is a considerable portion of the book in which the fantastic elements are very limited, with the story introducing more and more of these as it progresses. The &quot;world&quot; in which the epic unravels is composed by the Seven Kingdoms, protected on the north by The Wall, which is defended by the Night Watch to prevent &quot;mysterious creatures&quot; from invading. Winter is coming, and this is the time in which the Night Watch should be more alert. The length of the winter varies and is said to be proportional to that of the summer that preceded it; so this one is expected to be a very long one.<br />This first book focuses on two families, the Starks and the Lannisters. The former rule Winterfell, which is located in the North, and the later are related to King Robert through the marriage of their sister to the monarch. Eddard Stark is selected as Hand of the King by his friend Robert and has to go to court, leaving Winterfell under the control and supervision of his wife, Catelyn, and his eldest son, Robb. Eddard has two other sons; one of these is named Bran, who loves to climb and suffers an &quot;accident&quot; shortly before his father leaves. He also has two daughters, who are going to the court with him, and an illegitimate son, Jon, who has decided to join the Night Watch. The Lannisters are known for being conniving and for addressing their favors to whoever suits their purposes best. We are also introduced to the Tangaryen, which was the reigning house until King Robert won the throne. Viserys and his sister Daenerys, a maid of thirteen years, dream of recovering their previous grandeur and recover their throne.<br />George R. R.

B00003CWL6|5.0|Writer, Alan Ball's (of Six Feet Under fame) first theatrical script blurs those stereotypical slow death in suburbia lines and keeps the viewer off balance throughout the entirety of the film.<br />This film, is, above all, a deeply moving drama. The suburbanite, highly dysfunctional, Burnham Family is sad, enchanting, sickening, wonderful, confusing, tragic, abhorrent, and every other adjective listed in Websters.  That is precisely what makes this film a true \\"one-of-a-kind\\".<br />Mr. Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey)is daily pitted against his icy, cheating, manic, depressed, totally materialistic realtor of a psudo-wife, Carolyn (Annette Beining) and his quite sullen, self-absorbed, ambivolent, teenaged daughter, Jane (Thora Birch).<br />However, into Lester & Jane's lives come two very achingly beautiful & wonderful human beings. Jane's fellow cheerleader confidant Angela Hayes-note the Nabokov/Lolita reference in the last name-(Mena Suvari) who has a penchant for older men and a huge crush on Jane's daddy, jolts Lester into a sexual epiphany that makes Lester's life worth living again. He daily fantasizes about the young, sexy Angela. She makes him feel like a bumbling, pimplefaced teenager on his first date and all of these meetings between the two really blooms into kind of a second adolescence for the harried Lester. An eerily calm, young next door neighbor, Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) and his lifelong Marine Corps father, Col. Frank Fitts, USMC (Chris Cooper) add much drama.<br />The whole cast turns out top-notch performances and the score, cinematography & direction are utterly \\"dreamlike\\".<br />Highly recommended!<br />Happy Watching!
B00001ZULV|4.0|When Peter Gabriel left Genesis in the 1975 and Phil Collins taked a leader's place the band lost something its speciality and creativity. Soon Genesis came a popular pop band that sold millions copies. In my opinion, Original Genesis is must better than Pop Genesis. This collection gives surely almost the best possible picture about Genesis's hits. Yes, you can find &quot;Mama&quot;, &quot;Land of Confusion&quot; and &quot;Follow Me, Follow You&quot;.<br />There are also two songs for Gabriel's era: I Know What I Like( In your Wardrope) and Carpet Crawlers which it's a good time.<br /> If you like easy listening and hit oriented Genesis then this collection is made for you. Collins is a amazing drummer and a good singer. Also other members make their parts well. There are some bad tracks such a I Can't Dance and  That's All but mostly this collection sounds very good.
B0001FR3IQ|1.0|This movie shamefully wastes its talented cast and production crew with an all-too-predictable storyline full of unsympathetic characters at a &quot;mental institution&quot; that looks more like the set for a StarTrek movie. Properly directed and edited, this flick could have been scary and fun, as the ghost premise is not a bad idea.  Unfortunately, all of the jarring moments are telegraphed way in advance so there's nothing to be scared of, and the basic premise collapses under the wimpy, convoluted, subplots meant to &quot;distract&quot; you.   In sum, this flick suffers from a host of dull-as-dirt subplots, poor characterization, and a waste of STELLAR special effects.  Even the supremely talented Halle Berry couldn't save this one.  It's a total bomb.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|This is one of those once-in-a-lifetime TV events; a perfect marriage between brilliant writing and brilliant acting that produces the most wonderful, warm, brilliant show on television.  If I knew where Star's Hollow was, I'd move there.  I think a lot of us would.  (Yes, I know it's not real, but you'll be echoing the sentiment in no time.)<br />It's a treat to watch the pristine DVD transfers, without commercials (and with the parts that got chopped off for commercial space in reruns).  If you only buy one TV DVD this year, buy this one.  You won't just have found a DVD.  You'll have found a whole new wonderful world.

B00005JMEW|3.0|Quentin Tarantino had already mastered the art of directing by &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and in &quot;Kill Bill&quot; he continues his normal stride of shots and scene-crafting that seems to emanate from a natural talent and cool confidence of someone who was born to do what he does.<br />First the good news; &quot;Kill Bill&quot; is a good movie, highly watchable, enjoyable, and is thoroughly &quot;Tarantinian&quot; in style and mojo.  With Tarantino it's always the little highlights that get all the attention (such as when a character is knocked over, and the sound of bowling pins being knocked down is edited into the track).  <br />Also with Tarantino is the evanescence of geekiness.  There have been works written about the homages to Japanimation or &quot;Anime&quot; films that Tarantino seems to cherish, such as &quot;the sound of the sword slash was borrowed from such-and-such film,&quot; and &quot;the style of attack used by &quot;The Bride&quot; is reminiscent of such-and-such&quot; and on and on.  I'm not interested by anime, nor does Tarantino's fascination with it excite me.  It's merely there, and I accept it.<br />The bad news: the film is horrifically violent.  Blood is everywhere, people with limbs chopped off writhe on the ground in pain, children are present at the murder of their parents.  This is a cruel movie made by a film geek who views film as a vessel for flight from a certain &quot;decency.&quot;  While I am against censorship in any form, I am for good taste (such concepts get confused these days).  I don't think Tarantino exercises good taste with some of his decisions, especially utilizing the style of anime, which is an inherently violent genre.  For example, part of the film is actually anime, and yet there is no separation of reality from the footage of real actors and the footage of cartoons.  Blood spurts from wounds like an opened firehose in both cases, which is neither in good taste, nor is it appealing.  There is no significance to such mass quantities of blood or suffering, it's merely an allusion to anime.<br />All that gore is really in place to glorify cruelty, and the use of an assassin as the main plot-mover is evidence of this.  More evidence is the list she keeps of all the people who have wronged her, and she crosses them off one-by-one as she eliminates them.  Basically, there is no other recourse in this reality except complete retribution, therefore no mercy or compassion.  The movie is about cruelty, and it paints cruelty in an extremely shining light.<br />After a while, the blood and suffering because boring, and you wish that Thurman's character would simply Kill Bill and have it done with.<br />The idea of not revealing Thurman's character's name (simply referring to her as &quot;The Bride&quot;) is not a new idea in film, nor is it really necessary here.  Tarantino has no intention about making a point of namelessness in the realm of assassination, and &quot;Fight Club&quot; is the only movie that comes to mind that has pulled off the nameless-character bit with success.  Reason: I don't care if I know The Bride's name or not.<br />I'm sure opinions will change once I see &quot;Kill Bill 2,&quot; but I'm only anticipating more violence, more amplified gore, and more of Tarantino's anime-flavored dialogue which is so out of his realm that the usual giddiness of hearing the F-word thrown out in rapid-fire succession doesn't crop up.
B000002ITM|3.0|The Ritual is an album which although is good in both musical quality as well as excellent songwriting lacked one very important thing that defines them as being thrash metal. Where the hell is double bass drumming and that famous fast kick drum snare beat I had come to love over the years. It almost seems like they were attempting to write their Black Album or something. A decent effort but if you love thrash as much as i do you would be better off picking up The New Order or Low.
B00005JKZV|5.0|I loved the Battle of Helm's Deep. When Legolas and Gimli arrive at Helms Deep, they discover they are desperately short of manpower, and when Aragorn arrives and tells of the thousands coming to defeat them, all but these three are filled with despair. Then help comes, from an unexpected source. Now, with slightly more manpower, Helm's Deep awaits attack. The orcs come, and take their places. Aragorn gives the word, and the army releases their arrows. <br />So the battle begins. On the good side, many people, dwarfs, and elves are killed, and on the evil side, many orcs are killed. Men are shown falling off Helm's Deep's monstrous wall to the ferocious orcs below, while orcs are shown being cut apart by the swords of the warriors on the good side. In the end of the battle, when Helm's Deep's defending army finds itself outnumbered, Gandalf comes with another army, and the orcs are destroyed.<br />Another fascinating part of this movie is the battle between the talking trees and Saruman's army. A talking tree is taking Merry and Pippin back to the Shire. One of them suggests that they take a longer route to get there. While on this route, this tree sees the destruction that befell many of his kind. He howls in rage, and also to get the other talking trees to join him. Together, these trees throw enormous boulders at a dam holding water back from flooding the grounds where orcs were produced, and at the orcs themselves. While some of the trees are set on fire, the orcs succumb to the power of the trees.<br />For battle excitement without gore, don't miss this movie!
0385486804|3.0|Chris McCandless lead a life that most of us would like, but are afraid to do it. I liked Krakauer's writing. However, one chapter moved me and the next one I totally disliked. I didn't like when he talked about other adventurers and when he talked about his adventures. That kept the story from moving forward. When I got to those parts, I just put the book down. He should have kept the story moving, instead of wanting us to pat him on the back for his dangerous adventures.
B000059PR5|5.0|I rememeber this movie like it was yesterday, and it still effects me to this day.  I remember the scene were Jason Robards is in themiddle of the highway and or street.  THe family that was locked in the house etc.  I compare that movie to all thereafter and none have come close to what in my opinion is the truth; but I think from the looks of the day after tomarrow, it may just be the one!
B000021YQV|3.0|I totally understand if you think this band sucks.  Toxicity is probably better than the first album.  Nothing special really.  You get Prison Song, Chop Suey!, Shimmy, Toxicity, Aerials, and thats pretty much everthing that stands out since some of these were videos.  I might, in the end, sell the first and second album cause I'll get bored of it eventually.
B0001LQJQM|3.0|This film is based upon Michael Crichton's marvelous best selling book of the same name. When I first heard that a film was in the making, I was really looking forward to viewing it, as I absolutely loved the book. That it was in the theatres for just about the blink of an eye, however, gave me the idea something might be wrong with it. Having viewed it, I now fully understand why its sojourn in theatres was relatively brief.<br />Unfortunately, the film bears little resemblance to the author's finely crafted time travel tale. Jeff Maguire, having written a screenplay that seeks the lowest common denominator, just about destroys the author's work, reducing it to an almost incomprehensible piece of drivel. The screenplay takes a five star book and turns into a film that barely rates three stars.<br />Here, a young group of archaeologists and historians are excavating the ruins of a fourteenth century feudal town in France, which excavation is funded by  the International Technology Corp (ITC), a well-heeled, corporate giant. Some of the archeological finds are puzzling, as they seem to be anomalous to the time period. Moreover, the leader of the archaeological dig, Professor Johnson (Billy Connelly), has  suddenly headed back to the states to ITC headquarters, and they are unable to get in touch with him. They are then all summoned to ITC headquarters by Robert Doniger (David Thewlis), the head of  ITC.<br />At ITC, they are told that the Professor has been transported by ITC back to fourteenth century France through a worm hole that ITC has inadvertently discovered. Unfortunately, the professor has not returned, and ITC wishes to send them back in time through the wormhole to help with the rescue of the Professor. It appears that their help is needed in order to navigate the intricacies of medieval life. One of them, Chris (Paul Walker), is the Professor's own son, so he needs no urging, Besides, he  has a crush on one of his colleagues, Kate (Frances O'Connor), who is also ready to roll. Another,  Andre Marek (Gerard Butler), is a romantic in love with a bygone time, and he. too, has no problem in going through the wormhole and landing in fourteenth century France.<br />You know the screenplay is bad, however, when Francois, the only one who is reluctant to go through the wormhole, is told that he is needed because he is the only one who speaks French, as if the French spoken today were the same as that spoken in  fourteenth century medieval France! This would have been a line better left unsaid, as we all know that the French and English spoken today bear little resemblance to that spoken in early medieval times. It is a piece of information about which viewers always automatically suspend belief.<br />Garbed in clothing that is constructed to resemble that which the people of the fourteenth century would wear and carrying  time travel markers that will enable them to return home, they go through the wormhole.  When our intrepid time travelers, led by ITC security chief Frank Gordon (Neal McDonough), arrive in fourteenth Century France, they are immediately set upon by a marauding bunch of armored English knights, wherein their ranks are immediately thinned. They proceed into the town, where their ranks are further thinned. There, they find the Professor, when they are auspiciously imprisoned with him. Kate, who has excellent climbing ability, manages to help them all escape. They then split up, with Marek, incurable romantic that he is, forging on in his own way to help the Lady Clare (Anna Friel), a French noble woman whose fate spurs Marek on to acts of great chivalry.<br />They are all brought together for the historic battle between the English and the French over control of the town. There, the English are led by the ruthless and evil Lord Oliver (Michael Sheen), aided by a rogue knight named De Kere (Marton Csokas), who is really none other than a transplanted ITC employee. Marek finds himself fighting against the English in order to save the Lady Clare and makes a split second decision that will forever change his life.<br />The production values in the film are excellent and the direction is fine, as it is directed by none other than Richard Donner (The Omen, Lethal Weapon, Superman). The battle over the town provides some terrific action scenes. The actors themselves are also fine. They all do their best with the little with which they have to work. In the leading man category, however, Paul Walker is bested by Gerard Butler who is engaging as the romantic hero, Andre Marek. In the leading lady category, Anna Friel shines as Lady Clare, besting Frances O'Connor. The problem is that their is little chemistry between Paul Walker and Frances O'Connor. There is, however, chemistry between Gerard Butler and Anna Friel.  Unfortunately, they are all done in by the simply dreadful screenplay for which Jeff Maguire should be flogged.<br />If one rabidly enjoys medieval festivals and/or time travel stories, or if one loved the book upon which this film is based, then one will garner a modicum of enjoyment out of this film. If not, deduct one star from my rating. In any case, all who are inclined to see this film should rent, rather than buy, it.lish in order to save the Lady Clare and makes a split second decision that will forever change his life.<br />The production values in the film are excellent and the direction is fine, as it is directed by none other than Richard Donner (The Omen, Lethal Weapon, Superman).

B000007T1M|3.0|System of a Down is defintely not a GREAT band and is obviously over-rated.  The best song on the album is &quot;Sugar&quot; and the rest is O.K. material, nother super special.  I totally understand if people hate this music and think it sucks.
0671015206|3.0|It's an interesting read and a good way to get a kick in the butt to be a better investor and budgeter.  But in the end, I can't believe that the statistical information and the theories the authors were expounding could coincide.  Nonetheless, it's fun to mull over.
B000002ULO|4.0|Fresh off his work on the Beatles' \\"Anthology\\" albums, which reminded him of the creative standards set by his legendary old band, Paul McCartney recorded 1997's \\"Flaming Pie,\\" filled with new inspiration & vigor, and came up with one of his best solo albums in years (although Paul would do even better with 2001's magnificent \\"Driving Rain\\"). It's just tremendous fun hearing Paul get back in touch with his creative genius once more, since his most recent albums up to this point, though not without their share of good songs, had been a little TOO soft & fluffy overall. Not so with \\"Flaming Pie\\". Standouts include the excellent pop-rock of \\"The World Tonight,\\" \\"Young Boy,\\" the title song, \\"Used To Be Bad,\\" and \\"Beautiful Tonight,\\" as well as lovely songs like \\"Somedays,\\" \\"Calico Skies,\\" \\"Little Willow,\\" \\"Great Day,\\" and the gorgeous beauty that is \\"Heaven On A Sunday,\\" arguably the best song on the album, and featuring an amazing electric guitar solo by Paul's son, James, who was just 19 at the time. Paul's work throughout is quite wonderful, and there's excellent contributions thoughout by Steve Miller, Jeff Lynne, Paul's Beatle pal Ringo Starr, and the lovely Linda McCartney. While \\"Flaming Pie\\" doesn't represent Paul McCartney's *greatest* solo material---hence my 4-star rating instead of a perfect 5---this is undeniably a wonderful album, and a definitive step in the right direction for Sir Paul. \\"Flaming Pie\\" is mighty tasty.
B0001HAISG|5.0|This is the best showing of Peter Pan I have ever seen. It's a feast for the eyes and imagination. The story, special effects and music compilation captivates both young and old. A classic story told as never been told before. A must have for your movie collection!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|As of this writing, there's nearly 200 reviews of this DVD, and the number of reviews with less than 5 stars can be counted on one hand. That pretty much says it all. This DVD is brilliant.
B000002N3J|4.0|Considering Madonna was the &quot;diva&quot; during the pop music era in the '80s, she has proven herself well. This album is definitely a &quot;taker&quot;. I would recommend it to anyone.
B000006OAM|5.0|I have to say this cd is not for casual listening. That is to say, you can't put it on and appreciate it while you're driving or cleaning the house. It's also not for the casual Natalie Merchant fan. It takes time to absorb this cd as a whole and listen to the beautiful lyrics and music. How deceving to release &quot;Kind and Generous&quot; as the first single. It's light, peppy melody and &quot;la la la&quot; chorus are the only light hearted moments on the cd. &quot;My Skin&quot; tells the tale of an insecure woman with some disease. Cancer? What a wonderful perfomance on this song. Wonderful melody, piano playing and vocals. &quot;Life is Sweet&quot; was the follow up single, but not as successful as the first one. It basically contains a keep your chin up message. &quot;When they Ring Them Golden Bells&quot; is a traditional folk song that gets a beautiful treatment, and wouldn't sound out of place on her more recent cd of folk music. Check this cd out after &quot;Tigerlily&quot; and &quot;Motherland&quot;. Then promptly get every one of 10.000 Maniacs cd's.
B00005JKEC|4.0|I'm having a very hard time deciding how to rate this film, but the four-star treatment is the result of balancing its high and low points.  For instance, the overall tone of the film, with its immense amounts of violence and foul language, and completely oppressive sense of hopelessness, is not exactly my idea of a pleasurable motion picture experience.  Still, considering the subject matter, it is appropriate and the filmmakers bring it across quite well.<br />The subject matter is the world of vice cops, and if this tale is to be believed, they're all corrupt.  In fact, not only the vice cops but the heads of several major departments within the LAPD are all lost souls without redeeming graces.  This is a world where evil battles evil, and the prizes are convictions in court and large amounts of cash.  The only real law, however, is the law of the jungle.  This is unrealistic to the point of losing its cred, and is overdone.<br />Denzel Washington earned his Oscar for Best Actor in portraying plainclothes narcotics officer Alonzo Harris, who has the task of training young Jake (Ethan Hawke) in the ways of the trade.  Washington does an incredible job of keeping us all guessing as to Alonzo's true nature, as he neatly justifies all of his disgusting and irredeemable actions on the streets, and Jake (and we) continually have to wonder whether to go along with Alonzo or just give up and hate the man.  By the time Alonzo's corruption is fully revealed, Jake, the only character in the entire film with a sense of hope, has had his hope dashed as well as us.<br />All this is beautifully done.  Unlike at least one other reviewer here, I had no problem with the pacing, the dialogue, etc., but found the craft of filmmaking quite well done in most respects.  The major shortcoming for me, other than the overall filth of it all, was a couple of acting performances that really messed things up.<br />One of these is a child actor, a kid who plays Alonzo's son.  This tyke is detached from his world to a completely unbelievable degree, reacting to everyone and everything with absolute boredom, even an extended shootout in his own apartment.  Honestly, the director could have propped up a cardboard cutout of a child and gotten as much out of it.  Even worse is Snoop Dogg, who couldn't lose himself in a character if you drugged, blindfolded, and handcuffed him and parachuted him into the role.  Oh wait, no need to drug this overrated goof.<br />Ultimately this is well worth four stars for its effectiveness and for the performance of Washington, a favorite of mine who is brilliant beyond words in this role.  Still, the tone and content made me feel as if I'd been bathed in a barrel of filthy oil.  I had to take a shower.<br />I will never forget this film, but I never want to see it again.
B000002I97|5.0|My great musical regret is that I somehow missed this album growing up in the 1970s. It might have changed my life. Prine can be witty, moving, or irreverent, and never patronizing. Some of the most intelligent music I've ever heard, and his understated delivery will have you tapping your toes. A true gem and original.
B000002H38|5.0|This was the first of the cassettes that I bought of Anita Baker.<BR>(I call her Lady B, because the title Lady is a royal title.)She<BR>puts her heart in all of her songs and adds her personal touch<BR>with her octaves. Her videos give her songs an added flair that<BR>makes her my favorite R&amp;B singer. Sweet Love stands out in this <BR>album.
1592400876|3.0|This was just ok...parts of it was amusing, others I couldn't relate too.
0060934913|3.0|I just finished this book and really couldn't put it down, but at the same time I thought the author came off as really pompous: 'I've had the most interesting life and I just feel like talking about myself.' <BR>I've worked in restaurants before and to tell you the truth, I really wasn't all that shocked by the behavior of his degenerate kitchen staff. Guess what? Kitchens all over the world are plagued by these oddball screw-ups, so tell me something I don't know! And it was rather annoying how the author kept throwing out names all over the place. I got the feeling he was trying to make me feel inadequate because I have never heard of some of the famous chefs he refered to. Well, mission accomplished. I wonder who this book is directed at? It obviously is an ode to the restaurant industry. But I think people who haven't worked in the industry will no doubt pick it up and be lost at sea. <BR>At times I could not ignore the Lou Reed-ishness of this guy: A bad, don't-mess-with-me attitude but at the same time he's hoping people will read his book and propel him to greatness... but it was well-written and interesting, just like any Lou Reed song. <BR>A pet peeve: Pay a good editor to weed some of your commas out; there are only so many of them in the earth's atmosphere.
0316666343|4.0|I was left speechless by this book.  I am not giving it 5 stars, I rarely do, but this book brought to me that wonderful, gentle, loving sadness that would have made me cry, was I the crying type.  Read it.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|I do not profess to know what the intended message of this film was meant to be, nor do I care.  I will tell you what the film illustrated for me- the feeling of being alone, despite (or perhaps because of) the nearby maddening crowd.  And it is a funny film; not stupid slapstick comedy, but genuinely funny in a realistic way. Several scenes left me smiling about them for days.<br />Some viewers seem to have been surprised by the quality of Bill Murray's performance here.  While I do agree he was very convincing, I was not particularly surprised.  His character in this film actually seems to me as being similar to many of his other on-screen characters, only much more melancholy.  I attribute this to his maturing age, and maturing talent.<br />And I will go ahead and heap on some more praise for Scarlett Johansson.  She has a low-key way about her, which I think is rare for such a young actress.  This kind of quiet dignity lends more credibility to her performances.  That said, her physical resemblance to Jodie Sweetin is striking.  When I first saw Ms. Johansson in The Horse Whisperer, I could have sworn it was Stephanie Tanner from Full House.<br />Given the opportunity, I would happily watch this film again.  For me, that is the mark of quality and creativity.  I rarely watch any movie a second time.
B000002INJ|5.0|No, no, no, little man. This one is not for you. You had best leave right now.<br />I know you, little man. You're little, and in your smallness you know only fear. When something BIG comes along, something epic, something heroic, something so monumental it can scarcely be believed, it doesn't even register on your little brain, little man. You're like an ant crawling on a side of a great pyramid. It's beyond your comprehension.  Your little ears might hear the sounds of this album, little man, but they don't hear the music. You have never known the feeling of utter fearlessness, of living with a wide open heart, that it takes to hear the music. So this kind of power,  majesty, and glory are beyond you. What you'll do is what all little men do when they encounter these things. You'll call it \\"cheesy\\" or \\"over the top\\" and cover up your fear and your lack of understanding with laughter. That will make you feel better, little man, but you're not fooling me. You're whistling past the graveyard. More than anything, this album reminds you of how small you are. That's why you hate it, little man.<br />Go back to the kinds of records other nonentities just like you listen to, little man. I don't know what they are. Nirvana or the Beatles or Bob Dylan or U2 or whatever other garbage it is the kinds of burnouts and dropouts who end up becoming record reviewers relate to these days. The names change as the years pass, but they're all the same.<br />Maybe, just maybe, you're getting tired of being a little man. Getting tired of letting other people tell you what kind of music you should listen to, what you should think, what you should feel. Maybe someday you'll realize that this is more than just the best rock record ever made, if for no other reason that, unlike the kinds of \\"classics\\" made by bands like I just mentioned, this album is about something higher than just taking dope or taking some effeminate little political position or whining about nothing or just babbling onwith a bunch of nonsense -- you know, all the kinds of things little men do. No, this album is bigger than all of that and bigger than all those. This album is Wagnerian, Nietszchean, superhuman. This album is a gift from above. This album is what I would show to god himself, if he were to descend from heaven to judge all mankind for its weakness, its foolishness, its iniquities, in order to justify the existence of the human race. Not the statues of Michelangelo. Not the sonnets of Shakespeare. Not even Beethoven's Fifth. Kings of Metal, by Manowar. For where others are weak, Manowar is strong, and in thier strength they are LARGE. So large, in fact, that maybe it takes a god to hear them. Perhaps they frighten even god -- just like they frighten you, little man, for this record is large enough to let god know that real men walk this earth, men who would not back down from a fight even if it was with god himself. <br />No, little man, no. Not for you. Stand down. As for the kings among you, stand up. Your hour has arrived. You cannot judge this album. It will judge you. Face your fear, face yourself, and look upon this record. If you are large enough, you will hear the music of the spheres, and see the face of god. And just perhaps you will then even know his fear, the fear of men who walk like gods.
B0001HAISG|2.0|Because of some enthusiastic reviews, I decided to give this a try-what a mistake!  This is definitely a &quot;kids&quot; movie and not a &quot;family&quot; movie.  Much too frightening and violent for young children-would probably appeal best to older children and younger teenagers.  As an adult, this did not hold my interest.  I found the pace unbalanced, the special effects unimpressive, and the content very lacking. Much prefer the televised version which aired in the 60's!
B00003CXTG|1.0|First off let me say that if Kate Beckinsale's character was a plain woman do you really think that those two guys would still fall in love with her?, hmmm I wonder! I have yet to see a movie of this caliber have a story like that {that would be absolutely sweet}. Also this film is an insult to the actual events that took place on that terrible day, not only to the dead but also the survivors of the actual Pearl Harbour tragedy. But likewise as a fictional film goes this is a demeaning and shallow, utterly stupid film that should not have been made. Avoid it please at all costs.
B000001EAQ|1.0|U2 tried a new direction with POP, and it failed.  I am very strong U2 fan, and this is by far the worst album they ever recorded.  Past experiments by U2 have mostly suceeded, such as Achtung Baby and Zooropa.  But I have listened to POP several times, and it still just doesn't sink in.  No matter how many times I give it a try, it always comes up empty.  Save your money and concentrate on Boy, War, Unforgettable Fire, Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby.  POP is a very forgettable recording.
B000127LW2|3.0|Voyager is without a doubt, one of the best.  The show's got a great mix and an excellent cast.  I saw this DVD collection, however, at a local video store and was less than impressed.  I definately would not pay 130$ for this DVD set, - you don't even get the consolation prize of a nice box and pamphlet to make the money worth it. Paramount should really be ashamed at the poor job they suffered upon the fans of Star Trek. <BR> I started shopping around and found to my surprise, that the German release of Voyager is about 110$ (95) and a much better buy.  Firstly, the German edition comes with 6, not 5 discs, which include 2 Original Series episodes (&quot;Arena&quot; ST:TOS Ep.19, and &quot;The City On The Edge Of Forever&quot; ST:TOS Ep. 28), the first released ever on DVD.  This, as far as I know, is not included in the US release.  The box and packaging is also 1000% nicer, resembling that of the Next Generation Box Sets. This set also includes a much larger language selection, English, German, Italian, Spanish and French being all in Dolby 5.1.<BR>So I give the US Release three stars and two thumbs down. The stars are for the content. The German Paramount's release gets five stars however. If you have a region free DVD player, or watch your DVDs on your computer, then you might want to consider going to amazon.de to buy your STar Trek Voyager Box Set.  The extra postage is well worth the money...and in the long run, its not that much cheaper.
B00004SA86|5.0|I disagree forcefully with the reviewer who wrings his hands over the domestic DG release of Sinopoli vs. Kubelik. There is, simply put, enough complexity and depth in Mahler to admit more than one interpretation, and Kubelik occupies a different range of spectra from Sinopoli, a varied plenitude of voicings and hidden architectures. Guiseppe Sinopoli accomplished more in half a life than most mortals could achieve in three; it seems more like a neophyte listener reading early scathing reviews of G.S. and making up his mind, rather than basing a judgement on real authority. <br />Kubelik paints large canvases with a broad brush, like Mahler, and those comparative few who record the full cycle have in common an epic sensibility and a Proustian attention span. Blessed as he is with a sense of the orchestra's organic unity, Kubelik strives for a condition of tension and release in constant equipoise with one another. Sensitivity, passion, psychological breadth and depth all emerge from these recordings, done slightly after Bernstein's landmark cycle (which may account for the more recent Sinopoli box's domestic release). <br />Mahler, much like Shostakovich, aspires \\"somewhere beyond music,\\" as Zander would say so eloquently; he invites an obsessive, almost hermeneutic scrutiny, and the more one probes, the more one is rewarded. The sprightly pacing of Symphony No. 6; the emphatic tempo changes realized in No. 5; and the briskness we find in \\"Titan\\" make for an intense journey. Kubelik and the Symphonieorchester Des Bayerishe Rundfunk belong in the first rank of Mahlerian interpreters.<br />My advice is to buy both DG sets. Get the Bernstein too, while you're at it.

B0001HLVSC|1.0|peter weir continues after all these years to make bad movies---this one is more hollywood than most of his other mishaps-its not believable despite the other reviews here-- the first half almost sinks under the weight of garbled dialogue----- its all salty aND BRINY and british-- AND OVERWRITTEN---  the action is all close ups of wood being exploded --- u dont have any feelings for these sailors ---one actor astands out-- the lad who assists the doctor and captain and gets to see his other young friend die in battle----there are a few moments that are compelling- but not that compelling to make the voyage worth while---the suicide---- almost poignant but not quite- because of the general failure of the movie to put us convincingly where the action is- its all pretense and with no real plot----it adds up to much ado about very little-- in other better seafaring movies like the old moby dick-- or captains courageous----you are there on board ship having these great adventures ! !!!!here its all second hand--and you are always conscious yer watching something that was badly edited & unconvicingly shot-- this movie joins the ranks of the rest of the garbage that won awards last year-- the crappy mystic river- the unbearable sophomoric and moronic sophia coppalla nonsense - that hobbit idiocy -the oppressive and the depressing sand and fog --all just more smoke and mirrors !!!!! dont waste yer time matey !!!!!
B00006FDCJ|1.0|I have no idea what the big deal with this movie is. I was told by a couple of people that it was one of the greatest movies they have ever seen. Well apparently they haven't seen too many. It was aweful. And just so you don't think I have horrible taste in movies. Here are some of the movies that I think are REALLY great: Once Upon A Time In America, Saving Private Ryan, The Shawshank Redemption, Good Fellas, Enemy At The Gates, and Life Is Beautiful. Save your money!!
B00005JMEW|5.0|There's been a lot of subtlety and art drained out of recent action movies-- there's nothing but shock value and explosions and terrible dialogue and plot holes.<br />this movie will renew your faith in moviemaking. it tries new things and every shot is packed with intensity and subtelty. you will cheer for the mysterious main character and sit on the edge of your seat as a complete and intreguing story unfolds. the characters are round and nothing is sacrificed to produce this homage to what every action and kung fu flick wanted to be. there's no way to describe that tingly feeling you will have after the movie, even between every elegant shot and striking line passed between characters with deliberation and poignancy.<br />if you get this move, make sure you see the second volume in theaters right now. it was originally made as one movie but cut in half. trust me, if you see the first one you won't be able to help yourself; you'll be sucked too far into this modern gilgamesh.
0385510438|4.0|I liked the way the story moved,describing the life of a young man and his rise up from a college frat boy to an owner of a small town Missippi newspaper. I liked the way he developed a relationship with the townspeople who were much different than himself. The way he was openminded and grew to love his way of life and the people who made it up. The story flowed with a slow rhythmic beat and sort of felt like a lush breeze blowing over your skin. I don't think there was much of a plot, just a slice of life story that reflected a happiness that comes from openmindedness and fearless nature when we come upon differences in culture, race, social class, etc. It kind of reminds me of how a river meanders and lazily slugs onward. Thats kind of the pace of the story. Which worked for me!<br />Lisa Nary
B0001GOH6Q|1.0|who goes to this guys movies and enjoys them !??? this patently freaky director keeps making creepy weird movies that are overwrought inscrutible boring tasteless concoctions that only a mother could love-- and i bet she doesnt like them either ! who cares about these weirdos who have little in common with humankind at all-- actors of fine stature are wasted and or humiliated by the sheer inanity of his scripts-- original well done special effects as usual abound--- but who cares !!!!! i couldnt even make it thru this one without dozing off- albert finney -- a brilliant actor -is wasted here and his face is all puffy& he looks like the hunchback of notre dame----casting another brilliant actor  jessica lange as his wife---for some reason is not believable at all-- i guess his movies make money----but hes just too weird for his own good----the world is weird enough--- we need more from art these daze !!!!! big fish indeed !!!! big bull is more like it ! keeep yer fish tales to yerself dude !!!!! giving two hours or more of my life to yer decrepit imagination is a sacrilige !
076790592X|5.0|Morrie said, &quot;the most important thing in life is to learn how to give out love and to let it come in.&quot;   The book is full of these kinds of sayings.  They are wonderful.  I wish I would have written them all down.  What a simple but powerful book!   I have thought about interviewing my parents, brothers and sisters because of the inspiration this book provides.  I did get my Grandmother Jane on videotape before she died.  The tape is quite a treasure.  This book is a wealth of information about human love and compassion. <br />People of all ages should read this.  I can't wait for Mitch's next book, because I know it will be straight from the heart. :)<br />Jeffrey McAndrew<BR>author of &quot;Our Brown-Eyed Boy&quot;
B000001FMX|5.0|Having just re-listened to this album a few days ago, the same recurring thought hit me every time the record ends: why can't they make 'em like this anymore?<br />From beginning to end, this is uber-classic rock'n'roll at its finest, and what's still amazing is that over 30 years later, it's still as vital and fresh as ever.<br />From the gutter-punk raunch of &quot;Trash&quot;, &quot;Personality Crisis&quot;, and &quot;Looking For A Kiss&quot;, the album subtle melds Chuck Berry to Iggy &amp; The Stooges, but injects more than its fair share of original licks that have yet to be topped even to this very day.  &quot;Lonely Planet Boy&quot; is the doo-wop classic that never was, and &quot;Pills&quot; sounds just as potent unplugged as it does here in this steamrolling version.<br />My personal favourite has to be &quot;Subway Train&quot;, which crystalizes the ethos of the Dolls in under 4 1/2 minutes.  The follow-up &quot;Too Much Too Soon&quot; is equally good, but less rife with classics.  Get 'em both anyway.
B0001Z37HM|4.0|When I first viewed this video (I won't admit how old I was) it took a long time to realize Arnold was Kalidor and not Conan.  Perhaps because his other movies were a long way off from from a Barbarian film or I wanted it to be a sequel.  Either way, I enjoyed this film.  <BR>Now I don't review films, however after reading some of the other reviews I had to defend Arnold.  Maybe people need to be reminded that, although this movie is being released on DVD it still is a 1985 released video.  The special effects were nowhere near what they are now.  I'm not a history buff as I'm sure most people aren't.  The exact clothing worn in an era or weapons used aren't as important as the entertainment being provided (unless they try shooting each other with rifles).  I am less harsh on actors/actresses making debuts.  I've never done it, but it can't be easy.  As far as I'm concerned this is a good movie and I will buy it on DVD when it becomes available (anyone want to buy my video version?)
B00005JMJ4|3.0|Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) are two lonely people stuck in the same Tokyo hotel. Harris is working on a whiskey commercial, seemingly estranged from his wife in the States. Charlotte's photographer husband leaves her alone while out doing photo shoots. Eventually the two meet and slowly become friends. There's not a great deal of dialogue, but what is said is true and from the heart. This is definitely not a `plot-driven' story. The visuals are interesting, but not unique and filmed nearly like a travelogue. There could have been more attention given to the editing, which at times seems choppy and inappropriately mixed. However, the sound is crisp and cleverly portrays the modern soul of Tokyo. This is an experience that needs to be taken in slowly to appreciate the moods and emotions that are almost too subtle. It is not a far stretch to imagine that Director Sofia Coppola probably took most of these dialogues form her own conversations with her father Francis. The relationship between Bob and Charlotte is part soul mate and part paternal. There is no sexual tension between the two and that makes this film separate from most Hollywood fare. Some of the episodes with Bob and the Japanese people were on the edge of condescension, with more than enough confusion on how the Japanese cannot speak proper English. It was overly used and an inappropriate motif. However, that's not enough to override the atmosphere of the film. As a complete experience, \\"Lost In Translation\\" works, if only for it's consistency.
0312335164|5.0|Ignore the tech industry folks (he didn't write it as a technical manual for you!).  This is a work of F_I_C_T_I_O_N.  Look it up.  <br />As a work of fiction it is pretty good, and it was his first book (yes, his first.  It came before Angels and Demons.  It is not meant to be an attempt to 'cash in' on the popularity of 'DaVinci Code' as one reviewer stated).<br />The book works very well for a thriller.  If you are a tech industry person, perhaps you should give it a miss, as others seem to think the reseach doesn't live up to reality.  But, in order to make a convincing thriller, you sometimes have to be allowed a little artistic licence.<br />I still think 'Digital Fortress' is the best of Dan Brown's novels.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Young William Bloom grows restless with his father Edward's tall tales of wild circus life, World War II heroics, and lost mystical hamlets rising up at the end of the lagoon. For 3 years, they don't speak. Then, returning home to Alabama from France, William tries mending his fragile relationship with his dying father, now stricken with cancer. Edward Bloom's stories of fame and fortune are hard to believe.  &quot;A giant man can't have an ordinary life!&quot; he barks. Related in flashbacks, Edward tones back to life as a charming traveling salesman. One day he wandered out of a creepy Southern swamp and stumbled into a forgotten, magical town called Spectre, where the grass is green, and the girls are barefoot...15 years ago, Hollywood veteran Tim Burton began a famous career in a Batman cape. He floundered for years as a wierdo-movie director. Now, for the first time in &quot;Big Fish&quot;, Burton measures human emotion with his penchant for the quirky and the macabre. Tim Burton has come of age. Disturbed by his own father's recent death, Burton focuses clearly on the traumatic loss of a parent. Here is gravity and restraint we have not seen before. &quot;Big Fish&quot; stars a marvelous Ewan McGregor as the youthful Edward Bloom. McGregor delivers another enchanting, facile performance. Co-stars include Albert Finney and Billy Crudup. Extending the Tim Burton movie legacy is Danny DeVito(from &quot;Batman Returns&quot;) and several sword-glove props lifted directly from &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot;. AllMovieGuide lists uncredited cameo parts by Julianne Moore and Faye Dunaway(as a witch). Filmed entirely in Alabama and France, Columbia's &quot;Big Fish&quot; DVD is a rich, textured anamorphic transfer(1.85:1). Extras include trailers, previews, 9 featurettes, a trivia quiz, and Burton's own commentary. An Easter egg is hidden on the main menu page. &quot;Big Fish&quot; is a mature fantasy surrounded by death's cold-hearted earthly truths. And there's a sense of wonder here. As William Bloom says: &quot;The best I can do is tell it to you the way he told me. It doesn't always make sense, and most of it never happened. But that's what kind of story it is...&quot;
B000006O7C|5.0|so experimental and beautiful. Disc one is much more polished than two but doesnt mean its better. the gems that stand out on both cd's for me are &quot;everybody here wants you&quot; and &quot;I know we could be so happy&quot; but just like grace a new favorite pops after each listen. he was a true musical genius and it seems like the pot of them just keeps gettin thiner. i recommend this only for those who truly appreciate the music.
B000002H33|5.0|It's hilarious how a person can come and not only give this album one star but also explain how the songs on the album are nothing special.  Any real fan of metal will definitely tell you that Master of Puppets is as close to perfection as any album can get. I've listened to this album easily over a hundred times and still find myself in eager anticipation each time the album kicks off. Anything that Metallica released in the 80's was and still is pure brilliance.  Any reviews other than five stars should not be considered reliable.  Also look into any other album by Metallica released pre 90's, Megadeth and Iron Maiden.
0141301104|5.0|There is no better novel for describing the cognitive dissonance a normal person will feel around a certain type of civic booster than \\"The Witches.\\" <br />More than a wonderful child's fantasy novel, Dahl tells you what, as an adult, you will encounter with superficially sweet people who have their own agenda. His details of the witches - from their perfectly coiffed hair (wigs) to their meaty non-smile ricti (rictuses?) - are exactly what you encounter in the real world. <br />And if that sounds depressing and bitter, let me tell you, it helps to be able to laugh about it through Dahl's novel. This is a terrific kids' book - that's when I got exposed to it - but remembering how all the Royal Society for the Protection of Children were plastic evil people helps me put into perspective all the insane backstabbers I've had to deal with.<br /> Forget self-help, get Roald.
B0001LJC2K|4.0|The first full track, Apocolypse Please, blew me away. I heard some Radiohead similarities, but not enough to make me think I was listening to a Radiohead album. However, as the CD went on, I forgot I was listening to Muse. In fact, it sounds like it could be a Thom York side project. On the other hand, every single track is incredibly well crafted and will certainly have your head bouncing. Also, despite the Radiohead comparisons, there's a few differences. The music is very heavy at times and almost sounds like a full orchestra with distortion. Piano is well placed throughout the CD and adds a nice classical touch. If it weren't for Radiohead, I would give this album 5 stars, but since the music is too similar, I had to take one off.
0553573403|4.0|Reading these books has been one of the most refreshingly new experiences I have had in the world of fantasy in a long time.  The plots are fascinating and multi-tiered, drawing the reader in by making them guess as to what's happening next.  The realism is extraordinary, with a careful attention to detail that manages to come across as an improvement, not an obsession.  Martin is a genius at throwing little clues out to his readers, drawing you onward as you put the puzzle pieces together.  The particular genius, however, that places this book on a level with authors such as Tolkien and Asimov is the storytelling method.<br />Martin destroys the convention of simply following a character around and swamping the reader in unnecessary background.  Instead, he vividly brings his world to life through small details: the heraldry of noble houses, the scholar-doctor &quot;maesters&quot; and other little things.  By constantly switching perspectives, Martin puts a story together that could almost be real, building piece on piece, all from different (and biased) points of view.  And what points of view they are!  The characters are works of genius, some of the most three-dimensional people I have ever read in fantasy literature.  From the scheming, acid-tongued dwarf Tyrion Lannister to the troubled but dutiful wife Catelyn Stark, each character is believable down to the last detail.<br />All in all, I would not hesitate to recommend this story to every reader I know.
0634022296|5.0|&quot;The Beatles Complete Chord Songbook&quot; is indeed a wonderful compilation of all of the Beatles original songs complete with the guitar tabs, chords and lyrics.

6305313687|5.0|hi.<BR>well when i first saw this movie, i could not believe how good of a movie it was.. and usually i don't cry during movies, but this movie made me cry alot, it made me not want to hate anyone anymore, and that hate is not good no matter who you are.<BR>It just tells us how racism can break up a family, and how hate is not good, it can be learned, and it can be unlearned. This movie is such a great message to everyone, its a great movie to watch.. and you can learn so much fron watching this movie. by watching this movie it made me think how much your young brother or sister can learn from what your doing.. and want to do it to. i know because i have an older sister who is 18, and i've always wanted to do the things she did or does i'm 16 years old, and i'm kinda still watching what my sister does, ..it the same thing that happeneds in the movie. but as it says in the movie some legaches must end, that true. <br />this movie is the far the most best movie that i've ever saw.<br />thank you. <BR>bye:nancy.
B00000K0DQ|4.0|I liked the film because it tried to be neutral with the death penalty. It presented a murderer with unexpectable feelings and a family background who also suffered from the crime. I could sympathize with the poor Matthew Poncelet but Tim Robbins showed the hard reality of the victims parents in order to feel sorry for them, too. In the end I didnt know what to feel. Feel sorry for Matt, for Lucille (Matts mom), for the Delacroixs and the Percys?? The film raised the question/made us contemplate if the death penalty solves every problem!!
B00012QM8G|5.0|Schindler's list stands alone as the most important movie made about the holocaust. No other film comes close to it's message and delivery than perhaps Roman Polanski's &quot;Pianist&quot;. I first saw &quot;Schindler's list&quot; when I was in middle school and what I saw capitivated me and sparked a desire in me to learn more about the subject. My history classes up until that point had mentioned the holocaust but never provided me with any indepth or important information. &quot;Schindler's list&quot; is excellent in depicting the brutality in which the Germans operated. The Germans exterminated whole towns, used jews as target practice and made them strip naked and run laps like cattle, but most importantly the movie shows how we can change ourselves and do whats right. Whatching Mr. Schindler change though the movie is touching and inspiring. A once petty and corrupt man who plans to use jews as slave labor, Schindler begins to question his morality once his witnesses the horrors of the holocaust first hand. Although many questions about Schindlers character have been analyzed and debated even before the films release, I stand ferm with my respect for what he did. He as been criticized for not doing enough. I say at least he did something. I can't say enough good things about this movie. It is definitaly one of the greatest achievements in modern film making.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|I can't believe this movie came out and then disappeared just as fast.  My friend and I thought it was very suspenseful and a great performance by Ashton.  This was quite a different role for him and in my opinion warranted an award.  Wondered if maybe his TV shows with his goofball performances such as on \\"The 70's Show\\" might have stopped some people from wanting to see the movie.  His prior accomplishments I believe are catered more towards the younger generation.  Although I am middle aged, I thought the movie was great and I wish they would bring it back to the theaters, but guess I'll just wait for the DVD to come out.
B000001ESF|5.0|I was introduced to Rush in 1978. My friend had seen them at Manchesters Free Trade Hall and was blown away. He lent me 'Fly By Night' and I liked it but wanted a bit more from an album, good as it was. So I bought 'Closer to the Heart' on 12&quot; vinyl, which included 'Temples of Syrinx', which I loved. Then I listened to 2112. Wow! The opening 'Overture'is an incredible opus of power, hooks, and musical excellence. Then just when you think it is all instrumental, there are explosions, a hook or the 1812 overture, brief silence, Geddy's whispered 'and the meek shall inherit the earth' and BANG!, straight into Temples. After the explosive opening, the 2112 track builds as Geddys character discovers a guitar for the first time and we are with him all the way as he takes his first tentative steps towards mastering the instrument, the excitement as he presents it to the 'elders' and the despair as his dreams are cast aside and the instrument deemed as 'another toy that helped destroy the elder race of man', and his sadness as his dreams are destroyed. Soliloquoy is heart rendering, but the pace is picked up with the Grand Finale. It is a wonderous track, and the B side of the album is great too, with 'Something for Nothing' being my favourite. 'Tears' is a rarity, a Rush love song, and it has a gorgeous melody. 2112 is Classic rock of its time, and still evokes great memories for me, even now, my favourite Rush album although I love 'Grace Under Pressure'and 'Moving Pictures'. I saw them perform it at Manchesters Apollo Theatre in 1979 and it was everything I hoped for. Great Band, still performing to the highest standards.
B00005JLEU|5.0|although this movie was made for kids, adults will love it too. I ve watched this movie 73 times. it never gets old. not once in 73 times. watch it once and get sucked in. the charming story of a girl lost in a spirit world and the cutest dragon in the saving her puts a freakin'  twinkle in your heart and a burp in your belly.<BR>                  THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST EVER!!!!!!
B000069HK2|5.0|let me make it short, i have over 500 cd's and just recently came back to the used and this cd is one of best.   These guys are great!   I hope they come out with many cd's
B00007KQA3|1.0|this remake of a 1956 movie classic is awful.  the original movie, produced in 1956, starring Jan Sterling and Michael Redgrave was much more superior.  It really told the story of Oceania and Eurasia, with much more depth than this remade DVD fiasco.  Richard Burton's performance was outstanding, however placing John Hurt was a poor choice of judgment.  The eurythmics soundtrack is deplorable, distracting the overall view of the feel of the movie.  The producer was right in removing them from the soundtrack.  All we need then is Giorgio Moroder and you could dance in Victory Square!  If you are able to obtain a copy of the original version (sometimes on ebay, but the George Orwell society disapproves because of copyright) compare the two, and the original is much better.  The original was scored with the London Symphony Orchestra, and the 2 minute hate scene is far superior.  But, until its released so that everyone can enjoy it, this DVD version you are stuck with.
B0000D96NW|5.0|I have heard every MH album except for &quot;SuperCharger&quot; the majority of the people said that supercharger is fair at best. This new album is worthy of being called a metal masterpiece. MH may have put out a lackluster album in supercharger, but make no mistake about the &quot;Burning Red&quot; is a album worth having in your cd player. With so many bands sounding alike these days it is refreshing to see a band like MH come out swinging with emonational lyrics and guitar riffs/solos comparable to their first 2 albums. Give this new album your full attention. Also SuperCharger may have been lackluster but no album I have EVER heard has been more disapointing then &quot;ST.ANGER&quot; I think Metallica should hang'em up, their name as metal icons will remain intact, but only if they retire. MH is younger, better and faster than Metllica....I think ST.ANGER should be called ST.S*it
1592400876|5.0|I never thought I would laugh out loud reading a book about grammar and punctuation, but Lynne Truss has caused me to do just that!  As a self-confessed &quot;stickler,&quot; I had been looking forward to the publication of this book in the United States, and was not disappointed.  For anyone who is dismayed at the lack of proper grammar and punctuation in all areas of writing today, this book is a must-read.  For people who don't really know any better (as is obvious from their reviews on Amazon.com,) this book is a waste of time and a bore.  I am buying this book for friends and loved ones in order to share the message!
6305949980|5.0|I own this DVD and watch it nearly once a week.. its a masterpiece..<br />the music, the animation, the story, all of it is brilliant!<br />you gotta march around the room singing &quot;this is halloween.. this is halloween!&quot;, it makes it more fun.<br />I like the special features too, Frankenweenie was one of the first Burton flicks I ever saw back when VHS was just taking hold.
B00009UW0N|5.0|1978's &quot;Halloween&quot; never seems to grow old, or stale, or tiresome, or &quot;dated&quot; .... no matter how many October 31st viewings you are subjected to.  I'd call it a &quot;fine wine of cinema&quot; -- it seems to get better each year.  (This is possibly due to the fact that very few films of equal stature, within the &quot;horror&quot; genre, have been released since &quot;Halloween's&quot; debut in October 1978.)<br />Director-Writer John Carpenter was able to make &quot;Halloween&quot; on the shoe-string budget of only $320,000.  The film has since grossed approximately 175 times that figure -- earning more than 55 million dollars worldwide since its 1978 original release!  Talk about a great return on your investment!  Amazing indeed.<br />There have been seemingly a million imitations and carbon copies of this low-budget thriller, but not many (if any at all) can prey on a viewer's fears and anxieties the way this motion picture can do.  And none of the subsequent slice-and-dice, teenager-laden imitators and sequels can hold a candle to the incredible music score that John Carpenter came up with for the original &quot;Halloween&quot;.<br />Is it possible *not* to get a few chills upon hearing that music start up?  It's such an amazingly-simple composition by Carpenter; and yet so incredibly effective.  That music MAKES this movie THIS good.<br />&quot;Halloween&quot; has many memorable moments that evoke chills and a few shivers, even after repeated viewings -- such as:<br /><br />&gt;&gt; Loomis' (Donald Pleasence) creepy description of Michael Myers' &quot;evil&quot; black eyes. ....<br />&gt;&gt;  Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) looking out her schoolhouse window and seeing Michael for the first time, just standing there, creepy as all get out just by doing nothing but standing by the station wagon and staring at Laurie (ooohhh, what a shiver-inducing scene it is!). ....<br />&gt;&gt; Loomis discovering the headstone missing in the cemetery. Followed by his appropriate line of dialogue: &quot;He's come home.&quot; ....<br />&gt;&gt; The Myers-driven car popping up in view behind Laurie &amp; friend while they are driving. ....<br />&gt;&gt; Michael's &quot;head turn&quot; toward Laurie at the end of the film. (Now just WHY Laurie hasn't headed for the hills and away from that house at this point is another matter. Why she is sitting there, crying, with her back to her attacker is anyone's guess. But, it's good for the script at any rate.) ....<br />&gt;&gt; Is he or isn't he behind that hedge?? ....<br />&gt;&gt; Loomis spies the abandoned station wagon parked on a dark street. And then, implacably, that music starts yet again. Carpenter's constant use of that eerie musical score was a stroke of horror genius, in my opinion.  Each time we hear it, an inevitable feeling of unease is certain to follow. ....<br />&gt;&gt; And my very favorite &quot;creepy&quot; moment -- the stormy, rain-soaked scene where Loomis (and a female assistant) first drive up to Michael's &quot;institution&quot;. The nurse with Loomis says, &quot;Since when do they let them walk around?&quot;  Then Director Carpenter cranks up that music. A standout and unsettling moment.<br />I don't even mention any of the killings here, because (IMO) the &quot;anticipation&quot; of the evil-doings to come is much more unsettling and scary than the actual killings themselves.<br />&quot;Halloween&quot; was filmed in the nice, wide aspect ratio of 2.35:1; and that's how we see it on this DVD. Disc # 1 contains the movie only, in enhanced Anamorphic 2.35:1 Widescreen, and three different soundtrack choices (four if you count the one Commentary Track). You can listen to the film in Dolby Digital 5.1, 2-Channel Dolby Surround, or 2.0 Dolby Digital Mono.  The fourth track available is the Audio Commentary, featuring three participants: Jamie Lee Curtis, John Carpenter, and Producer Debra Hill.<br />In addition to the 3-person Commentary Track, this 2-Disc Anniversary Edition includes many other excellent bonus features (all located on Disc # 2), including the comprehensive, feature-length, 87-minute behind-the-movie documentary called &quot;Halloween: A Cut Above The Rest&quot;.  This stellar bonus documentary is very nearly as long as the movie itself (with the movie clocking in at 91 minutes).<br />Another mini-featurette is included --- &quot;On Location: 25 Years Later&quot; (length: 10.5 minutes).<br />Other extras include ..... 1 Theatrical Trailer; 2 TV Spots; 2 Radio Spots; An extensive &quot;Poster &amp; Still Gallery&quot;; 3 detailed text-only &quot;Talent Bios&quot; (on Director John Carpenter and stars Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence); and some DVD-ROM features for your computer -- the complete screenplay and 2 screen-savers.<br />An impressive array of features here (IMO). And all of this bonus material has been &quot;enhanced&quot; for widescreen monitors (anamorphic), which is always kind of nice. This includes even the Menu screens, which seem (to my eyes) to be anamorphic as well.  So there's no need to constantly switch ratio settings on your TV from one bonus item to the next.<br />The &quot;Cut Above The Rest&quot; documentary even has multiple soundtracks to choose from -- Dolby 5.1 and Dolby 2.0 Surround.  This extra is not broken into multiple &quot;chapters&quot;, however.<br />There's also a high-quality 16-page booklet included in this package, which is packed with a good deal of information about the making of the film, a chapter list, and some good-looking photos.  This is one of the more impressive &quot;paper enclosures&quot; you're likely to find with any DVD release.<br />There have been several different DVD versions of this ultra-creepy horror classic to hit the home video market, with this two-disc 25th Anniversary Edition (released originally by Anchor Bay Entertainment on August 5, 2003) being my favorite -- so far anyway.  :-)is 2-Disc Anniversary Edition includes many other excellent bonus features (all located on Disc # 2), including the comprehensive, feature-length, 87-minute behind-the-movie documentary called &quot;Halloween: A Cut Above The Rest&quot;.  This stellar bonus documentary is very nearly as long as the movie itself (with the movie clocking in at 91 minutes).   <br />Another mini-featurette is included --- &quot;On Location: 25 Years Later&quot; (length: 10.5 minutes).<br />Other extras include ..... 1 Theatrical Trailer; 2 TV Spots; 2 Radio Spots; An extensive &quot;Poster &amp; Still Gallery&quot;; 3 detailed text-only &quot;Talent Bios&quot; (on Director John Carpenter and stars Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence); and some DVD-ROM features for your computer -- the complete screenplay and 2 screen-savers.<br />An impressive array of features here (IMO). And all of this bonus material has been &quot;enhanced&quot; for widescreen monitors (anamorphic), which is always kind of nice. This includes even the Menu screens, which seem (to my eyes) to be anamorphic as well.  So there's no need to constantly switch ratio settings on your TV from one bonus item to the next.<br />The &quot;Cut Above The Rest&quot; documentary even has multiple soundtracks to choose from -- Dolby 5.1 and Dolby 2.0 Surround.

B0001CCXY8|4.0|I just got this CD yesterday. This is the first time i have heard anything by CC.This really is not a bad CD it just takes some getting used to. I had never heard them before and when i first heard this i had the same opinion most seem to have about this group. But i have listened to it about three times and watched the dvd that comes with it. The dvd changed my opinion about the group.They are really a cool bunch of guys.Sure the lyrics are kinda corny and somewhat stupid but overall i understand what they are trying to do. They are unique amongst death metal groups and to me that is a postitive.In my opinion they are a harder version of Obituary which i really like.Give this group a break and understand what they are trying to accomplish and maybe then you will find they are in a category all their own.I give this a 4 star because of the repetion in the lyrics. There is no deviance from the subject on their songs and the vocals dont vary too much.

B000069CWE|5.0|Great for a Linkin Park Fan.  If you want a different taste of Linkin Park, buy this album.  You won't be disappointed!
B000148KK2|2.0|Diana's approach to a song inspired me to go out and start investing time and money into jazz music.  I bought all the Diana Krall CD's and Live in Paris DVD, as well as Coltrane, Ella, Miles, Bud Powell, Monk, etc....  So after being a long time devoted fan, I knew what to expect when she released and new album.  This time I was shocked.  She strayed away from the sound and improvisations that made me fall in love with her in the first place.  Was she doing it as a marketing decision, or just exploring different styles of music?  Whatever the reason, it was a mistake.  I hope she soon gets back into her groove, and showcase her natural talent soon.
B0000CABBW|5.0|In 2002, Niki Caro directed and co-wrote the screenplay for the endearing New Zealand film &quot;Whale Rider&quot;, which was based upon novel of the same name written by Witi Ihimaera and published in New Zealand in 1987.  (In Maori, the title is &quot;Te Kaieke Tohora&quot;.)  The story is about a young Maori girl named Paikea 'Pai' Apirana (Keisha Castle-Hughes), who is a direct descendent of the Maori chief Paikea who arrived at Whangara, New Zealand on the back of a whale many generations ago.  From that time forward, his first-born male descendents were each named after him and became chiefs; that is, until Paikea Apirana's parents gave birth to twins, a boy and a girl, as their first-born children.  Sadly, the twin's mother died during childbirth, as did the boy; but the girl survived and was named Paikea.  Disgraced, her father, Porourangi (Cliff Curtis), leaves for Europe, so Pai's grandparents raise her instead.  Her grandfather, Koro Apirana (Rawiri Paratene), views Pai as a bad omen for the tribe and embarks on finding a Maori boy worthy of becoming the next chief since he can't accept the possibility of a girl becoming chief.  However, Pai's grandmother, Nanny Flowers (Vicky Haughton), loves Pai very much and encourages her to learn the ways of a chief in spite of Koro's objections.<br />&quot;Whale Rider&quot; was first released at the Toronto Film Festival in September, 2002, where it won the &quot;People's Choice Award&quot;.  As it was shown at various independent film festivals that followed, including the 2003 Sundance Film Festival, it continued to win awards and was finally released for general cinema in May, 2003 in Australia and in the U.S. one month later.  Shortly thereafter, the Keisha Castle-Hughes received serious attention from film critics.  She was rewarded for her performance in &quot;Whale Rider&quot; with an Oscar nomination for Best Actress.  Though she did not win the Oscar, she will hopefully continue to develop her acting abilities and continue to be a superb member of her generation of actors and actresses.<br />For its superb acting, wonderful story and incredible cinematography, I rate &quot;Whale Rider&quot; with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  Other memorable characters in the film include Uncle Rawiri (Grant Roa), Hemi (Mana Taumaunu) and Shilo (Rachel House).  Memorable scenes include Pai trying to clandestinely learn from Koro, Koro taking pupils out on a canoe, Pai finding the necklace, Pai reciting her history at school and the whales.  I highly recommend this film to everyone.
0790744295|5.0|The film tells the story of a young boy whose comic contains five stories told in the same vein of early 50's horror comic stories. The film is written by Stephan King (who also appears in the second story in his only starring role,) and directed by George A. Romerio (origonal LIVING DEAD trilogy). Included also are a few brief animated sequences.    A man pays a visit to his family on Father's Day from beyond the grave...    A farmer finds a meteorite that, when broken, spills fourth a strange moss that grows on everything, including his own flesh...    A man and his lover seek revenge on her husband AFTER they've been murdered...    A mysterious crate found in the basement of a college hids some thing that should never be let out.

B00005JLEX|5.0|I just saw the release date for the first season on an Australian DVD retail site...given as 15th November 2004 so if everything happens as it usually does maybe it will be released in the US before that.<br />Great classic comedy...
B00005K9LN|5.0|On British Steel, Priest finally broke through in the US.  Les Binks left and Dave Holland came aboard(not the best move), but still the album kicks A**!  From Metal classics like, &quot;Metal Gods&quot;, &quot;Rapid Fire&quot;, and &quot;Steeler&quot; to anthems such as &quot;living After Midnight&quot;, &quot;United&quot; and Breaking The Law, this album owns!!!
B0001LJC2K|5.0|This is an amazing CD. I had the pleasure to see these guys at Coachella on Sunday and I had previously owned Showbiz but I could never find this in stores. The show was incredible and even though it was over 100 degrees and the sun was in everyone's eyes it didn't keep everyone from dancing and jumping around like fools. Immediately after that show I had to go to the Virgin megastore booth to buy it. And well it's definitely not a let-down. Now I just need to close my eyes and go back to Coachella and pretend like I don't have a ton of work I should be doing...
B000000WJZ|1.0|After hearing this pukefest of an album, I can completely understand why William Hung can get a contract.<BR>A 2 year old toddler screaming sounds better than this garbage.<BR>Makes me wanna put on Motley Crue's Girls Girls Girls, and hear some real Rock!<BR>Thank god for bands like the Darkness and Jet, for bringing the fun back in rock.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|Wow this movie blows!  You know it's bad when the cover looks like a damn video game.  The battles scenes were soooooo lame, it was funny especially when that commander guy kept on yelling &quot;GOD DAMNIT!&quot;  That was so funny this movie is so dumb it's funny.  I like the other two movies they were tight, the highway scene on the second one was bad ass.  But there is no tight fighting scene in this movie, even the final &quot;showdown&quot; was dumb, more of a &quot;let down&quot; if you ask me.  So here's the verdict, the movie sucks!
B0000028UK|1.0|After the success of Ten, Pearl Jam got angry at being called metal (boo hoo) so they went in this crappy direction.  This album is bad, Thank god the salesof their albums nose dived after Pearl Jam took a step in this direction.
B0000033P0|3.0|Back in the 70's as a kid buying vinyl &quot;Lucky Man&quot; was definitely a cool little song.. it was released as a single...and &quot;Take A Pebble&quot; was another fine moment (both tunes are from ELP's self-titled debut LP) but  &quot;TARKUS&quot; (side 1) was ELP's best effort... and to my ears they &quot;jumped the shark&quot; as the saying goes shortly after releasing this record. <BR> I don't recall the bad press that another reviewer here mentions.. ELP were one of the first so-called &quot;super-groups&quot; who according to the press at the time could do no wrong it seemed and they really really didn't deserve all the good press that they did get..especially for anything after &quot;Pictures At An Exhibition&quot; - not as original as &quot;Tarkus&quot; but worth noting for introducing classical music to a lot of rock fans.<BR>I never particularly liked any ELP live recordings but seeing ELP live at Maple Leaf Gardens was a trip! Sure they had megalights and a supergoofy prog rock stage set (think Spinal Tap) but all that stuff paled in comparison to just seeing Keith get crazy and kick his organ around and stick knives in it... and that special custom MOOG he had (Moog built it especially for Keith) with all it's snaking cables looked like LILY TOMLIN's telephone operating system from Laugh-In.<BR>Then and now  -- as much as I totally loved ELP and strained to teach myself to play those excessively flashy yet monotonous Keith Emerson keyboard runs--and heck I was only 13 or 14 when this came out --  the Tarkus vs. Manticore &quot;concept&quot; struck me pretty stupid and despite Greg's lovely voice the lyrics extremely stupid!!! <BR>...but sheesh those analog synth sounds YOW! they were like nothing anyone was doing and they'll always sound great ... those synth sounds were heaven!
B0001AP12G|5.0|I can't really think of a bad track on the CD.  The only things T didn't like about it was the amount of skits and that some of the songs were censored...but it is one of the best of the year so far.  A definate buy.  Can't wait to hear more Kanye and I really want to see how he does the &quot;Jesus Walks&quot; video.
B0001HAISQ|4.0|I didn't expect much from Peter Pan, I figured if you seen one you've them all. That's not the case here though. Sure it has all the same plot details as the other movies but this one adds an attraction between Peter and Wendy.  Jeremy Sumpter (Frailty) and Rachel Hurd-Wood \\"in her first role\\" are well casted as Peter and Wendy. They both have really good chemestry. Sumpter completely nails the role of Peter. He's afraid of growing up and enjoys being a kid a lot yet there's still a sadness to him. He's lonely and wants to be with Wendy but without speaking of love and feelings. Anyway him and Wood are great in their roles and it's the best acting I've seen from young actors in awhile.<br />  Jason Isaacs (Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets) is equally good as Captain Hook. He plays the part more serious and scary than Dennis Hoffman did in Hook.  Isaacs clearly wants to kill Peter and is ruthless and deadly.  The Neverland scenery looks a lot better than it did in Hook too. Peter Pan has fantasy, adventure and romance and is great for the whole family. It can seem dark but no kids die like in Hook where Rufio dies. It can be violent but it never over does it. It's a really good movie and deserved more of an audience than it got while in theatres.
B000002VFW|5.0|This particular Lisa Stansfield CD puts most of today's R&amp;B female singers to shame. Her and Teena Marie make some these new girls seem like karaoke singers!
038572179X|2.0|ATONEMENT demonstrates again that, when she filled her pockets with stones and walked into the river, Virginia Woolf took the English novel with her.<br />ATONEMENT is a mediocre book, unqualifiedly in love with its own prose, which is workmanlike. Both the narrator and the characters signal their punches throughout, so when we discover, at the end, that one of the characters, a highly acclaimed writer, IS the author of the book, that the book is her atonement, then we feel that those she punished have been punished doubly so.<br />ATONEMENT presumes its readers are rather dense, won't see right away that Paul is the one who raped Briony's cousin nor that she will marry him. Are English readers dense? are they terribly distracted? they cannot be as dense as McEwen presumes.<br />Anyway, if you seek a contemporary British novel, highly acclaimed but actually run-of-the-mill, then try ATONEMENT.
B00006DEF9|5.0|Singin' in the Rain is definately one of my favorite musical films of all time.  No movie has ever gone into the Hollywood atmosphere to show how movies were made.  All the acting is superb.  Gene Kelly in this film is truely his best performance, as well as the laugh out loud Donald O' Connor.  Debbie Reynolds also plays a sweet innocent perfect character that she was born to play.  The music is fast paced and addictive, and unlike some musicals never slows down the pace of the plot line.  This is a definate film to see in your lifetime.  I highly reccomend this film.
B00005JMGL|5.0|Oh my gosh, I love this movie!!!  Jeremy Sumpter is so hott!!!  I've always liked the srory of Peter Pan but I never thought I would be so into it.  Jeremy Sumpter makes the movie come alive.  He is so inspiring I've always wanted to be a model and he was one and we have so much in common.  Even though I have never met him I still wish to do so.  I love this movie I want to win the autographed DVD of his movie Peter Pan.  I hope to someday meet this 15 year-old wonder.  Even though I'm only 14 I don't think it's a big deal.  I love him so much and I'm not upsessed I just love his movies and his personality and intrests.  I will always watch this movie when I but two copies and tell everyone how great this movie is.
B00003CXAE|5.0|This is definately my favorite of all the musical and dance movies ever.  Grease can be summed up into one word:  Awesome.  The music is electric, fast paced, and exciting.  The plot is funny and charming.  The cinamatography and the nostalgia factor is also good.  The movie is hands down perfect.  Danny and Sandy are icons in the movie world.  They are the ultimate teen couple.  The film is definately one of the greatest films of the nineteen seventies.  This is the kind of movie you can watch over and over again.  See it at least once.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I love Gilmore Girls, and I love that we can buy them no DVD now! But when I bought this DVD set at the store on the release date, and opened it up there were two disk #1's insead on disk 1,2,... Has any one other than me had this problem?
B00008972S|5.0|West Side Story is my second favorite musical of all time (second only to Grease.) This is a definately more real and compelling story than Romeo and Juliet.  Maria and Tony are so real together.  The movie itself is brilliant.  The music and dance sequences are always vibrant and non-stop and the music is electric and colorful.  The acting is wonderful, especially Natalie's, and Anita's.  The movie has issues that Romeo and Juliet never dealt with.  Like racism, and predjudice.  All in all the film is excellent and it definately gives Skakespeare a run for his money.
B00005JLSE|1.0|I rented the movie to see if I wanted to buy it.  So far I have not bought it.  I will wait for a double dvd reissue in the future with more extras. I watched all of the extras on this dvd including the commentaries.  I took me several tries to get through this movie.  I kept falling asleep even while watching it in the daytime.  I didn't care that much about it at all.  Boring comes to mind for my one-word review.  At least after watching the commentary, I &quot;understood&quot; a little more of what they were trying to do. Now don't get me wrong, I like musicals.  I own Caberet, Camelot, Moulin Rouge [much better than this one], The Sound of Music, The box set of Rogers and Hammerstein musicals and many more.<br />My goal is to buy all of the Best Picture movies from the start in 1927 to the present.  This one makes it hard to do that.  I want all of the best director, actors and actresses movies to collect also. I like Richard Gere's character and the performances of Renee and Queen Latifa. <br />I still don't understand how they picked this one as best picture.  I own Seabiscuit and it is 100 times better and should have won.
6305696071|5.0|Take a classic musical like My Fair Lady, and take out the music.  Then take Cinderella and put it into the modern world.  Those two combinations make this perfect Gary Marshall film.  Julia Roberts and Richard Gere are one of the best onscreen couples in the history of film.  The movie really makes you feel for the characters.  After the film, it is almost like you know Vivian.  Comedy is everywhere as well as romance.  All the performances are wonderful and the plot really grabs you.  This is a definate film for anyone.  See it.
1592400876|5.0|Just about every third sentence in Ms. Truss's book made me chuckle, or even laugh out loud.  The entire book is filled with amusing stories, anecdotes, and examples.  Yes, there are subtle differences between American and English grammar rules; however, this book is so entertaining and charming, it is a gem to read.
630522577X|5.0|My Fair Lady is one of the greatest film musicals of all time.  Audrey Hepburn lights up the silver screen in a somewhat different way.  She starts out not being the elegant film goddess that we are used to seeing in her previous films.  Rex Harrison plays another stuffy Englishman, as usual.  The music and the cinematography is really good.  It deserved the Academy Award for Best Picture.  This film is a musical that tends to make people laugh more than the others do.  It is nice to have a few good laughs in films that are lead up to be boring and pointless, even though they are not.  I highly reccomend this film for anyone and everyone.A Must See
B00005RYKV|2.0|Brother may seem like a whole lot of meaningless gore, and in fact I don't think it was a particularly well-made or enjoyable movie, but it provides valuable insight into the Japanese perception of their place in the world. I'm not sure this was intended by the director, but it makes a very interesting contrast to, for example, \\"Rising Sun\\", another fairly average movie (can't comment on the book, haven't read it), which showed a very American perspective of the Japanese.<br />Whereas in Rising Sun, we saw the Japanese as sneaky little yellow men hiding their prejudices, corruption and kinky sex behind polite smiles and a facade of high culture, here Kitano portrays them (or at least the Yakuza) as noble, loyal, selfless, brave warriors, willing to sacrifice all to protect their honour. Quite a contrast!<br />Rising Sun showed Westerners (represented by the US alone, as usual) as passionate but ultimately rational, independent-minded for the better, and, for the most part at least, genuine (in a \\"what you see is what you get\\" sense). Kyoudai (incidentally, the title refers not to any blood relationship between the two main characters - there was none!, but to the \\"brotherhood\\" of the Yakuza) shows Westerners as emotionally out-of-control, intellectually lacking, hopelessly disorganised and incapable of any subtlety or restraint. From considerable experience in Japan I can assure you that this is an accurate representation of the stereotype held by many Japanese.<br />Another (I think) accurate representation of the Japanese mindset in this film lies in the ease with which the Japanese muscle-in on the US underworld. With their diligence, their capacity for cooperation and self-sacrifice towards long-term, collective goals, how could they possibly fail against this disorganised rabble of Westerners?! - this is the attitude presented, and mostly validated in this film. It's very interesting, then, that the \\"brotherhood\\" are ultimately unsuccessful in their power-bid.Is this a symbolic recognition that the US has remained militarily and economically supreme? At the least, I feel that the way in which Kitano's character dies again reflects an important facet of the Japanese mindset, being the attitude that there is only ever a choice of complete victory or total failure, conquering the whole of Asia or being stripped of all military power, scoring highly in the University entrance exams or dropping out of the academic world completely - there is absolutely no room for compromise or mediocrity, and thus a willingness follows to sacrifice everything in the bid for that absolute, and possibly elusive, victory. Of course, this has alarming implications for Japan's potential return to military and/or economic power.<br />But if you want, you can forget my interpretations and just see this movie as a whole lot of meaningless gore.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|Following in the footsteps of Grease, Flashdance, and Footloose, this is definately one of the best dance movies ever made.  The plot is very intriguing, and you identify yourself in the characters.  The dancing is nonstop and the songs are great too.  Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze are a good couple on the screen, and the stage.  The movie can be funny at some times but mostly it stays dramatic and serious.  This is a perfect date movie to watch, and it is also a good movie to watch on a rainy day.  I definately reccomend this movie.  See it before you die.
B000068R1X|5.0|This is surely the greatest Ozzy performance to date. His voice sounds amazingly divine, almost supernatural. The great guitar playing of Jake E. Lee and the musicianship of Don Airey add up to one of the greatest music experiences you can have. The unusual song So Tired will surely amuse you in an unexpected way but the album reaches it's peak at it's end, with the killer Waiting For Darkness, which is a reflexion on life's downsides. The bonus tracks on this new release are also not to be missed. Both songs catch up with the rest of the album and are much better than any recent material.
0800141660|5.0|Sense and Sensablity with Kate Winslet and Emma Thompson is wonderful and a must see. The costumes and scenery are greta I highly reommend it.
B000063DFS|3.0|If you have been following Ozzy's carrer from Blizzard Of Ozz up to No Rest For The Wicked, you'll be sort of disappointed with this material. The whole album has a very commercial, poppish approach, sometimes it even sounds like it tries to catch up with the new trends stablished by the music industry. Perhaps the track called Road To Nowhere is the finest song in the album, but it's still not to be compared with Ozzy's previous work. It sounds like it lacks creativity, since all tracks sound similar. If you don't have all of the previous material yet (including the material from the Black Sabbath era), take my advice and leave this one for your next purchase.
B00005MP58|5.0|This version of &quot;Pride and Predjudice&quot; with Colin Firth is one of the best.  I highly recommend it.  The costumes are great and it's romantic and has wonderful scenery.  Its also pretty much true to the book also.
B000068QZK|4.0|This is surely the best album since Ozzy started working with Zakk Wylde. It also counts with the great drums of Randy Castillo, who also collaborated with the amazing Ultimate Sin. The song Fire In The Sky is very deep and intense, as well as songs such as Tattooed Dancer provide that punch you'd expect from a typical Ozzy album.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|First of all, to all of you who think metal is only somehow synonymous with the hair bands of the late 80's, this album is not for you.  If songs that last over 5 minutes disturb you, look elsewhere.<br />Now to the rest of us, who enjoy listening to bands filled with musicians that can actually play their instruments, and show us how inadequate most of us mere mortals really are!<br />More than any other metal or prog metal album in recent memory, this one gives you songs that will stick in your head, (at least since Symphony X - The Odyssey).  With the exception of the beautifully mellow Vacant, there isn't one song here that doesn't feature a killer riff, or a killer melody.<br />More than any other DT release, this is John Petrucci's album.  The heaviness that was sporadically used on the last 2 albums, is given full reign, and where he sometimes didn't seem to mind being in the background, here he's a lot more in your face.<br />This is not to say that the other band members don't contribute anything.  IMO, this features some of the best work of Mike Portnoy, and, finally a whole album that has John Myung mixed just right.  Personally, I like the fact that James LaBrie no longer hits the really high notes the way he used to.  Though I like singers who can hit those notes, he could get a bit annoying, especially live on the Once In A Livetime album.  The rap sections don't really work well.  (Memo to James LaBrie:  If you're going to use any rap on future albums, you might want to consider trying to sound like real rappers; on second thought, just skip it altogether.  It's not your strong suit.)  Jordan Rudess's role was somewhat dimished, although he still contributes some terrific runs.<br />If MTV had any brains (which they don't!), As I Am could be packaged as the next Enter Sandman (of course they would have to bleep out the F word in the song!)  Which brings me to my only real gripe with this album.  Although the word fits within the context of the song, IMO, using these kind of curse words does nothing but lower the artistic value a song lyric could possibly have.  It's like with comedy, you can always tell the ones who don't have any real talent by the fact that they couldn't get a laugh without using some kind of obscenity.  Apparently, the lyrics show that the band (or at least John Petrucci, who wrote the lyrics), doesn't want to be pigeonholed, or labeled &quot;Christian&quot;, which may have happened after Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence.  Although I am a Christian, I don't listen to DT for spiritual guidance, (even though I did enjoy the lyrics in SDOIT), and I don't think that anyone else does either.  If you're put off by profanity, you might want to take a pass, seeing that the F word is used in 2 songs.  This is the only reason why I gave this album 4 stars instead of 5.  I can tolerate it, but I'd rather do without it!<br />Stream Of Conciousness is DT's best instrumental.  Although it starts out sort of average, it quickly picks up into one of those jams that DT is so good at.  There's not one moment that I can think of with this song that doesn't belong, or that I would ever want to trim off, even though it lasts over 10 mins.<br />Of the rest, Endless Sacrifice is probably the best and In The Name Of God is probably the worst, although only like from 5 stars to 4½ stars.  Musically, ITNOG, like the rest of the songs, grabs you with the hooks, but the lyrics get repetitive.  While railing against the Jim Joneses and David Koreshes of the world is a good thing, this song just seems to try to find more ways to say the same thing over and over.  Still, the music is just so good, that you overlook the shortcomings of the lyrics.  This seems to hold true throughout<br />Bottom Line:  More than any other DT album, this just flat out rocks!  I've had this album for 3 weeks, and I still can't seem to get it out of my CD rotation, and neither will you!MO, using these kind of curse words does nothing but lower the artistic value a song lyric could possibly have.

Musically, ITNOG, like the rest of the songs, grabs you with the hooks, but the lyrics get repetitive.  While railing against the Jim Joneses and David Koreshes of the world is a good thing, this song just seems to try to find more ways to say the same thing over and over.  Still, the music is just so good, that you overlook the shortcomings of the lyrics.  This seems to hold true throughout<br />Bottom Line:  More than any other DT album, this just flat out rocks!  I've had this album for 3 weeks, and I still can't seem to get it out of my CD rotation, and neither will you!
B000002B7U|5.0|This is surely one of the greatest Ozzy albums, if not the best of them all. The greatest songs are Never Know Why, Lightning Strikes, Fool Like You and Shot In The Dark, but you won't find a single regular song at all among the others. This album is the last one with one of Ozzy's greatest guitarists, Jake E. Lee and the first one with the fabulous Randy Castillo. Definitely a must buy.
B0000025KI|4.0|It makes sense that this was the first really successful Springsteen record (&quot;Hungry Heart&quot; is famously his first top ten hit) - the blazing anthems are especially energizing, the slow numbers are tender and deeply human.  That makes for an amazing slew of songs, most of them outstanding, but a less thematic, cohesive outing than Born to Run and Darkness on the Edge of Town.  Compare the difference - say, the peppy summer anthem &quot;Sherry Darling&quot; and the sprawling balladry of &quot;Drive All Night&quot; - you have two brilliant songs that don't seem to belong on an album together.  In which case, it means that it happens to be only as good as a great rock record should be, as opposed to his masterpieces which fly past any of those standards.
B000065PUE|5.0|i don't know about the person that said this album is power pop (what the hell is that anyway) but this album has surf style music and punk. i think you should get surfer rosa first if your new on pixie stuff. these guys will never get old to me even after i got into the whole punk music fase.
0312319517|2.0|Man, to say this is his best book since Day Of The Jackal must be a joke! ODESSA FILE is better, DOGS OF WAR is better, DEVIL´s ALTERNATIVE is better. <br />What Forsyth´s book lacks now is that sense of real iminent danger present in his classics. HT anguish of the French detective trying to find the Jackal; the hunt, by Peter Miller, to find Odessa; the Ucranian revolutionary guy in the Devil´s Alternative.<br />Recently, all his books seems rushed, and all the characters are without any dimensional. It seems like every character is a consumate pro&quot;. Everybody does what it is supposed to do and that´s it. No inner feelings. No contradictions. No dillema. The children are &quot;Pro children&quot;, the women are &quot;Pro women&quot;, the killers are &quot;pro killers&quot;... well, you got the point. Also, the famous &quot;journeys across the world&quot; that his characters do, one of FOrsyth´s trademarks, are uninspiring nowadays: rushed, no thriller, no lurking danger, easy.<br />Other than this, comes the absurd rating some reviewers can give. If you give AVENGER five stars, you are simply saying that it is in the same status as DAY OF THE JACKAL, what any reasonable fan know this is not true!<br />AVENGER is a turn-pager, no doubt about that. But it´s not a great book at all, altough much better than some of his last books.

B000093BDX|5.0|I wasn't raised on The Beach Boys, but I did find them on my own.  I didn't even know who they were until David Lee Roth came out with his cover of &quot;California Girls&quot;.  There is NOTHING like the real thing!  Can there BE more harmonies within these songs?!  AMAZING!  Brian Wilson was a true genius.  I would prefer these guys over The Beatles for two reasons:  (1) It took 4 guys and a producer to come out with what The Beatles did.  Brian Wilson (JUST HIMSELF) wrote, recorded, produced, and mixed...how many albums you ask...get ready...FOURTEEN (14) in FOUR (4) years!!!  That is astonishing!  (2) I have their live album from when they were on the Ed Sullivan Show, and the girls were screaming just as loud, if not louder, for them than they were for The Beatles.<br />Wow!  Fourteen albums in four years.  That's one album every 3 1/2 months.  I have a band myself, and we never wrote 5 songs in ONE month, much less think about recording them yet.  However, legends that they are, their music will never die.  Dig them, you will definitely dig this album.  It's a greatest hits for crying out loud.  Another one at that.  Even if you don't like The Beach Boys, get this album.  You may change your mind.
B00005JM02|5.0|This guys just set another standard in animation. If you think Disney is the number 1, think again.
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|I have been following Marillion since 1984 and as great as their other albums (CD'S) are, this tops anything else that they have done. The music puts you on an emotional rollercoaster throughout the entire CD and it's about time that this amazing band get the airplay that they deserve. The standout tracks for me are \\"The Invisible Man\\", \\"Fantastic Place\\", \\"Ocean Cloud\\", \\"Angelina\\" and \\"Neverland. It's a shame that more people don't get a chance to listen to their music because they are not getting the exposure that they deserve. <BR>C'MON PEOPLE, GIVE THEM A LISTEN AND YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!
B000148KK2|2.0|Diana's music in this CD is well-liked by many people. It's new and different and, as an artist, I'm sure she will continue to explore the many musical avenues open to her. To my ears, the Diana Krall of yesteryear is the Diana I thoroughly enjoy, with her peak performance being the &quot;Live in Paris&quot; offering. In the past, she has given us a fresh interpretation of the old standards. If you've been listening to music for sixty years, you'll most likely prefer the &quot;old standards&quot; -- it's a comfort thing. I hope she continues to do well -- she's a hard-working, talented lady. I also hope that she will consider recording some of the familiar music of earlier times.
B00006879E|5.0|This cd is totally amazing.  its so full of emotion- like, drenching with it.  its fabulous to chill out to or to get ur heart beat going- whatever mood ur in, this can totally fill it.  the songs are plucked right from the soul and delievered for our listening pleasure.
B00008OLYN|3.0|Definitely an album off the beaten path.  Opeth works the &quot;progressive rock&quot; genre in a more restrained fashion than most bands you would find of its kind.  Indeed, their songs have a dream-like quality that floats in the room and tends to rest your attention.  Some may complain that Opeth displays little of the aggresion most turn to rock for and their minds just begin to wander after a few minutes.  So attitudes toward this album will vary according to how you relate to the genre.<br />The best song by most accounts is &quot;In My Time Of Need&quot;.  This song displays Opeth's general focus toward telling &quot;ghost&quot; stories.  It is a haunting song with a beautiful melody that hints at dread and fear.  The rest of Damnation is very much like this to one degree or another.  As such I personally can only play this music when I am in a particular mood.<br />This is a good CD.  Don't expect a party record and be prepared to listen to some stories.  These guys are from Sweden where they don't get much sun a good part of the year.  Makes sense.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I am not sure what troubles me more,..we are being dictated to by Lucas that if we wanna watch star wars we have to watch it with vile filth added, or that people are so blinded that they actually give this abomination a positive rating.  WHO CARES if it is the original series, that moron lucas has poisoned it with his twisted \\"VISION\\" that has brought us to the level of Jar Jar binks.  Lucas has clearly gone totally insane, and Martin Sheen should be sent up the river to \\"terminate his command\\".  This is not the star wars we know and love, this is not the revolutionary movie series, it's ruined,..everything good about the series,...POOF>>GONE.  This \\"special\\" edition(special as in RETARDED) is just the beginning  to his madness.  It was from this garbage he brought us his part 1&2 which ran the whole story and mythos of star wars straight into the ice berg.  Lucas has either fallen into the deepest depths of cenial dementia, or shuffles around lucas ranch with tissue boxes on his feet talking about his \\"Spruce Falcon\\".  WHY WHY WHY are people so deluded into buying his garbage,..why send him the message of, \\"well it's Total garbage, but we will buy it anyway\\", TELL HIM what this crap is by NOT buying this travesty. Let him know we want the REAL Star Wars, not this tripe.  I remember as a child seeing an interview with him and he said something Most of hollywood has forgotten including him,..\\"special effects are NOT what the movie is about, the movie is about the CHARACTERS moving through a STORY\\".  Now it seems all he cares about is blowing stuff up, or making crazy racially objectionable aliens.  (don't know what I mean, watch episode 1 again, then hit your local chinese restaurant,\\"oh U hona us wid yor bresance\\").  No,...tell him you want the real thing, what we fell in love with years ago, not this paste board mask.  With this action Lucas has propped himself right up with the Darkest sides of movie making, throw him into the long shaft and his special editionsin with him.<BR>Up yours George
B00000IBVC|1.0|For a long time I avoided buying this DVD, fearing that it would be like the football stadium Aidas that you see here and there:  &quot;Cast of thousands!  Horses and elephants! Truly spectacular!&quot;  Finally, after getting all the other Turandot DVDs, I broke down and bought this one.  Unfortunately, I was right -- this is just a circus. <br />The musical values are actually not all that bad, but they are overwhelmed by the colossally bad production values.  All the action is set in the midst of a vast plaza in which no one ever would expect an opera to be set.  The cinematography specializes in displaying &quot;look how big this is!&quot;  Scene after scene is shot from afar, over the heads or shoulders of a huge audience, presumably to show us how big the square is in Peking, how many people are attending, and how enormously clever the producers are to have arranged this.  The opera itself is largely overlooked in the rush to be with it.<br />I could go on about other, less serious faults, but why bother?  There are three other Turandots -- the Met, San Francisco, and Salzburg -- that are infinitely superior to this production.  Buy one or more of them, and leave this turkey on its roost.
B000148KK2|3.0|I can understand why some Diana Krall fans dislike this CD, but I have to admit that I much prefer this approach over the overly rich, orchestral production of her previous outing, &quot;The Look of Love.&quot; Even though the Elvis Costello influence is far more prominent than necessary here, it is refreshing to hear Diana add some more blues to her roster, such as the Tom Waits tune &quot;Temptation.&quot; Several of the Krall/Costello numbers might better have been placed on bonus tracks until Diana Krall gets more of a handle on her own songwriting abilities, as well as to spare us from Costello overkill. Despite its shortcomings, this CD is definitely more revealing of the real Diana Krall, who had recently suffered the loss of her mother. Her personal feelings are reflected in the self-penned tunes, especially &quot;Departure Bay&quot; and &quot;I'm Coming Through.&quot; Her version of &quot;I'm Pulling Through&quot; evokes similar themes. I personally could do without &quot;Almost Blue,&quot; &quot;Abandoned Masquerade,&quot; and the weakest track, &quot;I've Changed My Address.&quot; But overall, one has to respect her foray into new territory and marvel at her interpretive piano skills. Vocally, she's still the same Diana but for a few problematic pronounciations of words with &quot;r's&quot; such as &quot;smears,&quot; &quot;tears,&quot; &quot;fears,&quot; etc. Other than that, I think this CD can grow on you, and also, I do believe she is staying true to her jazz roots by exploring new terrain and not being formulamatic. After all, she could be churning out facsimiles of &quot;When I Look In Your Eyes&quot; for years to come, but she obviously aspires to continue growing as an artist . Good for her.<br />(P.S. If you want to hear a superlative interpretation of Joni Mitchell, be sure to check out Dianne Reeve's stunning rendition of &quot;River&quot; on &quot;The Best of Dianne Reeves.&quot;) Also, one minor complaint about Diana Krall. Why does she insist on covering other artist's signature songs (in this case, Bonnie Raitt/Love Me Like a Man, previously Dusty Springfield/Look of Love?) She should be pursuing her own signature songs, such as what she did with &quot;Peel Me a Grape.&quot;
B00005JLD4|5.0|This is a powerful film. I highly recommend it. The young aboriginal girls who star in this moving story are great. DVD includes a special feature documentary of how they went about casting the film.
0792842073|4.0|I watched this movie in my English class (12th grade). It is a very emotional movie - sometimes a little too emotional but in general you can say that it reaches the audience. What I like is that everyone will think about the movie after watching it regardless of his opinion about the death penalty. Dead Man Walking definitely sticks to your memory.<BR>By using flashbacks throughout the movie, Tim Robbins created a  movie that is shifting between reality, imagination and the past history of the plot. The flashbacks are very well used to show the thoughts and impressions that Sister Helen has about Matt. Matthew Poncelet is like a puzzle - the more you see of him during the movie the clearer becomes the image of his character. However, it is left to the viewer whether it comes out to a positive or negative image. <BR>This movie is unique because it shows another kind of `hero' than the usual brutal heroes that are  presented in every other Hollywood movie. <BR>However, there are a few points to critisize about it:<BR>First of all the story is a little bit overloaded with religious elements - especially in the end. This is kind of a black-and-white portrayal of the fact that religion or christianity is the only way to receive redemption.<BR>Another point of criticism are the rather heavy accents of the protagonist that made it almost imposible to understand the movie just by listening to the dialogs. However, I don't want to blame the movie for it - at least not entirely since my problems in understanding could also be a result of my personal inability. ;-)<BR>All in all I recommend this movie since it is extremely famous and you must have seen it!!
0790729628|3.0|Although the sci-fi braintrust has welcomed the Director's Cut with open arams, it has both improved and detracted from, the overall experiences. <br />The added scenes are nice, and the lame ending is eliminated, but the opening narration does leave a big hole in the movie. One screenwriter brought up an excellent point, that we've all heard the narration before, so our mind automatically fills in the blanks when we watch the movie without it. If it had never been present in the theatrical version, Blade Runner's opening would be boring, slow, and confusing to a great many patrons. <br />For that reason, I prefer the Theatrical Version to the Director's Cut, just marginally, though both are pretty good.
B0001LJCMK|3.0|This is one hell of a fun cd.  I would object to anyone comparing this to the wave of retro-sounding garage bands out right now... this is a totally different sound, and even their blues influences show up in a way completely and totally different than anything from the White Stripes or any other Detroit band.  There is something more primitive about this sound, with its fuzzy guitars and purposeful lack of sheen... but when these guys get going, they really groove in a way that few bands can these days.  The cover of Stuck in the Middle (or, Stuck in the Metal, as they call it) is a perfect example of what this cd is about... its a totally unnecessary cover of a great song... and they don't really play it all that differently... but something about it just sounds right and just like the rest of this cd, theres something about it that'll make you want to get up and move around and let loose.<br />Be warned that this sounds pretty much nothing like Queens of the Stone Age... but I do highly recommend it.  Its different in a refreshing, fun way.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This film seriously had me thinking afterwards...<BR>Jake Gyllenhaal was phenominal, along with the fact that the creative and well-made script and cinematography.<br />It was scary, dark, depressing, funny...overall bittersweet, but it really strikes a cord in you when you after you see things unravel at the end.<br />If you like to watch interesting films and not the typical romantic comedy or action flick, you'll love this movie!
B000000OSE|5.0|While not being as straightfowardly rock as Appetite, Use Your Illusion I shows that it can just as well be a metal classic. It would be a little hard to believe this is the same band, they changed so drastically. Axl's voice is different, the approach is less punky and outraged and more bluesy. But don't get me wrong. This is still a heavy metal album. On a lot of the songs, the band rocks out and sounds just as heavy and immature as they did circa 1988. The sole fly in the ointment is the rather weak ballad, Don't Cry. Even though it was an enourmous chart hit, it still sounds to me a little weak. Excluding Don't Cry, youv'e got yourself a great metal album.
B00003CX5P|5.0|The most eagerly-awaited prequel in movie history, &quot;Episode I:  The Phantom Menace&quot; carried so many false hopes into theatres many were bound to be disappointed.  But the problem isn't with the movie itself, which is first-rate.  There were just too many people who had their own ideas of what the first new Star Wars film in nearly a generation should be like for creator George Lucas to possibly satisfy.  Sadly, those persons' negative reviews have somewhat marred an otherwise phenomenal blockbuster, which by any well-reasoned definition is a highly worthy extension of the beloved Star Wars mythos.<br />Even the film's critics agree that this movie looks spectacular.  Lucas spared no expense in the set design and special effects, and the result is simply magical.  From the iconic architecture of the planet Naboo to the wastes of Tatooine and the cold reaches of space, everything shimmers with life and you almost feel like you could walk right into the story yourself. Beyond that, the story itself is excellent and in line with the familiar Star Wars formula of good vs. evil on an interplanetary scale.  Likewise, the cast is terrific and does a tremendous job.  Liam Neeson is an commanding Qui-Gon Jinn who dominates every scene he is in, and Ewan McGregor is also excellent as the young Obi-Wan Kenobi just growing into his full power but clearly destined to be one of the greatest Jedi of all.  Natalie Portman's Padme is appealing and believable, and Jake Lloyd is surprisingly effective as the ill-fated Anakin Skywalker.  Ian McDiarmid lends a sinister air as the shadowy Senator Palpatine, whose suave elegance barely conceals his true dark nature.  <br />Yes, there is Jar Jar Binks, and while Jar Jar does occasionally strike a funny note he is more often annoying.  And young Mr. Lloyd does have to utter some rather painful lines from time to time.  But these minor flaws hardly hinder the overall drama, which is quite strong.  Particularly moving is Anakin's final dialogue with his mother, when he stands at the crossroads of his destiny and realizes that once he chooses which path to take, he can never look back. Of course there is also the famous pod race, a deadly race against fate that shoots across the Tatooine desert like lightning. The masterful extended climax (divided amongst no less than four different battles)is incredibly exciting.  Here young Anakin foreshadows Luke Skywalker's later Death Star heroics, and Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan face the diabolical Darth Maul in an incredible display of lightsaber wizardry.  <br />No review of this film would be complete without mention of John Williams's usual fantastic score.  The soundtrack is magnificent, one of the most thrilling any movie has ever had, and it should've been used a bit more liberally in &quot;Attack of the Clones.&quot;<br />Not only is the movie great, but the DVD is something special too.  There are tons of special features that are sure to enhance what should be an already awesome viewing experience.<br />Overall, most of the negative press this movie got was undeserved.  The characters are strong, the action unceasing, and the final product is nothing less than sensational.  If it's not quite as good as the original Star Wars films, &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; nonetheless recaptures the spirit of those immortal movies and opens a brand new door to wonder and fantasy.  Don't be afraid...come on in!
B000063DIR|1.0|Do not buy this CD! It is not the original! It has been re-recorded! This is a terrible offense to all Ozzy fans and music fans in general. Reissuing albums like this should not be allowed and should not be tolerated. Demand that the original albums be put back in print!
B000092Q8K|5.0|After so many years and only two albums since then, Peter Gabriel's artistic and commercial pinnacle \\"So\\" remains my favorite album of his on so many levels.<br />Many seem to have labeled this album as a sellout album but those people couldn't be more wrong on that. This album is miles away from being a sellout and almost more like someone who has found his place at home. This album to me is the best example of how an artist can actually go pop, if you can call it that, but actually benefit both artistically and commercially. This album has a much earthier and much easier style to digest than his previous two albums especially his third album from 1980. It is also his most accessible album of his entire career although not necessarily his happiest album even though his most joyful and happiest songs are on here. The only really bright and sunny songs on here are \\"Sledgehammer\\" and \\"Big Time\\" but we've heard them many times so there's no need to go into them.<br /> Most of these songs have now made it onto the \\"Shaking The Tree\\" and \\"Hit\\" collections but with the exceptions of \\"Red Rain\\" and \\"Big Time\\", they are butchered which doesn't work too well for them and thus the originals are much better. \\"Red Rain\\" is the best track on this album. For such a straight-out popular track \\"Red Rain\\" completely throws all of it's peers right into the trash can. The song is a powerful, passionate wash of synthesizers, deep melody, intense mood and a very dramatic backdrop bringing to mind images of a massive rainstorm and the sun breaking out when the song ends. To me, this song is commercial pop at it's absolute best. No one has made popular music sound so good. \\"Don't Give Up\\" is one of the most encouraging songs that I've ever listened to. Having been going through some very emotionally turbulent times recently, this song has great meaning to me. \\"That Voice Again\\" is one of the most unique sounding songs ever done, especially by 1986 standards. I really love the lyrics too plus the really unique chord changes too. I still get some chills when listening to this track.<br /> \\"In Your Eyes\\" is one of the best love songs Gabriel has ever composed and remains so to this day. I have a lot of fond memories of hearing this track a lot back during my childhood and today it's still one of my favorite songs of his. It's an absolutely amazing song with amazing keyboards and showcases the increasing African influence which has been a part of Gabriel's music for a long time even by this point and towards the ending features Senegalese singer Youssou N'Dour. In certain ways, it's nice that this track, being at the ending ends the album on a positive note but it just feels weird being at the end. I liked it much better in the middle but that's just my opinion.<br /> \\"Mercy Street\\" is arguably one of the sexiest songs that has ever been written. Forget \\"Sledgehammer\\" MS is the best sex-song ever written even if it's not explicit at all. The song is a very hauntingly beautiful quiet storm-like track with a very dark but calm atmosphere and really amazing lyrics. The song is a tribute to the late Anne Sexton and the song is a masterpiece. I'll never forget listening to this song once during a walk many years ago.<br /><br /> There are two mysterious tracks that truly are just exquisite. \\"We Do What We're Told\\" spooked the daylights out of me when first listening to it. The song is a ghostly track with a dark and damp kind of \\"Birdy\\" like atmosphere like as if one were walking on the streets on a damp foggy night by the blue-white streetlights and then seeing spirits drifting overhead. This song evokes such images especially with the distant chorus singing \\"We Do What We're Told\\" and the song growing more dramatic and intense. Peter Gabriel's lines when they come in are just haunting and amazing. \\"This Is The Picture\\" also as \\"Excellent Birds\\" is a very odd and peculiar track with a slightly industrial sound and an eerie feel. In some ways, this song hasa lot of the sounds that would've come from the \\"Birdy\\" soundtrack and in fact could've fit on that soundtrack too.<br /> The remastered edition of this album cuts both ways in my opinion. The sound quality of the original older CD edition was already great to begin with especially for an album recorded in the mid 1980s but this remastered edition makes it sound even better and much better detailed too. For the SACD edition though, you need a CD player that can play SACDs because if you don't then it won't work. If you don't have one though, the regular remastered edition will do just fine. The downside unfortunately to this re-issued edition is that I for one wasn't too thrilled with \\"In Your Eyes\\" being moved to the last track position. I feel that I'm in the minority on this but I enjoyed this album ending on a mysterious note with \\"We Do What We're Told\\" and \\"This Is The Picture\\" both of which are eerie and haunting reminiscent of the darkness of \\"Birdy\\". WDWWT I feel really suffers from the track re-shuffling. This song in its new position robs this chilling classic of much of it's power. I enjoyed it in it's original position. While I take back my old comment about not wasting one's time on this remastered edition, I would NOT recommend throwing the old edition out for the two mysterious tracks I mentioned really are the best as the closer songs on this album. At the same time though, I can now appreciate the new track listing even though the original listing remains superior in my opinion.<br /> Aside from the blunder done with the re-issuing, \\"So\\" is one of the greatest albums that has ever been put out and deserves a place in any true music fans collection. No one has ever toyed with pop music in such a sophisticated style the way Gabriel did on here.s a lot of the sounds that would've come from the \\"Birdy\\" soundtrack and in fact could've fit on that soundtrack too. <br /> The remastered edition of this album cuts both ways in my opinion.

B000003TA4|1.0|I have always heard that Kurt Cobain was a genius with music. I ask, what did he do that was so great? I borrowed this album from a friend because he said it was a great album and that Kurt Cobain was the man blah blah blah. To me this is nothing but junk. The music is nothing spectacular and the lyrics aren't the greatest. Maybe it's just not my taste but i really don't like this album. But, to each his own i guess. Now a real musical genius is Chuck Schuldiner(R.I.P) from Death.
B0001Z53CY|5.0|This is the follow up to &quot;Devil's Night.&quot;  In my opinion it's not as good but all rap fans will still like it.  The best songs are &quot;Get My Gun&quot; &quot;How Come&quot; and &quot;6 in the Morning.&quot;  The worst song is &quot;D12 World.&quot;  I suggest that all rap fans buy this album, trust me you'll like it.
B000002HMH|1.0|Metallica's first 4 albums are the best (ahhh the good old '80s). Forget anything that came after it - I believe drinking too much alcohol has killed most of their brain cells.

0385335482|5.0|I loved this Shopaholic book. It was really great. Rebecca (Becky) Bloomwood is a finacial journalist for a mediocer company in London. She doesn't like the job because it is boring and would actually rather be out shopping. This leads to her downfall. She owes everybody lots of money 6,000 pounds to be exact and does not know what to do. Then one day she does some shopping and finds out that her cards have been cancelled because she has not paid them off. She then goes into hiding at her parents house outside of London where she tells them that she is being stocked.

B000001FS6|5.0|More often than not, you can only tell what kind of band you are listening to by seeing them in concert or by listening to a live recording.  Rattle and Hum is a recording of various concerts in the same tour of U2 in the 80's just after the Joshua Tree.  the energy is incredable!  <BR>The first track starts out with the cheering of the croud.  Then you hear Bono say &quot;This is the song Charles Manson stole from the Beatles...we're stealing it back.&quot; And then Edge plays the opening riffs to Helter Skelter.  The hole album is an experiance.  If you are a new comer looking for a good taste of U2, or an old fan looking for somthing classic, but unique- this is the album you've been praying for!  &quot;F*ck the revolution!&quot;~Bono
B00005V0X5|5.0|this is a great thing,  this is a real remastered<br />you can hear all thing very  clear, dave vocal is full of emotion , the riff are crayy , also the solos, bassline and the drumming<br />wht a great debut album<br />these boots was edited on this album but you get 3 bonus track , the demo from this album which sounds raw &amp; awesome
B000088E6D|5.0|This c.d. as well as Michael's new d.v.d. has brought me hours upon hours of enjoyment.  He is the best voice to come out in 20 years, a true crooner, with a voice that will give his audience goosebumps on goosebumps.  This boy never hits anything but perfect notes, with perfect pitch.  Not anyone with an ear for music, a beautiful voice, and wonderful songs will give this c.d. anything but the perfect score it deserves.  I recommend this disc to anyone from the ages of 5 to 95.  Just a incredible adventure to be enjoyed by all.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I got hooked on this show about a year ago and have loved it ever since. I'm so glad they released season one so I can finally catch up with what all I have missed. Lauren Graham is tremendous as Lorelai and the way she interacts with her daughter is a treat. Growing up while being the child of a single parent, I respect the way that Lorelai treats Rory and the maturity involved in their relationship. Some may complin that the dialogue is a bit &quot;wordy&quot; or developed, but I say that Stars Hollow resembles a typical New England town where intelligence is the common. Special shout goes out to Sally Struthers as Babette (so sad when her cat dies) and Carole King who sings the opening theme (and later appears as a music store owner).
B0001IN07Q|5.0|Loved the way this d.v.d. was shot, edited, and recorded. I do not agree with others who did not understand what Michael was trying to let us see.  It showed us a little of himself, his band, and his amazing showmanship and voice.  I say it is the most enjoyable hour that I have spent in so long.  I watch it at least once a week to get my Michael fix...What a wonderful breath of fresh air and I dare anyone to find one boring moment of this exciting and entertaining disc.  Way to go Michael, you just keet getting better and better.  We love this and everything you will bring to us in the future.  You never stop amazing all your fans,  New and old,  <BR>Good for You....
0790732254|5.0|I've only got a few things to say about this movie:  BEAUTIFULLY ACTED, AMAZINGLY CRAFTED &amp; DON'T EXPECT TO BE HAPPY AFTER SEEING IT!!!<br />This movie is amazing in every sense.  The script is fabulous and the actors couldn't have done anything better with this movie.  Liz Taylor was absolutely &quot;the limit&quot; with this role - her best one ever.  Richard Burton was marvelous, too - he played the downtrodden husband better than anyone could hope for.<br />The basic guts of this movie are that Liz and Richard invite a young couple over to have dinner and drinks but PLAY WITH THEIR MINDS throughout the entire show.  You have to watch the movie to understand the level of this ugly game that they are imposing on their guests.  To put it plainly, this movie is a mind f***.<br />Beware ye, all extremely sensitive viewers, you may watch this movie and be depressed for a few days straight!  That's not a joke - it has a tremendous effect on all who watch it.<br />This movie should be seen just for the fabulous performances of the actors.  See it and be depressed, weep, WHATEVER!!!

0800141865|5.0|\\"The People Vs. Larry Flint\\" is one of the most controversial releases of 1996, starring Woody Harrelson, Edward Norton, and Courtney Love.  It earned two Oscar nominations and two Golden Globe wins.  This real-life film wonderfully desplicts Larry Flint's struggle to publish \\"Hustler\\", a sexually explicit magazine.  He risks his freedom to prove that the bans violate the First Amendment on the US Bill of Rights, which is freedom of speech.  Through every step, he causes tremendous controversy throughout the country.  Some love him, some hate him.  Either way, nobody can get enough of him.  The plot is brilliant.  The daring material expressed deserves tremendous respect for doing what few writers have dared.  The climatic story keeps audiences interested in every scene, always wondering what Flint will say or do next.  The unexpected events keep the energy intact.  His eccentric behavior adds a more interesting flavor to the film.<br />Woody Harrelson and Courtney Love prove that they were made for their roles.  Harrelson's Oscar nominated performance as Larry Flint is the best in his career.  Nobody else could have played Flint better.  Love makes a triumphant film debut in her Golden Globe nominated role as Athena, Flint's wife.  Her erratic behavior is wonderfully displayed through every scene.  Athena's life struggles are beautifully expressed.  Edward Norton's role as Flint's lawyer is beautifully performed.  All other performers also acted their roles wonderfully.<br />\\"The People Vs. Larry Flint\\" is a great film for those looking for something risque.  This is sure to please audiences of all kinds.
B000068QZK|5.0|This album is one of, if not the best album ozzy has ever released, I mean, this is awesome.<br />Miracle Man-Probably my favorite Ozzy song ever, if not tied with &quot;Mr. Tinkertrain&quot; Guitar riff is awesome(I can play it!!!) and the lyrics kick @$$. 10/10<br />Devil's Daughter-The tune is kinda fudged up, the way ozzy sings the verses is a little weird, but it's good... 8/10<br />Crazy Babies-Riff and all of the song EXCEPT the walk that walk part are pretty cool. 9/10<br />Breaking all the Rules-Awesome! Heavy track... the guitar is really good on this one. 10/10<br />Bloodbath in Paradise-Cool. Creepy. About the Manson family. &quot;Helter skelter, spiral madness&quot; 9.5/10<br />Fire in the Sky-Not as good as &quot;Killer of Giants,&quot; &quot;Goodbye to Romance,&quot; or the best balled ever &quot;Road to Nowhere,&quot; but this song is alright. 8/10<br />Tatooed Dancer-Sweet song. Cool lyrics. 8.5/10<br />Demon Alcohol-Not such a cool song, but still a good track. 7/10<br />Hero-Pretty good song overall... i'm not too crazy about it. 8/10<br />*The Liar-Alright song... again not too crazy about it. 7.5/10<br />*Miracle Man(Live)-What the f***? This live version of one of the greatest songs ever SUCKS. The one on Live &amp; Loud is better. 2/10<br />So overall this is a great album. A few weak points, but still great. This would've gotten 4 stars, but Miracle Man(NOT the live version bonus track) gave it the extra star.
B00004Z459|5.0|When I heard the first sngs from Linkin Park, it didn't really appeal to me, but it grow an me, and now I listen to it most of the time. It is a really good cd.
B00003CXXS|5.0|Jurassic Park 3 one of the big summer blockbusters out of 2001 next to &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;.<BR>This has been the third in the Trilogy of Jurassic Park, no other sequels have been made since the first hit from Michael Crichton and Steven Spielberg so it seems that they ride might over for JP fans. This film again uses the same elements of cgi animation and several of the same models of Dinosaurs from the other installments. However new<BR>new dinosaurs are introduced and the writers changed the characters around in this one<BR>to add a bit of tension and suspense that works throughtout the whole movie.<br />Dr. Grant (Sam Niel), who in the first movie acts as a moral, and<BR>ethical scientist in the first movie, is a hypocrital,<BR>contradicting scientist in this one.<br />At first, Dr. Grant, rejects any offers to study Dinosaurs saying that his previous experience in<BR>Jurassic Park has annoyed from doing any other research.<BR>However, when Mr. Brimley (William H. Macy) offers to<BR>pay millions of dollars just to have Mr. Grant's presence and insight into the Dinosaurs of Lor Sorna,<BR>Grant has no problem signing over himself to the project.<br />He definitely is more interested in the financial and egotistical benefits of the project, than the actual<BR>scientist benefits of the project.<br />The cool thing about the Jurassic Park movies, is that<BR>you don't have to watch every movie, to find out what's going on.<br />Since the stories are basically the same in every movie,<BR>you can watch and be entertained by each movie, without<BR>being concerned about the plot.<br />The plot in this case, is that once again more genetic<BR>research in Dinosaurs has led to a creation of dinosaurs<BR>on Lor Sorna in Costa Rica.<br />Then a group of scientists, interested in the Dinosaurs<BR>wants to come down to Lor Sorna to &quot;study&quot; the dinosaurs.<br />The movie starts with a lecture being conducted by Dr. Grant (Sam Neil) who was in the first Jurassic Park.<br />Dr. Grant finds out that new research in genetic testing<BR>has led to new dinosaurs being bred in Lor Sorna in<BR>Costa Rica.<br />Grant eventually receives offers to study the dinosaurs<BR>but rejects all of them, saying that he has enough of<BR>dinosaurs (he almost died in the first movie).<br />However, a rich, entreprenual married couple is about to change that.<br />They eventually offer Dr. Grant millions of dollars to have his presence in a special trip that the couple plan to make to this new Jurassic Park.<br />However, all their plans are about to go amok, as the<BR>group of scientists, run into a bunch of dinosaurs, more<BR>deadly, more intelligent, and more scarier that<BR>the first dinosaurs in Jurassic Park........<br />Jurassic Park 3 has probably the best special effects<BR>I've seen in a dinosaur movie. Partially inspired<BR>by movies like &quot;King Kong&quot; and &quot;Godzilla&quot; the special<BR>effects team of Industrial Light and Magic and Stan<BR>Winston, once again, bring this monstrous creatures<BR>to life in all their glory.<br />JP3 also offers a ton of suspense and thrills.<br />There a bunch of new Dinosaurs in the movie.<BR>The Spinosaurs, who can attack in both land and sea<BR>is terrifying.<br />Also Director Joe Johnston, managed to add new life into the series by making the Dinosaurs smarter than ever.<BR>The dinosaurs now &quot;call&quot; to one another, when they<BR>see a prey they want to kill. The dinosaurs can now also use their brain to corner and attack, their prey in many new ways.<br />The scene in the lab, in which a dinosaurs corners their next victim is a great example of that.<BR>However, despite this JP3 is a fantastic achievement by<BR>ILM and Universal.<br />I was amazed by the features on the DVD version of Jurassic Park III:<br />*You get a special tour of ILM with Stan Winston<BR>*Trailer of the movie<BR>* Special interview with Paleontologist Jack Horner<BR>and much more like many featurettes on the making of hte film<br />Highly recommend film.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This CD is amazing...she just keeps getting better and better.  Her vocals do seem a little weaker...but she still breaks out with some amazing beats that get stuck in your head...in a good way.  What is great is that each song is so different and unique.  I love this album!  I've been a fan since Baby one more time and i think she continues to improve and make great music.  This album is by far her best...and i recommend it to anyone who likes music with a strong beat or if you like to dance.
B00006F7IM|4.0|This is more a nostalgia note than a review, but most of this movie was filmed over one summer in Milwaukee (maybe Cleveland wasn't blue-collar enough). All the baseball action scenes were filmed in County Stadium, which is now a big parking lot for Miller Park. The crew invited locals to the filming at the Stadium and other locations about town, so it has a lot of local flavor. I went to the  filming of the big finale to be part of the &quot;rabid&quot; crowd so I'm in this move, kind of. It's fun to see Uecker do his stuff, and Pete Vukovich, a former Brewer pitcher, is perfect as Heywood, the Yankee nemesis.<br />People from out of town said County Stadium was a dog of a ballyard, but look for the scene when Berenger sneaks onto the field at night alone and pretends to hit one out. It sure looks pretty, and I miss it.
6305232660|5.0|Okay if you have to do a comparison between these two movies which one had the more unbelievable story?  A bunch of drunken oil refiners going into space to drill an asteroid to save the world or, actual astranauts going into space to blow one up?  Come on people.  Overall this movie has most of what is needed to make a great movie.  Fanstatic actors (Morgan Freeman is great as the president), great effects of the east coast being destroyed again (what movie doesnt destroy the east coast of the US in one way or another), Great feelings of humanity which is so badly lacking in most disaster flicks.  I mean who cares if the world blows up if there are no characters to sympathise with? (Aka Independance day, Armageddon, The Night of the Comet... so many to list here).  Dont be so harsh on this movie until you see the rest of the trash that is out there.  By comparison, this movie shines and I do highly recommend it.
0316666343|3.0|I too was very interested in reading this book. Both because I liked the story idea and because I had heard so much about it. As the book begins, we are told that 14-year old Susie Salmon has been murdered. We are told this by Susie herself who narrated the entire story from Heaven. In Heaven, Susie follows the lives of her grieving family, her friend on Earth, and the life of the man who killed her. We follow her as she sees her dad try and track down her killer. We see her younger sister, Lindsey, cope with her lose. And we see her Mother withdraw from life. All this is very &quot;Lifetime&quot; movie-ish and maybe if I was a woman I could connect with the story more. But to me, the story itself and its conclusion just didn't satisfy. I guess I was looking more for a mystery/thriller/revenge story that a mushy &quot;made for TV movie&quot; sort of story. Sebold is a great writer, so the book has that going for it, but I would have liked to see this story idea written by someone like Stephen King. I think he would have given this story some balls!!
B000000OYQ|1.0|The issue with respect to Page's Outrider album is not whether it sounds like LZ, but whether it's any good on its own. Which, sorry to say, it generally is not. Aside from one or two good cuts, it's largely unlistenable. God knows I've tried. One keeps thinking -- is is really this bad? And the same answer comes back every time -- yep. 'tis. There's a reason it's selling for $1.58 in Amazon's used bin. Let me make an analogy. When I was in grade school, they used to make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with butter on them. Gross. Why ruin a perfectly good sandwich? Dunno. Why did Page put out this cd when he so clearly is capable of great playing? Dunno. It's inexplicable.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|I didn't get to see this movie at Christmas which may have made the viewing that bit more special, but I was not disappointed at waiting. A veritable &quot;who's who&quot; of well known stars grace a collection of short stories, in funny, romantic, sad, and heartwarming scenarios, and the end result, though a bit muddled is cleverly handled. A real testament to the success of this movie after it's release was how well it was received here in the States, for being a fairly formula laden Richard Curtis written &amp; directed production. Some of the stories do stretch the boundaries of credulity a little, but the flavor of the Christmas magic allows even the most cynical viewers to be forgiving. The performances are ALL great, as seemingly the entire range of human emotions are played out before you in each individual tale, culminating in a clever, and touching set of finales. Some of the language will make this unsuitable for younger viewers, but good family viewing overall. Often very touching but never sickly sweet, this is a great DVD buy, and will be surely pulled out every holiday season, along with the host of other well known seasonal regulars. Enjoy
B0001BKAEY|4.0|Why do the critics downplay the Matrix trilogy. I do admit that while watching the second and third parts, it did seem tedious and I was waiting for the real action but after watching it a few times and understanding the endings, I must say it was really a great series. Why does everyone have to bash it? It had some great action scenes, and if you pay attention the story is very interesting. Watch it a few more times, and trust me, you'll appreciate it much more.
B000002UDB|1.0|The three number one singles that anchor this burst of brilliance can be obtained on Beatles 1, enabling the listener to avoid the likes of Flying, Blue Jay Way, Your Mother Should Know, and on and on....
B00005JMX4|4.0|THIS IS A GOOD TEEN MOVIE THAT JUST GOT A BAD WRAP<BR>FROM THE MOVIE CRITICS.  TAKE A LOOK FOR YOURSELF.<BR>IT'S NOT AN OSCAR CALIVER MOVIE, BUT ELISHA<BR>CUTHBERT'S PERFORMANCE IS TO BE NOTICED.
B000065VA1|5.0|i was in my late teens when this album came out in 1986. i basically played it to death eventually needing to purchase a new cassette as my other one gave up the ghost through repeated plays. it is lucky i didnt have it on vinyl as i would have needed a new stylus as well! gabby's vocal on the opening cut, red rain is fantastic as is the music that accompanies the album opener. miss bush, who is a legend in her own right is great on dont give up giving the song an extra talented vocal bonus. for some reason the remastered version of this disc has shifted in your eyes from 5th to last track on the album moving the eerie mercy street for anne sexton up the pecking order but it makes no difference to the quality of music on this 80's stalwart. overall a masterpiece but it would have been great to have any extra cuts that didnt make it on to the final release added to the remastered edition. they must be saving them for an expensive boxset which i will end up buying anyway so it makes no difference to me anyway.
B00005JMEW|4.0|This movie looks incredible.  The action sequences are top-notch.  There are lots of impressive stunts and swordfights captured with expert cinematography.  Kill Bill is absolutey dripping with style.  The problem is, this Tarantino picture comes across a lot more self-conscious than his previous films.  It's like when someone can't tell a joke because they're so caught up in how clever they are.  Also absent are his snappy dialogue and his usual command of non-linear storytelling.  This dialogue is often hokey and cloddish.  He does do the non-linear thing again, but this time it's lop-sided.  It doesn't flow as seamlessly as I expect a Tarantino script to flow.<br />Now, the good stuff; did I mention that the film looks good?  \\"Slick\\" does not even begin to describe the look of this movie.  The last fight sequence in which Uma Thurman's character battles at least 100 men and women, is really a lot of fun.  If you are a fan of splatter movies or kung fu movies or especially splatter/kung fu movies, you will want to see this movie for this scene if nothing else.<br />The four stars are for the eye-candy.  As far as characters or story, this is not Tarantino's best film.  <br />People talk about how derivitive this movie is, and rightly so.  No one ever mentions how much he has been influenced by Miike.  I hate to say it, but if you want to watch a real samurai flick with lots of arterial spray and humor and interesting characters, watch Dead or Alive or Ichi the Killer.  Then watch Kill Bill again with a fresh perspective.
B000002MU3|5.0|for many years now i have never taken any notice of what other people thought of the music i like. this album is brilliant. in the same vein as U2's achtung baby you are hit right between the eyes by a wall of sound from start to end. the opening track, &quot;kenneth&quot; is fantastic and it's a shame it only went for 4 minutes. but my favourite cut from the album would have to be track 10 &quot;let me in&quot; with its absolutely trashy guitar playing and demented church organ keyboards which help finish the track off. if you do not own this album then you should be ashamed of yourself especially if you class yourself as an REM fan. but what would i know? it needs to be remastered and have any leftover session cuts added to it to make real appreciators of REM's quality music very very happy. the only other quality american bands there have been are the cars and the talking heads so i recommend anyone who is thinking of buying this album to do so immediately. thakyou for reading my &quot;expert analysis&quot; of monster.
B000148KK2|5.0|Why are some people so dissappointed when a musician tries to stretch and grow.  Diana Krall doesn't dissapoint in her new CD.  Great covers of jazz and pop songs-Temptation, Stop This World, Black Crow-Diana does Joni Mitchell better than Joni!  Plus she and husband Elvis Costello add some great new original compositions-Departure Bay and Narrow Daylight are two of the best.  I loved the &quot;old&quot; Diana doing covers of jazz standards-I love the &quot;New&quot; Diana adding original compositons to the mix.  5 stars!
B000002H33|5.0|This is simply one of the best Heavy Metal albuns ever recorded, along with their own ...And Justice For All, both DOWN albuns, Panteras &quot;TGSTK&quot;, Megadeths &quot;So Far So Good So What&quot; and &quot;Rust In Peace&quot; and Slayers &quot;Reign in Blood&quot;. Long Live Metallica!!
0060591706|3.0|A pesar de las crticas realizadas hacia este libro, no encuentro razn para dar una resea en la cual mate por completo el inters del lector hacia este, ya que es un libro que cumple lo que se necesita en un escrito de aventuras, osea que, este libro posee una historia entretenida, audaz y con muchos acertijos que hacen que en ocaciones el lector pueda predecir el desenlace, tal es el caso con lo de la Especialista que para los que ya la leyeron, me imagino que supusieron quin era, pero al final el libro si se parece mucho a una pelcula de suspenso tipo Hollywood y deja enseanzas lejanas a un libro de pensamientos profundos, pero vuelvo a repetir, este libro no es aburrido solo predecible y vale la pena darle una leda, al final siempre es bueno leer, y este libro es sencillo y rpido de digerir y terminar, es un libro de atencin promedio.
B0001GOH6Q|3.0|I enjoyed the movie very much right up until the contrived narrated ending. I was touched by the scene of the son himself finally reconciling with his dying father by helping his father create the father's 'final story'.  That was very good and that idea ~could have been~ the 'closer'.  The scene of all the people from the father's stories showing up at the funeral to prove they were indeed real was okay but left the film little place to go for an ending. <br />Those people should have shown up visiting the father at the hospital BEFORE the father-son bed side death scene. They could have intereacted with the son and bolstered his enlightenment.  After that, with the son telling the 'final story' as his father dies, the script could have broken directly into to a final fantasized ending scene that WAS the son telling his father's last story showing his resting place in the river as a big fish.   <br />I was expecting one final 'whopper' like that ... but was given a guppy instead.
B000002BFZ|5.0|No Code came at a interesting time PJ's career, on the heels on the highly experimental Vitalogy, No Code comes off as the meloed out little brother, tracks such as &quot;Sometimes&quot; and &quot;Off He Goes&quot; and &quot;Around The Bend&quot; are the type of songs you would love to listen to when your unwinding, coupled with Eddie Vedders dynamic lyrics, makes No Code a album unlike any other PJ effort (But does any of their albums sound like its predecesor anyway???). But it still rocks in some spots, the 1:02 long earshreader &quot;Lukin&quot; and the bluesy 60ish rocker &quot;Red Mosquito&quot; are definately worth the time. No Code is a must have for all PJ fans, and for that matter anyone, this album shows the depth of Pearl Jam's talent, evedence by the fact that their are no radio staples on this album, by that fact alone you should get this album and find out why radio and pop music is truley void of meaning.
B00005JKN9|2.0|I was disappointed by this movie. Scorsese is one of the best American directors alive, and the story of New York City in the 1860s is a great subject, exactly the sort of thing Scorsese ought to excel at. <br />But the whole project goes weirdly awry. The plot is trite and silly, the sort of boring revenge drama we've seen a hundred times before: It doesn't shed any light at all on the subject of New York in the 19th century. The cast is extremely uneven: Di Caprio is simply not credible as a prison-hardened gang leader (he's still a soft, spoiled, 20th century pipsqueak), Day-Lewis as the villain is so over-the-top he's funny (maybe he meant it to be that way?), and the great Liam Neeson is wasted (literally) in a brief appearance as Di Caprio's dad. Only the smaller roles are well cast, particularly Jim Broadbent as Boss Tweed. (And by the way, what was the Vampire Woman doing in the movie? She seems to have wandered in from the set of Road Warrior.)<br />Worst of all, though, was the tone of the movie. It was completely off. From the acid-rock electric guitar solo that plays over the big fight scene at the beginning, to the pointlessly flashy visuals (it looked like Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge), to the ridiculous mischaracterization of race relations between Irish immigrant gangs and the blacks, to the offensive use of the Draft Riots (really a huge race riot) as mere background to a phony, anti-climactic duel between protagonist and antagonist--everything was just so weirdly conceived and utterly tone deaf.<br />What went wrong? Scorsese seemed like the perfect choice to direct this movie, but he blew a great opportunity to tell a great story. Maybe he has no feel for any time period other than his own. What a shame.
B000002BYD|5.0|&quot;Who's got the Brain of JFK, what does it mean to us now&quot; the first line from the opening track &quot;Brain of J&quot;, lets you know right off where Ed is going to take you to in this album, lyrically &quot;Yield&quot; is the strongest in the Pearl Jam catalog. Also another track in the album &quot;Do The Evolution&quot; looks at human evolution to the great inventions of out time to money sucking greed mongrels &quot;Im a theif, Im a liar, theres my church I Sing In the choir&quot;. Also Ed looks to his own superstardom, and longs for simplar elements to his being &quot;I wish i was a full moon shining from a camaros hood&quot;. Musicall Stone Gossard, Jeff Ament, Mike McCready and Matt Cameron present a deep, musical journey, rich with great bass and guitar work, and deep brooding drums, best exibited by &quot;Faithfull&quot;. the swirling smooth guitars of Gossard and McCready, pitted with Cameron's dynamic drumming, combined with Aments driving bass sums up this albums integrity. Yield is the best of the PJ Catalog and truley worthy of this crown.
B0000019PA|5.0|Everyone I've played this album to has either loved it (and I mean LOVED it) or dismissed it (&quot;Three chords and a whine&quot; is the quickest dismissal I've heard). It sounds sorta like the Mountain Goats jamming with the Zombies but more like the articulation of a series of dreams.<BR>Jeff Magnum throws away lines like &quot;Your father made fetuses with flesh-licking ladies while you and your mother were asleep in the trailer park&quot; as if he were reading from a phone-book with a tab printed over the names and addresses. There has never been a better use of horns and fuzz guitars together on an album. <BR>This is an indie 'Pet Sounds': it sounds precious and holy and all that, you know? If something has lead you to read this, you will like the album. Chances are, you'll love it. I mean, have you ever seen so much impotent hyberpole used to describe anything this side of 1977?<BR>Believe the hype; for your own good, believe the hype.
0920668364|5.0|Love you forever is one of the most special children books that I have read.  <BR>I remember hearing it when I was a youngster and telling myself that if I had a little boy that I would read it to him.  <br />Now as a new parent to a little dark haired boy I feel that it is a special book for him and I to share.  He loves the colorful pictures, and the special ending and the message it shares with youngsters.  <br />This is truly a masterpiece!
B000006OBQ|5.0|I've been a Sinatra fan since my early 20's (about fifteen years now) and I've searched far and wide for an album that compares to this one.  I haven't found one yet.  Whether you are a big Frank Sintra fan or you just want to have a collection that includes The Chairman (everyone should own at least one Frank CD) this album is a must.  While I don't love every song on this, there are many songs that are just breathtakingly splendid to make this an 5 Star CD.  Sinatra, who was 50 when this was recorded was at the top of his game.  Songs like &quot;Come fly with me&quot; and &quot;In other words&quot; are simply incredible.  Every time I listen to this it puts me in a good mood.<br />This album takes you back and gives you an idea just how special it must have been to be in the audience back in 1966.  I shouldn't forget Count Basie and his band as a part of this album.  They, and Quincy Jones make it great just as Sinatra does.  I would say this album is a must for almost anybody's collection.  You will love it.
B00005JN02|5.0|As a Tulsan living in Germany who has experienced Germany before and after the breach of the Berlin wall, I naturally wanted my friends and family to see this great film so they could get a taste of east/west pathos, love and laughter.<BR>What a pity this wildly popular, blockbuster film (over here at least) remains amazingly obscure in the US. \\"Sonnenalle\\" (\\"Sun Alley\\"), another east/west German classic, is another case in point.<BR>Germany gets a steady diet of our new and old, best and worst movies. What I can't get over is the apparent lack of US interest in post-WW2 Germany. <BR>What a pity that the two DVD systems don't allow me to simply bring DVDs over to show my friends and family. I know they would appreciate these films as much as the other Americans who have seem them over here.<BR>Waiting....
B0000048CX|5.0|This album and YLT's &quot;I Can Hear...&quot; are probably two of the best albums of the 1990s.  For new listeners of YLT, this is an excellent companion to &quot;I Can Hear...,&quot; both albums encapsulate the scope and skill of YLT at their best:  at one end, a music collector/critic's charming collection of musical americana spanning cheesy rock, folksy hoaxes, and good old fashioned crooning and melody, at the other, the fine tuning of guitar feedback rock and genre bending, both albums elegantly and intelligently executed.  Very accessible, the quirkiness and skill of the songs elevate the material above mere easy listening.  Who couldn't love Speeding Motorcycle?
B0001IN07Q|1.0|Good voice, great songs, but, man, this guy is in love with himself.  What a narcisistic exercise.  Does someone carry a mirror beside him all day so he can gaze upon his own greatness?  Hello, it's the music, Michael.  The DVD portion continues an annoying trend in concert productions, where an edit seems to take place every 2 seconds.  It would be nice if a shot lasted long enough so that the viewer can take in the scene.  All the jumping around detracts from the music and induces a headache.  Most everything else is Michael yammering on about how great he is and how all women? adore him.  That and a bunch of other disingenuous clap trap nonsense that rates mighty high on the barfometer.  Just sing a straight song and throw back a bourbon, kid.
0553583182|5.0|This is the first book by Joseph Murphy that I read. Since then, I have gone on to read many of his books. I am not easily impressed by positive thinking books. Many of them appeal to other readers but are not sensible enough for my taste. Joseph Murphy's books are practical and straight-forward. His nondenominational approach is very refreshing and scientific. The Power of Your Subconscious Mind is for everyone. It is much more understandable and usable than Napoleon Hill's Think and Grow Rich, so if you liked that book, you will want to get this as well. Joseph Murphy does not try to be mysterious. He gives very practical advice. And, moreover, his advice works. He explains that, like chemistry or math, the law of creation can be used more effectively by anyone who knows how it functions. He teaches you methods you can use -- all of them effective, simple, and easy. This is one book worth reading and even rereading (not something I say about most books.)
B00004THAY|1.0|Clapton's &quot;whitewashed&quot; version od the blues just pales in compariosn with BB's soulful meaningful and powerful blues.  If we could only edit out all of Clapton's parts thsi would be a great date.  Too bad they didn't match BB with John Lee Hooker instead, he was still around back then.  Oh well...
B0001BKAEY|1.0|Having given the theatrical release of this movie 1 star, after viewing the DVD I can not say that my impressions have changed that much. In fact I can now clearly see why I did not like Revolutions and why many others did not like it either. The central problem with Revolutions is that bit-part actors and actresses are given leading roles that are immensely time consuming. So much so that everyone who made the first Matrix so good have literally been given a backseat to Niobi's driving skills or a token Kid that saves the day. Forget Morpheus's slick philosophical statements while dressed in black. Here he just wears a woolly jumper and sits around wondering just what is going on. Imagine if Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Lea where replaced at the end of the trilogy with Jabba the Hut, a Jawa, a Storm Trooper and an Ewok made the central focus characters? Would you like that? Well this is EXACTLY what Revolutions does! Zion is really what has gone wrong here. By expanding the depth of the Matrix story the filmmakers have missed the mark of what made the first Matrix so good and this is a problem for the audience. In short, and for all intensive purposes, Revolutions does not resemble the original movie in any way shape or form. In fact the only thing that Revolutions has in common with the original film is the characters. Now we have been introduced to a battle between the machines and Zion - in an environment where Neo will not be found... or Morpheus ... or Trinity... or Agent Smith. This battle sequence is the BIGGEST part of the film. So for thirty odd minutes or so you will certainly NOT be watching any form of the Matrix... but heck this was never about the Matrix in the first place. Reloaded and Revolutions where designed to move between plot banality and theme-park type experiences WITHOUT the metaphysical `thought' and `dialogue' that made the original Matrix what it was. You are paying to see a empty spectacle - nothing more, nothing less.<br />Those who have done their homework will realize that the filmmakers have forgotten a lot and provided us with simple excuses so that they can bring on the next big special effects scene. Like I said already NEW CHARACTERS are introduced that serve very little function and are forgotten about just as quick. The Trainman appears as an important character and then... disappears. His whole scene at the start of the movie with Neo served absolutely NO PURPOSE. The Architect materializes briefly at the end for a few lines to try and consolidate everything. Persephone is back again with the Merovingian as if nothing is wrong after her releasing the Keymaker in Reloaded. The Twins who disappeared in Reloaded are obviously vaporized, because they are not here. What happens to Seraph? What happened to the Merovingian? They are here in Revolutions but don't expect they actually play an important role in much because whatever they say or do means nothing by the time the end credits role and here is also another problem. The ENDING of the original Matrix is so much better than Revolutions that the sequels seem pointless. But there we really have summed it up. This is a money making high budget sci-fi movie, end of story. People are going to watch it so why not experiment? Sadly that experiment does not pay off simply because it breaks too many rules... rules that the original Matrix created for us. The original Matrix was a high like no other. Reloaded was satisfactory and at least had some knockout action sequences with elements that where in the first Matrix and a few extra scenes here and there to help develop the story around Zion. Okay so the dance scene at the start was totally out of place but in Reloaded as soon as Neo met the Oracle it was the Matrix rocking like you mother from start to finish. Revolutions is NOTHING like Reloaded.<br />Like we said questions that where created in Reloaded are left unanswered. What is it with the Indian family who take up almost fifteen minutes talking at the start of the film? The copout for replacing the Oracle with a new actress is explained in the worst possible way..... AND WHOEVER WROTE THE SCREENPLAY DIALOGUE SHOULD HAVE HIS PAYCHECK REVOKED! What a cliche driven script! You will not believe the stereotype dialogue on display here! Watch Neo stand for a few minutes in stupidity as Bane, who sounds, talks and moves just like Agent Smith, almost has to tell Neo who he is before the penny drops with our savior character! Bill and Ted where on the screen for a few moments there. Sssshesshhh.....<br />The bottom line here is that this film is a disaster. Even if it where like Reloaded it would have been an acceptable movie but it seems almost like some sort of Direct to Video type release on a big budget. It is very hard to describe what an utter disappointment this film was. It could possibly be one of worst mega-budget pictures ever made. Fans will feel downright conned. Those who are looking for popcorn fodder will probably find it okay-ish entertainment but if we wanted to watch okay-ish entertainment we would hope to find that somewhere else other than in one of the most expensive sci-fi films ever made!!!!! Thank God that the Lord of the Rings is there to redeem our faith in high-concept large budget fantasy films. Revolutions is a bad stain on the Matrix series - if not trilogies as a whole. As a fan I have voiced my disapproval, it is little more than I can do, but what do they care laughing all the way to the bank???ost fifteen minutes talking at the start of the film? The copout for replacing the Oracle with a new actress is explained in the worst possible way..... AND WHOEVER WROTE THE SCREENPLAY DIALOGUE SHOULD HAVE HIS PAYCHECK REVOKED!

B0000029GA|5.0|ILLmatic is the greatest hip hop albums period. From the moment you put this album into your stero, it sucks you in. Nas is truely a poet. It is scary that when he was on the way to the studio to record ILLmatic,he left his rhyme book on the bus,and it got stolen.Nas was forced to rewrite severla tracks right there in the studio.Thats amazing,and shows how gifted he is. Truly there is no other rapper out there like him.Is Nas even a rapper? he's more of a street poet. This is just the first of his classics. Nas is the greatest...
B0001ENY6M|5.0|The music of the film can't be better, rightly composed to suit such a movie like THE PASSION! <br />It's the best movie I've ever watched, my favourite! :)
B00005JMEW|5.0|&quot;Kill Bill&quot; is a very rare phenomenon: a fun, thrilling, exciting action film that also contains a genuinely poignant emotional core.<br />It's COOL when the Bride kicks the crap out of Vernita Green in her idyllic suburban home. It's POIGNANT when she comes face to face with Vernita's 4-year-old daughter after killing her. It's COOL when the Bride beats the hell out of the disgusting orderly who's been pimping out her comatose body. It's POIGNANT when the Bride wakes up from her coma, and, after realizing she's lost her baby, cries out in acute pain and loss. It's COOL when O-Ren Ishii beheads a fellow crime boss at a dinner banquet. It's POIGNANT when an anime flashback shows how she witnessed the death of her parents as a small child.<br />Brilliantly written, acted, and executed, I LOVED this movie. And extra props to Tarantino for not using ANY CGI in this film!!<br />PS Go-Go rules!!!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|\\"Lost in Translation\\" is one of those rare movies that deserve the hype.  Unfortunately, the term \\"hype\\" is probably better attached to your various blockbusters. Imagine the hype over a good story by Chekov?  Normally, in our exploding, flashing entertainment world it isn't going to happen since the bar has been so lowered.  But that's where this story resides, in a land of nuance and quiet space (Bergman territory).  Such craftsmanship places demands on the viewer, just like a well written story places demands on a reader. Bittersweet is very hard to do, but this film pulls if off, right down to the last scene (the whisper was a perfect, hopeful, human touch.)  Murray deserved a nomination for this flick (though Sean Penn was overdue), but Scarlett Johansson also deserved recognition.  The intelligent dialogue between these two, the framing of scenes, the photography, all are excellent.  Easily a five star movie for the discerning viewer.
B000002GJS|5.0|Having been a fan of Bryan's since his &quot;Let Me Take You Dancing&quot;, I can safely say that Waking Up the Neighbours is his best album of his career.  No other album released since then comes even close!  Just wish he'd play songs from it more often in concert, however, he states they are too hard to do too often.........not sure why!
B0001AVZA8|5.0|Come on people....don't take it so seriously!!  This was a fun movie with a FANTASTIC cast!  Diane Keaton is my favorite actress and I loved her in this part!  I thought the crying scene was hilarious (what it was intended to be) and if you have ever had your heart broken you also know it's not too far fetched! I wanted to watch it again the very next day!  It was a great little romantic comedy!
B000002UDB|5.0|Who else but the Beatles could come up with &quot;I am the walrus&quot; and make a great song out of it? Nobody else,not Dylan,not the Stones,nobody,only John Lennons mind could pull it off (with a little help from sir Paul).
B000002J2D|2.0|This was very much a transitional album for Genesis, and it shows. Some of the songs -- &quot;Undertow,&quot; &quot;Burning Rope,&quot; the lovely &quot;Follow You Follow Me&quot; -- are as gorgeous as anything else in the band's enormous catalogue, but a good many others seem underwritten, overplayed or forgettable. Genesis recorded this album quickly, and did so in the wake of guitarist Steve Hackett's departure, so it's understandable that the album doesn't measure up to early masterpieces like &quot;Foxtrot&quot; or their later self-titled collection of pop gems. For new listeners, this wouldn't be the first -- or even the fourth or fifth -- Genesis album that I'd recommend, but it does have three or four excellent songs that make it worth coming back to.
B00005JMEW|4.0|i really give this one 4.5 stars especially for uma thurman's performance.  she is killer (literally) in this movie!  the 70's styling of the movie was okay but a bit unbelievable.  still some great fight scenes and a sick storyline.  a must have!
B0001VWP8I|5.0|This album is amazing i really like this i play this all the time.
B00004RFFS|5.0|rarely when a movie is made based on a book does it truly do the book justice.  in this instance, it does the book justice.  it is so much like the story that i was amazed that it was possible to do so.  it has been my favorite movie for about 6 years now and i would recommend this to anyone who likes vampires.  i hope that they do more of anne rice's storys on the big screen, but only if they are more like this one than the way that the queen of the damned was done.
B0001HAHXW|3.0|As a connoisseur and great admirer of R.J., I had mixed feelings about the release of Clapton's &quot;Me &amp; Mr. Johnson&quot;.<BR>My first thought was : &quot;You don't mess with legends!&quot;.<BR>Anyhow, I bought the CD and I'm still torned and frayed whether I like this CD or not.<BR>One of my complaints is the sound quality, there is some gray<BR>fog all over the tracks, it's not as clear as the three R.J.<BR>songs on &quot;Unplugged&quot;: Walking Blues - Malted Milk and Rolling and Tumbling( = If I Had Possession Over Judgement Day !).<BR>These R.J. songs on &quot;Unplugged&quot; sound much better than those on &quot;Me &amp; Mr. Johnson&quot;. They really sound crystal clear !<br />E.C. stayed unbelievably close to the originals, both musically and text, even the growling speach on some tracks of R.J. is incorporated by E.C. !<BR>So E.C.'s renditions are not as amazing as f.i. the R.J. versions of Johnny Shines or Elmore James, who went further on the way in adapting R.J.'s music for the generations to come.<BR>On the other hand, &quot;Me and Mr. Johnson&quot; can generate younger<BR>buyers to go after the originals and that can be of great profit for the legend Robert Johnson, after all, I myself also discovered R.J. by the renditions of  &quot;the Stones&quot; like<BR>&quot;Love in Vain&quot; and &quot;Stop Breaking Down&quot; ! And by the time &quot;the Bluesbrothers&quot; promoted R.J.'s &quot;Sweet Home Chicago&quot; I already<BR>knew very well who Robert Johnson was.<BR>Listening many times to &quot;Me &amp; Mr. Johnson&quot;, every time a question came up, what should R.J. himself have found of this<BR>tribute of Clapton ? After all, I think he should have found it okay.<br />Some others state in their reviews that E.C.'s guitar playing<BR>can't cope with the originals, I fully agree with that, R.J. belongs in the top three of best guitar players ever.<BR>In the CD liner notes Clapton states that R.J. is &quot;the keystone&quot; in his musical foundation. Is that really true Eric ?<BR>Up to now, I've heard only one guitarist that really can play<BR>like R.J. and that is &quot;Keith Richard&quot;. Personally I think that Keith Richard is more knocked off of his feet by R.J. than E.C. ever will be. Maybe Keith can make a real stunnig tribute out of the fifteen Johnson tracks that Eric left on the shelf, that could really be a shock !
B00003BDXG|5.0|this movie was fantastic.  it has a little bit of each genre in it.  woody harrelson gives an amazing performance along side a great cast of talented actors.  every character in the movie was depicted perfectly by that who played it.  most people who have seen this movie don't truly get what it was about.  the core of it was a love story.  a love story surrounded by chaos and mass murder and some psychedelics.  this movie definitely gets 5 stars from me.

B0001WTUH6|3.0|I could have loved this movie.  It looked great, had interesting characters and used a decent rehash of the old vampire vs werewolf story.   But why oh why have all these exotic beings with supernatural abilities, and then bring it all back down to a hokey shoot-out by introducing the idea of both sides having guns that can kill the other.   One of the great things about vampire or werewolf movies is that they are so hard to kill, allowing for great hand-to-hand type action scenes.  To beat the biggest bad, you should have to be Really Good. But allow either side to be taken out by a bullet from afar, and what do you have?  It might as well be gangster flick or WW2 yarn.
B000002H2H|5.0|Well well well, metallica's second album even better than the first. I'll be damned.<br />1)Fight fire with fire-10/10-This song is so fast!!!<BR>2)Ride the lightning-10/10 the first riff is soo cool<BR>3)for whom the bell tollss-10/10 my fav on the cd<BR>4)fade to black-10/10 this song is definately awesomeeeeeee<BR>5)trapped under ice-9/10-i keep forgetting about this song so it mustn't be that good<BR>6)Escape-6/10-sounds too much like black sabbath<BR>7)creeping death-10/10 the bridge in this song kicks ass<BR>8)Call of the ktulu-10/10 the best instrumental met has ever done
B00005MNP8|5.0|This cd is sooo good. It's rock-pop-disco and almost all the songs can be on a greatest hits ! <br />Just one thing, some of the extras (live songs) are not very good... for the live songs, the sound is bad.<br />If you like Blondie, you need this album.
B0001GL3KE|5.0|As christmas comedies go, Love Actually is among the best of all time. The film is just a great heart warming comedy for all the family (except maybe the eight year old, due to the occasional swear word, nothing too bad though). The cast is fantastic, one of my favorite actors, Liam Neeson has a major role as a father who's son has fallen in love with a girl at school, and he has to deal with the teenage traumas and does so in great style. The gentlemanly Hugh Grant who plays, well, himself as always, but also the Prime Minister. Bill Nighy, always very funny to watch, plays an old rock star trying to make it big again (another great rock film with Bill is Still Crazy, have a look). Martine McCutcheon also stars as Hugh Grants tea lady (obviously they fall in love too). Also worth mentioning is Colin Firth's performance, who after leaving his wife as she was having an affair, he goes to France for holiday and falls in love with his Portuguese maid.<br />Overall a great combination of the best British actors around. Hugh Grant was great as the PM and had some very funny scenes but I think Bill Nighy stole the show, everytime he came up something hilarious happens! Great heart warming, christmasy comedy for everyone.
B000002MY3|5.0|Jagged Little Pill came over the world like an a-bomb. I don't know really when was the first time I heard one of that songs, but in early 1996, the rumour about her songs, about her videoclips and everything were possible to be heard here, in the middle of South America, more than 100 miles far from a big city. Never mind that success, I just bought this album in 2002, and stayed amazed with her performance. I started listening to All I really want, with a strange harmonica arrengement, and that thing she tells us: \\"my sweater is on the backwards and inside out\\". What does mean a sweater inside out, on the backwards? What does it mean really? Is she talking about something she thought after having sex with someone, or is she talking about a mess she doesn't understand? No matter. It is a big cry of anger, of fury, of madness, repeating the same thing, adding things that compound the same wish. When she says all she really wants she wants to say she want a good affair. That's all. Told in so many manners. There's nothing left to say about You Oughta Know. But nobody talks about a thing. She says things she would never say to a guy in any moment. I think it's really like this. Just imagine. Saying this in a song, she don't have to look in anyone's eyes, and she can do her revenge. Maybe the one about whom she talked in that song, never knew it. He must thought that was about other man. Perfect was used by me in an English class. I made my pupils think about the things they do and the things people use to say to them. Perfect tells us about things adults use to say to children and teenagers, as though they needed to bill them for something. Do children owe something, really, to his parents? Hand In My Pocket is astounding. I will never forget that harmonica, nor that big voice and that marvelous and ironic theme. I've got one hand in my pocket, and the other one is writing a rewiew. I'm kidding. Right Through You may be a yawe of anger and almost bloody of extreme pain. Everything because of a man that humbled her sometime. Who is this man, please, send me an email!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Forgiven talks to me like the same experience I had with Catholic Church. She seemed to be fooled by the Church. Reading carefully the lyrics I could perceive she felt robbed, felt like someone had robbed her salvation. She talks about the contradiction and so many bad feelings that came upon her brain that moment. WONDERFUL. You Learn is an pint of otimism in this boiling pan. You learn, no matter how hard or soft things can be. I learned this. You listen to You learn. As the song says. Head Over Feet is here to be one of the most sincere songs about something a girl wants to say to a guy. You cannot believe in me but it is true. The realistic way she says \\"I am aware now\\" makes the guy who inspirated this song thinks: \\"I never should act like this with her.\\" Mary Jane is calling someone deep down in a pool, as we can see in her \\"Jagged Little Pill live\\", in extreme pain and depression. The high vowels she sings in the middle of the song, the way (crying? shouting? moaning?) is so impressive. Just listen to and make an opinion. Forgive the mine. Ironic passes us a kind of irony that we don't pay attention to. It is funny and sick at the same time. It's like a bittersweet salad. It's like eating chocolate with roastbeef at the same time. Not The Doctor is not the best song of the album. I think it is the less interesting, but you wait to listen it in the \\"Jagged Little Pill live\\", it's psychodelically marvelous. After Wake Up, one of the best songs. It is wonderful, it is psychodelic, its everything at the same time. The album finishes with a bonus track with a different version for You Oughta Know and after one minute or more of silence the impressive Your House, a capella. Buy one, it's a kind of rock with extreme quality, without makeup, with so much heart, voice and guitars. She never made a cd like that. Do not waste time. Buy one for your neighbor, for your brother and sister, for you grandma if she likes it. It is marvelous. Alex
B000066NW0|1.0|Firstly Avril Lavigne has done a great job, lets face it, anyone who can do something completely un-natural to themselves, and earn millions is a genius.<br />I understand she was a country and western singer before her producer told her, 'look the best way to earn millions is to become a completely fake bimbo with the wrong label, but the right audience', or something like that anyway, then she replied, 'no, I love my country singing, please, please,' then, 'Enough! You shall be a punk rock star who sings about skater boys, OK?', 'I suppose so,' I'm not sure if thats 100% accurate, but I heard it through the 'punk rock' grapevine. So, here we are, with yet another talentless person making WAY TOO MUCH MONEY.<br />I swear I met her once in a moshpit at a Tool concert, oh no, maybe in a barn somewhere with her acoustic guitar, much more probable.
038572179X|5.0|Is it possible to make up for a seemingly harmless action that affects the life of your loved ones; sending them spiraling irrevocably into nightmarish misery?  Is it possible to forgive someone who destroys your chances for love and happiness just as you're in their throes?  If the culprit is a naive young girl, is she any less culpable?  If this was the sum of McEwan's aim in writing this book, it would still be enough to shortlist him for the Booker Prize.<br />But, no, McEwan is interested (perhaps primarily) in portraying a young author who writes a story-within-a-story.  As Briony observes her sister Cecilia with their neighbor Robbie, a shocking scene shakes her world, hurdling her from the safe and simple plays of her innocence to the dangerous and exciting edges of adulthood, sexuality, and sober reality.  Engaging his heroine (if she may be dubbed one) with the story from her writer's point of view, McEwan engages the reader in following this interaction.<br />Atonement, although similar in concept to previously published works, eschews covered ground by shifting perspectives and narrative voices-not only between individual characters but between the same characters over time-thus keeping us on our feet.  We are never quite sure whose point of view is more accurate, and whether we can even trust them.  Scattered clues throughout the text only lead literary explorers to a mystifying culmination where the truth offers little value and satisfaction, and a melancholy resolution moves us with its forlorn reticence.  An exquisite read.
067940581X|4.0|This book is light-hearted and fun to read if you have a decent attention span. Emma is proud of her recent match-making success and sets out to do more. After a few awkward setbacks, she learns not to play Cupid, and that love is random and spotaneous, and can't be forced. In some places, the book can be kind of slow, but if you keep going, it gets better. All in all, I enjoyed it very much.
B000056VIY|4.0|J.LO, actress-turned-singer Jennifer Lopez's second album, outdoes its predescesor ON THE 6 by a million times a million.  This album is overall the best from Lopez's repitoire.  Love this record!  I don't agree with Mike who officially reviews the album: Lopez is NO Latina Madonna.  Selena is and always will be!  Lopez, although with this album makes her first steps toward becoming a sizzlin' performer, is no Selena.
B0001I55OC|2.0|What is it about Michael Crichton books that are so easy to screw up? Good movies are possible from Crichton's work, such as Jurassic Park and Andromeda Strain. From Congo to Sphere, though, Crichton's books have made horrific movies. Timeline is no exception. I consider Timeline, the book, to be one of Crichton's crowning works. This movie however, is a total wreck. The plot is lost in a sea of overworked special effects. Paul Walker was a horrible choice for his role. The plot changes lose the audience. The science of the movie seems to be lost in the rush to make a good action movie. If you want a good movie, look elsewhere, if you want a good book, read Timeline.
B000099T2L|3.0|Beyonce Knowles's debut album isn't what I expected.  From all the reviews I thought it'd be full of hits, but most of the songs are dull compared to breakout single &quot;Crazy in Love&quot;.  IN LOVE is an album ya should get if you're really into the R&amp;B style of music - personally, I like more pop-oriented songs so Beyonce doesn't deliver with this album.  It's done sterlingly production-wise!  Buy this album if you're a huge Beyonce fan or if you like R&amp;B.
B00004STPT|5.0|I can't say enough about this CD. Just buy it. You won't be disappointed.
0451191153|5.0|That was easily the worst 704 leaves of book I have ever read. If that passes as entertainment in this country then I must be deluded. Never have I seen such bad writing. There wasn't a laugh to be found amid insipid, corny dialogue proving yet again that what is popular is rarely the most deserving. The book is never been more than a vehicle for the author to overwrite and make silly political proncouncements. It is all the infuriating that this untalented person should make such money. Of course I'm jealous, I'd love to make millions out of nothing. Who reads this rubbish?

B00005OAIE|5.0|I've had this album for a long time, and like every thing else I figured it would fade away and I would move on, but I find myself still listening to this CD. His music is just so vivid and theres really no one out there like John. He's in a world of his own on this album. And if theres someone out there who is looking for music to possibly change your views on some subjects in life.. Get this CD..Trust Me.

0385424736|3.0|The book starts off with the graduation of Rudy Baylor, the main character, from a Memphis college. Rudy gets a case of an insurance agent Great Benefits cheating a family whose son is about to die as the insurance company failed to pay up the cover for his bone-marrow transplant. The case goes to Rudy just before he takes up his bar exam to become a licensed lawyer. Once he passes the bar, he and a friend named Deck, the so-called paralawyer, decide to challange the insurance company being represented by one of the most expensive and well known firms in Memphis. Rudy's graduation, the pre-trial events were kinda droning along. The only likeable part of this novel by Grisham was the trial itself. Even the trial was practically far-fetched because judge Kipler is fully biased towards the plaintiff. This is normally not what happens in court. Grisham kinds makes a mockery of the legal system. But it is a little fun to read. Recommended if you have nothing else to read.
B00004XONN|5.0|Different from OK Computer-- jarringly so at first.  After a couple repeat listens and some time, however, it started becoming my favorite album.  It doesn't necessarily have a few radio-friendly tracks that you can sing along to like in The Bends or OK Computer, but it's an amazing listen from beginning to end.  If I were trapped on an island and could only choose a few CD's for company, this is a must-have.
B000063DFN|5.0|I've been a Iron Maiden fan for a little over 3 years and my God this is the album that really stood out. The reason. The guitaring. Dave Murray, Adrian Smith and Janick Gers. The power of the 3 guitars is really depicted in 'Losfer Words' and 'Duellists'. These two tracks will automatically set you heads banging before you know it. <br />This album has a distinct 'sound' that distingwishes itself from other Maiden albums. The opening song for any album does not get any better than 'Aces High'. Bruce Dickinson, the vocalist goes real deep with lots of shrills sending chilling feeling down the listener. <br />The best track in my opinion is the epic 'Rime of the Ancient Mariner'. The drumming is top class in this song. 'Powerslave' is another explosive track with Bruce changing his style of vocals a little in this song. Flash of the Blade is another guitaring classic. Overall a great album for any metal fan. Highly recommended.
B00000K0DQ|2.0|I saw this movie in my English class as we discussed the pro and con of Capital Punishment. I would never have watched this by myself and I have to say, I wish I  hadn't. It is not that I think that the movie is too didactic, I simply don't like films in which the director and the actors obviously try to stimulate certain emotions. I watched the movie thinking: Now I should feel sad, now I should feel sorry, now I should hate Matt... But I didn't really feel one of these feelings at all! the movie is just so artificial, everything seems to be a clich, nothing is new or interesting, although the director tried to produce tension, I was bored many times. You could say that I am cold and  that I do not allow the movie to touch me but I am not against emotional movies at all. If you want to watch a movie bout the death penalty, watch the Green Mile. If you want a movie that is moving and brillant at the same time, watch &quot;the Rainman&quot; (my favourite &quot;sad&quot; movie), but you really don't have to see &quot;dead Man walking&quot;. <BR>c. freitag

B000148KK2|2.0|It was with great anticipation that I awaited the arrival of Diana's new CD.  I'm sad to admit that I don't even feel like buying this compilation, based on the excerpts I've listened to thus far.  I commend any artist who attempts to graduate from a successful genre, but in the case of Diana Krall, why she ever meandered from her jazz roots baffles me.  Her piano playing is a formidable force, and her sultry voice gives her a leg up on most jazz vocalists.  Perhaps her marketing team is trying to help her reach more of the masses by having her dabble in pop, but to me, its a dilution of one of the finest talents today. I'm hoping Diana, like Harry Connick Jr. will return to her jazz roots and let other pop singers satiate the bland palate of the masses.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I bought the DVD because I knew I'd love the film, and I do. First of all, every single notable British actor that you can think of is in this movie. The plot follows approximately ten different couples who are struggling through their respective relationships. Some of my favorite couples are Hugh Grant's character (the Prime Minister) and his outspoken assistant, Liam Neeson and his adorable son, and Colin Firth and his Portuguese maid. The best scenes in the film are between Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman, who portray a married couple going through a rough patch. This is an amazing movie that will have you in fits of laughter one minute and fighting back tears the next. The DVD is great because it contains over 20 minutes of deleted scenes, most of which are very good.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|This is roughly the 800th(!) review of REVOLUTIONS.<BR> I won't bother hashing over details that have been scoured over so many times. I'm just trying to clarify to the potential viewer, the criteria of the people who loved or hated this movie. Of course this includes my critereia. You can decide which criteria guides your viewing choices. <br />A common theme seems emerge from the pro/con camps. These are my generic interpretation of the two types of review.<br />CON-I loved the first movie. The things that made it special were increasingly absent from the sequels. I thought maybe &quot;Revolutions&quot; could make sense of the overly dense plot created by &quot;Reloaded&quot; and redeem the trilogy. It couldn't. The spectacles rang hollow, the actors were bad at saying their bad lines, and the end was wimpy and nonsensical.<br />PRO-People shouldn't have gone to see the sequels with preconceptions and unreasonable expectations. Sequels rarely meet them. The Bros. W are geniuses and the detractors are ignorant. Instead bowing to the mob, the Bros. W wove an intricate fabric of philosophical themes and action. The ending was socially enlightened rather than blockbuster predictable. If you watch the movie carefully or often enough, you will catch the explanations for Neo's powers and make sense of the ending.<br />The thing the PRO camp seems to overlook is a lot of the detractors were long familiar with the themes of this trilogy. This familiarity fostered annoyance with philosophy-speak rather than philosophy-do. Monologue in place of dialogue and deed is a trait usually attributed to the novice screenwriter.  These detractors didn't go to the theater for extended, yet shallow lectures, even shallower characters, and gratuitous action. They came to witness an intelligent well told, highly dramatic story. That was the appeal of the first film; the synergy of ideas, (purposeful) cutting edge effects with (purposeful) action, and strong fundamental storytelling (relatable characters, pace, dynamics, seamless narrative, etc.).   There are plenty of successful sequels that meet or exceed expectations. This kind of synergy of strong fundamentals is what is common among them. <BR>This synergy is what is heartbreakingly absent from the Matrix sequels.<br />If you have classic fundamental cinematic storytelling criteria (standards of dialogue, seamless narrative etc.) for any film you view, you may have no tolerence for the Matrix sequels.<br />If you think these fundamentals translate to cliché, if you're looking for a mythology platform that throws a lot of ideas your way, then you might enjoy the Matrix sequels. <BR> If you enjoy the exercise of repeatedly analyzing a bunch of ideas and interpreting fleeting plot clues, you might enjoy the Matrix sequels.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|What an amazing movie!  William Bloom (Billy Crudup) is a man who is coming to terms with the impending death of his father Ed (Albert Finney).  Will has issues with his father because he is tired of listening to Ed's fabricated stories about his life.  We are treated to many of those stories in a delightful series of flashbacks featuring Ewan McGregor as the young Edward Bloom.  The retelling of these stories leads Will to do some investigating, and he is finally able to understand what kind of a man his father really is.<br />The performances in this film are fabulous.  Ewan McGregor is hysterical, and his resemblance to Finney is kind of eerie (as is Alison Lohman's resemblance to Jessica Lange).  Helena Bonham Carter also delivers an outstanding performance in her dual role.  Tim Burton does an amazing job creating the magical world of Edward's imagination: the visual effects are astonishing, and the whole film has Burton's creepy &quot;edge&quot; to it.<br />&quot;Big Fish&quot; is an amazing movie that is comical as well as sentimental.  I will never understand why it wasn't given an Oscar nomination for Best Picture.
006054094X|5.0|I picked up the book from London during a trip.  I was looking for something entertaining to read, and I found my choices, Stupid White Men and 1421, are the ones I was looking for.<br />Gavin Menzis basically collected the facts and analyzed through his knowledge and experiences as a modern day navigator.  There are many facts about Chinese fleets in Ming Dynasty already, and Mr Menzis tries to stretch a little.  Well, not as scientific or scholarly as we want, but it is really a challenge to scholars on this subject.  It gives the world a chance to reexamine the missing link of the great fleets and their accomplishments.  Hope the academic world can do more research work on the details of the treasure boats which disappeared from official records for so long.  It really deserves more today.<br />A few facts from other sources:<BR>--- Chinese visited Aferica even before 1421.  There are maps about Africa in Chinese library dated back to 1389.<BR>--- There are records about Austrilia long before 1421.<br />The 28, 000+ strong fleet certainly did more than just fetching some spices for the royal court.  Remember they had been sailing for at least seven times.<br />Menzis is doing many of the reasearch work by himself.  The dispute or support from academic world will help the effort in detailing the history of Zheng He's fleet, and we are happy to see other new charts about the routes.<br />In the meantime, enjoying the fascinating story and well-connected imagination of the giant fleets during the two-year voyage.
B0000029AL|5.0|Quite a statement there. As a growing up teenager learning to play guitar, this one continually sent me back practicing. I still don't have Dream On completely figured out!<br />For anyone's first album, for it to be this good is amazing. And indeed it is. Everything is pure Aerosmith. It seems like no producers or executives got in there way. This is the way Aerosmith should have always been recorded. They sound like a gritty, fighting for their careers, musicians that always made them sound their best.<br />There are a couple of well done covers, and some nice original blues and slight jazz songs here. To call out the best song, I've got to tell you that seven out of eight songs have to step forward, if you like this type of rock and roll.<br />This is an album that will make all you younger guys say, hey, with a little practice, I can get real close to playing this stuff. And you can. Just keep working on your guitar solos!<br />But this will definitely motivate you to pick up your axe and start playing. Good, well defined, basic, good sounding rock music that came from a garage, and still can. Difficult category of album to find.<br />Enjoy, and play your axe off!<br />Michael Dolim
B00007G207|2.0|The original version of this movie is wonderful - hence the Academy Award.  The ending is one of the truly sublime moments in cinematography!  The director's cut adds so much melodrama, including footage which besmirches the main character much to the emotional detriment of the film.  The result is a mediocre soap opera, and the ending of the movie is totally devoid of emotional punch because the whole arc of the story is ruined by the end of an extra hour's unnecessary footage.<br />Fortunately, the DVD has both versions.  Watch the original and love it.  Ignore the director's cut.
B0000029AP|4.0|Toys was released after &quot;Aerosmith&quot; and &quot;Get Your Wings&quot; and before &quot;Rocks.&quot; If you are an early Aerosmith fan (ie-the first four albums), this has to go into your collection, but I wouldn't necessarily put it there first.<br />The really great songs include &quot;Walk This Way&quot; which all us white guys picked up on back when it was released, although the RUN-DMC video was a scream. After &quot;Dream On&quot; from the first album, this probably defines Aerosmith for most people. A great fun song it is. Everyone in the band is at their best.<br />Next up is &quot;Big Ten Inch Record.&quot; Sorry teenie boppers, but Aerosmith has always had a blues side to them. This one just has a few funny lyrics. It was quite disturbing to my parents when I was a teenager. Nevertheless, well done, and a little tongue in cheek for Steven Tyler.<br />Right up next is probably the best produced song on the CD: &quot;Sweet Emotion.&quot; This one happened to never really get my attention, but it all my friends' attention. Looking back, while I think it is a little over-produced song, Tom Hamilton lays down a very nice groove on the song, which turns out to be the basis for the whole song.<br />There aren't any BAD songs on this album, but only three really sound special to me, but hey, the first four Aerosmith albums are simply an Aerosmith fan's must have. This one sounds a little over-produced, but this is the real Aerosmith.<br />I recommend the other three first albums &quot;Aerosmith,&quot; &quot;Get Your Wings&quot; and &quot;Rocks&quot; to go with this. Then you will understand their latest &quot;Honkin' on Bobo.&quot; Until then, you will know Aerosmith as just a pretty good rock and roll band.

B0001AP12G|5.0|An Australian citizen, I have been a fan of hip-hop only since `01, and specifically of the artists Kweli, Common, the Roots, Nas, Dead Prez and Jay-Z. However, apart from these aforementioned artists, I have seen and heard a lot since then, most of it being unedifying drivel that does little toward the progress of the genre. It's great to listen to someone who feels he doesn't have to rhyme about cars, money, drugs, mackin' hoes and killing people.<br />Why I love the CD so much:<br />Kanye, a hip-hop producer and one of the most notable today, changed the game when he decided to add some raps to his beats as well (- if they can do it, why can't I?). And Kanye does an unbelievably good job at it too, \\"rapping better than most rappers\\", in a style that is uniquely his own. Story-telling from the start, Ye rhymes about his past, his encounters with the opposite sex, and his rise to fame and fortune. However, unlike most rappers, Kanye does not do much bragging, letting his work do most of the talking. The album is upbeat due to Kanye's light-hearted approach to his many - though deep - subjects, and is an absolute pleasure to listen to due to the humour contained in much of the lyrics. More than that, his beats that have been met with so much commercial success when employed by other artists, are matched by the quality of his rhyme which truly make the album a delight to listen to and a genuine 5-mic classic!<br />Hit KanyeWest.com to hear samples of his work.
B000148KK2|1.0|Diana Krall should stick to what she does best, i.e. singing jazz standards, and improve on that. The recent commercial success should not lead her astray to the muddy marshes of pop music.<br />This will probably be a cry into the wind because I expect that the marketing plague of our time, will make sure that customers will be convinced that this is a most personal and original CD and that the collaboration with Elvis Costello has resulted in an unique cross-over synergy.<br />The bottom line is that I don't enjoy this CD.

B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Those reviewers who said this movie was boring or silly, couldn't possibly have an imagination!  If you loved Edward Scissorhands, Arabian Nights, the Wizard of Oz.... then surely you will cherish this film.  It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but to judge it as a film with no merit is just plain small minded!  I loved it and will add it to my collection of all time favorites.  I strongly urge anyone who wants a movie that will entertain and carry them away from the ordinary world for just a few hours, to buy this DVD and watch it often.  I know I plan to!
6301963717|5.0|\\"Miller's Crossing\\" is the Coen brothers' homage to gangster flicks.  This is a movie that is in love with the gangster movie, from its cliches to its dialogue to its rich look, \\"Miller's Crossing\\" pays tribute to many of the great gangster films of the past. <br />Loosely based on Dashiell Hammet's \\"The Glass Key,\\" \\"Miller's Crossing\\" has an extremely complex plot.  Gabriel Byrne, in his finest performance, plays Tom, adviser and right-hand-man for Leo, played with fabulous machismo by Albert Finney.  Leo, the leading gangster in an anonymous Prohibition-era town, is one of those \\"nice guy\\" gangsters - a self-professed big-hearted slob who's an \\"artist with the Thompson\\" -- the ultimate gangster weapon.<br />We meet Tom and Leo in a fabulous opening scene where Johnny Caspar (the delightful John Polito) talks about \\"ettics,\\" fixed fights, and the need to kill off a manic John Turturro for selling the information on Caspar's fixed fights.  This scene is a marvelous tribute to \\"The Godfather,\\" which opens with people requesting favors of the Don.  We also meet Eddie Dane, Caspar's fearsome henchman, who stalks the movie with a perpetual snarl and is the scourge of the gangster world.<br />This is a movie with a perfect look.  From the thin spiral of smoke from a fired pistol, to the rich details of the city's gin-joints, to the ominous beauty of Miller's Crossing, the movie is steeped in its time period.  One of the best shots is a perversion of a Norman Rockwell painting where a young ragamuffin and his pet dog peer closely at a murdered gangster -- just the kind of ironic twist that fans of the Coens will love.<br />The plot gets going because Leo refuses to give Caspar the permission to whack John Turturro for selling the fixed fight information.  Caspar, a powerful gangster in his own right, declares war on Leo.  In a magnificent scene, two henchmen try to whack Leo in his house, and while Leo's house goes up in flames Leo blows away the two hitmen as well as a carful of other assassins on the street outside.  In typical Coen fashion, the scene is accompanied by a soaring rendition of \\"Danny Boy\\" -- wow!<br />Complicating matters, Tom is sleeping with Leo's girlfriend, Verna (Patricia Gay Harden, who throws the best punch ever thrown by a woman in a gangster film), and Leo finds out. Tom appears to flip sides, going over to Caspar and the Dane and appears to be working on their side.  Still, this movie is about codes of honor, and ulterior motives remain intact.  <br />The dialogue in this movie is wonderful, with gangster/period slang injecting a strong dose of style and wit into the movie. Instead of a mere, \\"What's up?\\" we hear, \\"What's the rumpus?\\"  Instead of \\"Get out,\\" we hear, \\"Take your flunky and dangle.\\"  Instead of \\"That's insulting,\\" we hear, \\"I'm sick of the high hat!\\"  Instead of \\"I'm going to rat you out,\\" we get, \\"If I don't hear from you, I start eating in restaurants.\\"  And Steve Buscemi steals the show with a rapid-fire speech to Tom.<br />After a bunch of double-crosses, threats, gunfights, pointed jokes about city corruption, and subtle jokes about the veiled homosexuality underlying virtually all gangster movies, \\"Miller's Crossing\\" builds to a dark crescendo when all motives are laid bare.  The characters cross the point of no return, and the movie closes with a wonderfully-enigmatic, melancholy Tom staring after his beloved Verna and Leo.  <br />A bit dark and bloody, even by the Coen brothers' standards, this movie will have some squirming in their seats from time to time.  But make no mistake - this is a movie filled with beauty, humor, and the sheer love of filmmaking.  A must-have for any fan of the gangster genre as well as any fan of the Coens' other films.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Well, where to begin? Usually I can twitter on for pages about a product, but this is a tough one. Well, let me start with my opinion that Schindler's List is the best film ever made, and deserves all the critical praise it has received. Never before have I seen such an emotionally powerful film.<br />I am the grandson of a man who, at the age of 14, was trapped in a concentration camp, before later escaping through some miracle. He wasn't Jewish, but lived in Russia and was hauled off one day when he found out that his father had been dead for months, even though he continued to receive letters from him. He later discovered the letters had been written by the Nazis, and sent to him as a cover up. He refused to talk about his experiences, even until his death in July 1996, so I have always tried to find other information about this dark period in history through sources such as books, films and documentaries. I first saw Schindler's List a few years ago, but never watched it all the way through - until recently.<br />Schindler's List revolves around a true story of Oskar Schindler who helped save the lives of more than a thousand Jews from a terrible fate. In the film, Oskar Schindler is a well-known Catholic, drinker and womaniser who is just in the whole extermination process to make pots of money at the expense of the Jews. He only cares about himself, and is more bothered about his public image than anything else. With all this behind him, he is hardly a man who thinks about...until he starts spending more time at the concentration camps. As the true horrors of the Holocaust unfold, his conscience changes dramatically until the point where he is willing to do anything he can in his power to save 1,100 Jews.<br />Liam Neeson is absolutely amazing as Oskar Schindler. I cannot think of any other actor than him to play this part. He pulls off the role very effectively and professionally, considering the subject was so hard to pull off. The perfect counterpart to Schindler's character is that of the evil German Nazi commandant Amon Goathe. Played by the remarkable Ralph Fiennes, his character is one of pure evil. The man is demonic, heartless and totally frigid. He has no care for anyone else but himself, and has piercing eyes that will no doubt have been the subject of millions of nightmares. Continual praise is essential for Fiennes, as it must have been very hard to re-enact some of the scenes that caused so much shock and terror throughout the world.<br />Ben Kingsley is also wonderful as Itzhak Stern, the Jewish man who works as Schindler's accountant. He doesn't have much of a large part in the film, but that all changed when he is needed to type up Oskar's list of people to save. The entire cast consists of more than 30,000 extras who give amazing performances as truly terrified Jews, giving the film a very real feel of what actually happened.<br />The way Schindler's List is filmed in black and white is perfect. This gives the film a documentary style, which is just the way director Steven Spielberg wanted it. There are only a few colour segments, but these are put to optimum use in making the viewer take note. The most famous of these is the one where Schindler sees a little girl in a red coat running away from the Nazis. He continues to watch her escape, until he later sees her on a pile of bodies awaiting cremation at a concentration camp. He is truly shocked. Spielberg is expressing the horror of the Holocaust here by saying that not even the young and innocent are spared. There are some truly shocking and disturbing scenes in this film, but all of which are brilliant in their tried ways to describe what actually went on. There are many random killings for no apparent reason at all.<br />This Special Edition of Schindler's List is truly one of the most essential DVD's you could ever hope to own. The movie is, in my opinion, the best I have ever had the pleasure to view. The emotion on display just blows you away, and to own the Special Edition is a great advantage for DVD fanatics. The extra features include:<br />- Movie soundtrack<br />- Book<br />- Senitype from the film<br />- Voices From The List documentary<br />- The Shoah Foundation Story With Steven Spielberg<br />- Cast and crew<br />- About Oskar Schindler<br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br />Schindler's List is my all-time favourite film and is definitely one that all young people should see. It's different for me because my grandad went through almost everything that is in this film, and that makes me think of him as someone very heroic and courageous. While not a film you can watch again and again, Schindler's List is one that will change you and your views on the supposed idealistic world that we live in. It makes you realise how cruel society can be and how far it is possible of going if we let it.

B00005QATY|5.0|While my favorite Coen brothers' film is &quot;Miller's Crossing,&quot; &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; is my favorite comedy by these two mavericks.<br />Loosely based on Homer's &quot;The Odyssey,&quot; earning an Oscar nomination for best adapted screenplay even though the Coens' admitted to reading only the Cliff Notes, &quot;O Brother&quot; is the Coens' tribute to American bluegrass music.  For some reason, this movie was shamefully snubbed at the Oscars, but George Clooney earned his Golden Globe award for best actor.  <br />Clooney plays the fast-talking Clark Gable wannabe, Ulysses Everett MacGill.  Unfortunately for Ulysses, his mouth runs about five steps ahead of his brain, and his delight in the clever, hyper-articulate use of the English language cannot mask his delightful naivete.  In a performance of sly self-mockery (can you think of another major film star who would so earnestly ask for a hair net to sleep in or speak movingly about being a &quot;Dapper Dan Man&quot;?), Clooney steals one heck of a show.  <br />Ulysses escapes from a chain gang in Depression-era Mississippi with his sidekicks, the hot-blooded Pete (John Turturro) and easy-going Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson).  Allegedly going to find some treasure before a river gets dammed, sinking the treasure beneath a deep lake, this trio begins a bizarre journey across the Deep South.<br />Along the way they meet guitarist Tommy Johnson, who followed an American musical legend by selling his soul to the devil at a crossroads in exchange for the ability to play the guitar, Big Jim Teague (the Cyclops), three Sirens, a blind seer, Baby Face Nelson, a spelling-challenged rifle-toting youngster, and Governor Pappy O'Daniel (conveniently relocated from Texas to Mississippi).  Recalling the ultimate road story of the Odyssey, &quot;O Brother&quot; breezes from episode to episode with delightful ease.<br />As ever with Coen brothers' films, the movie looks wonderful and feels authentic.  You can feel the oppressive heat of the Mississippi sunshine, you choke on dusty roads, and you glory in the greens and yellows of the languid countryside.  Unlike so many films set in the Old South, characters are fully-realized (even if hilariously flawed) rather than caricatures.  The minor details of daily life in the South (a mild oath from Ulysses gets a stern warning -- &quot;Watch your mouth, young feller, this is a public shop&quot;) are delightful touches.  <br />Of course, the true star of this movie, other than Clooney, is the soundtrack.  Almost solely responsible for the recent Bluegrass explosion, &quot;O Brother&quot; lovingly grounds this musical genre in its appropriate time and space, and the songs form a perfect accompaniment to the rest of the movie.  When the congregation sings is gospel tunes, or Pappy O'Daniel leads the Soggy Bottom Boys (what a name!) in a rendition of &quot;You Are My Sunshine,&quot; the powerful force of music resonates throughout this delightful film.  <br />One of the best movies of recent years, it's hard to understand why &quot;O Brother&quot; was so snubbed by the Academy.  Like other recent snubs (e.g., &quot;Shawshank Redemption,&quot; this movie is sure to generate more critical acclaim as it ages.  <br />Whether it's for the wonderful acting, terrific writing, or amazing soundtrack, &quot;O Brother&quot; should be in your collection!

B000067J1H|5.0|I went to see Fight Club the first Saturday it opened only because Ed Norton was in it and I was impressed with his contribution to \\"Rounders\\" - I hade never heard of Norton before seeing \\"Rounders\\". In any event, the theatre was half filled with \\"Twenty-Something\\" guys apparently looking for a some violent orgiastic 'dust-up'. Many of the youngsters left when they discovered that was not the idea of the film. True, there are several scenes of pugilistic mayhem BUT, in my opinion, most people miss the whole idea. The movie is purely symbolic ... bear with me here... The story is actually about the 'Feminization of the American Male' and the movie is a very effective though cloaked response. I do not want to spoil the fun in uncovering the often times very clever symbolism so I will offer only two examples. The first is the character played by Meatloaf who is a member of the 'testicular cancer support group'. Meatloaf's character is plainly a male becoming defacto feminized as evidenced by his growth of breasts from the hormone imbalance induced from having his testicles removed. Of course his emasculation is from disease and not politics or the despicable 'Political Correctness' movement. A second humorous episode is the apparent vandalism of rolling a giant bronze sphere \\"statue\\" in down a hill through the front glass of a \\"fern bar\\". There are DOZENS of subtle, not so subtle, and hilarious symbolic offerings. <BR>A person could EASILY write a lengthy, dry and self-important facetiously erudite exploration of the why and wherefores of the 'Feminization of the American Male' in an attempt to \\"spell it all out\\" for the dummies but Fight Club dispenses with all of that. The movie is truly not an indictment of a societies need to tame if not 'domesticate' the American Male. It simply explores how slowly moving cultural attitudes can catch the less circumspect off guard and, well, drive them nutz - literally and figuratively. I was truly disappointed by Ebert's review of the movie (to whom I usually pay attention) when he described Fight Club as 'Homosexual sado-masochism' - Caused me to wonder what kind of weird stuff he has living in his closet.<BR>Fight Club ranks in importance with A Clockwork Orange as social commentary but, in my opinion, is much more subtle and sophisticated. Regards,

B000007SIN|5.0|I don't write reviews often, but after I heard this disc on my system, I was so impressed that I dashed off to write a review to strongly support it (and hopefully spur sales to get more Steely Dan material transferred.  Hey, what's in it for me, right?)  Seriously though, I am a audio technophile (and, yes, a Steely Dan fan too) and this may be the best sounding material I have ever heard eminating from any stero system I have ever heard.  Honestly, it brings chills to my spine and I would only describe my current stereo system as good, but not extraordinary.  &quot;Hey Nineteen&quot; is the highlight if you ask me, especially once the bongos get going out of the left surround and the &quot;washboard&quot; out of the right surround.  And with the vocals taken care of by the center channel, it adds tremendously to the &quot;normal&quot; stereo separation of the main channels (I swear the horn player is standing right between my left main and surround speakers.)  And the separate subwoofer channel blends the low frequencies of the main speakers with the subwoofer output much better than the crossovers produce on my system with stereo discs.<br />Steely Dan is the perfect material to show off the capabilities of DTS and my expectations for this disc, which were very high, were met.  Hope to see more of this.  If you have a DTS capable sytem, then buy it.  If you are a Steely Dan fan, then get a DTS capable system...
B0000242AD|5.0|Yes, it's a masterpiece. It's just their debut but it already exceeds most of its successors (with the exception of Construction Time Again). I don't know why people always tell things like &quot;Good thing that Vince Clarke left so early&quot; and stuff, when he produced such a jewel of Britsh Synth Pop. <BR>We have these happy-go-lucky pop songs like &quot;Just Can't Get Enough&quot; or &quot;New Life&quot;, as well as thoughtful songs in minor key e.g.&quot;Puppets&quot;. And then, my 6 all time favourites, that are even better then various songs from other DM albums.<br />&quot;Any Second Now(Voices)&quot; sounds a bit like Kraftwerk and it represents Vince's sensitive side, letting Martin Gore take vocals and using the Warm Pad Synth in the (instrumental) chorus.<BR>&quot;I Sometimes Wish I Was Dead&quot; (which appears on this album version) might confuse the listener a bit, as the song is not at all as gloomy as the title would suggest. But nevertheless it's great, due to the simplistic cadences (G-D-C), this leading synth melody that reappaers constantly and the march feeling produced by the moog bass synth line and the militant rythm.<BR>Also the b-sides featured on this album version are great. Take &quot;Icemachine&quot;. It's not that happy-go-lucky like its A-Side &quot;Dreaming of Me&quot;, but, written in minor key, darker and also rhythmically very interesting, using clapping percussion and puff sounds which make it seem quite rebellious.<BR>And then &quot;Shout&quot; is quite dark for Vince's work and not at all naive and happy. It sounds a little bit exotic according to the heavy rythm devices, and this 'evil' bass synths (modified with phaser effect) that dominates this track makes it quite dark so that the atmosphere of this song stands in contrast to its lyrics.<BR>Vince Clarke was a great musician but lyrically he was a little bit abstract. If you're looking for proper lyrics on this album, you'll only find them on &quot;Tora Tora Tora!&quot; which was written by Martin Gore. And this song is also dark and sounds very exotic (Middle Eastern), using various sounds effect and Drum Loops and a peculiar scale.<BR>So it's clear that this song is one of my favourites. It was written by Martin but musically it's still more similar to the true analog synth pop sound of the early eighties which, unfortunately, was resigned by DM after Vince's departure in order to receive a different image. I wish, Martin had written more material with this early unique futuristic synth pop sound because &quot;Tora Tora Tora!&quot; is so great.<BR>It's only exceeded by &quot;Photographic&quot;. And this is the biggest killer they ever landed. Pure futuristic techno pop in minor key that surely influenced many artists of the later dance and techno scene. It was written in 1981 but sounds like from 1991 at least, already utilising that hard beat that would be etablished in Techno then.<BR>And, what makes it top, is the Sawtooth Synths in the Chorus and the Brass Synth Solo after the 2nd stanza. <br />So these are my 6 favourites and it would be worth buying this album already for these six masterpieces that even differ from the 'usual' Speak and Spell synth pop sound.<BR>But also the rest fits in and makes it valuable, and there's no track that's annoying like on other albums, even &quot;The Big Muff&quot;, an instrumental, is nice, but it would be recommendable to hear it as the intro song. And it would also be reommendable not to listen to the songs in the chronological order but in the order listed below, so that the 2 greatest songs come at the last:<br />1.Bug Muff, 2.Any Second Now(Voices), 3.Just Can't Get Enough, 4.Dreaming of Me, 5.Icemachine, 6.Shout, 7.New Life, 8.I Somethimes Wish I Was Dead, 9.Puppets, 10.Boys Say Go!, 11.Nodisco, 12.What's Your Name, 13.Tora Tora Tora, 14.Photographic<BR>If you take this order, it should be even more convincing and overwhelming.<br />This album's got something to offer for every mood.<BR>It contains bitterness, sometimes more subtle (Just Can't Get Enough), and sometimes obvious (Tora Tora Tora), romanticism (Dreaming of Me; Any Second Now) and teenage rebellion (Icemachine; Boys Say Go!).<BR>Vince harboured a certain intention writing these songs. And his lyrics are not always naive or happy-go-lucky, but also pure parody sometimes. He indirectly criticises the stupid monotonous night life (Nodisco), makes fun of awkward macho behaviour (Boys Say Go!; What's Your Name), devolops ideas of Romanticism (Any Second Now; Dreaming of Me) and Escapism (Shout), is longing for a bit of command (Puppets) and even inserts the feelings of Loneliness, Nostalgia and Paranoia (Photographic; Icemachine).<BR>And Martin's Tora Tora Tora is great anyway, also lyrically, criticising the cultural deprivation in the Middle East due to americanisation (how very current!)<BR>So, for God's sake, buy this album! It's a real masterpiece, totally under-rated. and you'll never anything like that again, neither on Vince's nor on DM's later material. I hope that some artists of the current Synth Pop scene will be inspired to write such songs again, producing equally, if not better.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. The characters are wonderfully drawn and believable. It is a real affirmation of love in all of its forms and brings tears to my eyes every time I watch it. The only flaw is that they have one couple who are actors in a pronographic film and they follow the couple falling in love in the course of making a porn film. They are not integral to the stories and only have about 4 minutes of screen time, but the porn scenes (R, not X), are a real irritation.
0743454529|3.0|I liked this book a lot--I read it in 24 hours, and  my mind was enraptured in Kate and Anna's story. However, there were too many characters I didn't care at all about, and some of the plot devices and skills Ms. Picoult used made me cringe.<br />I thought the character narratives of Campbell and Julia ridiculous--I didn't give a crap if they got together, slept together, broke up, she sobbed, they get back together...what? Who cares?? <br />I was more interested in *why* Anna wanted to file this lawsuit. I find that a sister rejecting to help her sister out as a doner intriguing--mainly because if my sister needed anything, I would give it to her in a heartbeat.<br />Anna's intent is explained at the end, but even then the readers aren't given enough to chew on. The pacing is good, the suspense is good, the emotion is realistic and the ending blew me away, but I felt this novel could have been fine tuned, polished and given a bit more guts. I read somewhere Jodi Picoult writes two novels a year, maybe this is why at times it felt rushed and contrived. <br />Good--but definately not, as Jodi Picoult so 'modestly' titled this book, 'this year's Sophie's Choice&quot; (As written on her website)
078062999X|5.0|I cannot add to the wonderful reviews for this film but I would like to tell of my personal experience with it.<br />I have a teen-age daughter who was struggling with English Lit.  She hated reading (always had).  She had to read various classics and was especially struggling with Hamlet.  She could not understand it, but, plodded through it anyway.  The cliff notes confused her.  I came across this movie at the video rental place and decided to try it to see if it would help.  After watching the video, she was so excited about the story of Hamlet that she immediately read it again, then watched the movie again.  We both found the movie to be extremely true to  the original writing.  The greatest thing about this movie is that it gave my daughter the drive to read.  FINALLY.  I had given up on her ever being able to enjoy reading, now she would rather read than watch TV.   I give all the credit to this movie.   Now, if a movie comes out based on a book she always reads the book if she watches the movie.<br />The only criticism I have is that I WANT THIS ON DVD and it isn't available.
B00003CXSP|3.0|I avoided this for quite some time.  The first one, Silence of the Lambs, moved me very little.  A friend in San Francisco alerted me to the Thomas Harris books, which I've never even thumbed.  What got me into this was Manhunter, a stylish (and likely much lower-budget) 'Lecter' film with Brian Cox as the doc.  Somehow, as a generations-upsmanship over Roger Corman/Vincent Price work, Manhunter managed.  <br />Silence was too pricey, and Jodie Foster from frame one struck me as improbable.  Hannibal seemed to offer more of the same.  But it did a few things right: Giancarlo Giannini, wonderful; Julianne Moore, double wonderful.  Those two, along with the Italian ambience that inserts itself as part of the adventure, added to the presence of Hopkins, made this work for me. The DVD does have some nice features, not least the many potential theatrical poster mockups. <br />The spectacle parts of this do show how debased our culture is becoming, but I'm not sure any culture couldn't say the same, save those whose titillation comes from exercising puritanical zeal.
B0000C8AV3|3.0|It is known that this disc was altered during it's original release 20 years ago.<br />Bob changed the song selection and re-did some of the tracks after Mark Knophler had gone.<br />If you want the real Infidels just burn the CD again with the Infidels out-takes from the Bootleg series Vol 1-3 CD set.<br />You will find these 5 or so tracks finish the disc far better.
B00002ND77|5.0|The first time I saw this movie I was fortunate as I had read the book &quot;The Autoboigraphy of Malcom X&quot; by Alex Hailey, on which the movie was based, and fewer people  could have translated the book into a movie like Spike Lee did.Mr Lee is one of the few film-makers to burn the American flag on the big screen, in the opening sequence of the movie,symbolizing the hatred that the black people had for the government of that day which was for whites only.The film contrasts the three different <br />times of Malcolm X, was a hustler then a prisoner and finally a minister who came to be feared by those who brought into Islam.Not only was he feard within his community but also by the white people( FBI/CIA) to drive a wedge between Malcon X and the Nation of Islam.I guess many people have a problem with this movie as it only potrays the truth as it was in those days.For anyone who knows nothing about the history of the black people around the world, and why black peoplef Africa and Carribeans seem to be behind in every aspect of this life, this movie is an excellent choice
B0000C8AW5|4.0|I always thought Planet Waves was supposed to be one of Bobs low points until I heard this disc in my car and was very surprised how fresh and alive this disc is.<br />Not a dud track plus a classic 'Wedding Song' worth getting this disc just for this song alone.<br />Great disc and well worth getting.<br />Shame no bonus tracks are included.
B00000K0DQ|3.0|I really enjoyed &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; because it shows the murderers point of view as well as the victims` families` sides.<BR>It gives a good impression about the suffering of everyone who is concerned in cases of the death penalty.<BR>In the end of the film the stress is too much on the emotional base and serious arguments for or against Matt`s execution are left out.<BR>But all in all I could imagine that this film really could change people&amp;#180;s minds about Capital Punishment.

B00005JMKI|4.0|It's a full three hours long.  It's depressing.  It's a film about America from a Danish director who has never set foot in the United States.  And it feels like a play that has been filmed because of its stark set.  Yes, it's about a town but the audience only sees chalk marks where houses are supposed to be and the very most vague Styrofoam or wooden partially built sets.  Everything, from the dialog to the narration to the titles on the screen is of the minimalist variety. It's the kind of film that holds controversy as its core and likely to be analyzed to death.<br /><br />It does have star quality though.  The voice is John Hurt, a narrator we never see.  He's the storyteller, and moves along the action, interpreting things that the audience would be able to see for themselves if he just stopped talking.  The scene is a small town named Dogville in 1920s America.  There are 15 residents of the town -- all leading harsh and unhappy lives.  Nicole Kidman seems to come out of nowhere, running from the mob.  The town decides to hide her and she must win them over.  At first they say they don't need help but little by little she does a service for each of them.  She reads to a blind man, she baby-sits for a family's children, she works in an apple orchard, she weeds the gooseberries.  At first they love her.  Then they take her for granted.  And then, when she tries to run away, they keep her captive. Eventually we see the ugly side of each of them.  And, at the end, we see Nichole Kidman's ugly side too.<br /><br />Certainly, this film was much much too long.  It drove home its points over and over again.  I wanted to scream \\"enough already\\"!  It also shows the cruel side of human beings.  It goes on and on.  Too much!  I hadn't realized a non-American director made it until the very end.  And it was only later that I came to understand that he made this film to be particularly negative to Americans.  That's funny.  Because even though Dogville was set in America, it was clear to me throughout that it could have been set any place in the world.  Negative and hurtful human beings are everywhere.<br /><br />Some people will consider Dogville a work of art.  It reminds me of some of the exhibits I've seen at the Guggenheim Museum and couldn't help but raise a quizzical eyebrow.  The work might be articulated well, but the art comes straight from a sick and twisted mind.  It left me disturbed and somewhat angry.  However, I cannot say this was a bad film.  It a way it was a work of genius.  But it's not the kind of genius I either like or admire. Film buffs should see it for curiosity alone.  All others should avoid it.erica, it was clear to me throughout that it could have been set any place in the world.

0201485672|3.0|Folwer's First Example: Won't Compile, Won't Run<br />Fri 5/07/04 7:07 pm. I am a professional programmer, and have been refactoring long before anybody told me about it. Fowler's first example is broken. Specifically:<br />1. &quot;import java.util.*&quot; omitted in Customer.java. This is the kind of thing it's very difficult to guess; the Sun compiler flags &quot;Vector&quot; and &quot;Enumeration&quot; with no hint of what to do about it (environments like JBuilder etc. are probably more helpful).<br />2. Page 11 has a misplaced curly bracket, leaving the &quot;amountFor&quot; routine out in the cold.<br />3. There is no program; Fowler shows us classes, and mentions that he tests them, but neither is shown. At least not before page 11.<br />This is particularly puzzling because Fowler claims it's very important to test everything constantly -- and it is obvious these classes cannot be tested because they cannot compile. And they won't run, because there is no program; surely it makes a difference *which* tests or program the classes are run under?<br />CONCLUSION: the information Fowler has to impart would be useful for those who don't know it; but typically these will be beginning programmers, and they may well be confounded by the broken example code at the beginning of the book.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I am sorry that they are not releasing both versions,  but George Lucas told us all that the special edition version was the version he originally wanted to release.

Most people are clamoring for more deleted scenes and extra material...these are the same people who say that Lucas has destroyed the movie by adding material to it.<br />I agree with the person earlier who said...\\"thank god, now I can get rid of my VCR.\\"<br />Those of you who think that this re-release of the special edition is sacreligous, shouldn't buy it...go watch it on your Betamax or laser disk player, afterall you were probably pissed when they put it on VHS and released the THX version that changed the sound.<br />I personnaly cant wait to show it to my kids who will be able to enjoy it for years and years...BRAVO George Lucas for getting off your duff and releasing it...finally!
B0000041Z6|3.0|It has taken me a long time to really make my final verdict on Solti's interpretations of the Mahler symphonies.  There are so many contradictions in Solti's interpretations.  He seems at one moment distanced and uninterested and then seconds later the music is on fire.  Indeed, these are fascinating performances, not because Solti brings some divine insight.  Rather, it is fascinating to hear Mahler performed so awkwardly.<br />I will admit that I initially felt some of the other reviews of this set were a bit harsh.  Solti is not the mediocre romantic that many have made him out to be.  These are by no means terrible performances.  The playing by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra is, as always, astounding.  Rarely do climaxes rise to such levels of intensity.  The brass is flawless in their execution, the winds strong and clear, the strings forceful.  As an orchestra, the Chicago Symphony brings a level of depth and incite to their parts that is hard to match.  The performances, in this regard, are wonderful.<br />Then we come to Solti's interpretations.  Its difficult to put into words what Solti does.  For the most part, these are not bad performances.  But they are extremely bland, overly dramatic, and lacking any real substance.  Solti does a poor job of interpreting these great works.  The subtleties of orchestration, the dynamic details, the emotion behind the work - all of this is lost in Solti's hands.  Solti seems to think, at times, that having a big and loud sound is all you need for Mahler.  Indeed, listen to the big symphonies, 2, 3, 6, etc., and you will notice that Solti really only has two dynamics, mf and fff.  This overly dramatic dynamic treatment of the symphonies actually takes away from the emotional experience of listening to Mahler.  Rather, Solti creates a bland sound that is sometimes loud and sometimes not but never is it interesting.  In a nutshell, these performances have all the bells and whistles, but none of the substance.  Solti brings little incite to these scores - we are left with extremely routine performances of Mahler.<br />There are so many other versions of the Mahler symphonies to turn to.  Bernstein on DG, although nearly three times as expensive, is a much safer bet.  Michael Tilson Thomas with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra has created some fascinating performances of Mahler.  Look to Solti for Wagner.  Mahler is completely lost on Solti.

There has never been a better, stronger, more beautiful Wendy than Rachel Hurd-Wood. Jason Isaacs as Capt. Hook is wicked, charming, attractive, and NASTY! He delivers some great lines along the way...&quot;Wendy.....Darling.&quot; The special effects are fantastic, the sets gorgeous, and Peter is really a great, fun, dirty boy instead of a girly-boy like in previous interpretations.

The first time I saw this movie was at a group meeting for alcoholics and the response was breathtaking it touches your soul and makes you feel the love and the pain and every other emotion possible. The title I must admit doesnt draw you to the movie because you figure *Oh just another romance with no point or purpose* but in reality there are both. This movie is one of my all time favorites and I would recommend it to anyone. Its not just a chick flick for all you guys out there:p Never Judge a book by its cover:)

B0001CCXZW|5.0|This is one of those once-in-a-lifetime TV events; a perfect marriage between brilliant writing and brilliant acting that produces the most wonderful, warm, brilliant show on television.  If I knew where Star's Hollow was, I'd move there.  I think a lot of us would.  (Yes, I know it's not real, but you'll be echoing the sentiment in no time.)<br />It's a treat to watch the pristine DVD transfers, without commercials (and with the parts that got chopped off for commercial space in reruns).  If you only buy one TV DVD this year, buy this one.  You won't just have found a DVD.  You'll have found a whole new wonderful world.
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|Yea, alot of people are giving this cd bad reviews because their women who don't appreciate what em raps about, but they're not the ones to rate a cd for its lyrics and beats. F**k em. This cd is great, there are so many different types of songs, so there is bound to be one that's your type. The lyrics are funny when their suppose to be funny, and serious when its suppose to be serious. The beats are great. Check out 1. Git up 3. Just like U 8. 6 in the Morning 9. How Come (my favorite) 16. 40 0z and 21. Keep Talkin
B000148KK2|2.0|I expected more,,a lot more. Boring songs..and lyrics..<BR>Live in Paris is one of the WORLD'S best recordings...The FEEL is what Diana is about.......Oh well...better luck next time..Thanks Al...You're great...Diana you are too,,not this time..Sorry
B00006L9ZT|4.0|Siegfried Jerusalem's Loge is utterly captivating (moreso, perhaps, than his Siegfried!): his Wagnerian tenor voice is matched in intensity with his acting. Levine's conducting is very accurate: he does not take the extended ritards (unfaithful to the text of the score) that seem to pervade the Boulez version. The stage direction is superb, with a single exception: Das Rheingold, scene one works very well (the set is excellent, the acting so-so) but the way the Rhinemaidens wave their arms and torsos around is just silly. The ending (traditionally problematic) is well-handled.
B0001Z53AQ|4.0|First I think half of the bad reviews are from haters that are just hating on EM and probably havent even listened to &quot;World.&quot; second this is a GOOD CD and if it wasnt I would say so, not just because I like or dis like EM. If you can gety the DVD edition get it its a great value a pretty funny look at the &quot;band&quot; on making the CD and then combined w/ 20 + tracks w/ only like 3 skits, cant go wrong. There are alot of great songs and tight lyrics. A couple throw a way tracks.
B00004DTLJ|3.0|Saxon, led by singer Biff Byford gave heavy metal a real fuel injection in the early 1980's, and their early albums are all classics that should be included in any metal fan's album collection. As the years went by, I guess Saxon became more and more eager to break into the American market where the British unpolished heavy metal hadn't appealed to the masses. \\"INNOCENT IS NO EXCUSE\\" (1985) is not Saxon's weakest album but it has a overall polished and more radio friendly approach suitable for American record buyers. Melodic tunes like \\"Back on the streets again\\" and \\"Call of the wild\\" are appealing , and the opening strong \\"Rocking again\\" together with the slow \\"Broken heroes\\" are the best songs on the album. Half of the material is good while the other half is not up to Saxon's previous standard (the dreadful debut album excluded). If you like Def Leppard's \\"Pyromania\\" and Quiet Riot's \\"Metal health\\", I bet you'll find this album enjoyable.
B00003CXA2|5.0|There is something about this movie. The moment I began watching it I felt good. It's amazing how by accident so many good things can happen to a man. Now Forrest Gump is not a smart man but he sure has a great life. This is the kind of movie that makes you laugh and makes you cry and just makes you feel plain out good. It's got everything, romance, action, drama, and comedy. This movie is just amazing, it puts a smile on your face. It just feels good to see this movie and you know that even if you aren't smart things can still turn out great. By the time this movie is over you'll wish it never ended.
B0001HAISG|5.0|We didn't see it in the Movie Theater... so we decided to buy it... WE'VE WATCHED IT 7 OR 8 TIMES SO FAR!!!!! <br />IT IS THE BEST VERSION OF PETER PAN EVER! The CGI work in the film is AWESOME!!! The music is BEAUTIFUL! The characters are ROCKAGE!!! AND IT IS SOOOOOOO WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY LIKE THE BOOK! It's just WOW!<br />Do not mistake this movie for a Disney Film... Disney would've killed it... UNIVERSAL ALL THE WAY!!<BR>If You haven't bought/rented/viewed it... YOU SHOULD!!
B000148KK2|3.0|There are a few songs that make the purchase worthwhile, but it is my least favorite of her CDs.  Marrying Elvis Costello may make her happy, but I do not believe that it has been beneficial to her career.  Diana, please go back to jazz and ballad standards.
B000002UDB|5.0|THIS WAS A GREAT CD FROM THE FAB FOUR FEATURING THE GREAT STRAWBERRY FIELDS FOREVER HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.FIVE STARS.
B000148KK2|5.0|Diana is always great. This CD is very special because it contains a number of self-penned songs, which are excellent.  Her incredible piano playing and voice are better than ever. It's wonderful to hear Diana doing new songs of her own -- she has a way of making them sound like the best of the old standards.  You'll enjoy this CD A LOT!
B00005JL96|1.0|I paid 22 dollars for what I thought would be a great Disney film.  The story line was disjointed, and certainly beyond what a young child could make any sense out of.  Lately Disney's M.O. seems to be: Make the animation using as few colors as possible i.e. (powder blue, brown, muted red, and possibly one or two other colors).  Many scenes in Stitch seem to have backdrops done in watercolor. DreamWorks and Pixar will be my choice for animation if this is the best Disney can do-they exhibit good color, depth of field, even if sometimes exaggerated,[ex. the trees in the background in certain scenes in Shrek had too much haze in an effort to simulate the contrast between the foreground and background] texture, and great sound. I'll keep The Lion King,<BR>Shrek and other quality animation DVDs, but Stitch and Atlantis have got to go. To digress for a moment, the animation in Atlantis was dark, used a limited amount of colors, and had unatural lines especially on body parts, i.e. squared off fingers and fingernails, squared off muscles and the like.  The 2.35:1 ratio was a nice touch in that I'm viewing it on a &quot;106&quot; screen through a projector.
B00008BXJG|5.0|Along with &quot;Powerage&quot;, this album is essential to any rock  music collection.  Compared to the previously mentioned &quot;Powerage&quot;, the songs here are shorter, tighter and more focused (where &quot;Powerage&quot; has some longer songs with a bit more riffage from Angus).  &quot;H.T.H.&quot; is arguably the most commercially accessible Bon Scott era album from the band; consequently this  should be the first purchase for anyone iterested in adding an AC/DC album to their collection.
B0000584V3|5.0|It's fortunate that I was introduced to Opeth by a friend who had the sense not to try and classify them. If she'd said &quot;black metal&quot; or &quot;death metal&quot; I might have been less inclined to listen. Fortunately she didn't, and I'm now the proud owner of all the albums by this phenomenal group.<br />Being relatively new to Opeth, I couldn't say if there is a &quot;best&quot; album, but Blackwater Park is a superb one without any question. The sheer amount of great riffs, melodies, beats and vocals (yes, he does growl, but when he sings clean, he has a wonderful voice) is quite amazing. Unlike many bands, for whom the idea of contrasting loud and soft is nothing more than a gimmick, the heavy stuff here is as good as any metal band you could name, and the soft stuff is genuinely gorgeous to listen to. The acoustic &quot;Harvest&quot; is a great song, and the guitar lines on &quot;Bleak&quot; are inventive, powerful and mesmerising. The title track itself is another standout track, flowing from soft to hard with no sense of difficulty at all. But really there is so much on offer here that it is pointless to single out individual tracks.<br />Opeth will, if there is any justice, gain a reputation as one of the most important bands in recent memory. In terms of variety, musical skill and inventiveness there are few around who can get close.
B000148KK2|5.0|Diana's new CD takes her in another direction that continues to show her very versatile talents.  Just as the greats from the past, Ella, Sarah, and Carmen showed their talent by varying from their usual jazz venue to show their expertise in show tunes, blues, pop and other varied styles; Diana is able to do the same.  Hope she follows up with her roots of jazz and also continues to experiment with other styles.  She can probably do it all!
078322687X|5.0|The breakfast club is by far one of the most funniest movies i have ever seen this movie right here is one of my personal favorites i mean i could watch this movie foreverit just keeps getting funnier everytime i see it there is just something about this film that makes me like it and makes me want to see it again u know how many times i have rented this puppy about 14 times untill i couldnt take it anymore and i bought this beauty i could watch this movie forever im serious. because it was just such a excellent movie. I brought this movie to school one day so we could watch it in our class everyone loved it and everyone was laughing their heads off . I highly recommend this film to anyone. No wait a minute, Im serious here, I STRONGLY, HIGHLY,HONESTLY,SERIOUSLY,TRUTHFULLY RECOMEND this movie to anyone. THIS MOVIE ROCKS!
630441403X|3.0|I like this movie and recommend it. Something to watch when you're alone late at night. Good acting by the talented Cage <BR>&amp; Shue. Makes an impression on you.
0553106635|5.0|This Book is by far the best of the series so far. Mr. Martin's ability to captivate the read is unmistakable.  I would recommend \\"A Song of Fire &amp; Fire\\" Series to anyone who likes fantasy.  Theses Books are AWESOME!! HANDS DOWN!!
B000002B1M|5.0|Not as good as \\"Illmatic\\" but it's still really really good.  In my opinion Nas is way better than Jay-Z.  I think Nas is one of the best rappers of all time.  I don't know if his record sales show it but his lyrics do.  Nas's lyrics do all the talking on this album.  All rap fans will love this album so I suggest you all pick this one up.  Believe me, it's hot.  The best songs are \\"Shootouts\\" and \\"The Set Up.\\"<br />Album Intro (Intro)<BR>The Message-5/5<BR>Street Dreams-4/5<BR>I Gave You Power-5/5<BR>Watch Dem Niggas-4/5<BR>Take It In Blood-5/5<BR>Nas Is Coming-5/5<BR>Affirmative Action-5/5<BR>The Set Up-5/5<BR>Black Girl Lost-4/5<BR>Suspect-4/5<BR>Shootouts-5/5<BR>Live Nigga Rap-4/5<BR>If I Ruled The World-5/5
055357342X|5.0|I just want to answer a point raised in an earlier review about some of the language belonging more to gangster rap than medieval times. Actually many of the four-letter words (I assume that is what the reviewer was referring to) can be found in Shakespeare - his plays were after all written to entertain the masses. <BR>Anyway about the book. The only down side I can think of is the neverending wait for book 4, as this one ends on such a cliffhanger. I also want to know whether my hunches about Jons true parentage are correct - we'll see. As has been mentioned in hundreds of other reviews, it is the fact that none of the characters are clearly good or evil that has gotten me so hooked on this series. I personally have high hopes for Jaime despite the despicable things he has done. So keep writing Martin!
B0000TLA9G|3.0|Finally! A greatest hits collection for Guns N Roses! (Live Era doesn't count). There is no way to include all of their songs onto one disc. Therefore there are many songs missing. Some of which include &quot;Mr. Brownstone,&quot; &quot;Dust N' Bones,&quot; &quot;Coma,&quot; and &quot;Estranged.&quot; Space is wasted to make room for an awful &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; remake and a mediocre cover of Bob Dylan's &quot;Knockin' On Heaven's Door.&quot; If a two-disc set would come out there should also be &quot;Double Talkin Jive,&quot; &quot;So Fine, &quot;14 Years&quot; and something else to represent AFD; maybe &quot;You're Crazy&quot; or &quot;My Michele.&quot; Don't waste your money on this, even to get a G'N'R'S poster, instead buy their three full length albums and if you like acoustic or live get g'n'r Lies.
B0001VWP8I|5.0|This woman has it all: An amazing, powerful, expressive, and unique voice, great song writing skills, and the looks of a world class model! Some may call her voice overpowering, and her music overproduced, but who needs them! Anastacia has an incredible range and can easily mold herself to different styles and tempos of music. Just stunning! Already huge overseas, North America has not embraced Anastacia the way Europe has. Why? The only reason I can come up with is that Sony has not done their job in promoting Anastacia the way she should be. How can they expect an artist to make a name in North America if they just sit back and relax? I wish more people knew about this lady, for her talent is very much overlooked.
B0001Z53AQ|4.0|no this isn't a devils night it's way better. I love pretty much everything Eminem does and produces but when d12 is all together it's off the hook. by the way to all those hating saying the Eminem camp is garbage cause it's disrespectful to woman, this reveiw is coming to you by a WOMAN bay-be!
1592400876|5.0|My sister gave this to me for my birthday.  I have been living under a rock, so I had not yet heard of this book.  When I opened it, I said, &quot;Wow.  A book about punctuation.  Thanks, Ashley.&quot;  I thought it was one of those gifts people give English grads, because they've run out of other ideas.  My mom quickly jumped in and said, &quot;No, I've heard it's supposed to be really good.&quot;  I gave it a chance, and aside from the less than stellar Frank McCourt intro, I fell in love with the book.  Previous to this, I would have laughed at the idea of a funny and interesting book about punctuation.  I find that I am unable to stop thanking my sister, and I will probably be giving this book as a gift to all my friends.  They will read it and like it.
B000002TQV|4.0|the bends is a great radiohead album. if you want to check out radiohead before they become experimental with OKC, check out the bends. people say the bends has some of the best rock songs from radiohead. and also mellow songs such as [nice dream], bulletproof, and street spirit. the only song i dont like is 'sulk'. the ONLY reason i gave this only four stars is that it just doesn't have the amazing creativity and experimental like OKC and Kid A. if you are just getting into radiohead, get The bends first!!! and you'll love it, but soon after you buy their later albums... you may stop listening to it.
B0001Z53AQ|1.0|This is absolutely the worst most boring hip hop cd i have ever purchased.  Eminem is talented . . . H*ll the group may even be talented but you wouldnt know it from this album.  Do not buy the album just go to the D12 website and it will play the My Band single automatically if thats what you want to hear.<br />This album is garbage and boring to say the least.<BR>Dont waste your money like i did.
1594200106|5.0|I finished reading this intensely seductive and rewarding masterpiece two days ago. Since then I've been unable to get it out of my mind, and I think you won't either. The characters, the plot and specially the extremely powerful and clever brand of storytelling deployed here seem to have left me under a spell that I can't remember experiencing  with any other book I've read in the last 25 years. The promise of the magic first few pages, a stunning and seductive journey to a wonderful place called \\"the cemetery of forgotten books\\", not only doesn't let down, but steadily builds up into a magnificent  saga of intrigue, romance, passion, murder, satire and even spine-chilling touches of gothic suspense. This is literature of the highest order, but I think it is also the most intelligent, often wickedly so, piece of entertainment I've come across. It manages to be at the same time an epic love story, a spellbinding mystery about enigmatic books, a meditation on the power of literature and the boundaries between fact and fiction and a grand saga in the tradition of the 19th century classics. I could see a lot of Dickens and Victor Hugo here, but somehow powered and intensified by an mesmerizing cinematic drive that places the reader inside the story and its world. I read for hours on end, marveled by the language, the wonderfully drawn characters and the many secrets of the story. I felt echoes of Poe, Borges, Garcia Marquez, Eco, Wilkie Collins, Balzac and many others. But the voice here was entirely original, unique, unlike anything else I've read before. And modern, very modern, despite the references to those classic novels. I think a book like this comes once in a reader's lifetime. It becomes much more than a engrossing read, it reminds you why you are a reader and makes you much more aware of the power of great literature to touch your life. Above all, I don't remember having this much fun in ages, and at the same time I was moved, sometimes to tears, sometimes to terror, sometimes to hysterical laugh, beyond what I had thought a book could take me to. As I was reaching the conclusion, I felt I did not want it to end. I would reread scenes or chapters, much like young Daniel does in the novel when he finds the book that will change his life. In many ways this shadow of the wind made me a young Daniel, made me experience again the thrills of first love, the times when life held mystery and promise and I dreamed some day I could find and experience such a extraordinary work of fiction as this one. I recommend this novel 100%. I would even urge you to read it and not miss what most possibly will be one of the most intense, engrossing, rewarding and magical experiences in your life as a reader.o terror, sometimes to hysterical laugh, beyond what I had thought a book could take me to.

068484267X|4.0|Although angela's ashes is a really sad book, the author writes everything with a light sense of humor. And as much as he tells us about the hardships of his childhood and how tough life at home was, he doesnt fail to stick in a good anecdote or two about school  or him and his brothers. I really enjoyed this book, and i think that the author did a really good job of getting a not so bright story across without making the book a total sob-fest.
B000002J0G|5.0|Now I know that alot of you all out there missed Alex on this album, but I didn't even know he wasn't on this album till I saw the inner sleeve of the cd. I like the fact that they progressed alot on this cd and Chuck Billy's growl sounds killer. With track like Chasing Fear and Greg Christian 's killer bass solos on Uritsukidojo it is a must have for fans of Testament's older material.Progression is a good thing and maybe their sound changed a little bit but at least they didn' take it up the ass from MTV like Metallica did and stayed true to their sound. Five stars way high
0790729628|5.0|I have watched this movie 20-30 times and still I get something out of it. I originally saw Blade Runner is the the theatre and was blown away with it.  This is one of those rare movies that there is no need to fast forward any of the parts.  A rarity with movies, even today.  The cast is awesome, the script is awesome, and the way the movie was done is awesome.  Both versions are well made, although I would recommend the standard version for the casual viewer.  This is a movie well worth purchasing and a must for ANY DVD collection.  Anyone who views and/or purchases Blade Runner will NOT be disappointed.
1592400876|5.0|There's something in this book for everyone.  I found myself reading Ms. Truss' (should there be an apostrophe there or not?)book and laughing out loud, as well as saying, \\"I can relate to that!\\"  The reader will certainly learn some things about the history and evolution of punctuation, get some lessons on what not to do the next time they write, and laugh when they read what the simple slip of a comma can do.  The authour's style of writing is most definitely British, so American readers will notice some nuances in sentence structure as well as spelling, but as a Brit myself, I found it delightfully refreshing. Read it you'll like it! It's entertaining, educational and helpful. I have recommended it or shared with several of my colleagues who like to write.
B000005RTG|5.0|Here is why \\"Come Taste The Band\\" is the BEST Purple album.<br />1. Tommy Bolin was a better guitarist and song writer than Ritchie Blackmore.<br />2. The album works as a WHOLE, and builds into a finale rivaled only by(in a VERY different way) 'Hard Lovin' Man' from \\"In Rock\\".<br />3. Coverdale, for ONE album (\\"Come Taste The Band\\") sounds BETTER than Ian Gillan.<br />4. Glenn Hughes and Tommy Bolin were the greatest duo to ever grace a Purple album(JUST LISTEN TO 'Gettin' Tighter'!!!)<br />5. The album recieved virtually NO airplay, but after about 2 listens you can hum every damn song....<br />6. \\"Come Taste The Band\\" acts as a showcase for each members(Coverdale, Bolin, Hughes, Lord, Paice) unique talents, and offers a BALANCE often lacking in the Blackmore controlled albums.<br />7. The story behind the album is by far the most interesting of any Purple album. This line-up and album SHOULD have sucked!!! But instead, with the help(?) of massive amounts of cocaine, Bolin's innovations, a lack of Blackmore's ego and control, and a frighteningly brilliant BOND between ALL the players on this particular album, \\"Come Taste The Band\\" stands out as a perfect product. It almost makes you cry at the fact that this Purple line-up only released ONE album. It DOES make you cry that Tommy Bolin(possibly the greatest guitar prodigy of the 70's) died of an overdose a year later.<br />8. In memory of Bolin, this album stands as a memorial to his ability to work with ANY band. Even one as ego-filled as Deep Purple. Come Taste This Album. DO NOT DISMISS IT LIKE SO MANY OTHER PURPLE FAN FOOLS!!!! The album is a 10 outta 10, just like everything else Tommy Bolin was associated with.
B0000CFW87|3.0|There is no doubting that Groban has a very nice voice, but as another reviewer has said - anyone can go to a broadway production and hear the exact same quality of voice.<br />As a professional singer, I wonder when he will ever come out of all the heavily mixed and post-produced recordings and let us hear his real voice?  If he's studied music for real, let him release a simple CD of true vocal music.  I think we would all be either suprised or horified... but it would be a nice change from the overwhleming synths and tacky Celine Dion string arrangements.

B000000OQF|5.0|\\"Anything Goes\\" not withstanding, this album is flawless.  Every riff is perfect.  Every lyric rings true.  Every solo encapsulates the fire that runs through the entire record.  <br />In fact, APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION is so damn good that us abused GNR fans continue to forgive Axl like we're battered women or something.
B00006690G|5.0|everyone knows by now, whether you like him or not, that eminem has serious talent. He is absorbed in his music and his genius is displayed in each of his songs. This album is certainly no exception. Unlike most rappers who seem to diminish in talent as their career progresses (through growing arrogance, or laziness), you can actually see eminem growing into the world's greatest rapper. Because thats what he is. I'm sorry to all you african americans out there but a white boy is the best rap talent in the world now, and you better come to terms with that.<BR>Every song on this album is a piece of art, and Eminem is the man. BUy it, you may be horrified, but you will be enthralled.
0142004235|4.0|This is a beautiful but brutal story of sibling rivalry, parent-child relationships, and the inherent good and evil in each one of us.  The novel spans three generations of the Trask family, beginning with the amoral patriarch Cyrus, who invents himself as a heroic soldier but is actually a thieving failure in the army.  His two sons--Charles and Adam--recreate the story of Cain and Abel.  Charles is smart and bitter over his father's obvious preference for Adam.  Adam is naive and unimpressed by his father's affections.  Adam marries the beautiful but sociopathic prostitute Cathy, who sleeps with Charles on their wedding night and shoots Adam after bearing twins.  The twins--Cal and Aron--recreate the story of Charles and Adam in a pathetic and depressing historical retread.<br />The overall theme of this tale is that each person has good and evil within them, and must consciously choose the moral path.  Steinbeck rejects the idea that a person is inherently good or evil and has no control over his destiny.  Even the evil Cathy ultimately recognizes her immorality, and seems to regret having no love in her life.<br />I found the characters dealing with Cathy to be the most interesting.  Cathy and Lee were the most finely developed character in the novel for me. Though Cathy is primarily \\"evil\\" and Lee is primarily \\"good\\", both characters contained complexities and contradictions more finely tuned than those that were present in, for example, Adam Trask and Samuel Hamilton.<br />I can't help but compare this epic novel to Steinbeck's other opus, The Grapes of Wrath.  I enjoyed the Grapes of Wrath more, because the characters were more multi-dimensional and the story more fluid.  Here the characters seemed like symbols more than actual people--pawns in Steinbeck's obvious allegory.    Nevertheless, this novel is worth your time to read.  It contains beautiful prose and thought-provoking ideas.  This highly ambitious novel succeeds on many levels, and is a pleasure toread and ponder.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|This was an awesome movie.  I am definetly buying this when it comes out.
B00005JMSE|5.0|I saw all the previews of Hellboy long before the movie came out and I was skeptical of the movie. I had never heard of Hellboy, the previews looked a little cheesy, and the comic book was slightly bizarre to say the least. However, as more previews came out, I became a little curious as to what the final movie would be like. I got so intrigued by the character of Hellboy I even bought a Kotobukiya vinyl model of him just because he looked so incredible.<br />Opening day came and I had big expectations for the movie since the last few previews were more exciting than the previous ones. When the movie started, it was kinda bizarre at first with all this magic and hocus pocus and nazi's running around trying to destroy the world and what not. However, as the movie progress, it just got better and better. John Myers was Hellboy's new caretaker and his reaction to first meeting Hellboy was my reaction to the whole movie. Wow. From the first fight to the final scene, everything fell into place and made me truly enjoy this movie going experience. Hellboy was not only one of the most incredible bad ass characters, he was funny at all the right times too. Anyway, I don't want to give too much of the movie away, but trust me, you can't go wrong by going to see this movie. The jokes, the action, the bad guys, the good guys, everything about this movie, even the loose scenes just either make you laugh out loud, or cheer on Hellboy to the end. A must see.

B0000AGWJ7|5.0|This has to be the best album of last year, it's utterly amazing! First M.Shadows' voice, his growling voice is great,but in his normal voice he's outstanding! The Rev's drumming will rock your socks off! The guitar's are o.k. but they are all power E chords! The bass isn't fair to judge, because you can't hear it.<br />My Favorite songs:<BR>1.Chapter Four<BR>2.Unholy Confessions<BR>3.I Won't See You Tonight,Part 1<BR>4. Second Heartbeat<BR>5.And All Things Will End<BR>6.Clairvoyant Disease<br />Also they said they hope to get out their next album early next year.
B0000D96NW|5.0|As a fan of Machine Head since Burn My Eyes, I always expect each album to get better than the next.  Supercharger was a let down after 'The Burning Red', but I still believed in this band.  Cut to the point, 'Through The Ashes Of Empires' is their best since their debut.  This is how true metal should sound.  Machine Head have stuck to their guns and made an album that destroys all the nu-metal posers of today.  If there's one album to buy this year, this is it.
0446613444|5.0|This is Michael Connelly's second book and - like his first - features Harry Bosch as its central character. Little has changed for Bosch in the eighteen months since the events of &quot;The Black Echo&quot;. He's still a jazz-loving loner who's happy to bend the rules, while his taste for coffee, beer and cigarettes remains undiminished. <br />As the book begins, it's Christmas Day and our hero is at home, alone and on call. Monitoring police / fire / ambulance radio messages on his scanner, he picks up a message regarding an apparent homicide within Hollywood boundaries that is being dealt with directly by RHD. Despite the fact that it's Christmas, Bosch isn't too happy that he wasn't notified first - as he should've been, according to protocol. Arriving uninvited at the scene of the crime, he tries to edge his way into things. At first glance, it's an apparent suicide involving Cal Moore, another cop working out of the Hollywood Division's narcotics unit. Although they worked in the same department, Bosch didn't know Moore that well. They'd only spoken properly once, about a stalled case Bosch was working : the murder of a drugs runner called Jimmy Kapps. Bosch was hoping Moore could give him a few leads - about the drug he was smuggling in from Hawaii, called Ice, and possible rival gangs who may have been responsible for his death. Bosch was aware, however, he'd had a few problems - including a possible showdown with IAD. Bosch's only involvement in the case, however, is informing Moore's widow. <br />The following day, Bosch's boss - Harvey '98' Pounds - tells him to stop working the Kapps case and to keep away the Moore case. One of Bosch's fellow homicide detectives, Lou Porter, has decided to retire on stress related grounds - though it has been commonly known for some time that Porter had a drinking problem. Pounds has assigned Porter's cases to Bosch in the hope that Bosch will be able to clear at least one of them by New Year's Eve. Things soon become complicated though - Bosch's investigations constantly bring Cal Moore back into the equation. Of Porter's cases, he settles on the murder of an unidentified Mexican, whose corpse has been found dumped beside the kitchen door of a diner. Although it was Porter's case, Cal Moore had found the corpse. Not long afterwards, Bosch is contacted by Moore's former colleagues - Moore had left a file for Bosch's attention, with some information regarding the Kapps case. The information throws up some interesting coincidences - and Bosch doesn't believe in coincidences. Now believing that Moore case isn't a straightforward suicide, he believes that the cases are so tightly connected that in solving one he'll solve them all. <br />Like Connolly's first book, I found this a very enjoyable story. Although this is the second book to feature Harry Bosch, it's not entirely necessary to have read the books in order. There's nothing in it that'll have any major impact on this story - but I would recommend reading &quot;The Black Echo&quot; first. It will clarify a couple of minor points and cover some parts of Harry's background.
0679428895|5.0|Eminently readable and encompassing a break-neck pace, \\"Pompeii\\" by Robert Harris is a delightful, action-filled novel that also has a unique historical side that should appeal to all readers. Under the aegis of the imminent eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in Roman dominated Italy in 79 A.D., Harris presents us with Marcus Attilius, a young Roman engineer who's suddenly charged with oversight of the massive Aqua Augusta when it's former manager disappears inexplicably and with troubleshooting of a seemingly damaged section of the Augusta. <br />Right from the start, subtle clues and occurances force Attilius to consider that this is not a normal maintenance project. Coupled with the rougue state of the characters under his command, Attilius sets out to find whats wrong with his beloved Augusta. Character development and subtle plot twists overlay the coming disaster and Harris is superb at describing Roman life and 1st century Italy as it fits this story. What Attilius discovers and how he finds himself ensconsed in the tragedy is brilliantly depicted by Harris...we not only get a first-rate thriller, but an important geology lesson as well (Harris supplements each chapter with an excerpt from his various sources of scholarship on Volcanology).<br />The apex of this work is without doubt the eruption of Vesuvius and how each character is then affected. Using the afore mentioned sources of Volcanology, Harris paints a truely realistic picture of what that massive explosion was like and the immediate after-affects on the towns and country-side. Without giving too much of the ending away, Harris provides an entertaining and plausible conclusion that should please all readers.<br />Whether your interested in geology, Roman history or just enjoy an action-filled read, \\"Pompeii\\" should satisfy all these needs. Robert Harris is to commended for expert research and sublime story-telling that should make Pompeii not only a great story, but an important source on the Vesuvius eruption. I would not hesitate to recommend this work very highly.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly's early demise guaranteed it would never get a decent airing over here in the UK. I discovered it by accident on ebay, while searching for Buffy rarities, and, trusting Joss Whedon, came her to find out more. And bought it.<br />A truly amazing series; obvious from the pilot what the potential was, obvious that Mutant Enemy had a surefire hit, but also clear that it would be a slow burner. The characters and the acting are simply amazing, and the production team deserved more than one award.<br />As Whedon claims on the DVD, this was a new way of telling a story. And a good one. All credit to the team for not giving up on it, and all credit for taking it to a studio with just a little faith and imagination. <br />A great series, and a fine DVD. Gimme The Movie ...
B0001HAHXW|2.0|Robert Johnson is an artist who we simply don't know. With only a handful of recordings and a spattering of tales that have been passed down through the years, there's just no way we can know the man; so we fashion a legend. <br />Johnson's recordings are stark and terrifying, due more to what we don't know about him than we what we do. The gates of the mind are thrown ajar and the imagination is allowed to run free with the apparent pain and sorrow dripping from this man, his guitar, and the empty crackles of old recordings. Bottom line, no one's got a right to do Johnson. He's a singular entity, a surprising phenomenon of a time long past, and there's a nary man who should be singing his music. Dammit, Clapton, don't pretty up such a good legend!<br />Granted, John Hammond, Jr. gets as close as anyone to channeling Johnson through his playing, but he's certifiably obsessessed and Clapton certainly ain't. Where unconsciously or not, Clapton's playing up an image, and if he's going to make an album as bland and over-produced as this, he doesn't have a clue as to what Robert Johnson is or what he represents. Clapton, judging by this record, just isn't a devil-fearing troubadour with a heart unafraid to admit either its wickedness or tenderness. And he damn well shouldn't try to be. <br />If you do like this, though, and you haven't heard Mr. Robert Johnson, buy the Complete Recordings and give him a shot. It's taxing, but well worth it.
0743424425|2.0|Something about Stephen King's style of story telling has always drawn me to his work - both the horror genre and otherwise.  Although The Shining is one of the Stephen King classics that helped build his fan base, it just wasn't written in a voice that was true to the characters.  Much of the story is told through the eyes of the telepathic 5-yr old, Danny.  King failed to portray the language and thought processes of a child convincingly.  The reader is forced to perceive Danny as an adult's interpretation of how a child would speak and think.
1592400876|4.0|I tremble at the thought of writing a review for this book; nevertheless, I'll attempt it. One the one hand, it was a real joy to read (and learn) of someone else out there who had a categorical whole-body shiver when sighting such atrocities as &quot;book's for sale&quot;. On the other hand, I learned of far too many mistakes I make, daily, throughout my own writings and musings.<BR> <BR>It is Truss's wit that keeps you reading. Her deft touch with hyperbole is extremely funny (though, at times, you wonder if she really does think the aspiring grammatical terrorist would indeed require camo' pants and a gun). Her examples leave one smiling; I can't help but feel a complete sense of comissery with her annoyance of the title Who Framed Roger Rabbit (no question mark). <BR> <BR>It's a guilty pleasure: you shouldn't enjoy being so cruelly holier-than-thou. I couldn't help it. Even at dinner with the new (and distracting) Mr. Dude, I had to pause and point out that our menu was telling us to vacate. We ordered the dish anyway, and quite enjoyed our &quot;stuffed spinach leave&quot;.<BR> <BR>Long live the revolution!<BR> <BR>'Nathan *<BR> <BR>* so written as I am technically named Jonathan; hence, the apostrophe holds the place of the letters 'J' and 'O'.
B000000OAC|4.0|Queen is my favorite band, they are diverse, fun, cheeky, and pioneers in the art of recording and songwriting. This album proves to be no different..<br />\\"News Of The World\\" is a collection of songs put together that show a band that is out to 'prove' they can keep up with the 'punks' that were all the craze in '77... Although I'm not sure what they needed to prove! \\"News..\\" contains Hard biting, unique pop/rock, blues rock, acoustic pop, and artistic ballads.<br />What sets this album apart from all other Queen albums comes down to two elements: The production/mixing value and songwriting showcasing..<br />- The production on each track is excellent... Each performance has a loose sound which gave the whole album it's 'garage-band' sound. Each instrument is played with attitude and every vocal part has a certain raw energy giving the tracks more 'Rock' intensity than Queens earlier output. Sheer Heart Attack alone is proof of that. But the melody inside each song never loses it's luster through the rock pomp. The production is the crucial element of success for this album because it brought all the diverse tracks together and made this album sound 'cohesive' and 'fluent'.<br />- That brings us to the next element which is the 'diverse songwriting'. This album truly showcases the styles of writing for each member of Queen thats been there through their entire reighn...: Freddies Over the top anthems/sexually charged lyrics, Brians Love for blues/hard rock/artistic balladry, Johns storyline lyrics/simple-lovable melodies, and Rogers love for funky, dirty rock and roll. This is the backdrop for all Queen releases showing the influence each member had on the music they did..  (Ever thought of that?!?)<br />A lot of fans consider this album a favorite of theirs (it's one of mine), and some even discard it. As a musician, the energy throughout inspires me every time I hear it, and It will always be a favorite Queen release of mine..<br />All The Best, The AndyMan!  ;o)
B00005QIPH|4.0|When these guys released the first single, &quot;Last Night,&quot; I wasn't impressed. Not because I felt that they were ripping off Velvet Underground-my reason was even worse...I was still trying to enjoy my oh-so-tough nu-metal. Well, two years later, after witnessing Spin magazine devote every issue to these guys, I bought the second release and loved it. Naturally I had to go get this one. Though not that much different, &quot;Is This Is It&quot; is the better one. My lyric interpretation of this song is that poor, pretty boy Julious wants to smash, yet his date has got him jumping thtough hoops to do so. We've all been there. There is plenty of cocky swagger on this album. They do indeed sound like rich kids who need a punch or two. &quot;New York City&quot; Cops, which has a differnt name on the U.S release, addresses the intelligence of the NYPD. It's quite ironic that I got into a wreck while playing this song and the cops were actually cool. My favorite track &quot;Take It Or Leave It,&quot; is pure punk glory. (I think) it refers to some jealous dude that's mad cause his girl's eyeing New York's coolest band. This is great stuff. Sometimes it sounds proto-punk, sometimes post-punk. These labels kill me. All in all, it's worth the hype.
B000000993|5.0|This Cd is fantastic! It is one of the best rock albums of all time by one of the best Rock groups, Tool. Of course without Maynard james Keenan, Tool would be good, but he takes them that step further above the rest. The lyrics are both haunting and overwhelming, and the way in which MJK sings them adds to the whole picture. The guitars have a very gritty atmosphere about them which helps the whole grunge prospect from Tool. Undertow, is, like any Tool fan should know, completely unique, as is all other Tool albums. Never expect a similar album from Tool.<br />Undertow is possibly the most aggresive, although Opiate has the most aggressive lyrics, but in Undertow Tool have advanced. Aenima has much more depth and layering, but Undertow is just great hard rocking stuff!<br />Nice One Tool.
038533348X|5.0|Put this review down at once, it is nothing but foma!  You there, sitting in your granfallons, thinking you know your karass, but really living out a wrang-wrang.  Shame on you!  If you want to know your zah-mah-ki-bo, read this book.  But never, never drink a cold, refreshing drink poured gingerly over a nice tall glass of ice-nine.

B000050XEI|5.0|&quot;Who in their right mind would call this cool?!!!&quot;<BR>See next.<br />&quot;I could probably fall asleep to this in two milliseconds.&quot;<BR>That's cool.<br />&quot;This music is for wimps.&quot;<BR>There are normal people between wimps and hardcores, accept it or not, it's always so. And what's even more, they are the majority.<br />&quot;If you want REAL music (not this new age crap), listen to some heavy metal, like ...&quot;<BR>I tell you what REAL music is. REAL music for each REAL individual is the music that is a REAL appeal for that person! If heavy iron or copper appeals to you, you can take them as your REAL music.<br />&quot;This music is for losers!&quot;<BR>True only if you are the only winner.<br />In my opinion, this album is really pleasing.
B000000OAH|3.0|Queen is my favorite band of all time. They are diverse, cheeky, fun, extremely talented, and above all pioneers in the art of recording and songwriting.<br />Jazz is an album that finds Queen at the end of their 70's over-the-top expiremental phase. It contains all the early trademarks that made their sound so great.. &quot;Jazz&quot; is definately not Queens strongest output (fill in your own album here)... However, what makes this album different than the others is how 'fun' the album sounds. Most of Queen's work sounds as if they've had something to prove, where 'Jazz' sounds like they were having the time of their lives recording it. Each track is unique and cheeky in their own extravagant ways, but the arraingements sound very sophisticated and well thought out. It is a very brittish-sounding album, compared to the american-esque &quot;News Of The World&quot; the year before.<br />On the other hand, my only complaint about this album is the overall 'production/mixing'. As a musician, I don't particularly enjoy the way the guitars and drums were recorded. The drums tend to have a 'boxy' or 'clunky' sound to them, whereas the guitars are mid-rangey and muddy throughout. They are no where near how crisp Brians guitar work has been in the past, but then again this is what makes Queen unique. None of their albums sound the same!<br />So when you buy this (and you will!), listen to it front to back. You'll hear the cheekyness and fun they had, and you'll hear a band that is at the pinnacle of excess and sucess (and it shows with their 'I don't care' attitudes). Hopefully the production value won't hinder your opinion of the album too much..<br />All The Best,  -The AndyMan-  ;o)
B0000025DR|4.0|Comparisons between the sound of ELO and the sound of the late Beatles (Sgt. Pepper, Magical Mystery Tour) are not unfounded.  Yet ELO took the ideas flirted with by the Fab Four and made a hearty career of them, leaving behind several excellent recordings filled with swooping strings and galloping rhythms.  &quot;Face the Music&quot; is one of the best of these.  <br />Their sound may not have been totally original, but they broke new ground in several directions with the germ of an idea (hard rock with strings) that the Beatles had begun; ELO took it one step frther by making the string section a permanent part of the band, featuring virtuoso violinist Mik Kaminsky.  While a few other groups were using this instrument to varying degrees of success (Kansas, Shooting Star, Pavlov's Dog), ELO had a pair of cellists as well, their backdrop as much an integral part of the sound as any other group's bass guitar.<br />FtM was the 5th LP from this group, the 4th since Jeff Lynne had taken leadership of the band from the restless Roy Wood, and it shows their continuing metamorphosis from a heavier-minded experiment into an extremely successful pop band with that special twist.  Naturally this caused them to begin to slowly fall from favor with the serious-minded critics of the day, those who never seem to understand that music can be intelligent and popular at the same time.  (I know, it's rare, but it does happen.)  <br />Their first #1 hit, &quot;Evil Woman,&quot; is here, along with the serene &quot;Strange Magic,&quot; the hard-rocking &quot;Poker,&quot; the funsy &quot;Down Home Town,&quot; and my personal favorite, &quot;Nightrider,&quot; which manages to be straight-ahead rock, yearning heartsick love song, and unforgettable hook-filled pop all at the same time.  If there's a weak track here, it might be &quot;One Summer Dream&quot; or &quot;Waterfall,&quot; though both are very listenable (they just don't stick in your mind as well).<br />While some of the group'sother outings are more consistently excellent, this is close enough that a 4-1/2 star rating would be right on target.  Nice cornerstone to a collection of any fan of '70s pop/rock.

B000000OA6|4.0|-- Everyone knows that Innuendo is the last album released before the death of Freddie and everyone has already spoke their mind on what they think you'll like about this album... I'm simply going to tell you my opinion on it and how it influenced me, and hopefully it will influence you to check this incredible recording out. Having said that, on to my personal view of this album --<br />Queen is my favorite band. They are diverse, fun, cheeky, melodic, excellent showmen, and are pioneers in the art of recording and songwriting.<br />&quot;Innuendo&quot; is one of those albums that (to me) sounds very dark, spacey, and emotional at the same time. A very brittish album, each track is very cheeky and over-the-top in the usual Queen fashion but comes through sounding fresh and unique to me... More so than most of their 80's output had. I feel that the songwriting brought the band full circle at last to the brilliance that they had captured in their earlier years.<br />If you listen to each track, you can tell that all four members were completely in touch (musically) with eachother. They understood the goal and were all working together to get the final product something they could all be proud of. Every song has it's own character, yet seems to flow together very well. That has to do with the production/arraingments of the tracks.<br />Now, there are only two tracks here that I feel just aren't quite up to par compared to the rest of them, but they are still good in their own right. (I won't mention them, I'll let you see if you can figure out which two that they are. I know everyone can agree on 1 of them!!)<br />Get this album, sit back, take a listen (very closely infact) and try to see what I mean. It's emotional and powerful, dark and spacey, and it leaves you wishing that this masterpiece wasn't the final chapter for her majesties Queen...<br />All the best, The AndyMan ;o)
B0001BKAEE|1.0|If you buy this DVD, you deserve what you get: a bad anime. The Matrix was brilliant, Reloaded was okay, kind of pushing it, but this...this was anime, pure and simple.<BR>The Wachowski brothers forgot what made the first movie such a hit: the philisophical and religious references. They used up the major ones in the Matrix, the interesting but unneeded ones in Reloaded, and had no soul left for Revolutions. So what is left is an hour and a half long fight scene that doesn't make sense. Apparently, when it comes to the final showdown between man and machine, the machines stop fighting and fly around in a figure-eight pattern, letting a measely pack of bipedal robots shoot at them for what feels like hours. And why attack robots don't have long-range weapons is beyond me. And Smith, the personification of a computer virus, doesn't behave like one. Hey, Smith! Neo can take on twenty of you at once, unscathed! Why in god's name are you even trying to fight him one-on-one?! Dramatic effect.<BR>Bad anime, for sure.<BR>But it goes beyond that. I'm sorry, people, but computers are incapable of actual emotion. Sure, you can simulate it all you want via software, but to have actual emotion, you need an electro-chemical biological machine. In other words, a brain. An actual lump of grey-pink flesh. This scientific fact makes the ending of Revolutions fall apart, since it's based on computers being capable of honor.The promise the Architect makes? It has no reason to keep it. With Neo dead (or at least incapacitated), it can keep the human race in its fold for as long as it feels like it. And if Neo's not dead, then that would mean Smith is still running loose, since they do exist because of one another. So this is, in effect, really titled The Matrix : No Resolutions.<BR>But sorry if I've ruined the ending. Frankly, there's not much there. If you want anime, save your fifteen bucks and go buy Street Fighter XXI or whatever and satisfy you need for bad acting and plotlines that serve soley to move on to the next painful duel scene.
0451524780|4.0|First I must make a note of the fact that this is the first and only Sherlock Holmes story I've read thus far. Therefore I cannot offer any kind of comparison between &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; and Doyle's other works. I will simply give you my thoughts about it as a story in and of itself.<br />The book is simply written and easy to understand, but the plot remains engaging throughout. It is not overly complicated, but neither is it too simplistic or predictable. The Baskerville family has passed down the legend of a giant black hound that plagues the residents of Baskerville Hall, bringing a swift end to any that dare venture alone onto the nearby moor at night. When Sir Charles Baskerville is found dead upon the moor with the pawprints of a large dog in the earth nearby, the case is presented to Sherlock Holmes in hopes of unraveling the mystery and ensuring the safety of Sir Charles's nephew and Baskerville Hall's new occupant, Sir Henry Baskerville.<br />Too busy to investigate the matter himself, Holmes sends his friend and assistant, Dr. Watson, out to Baskerville Hall in his stead. Watson is the narrator of the story, and we see threads of the mystery slowly unravel as he makes his reports back to Holmes. Other reviewers have complained about the fact that Holmes is not the central figure in this particular novel, but I actually liked the way the story was done. And as we find out toward the end of the book, Holmes actually plays a larger part than he initially appears to. I must admit, though, that it was a bit depressing to see Watson toil away at investigating and drawing conclusions only to have Holmes repeatedly inform him that his conclusions are wrong. Watson does most of the drudge-work but gets very little in return.<br />The style of the writing was very appealing to me. The story has a very dark, gothic feel, and is full of suspense. Doyle's descriptions make the eerie moor feel very real. For a book written a century ago, it is still very reader-friendly. The only part where I thought the book dropped off a little was in the last few chapters. For all the build-up and suspense, the climax of the story is much too short and quickly resolved, leaving a feeling of unreality. Also, Doyle concludes by having Holmes simply recite to Watson all the details of his sleuthing that were left out of the action of the book. I think the rule &quot;Show, don't tell,&quot; is a good one when it comes to literature, and I would rather have actually seen Holmes come to his conclusions as the story progressed.<br />Overall, though, I did enjoy the book, and look forward to reading more of Doyle's work. My one last word of advice regards this particular edition of the book (the 1993 Signet Classics printing with Afterword by Frederick Busch). There are numerous typos that really should have been caught and corrected before publishing (most, curiously, are instances where the letter &quot;t&quot; is inexplicably replaced with the letter &quot;b&quot;). I would recommend looking for a different version that is more competently edited.ll very reader-friendly. The only part where I thought the book dropped off a little was in the last few chapters.

0156027321|4.0|I read 95% of this with a healthy bit of sceptism.  The author started out describing his problems, in the first person. Then jumped to Pi's problems, in the first person.  This began to play like so many &quot;my so-called life&quot; stories. <BR>I couldn't quite figure out where he was going with Pi's &quot;religion of the day&quot; thing.  I thought I was getting somewhere when I came upon the &quot;castaway on a lifeboat&quot; story line with the bengalese tiger twist. The strange co-relationship between Richard Parker and Pi seemed to echo the theme of disparate religions residing in one person, a metaphor for societies struggles to accomodate rampant differentiation I guess.  But the real moral of the story came out in not so subtle fashion when Pi said &quot; As it is with God&quot;. It rang of Karl Marx and &quot;Religion is the opiate of the masses &quot;.  <BR>Can it be that God, in all its manifestations, is just a coping mechanism for a world to grim to contemplate??? How ultimately depressing...

B00003CXTG|2.0|. . .  of the worst war film ever produced.  The plot of this film is stretched so thin it's likely to break.  It certainly broke me from seeing any more trite films like it.  A hot pilot with poor vision stretches his career from illegally flying for the RAF [against the wrong model of Bf109] to being one of the two Warhawk pilots to get aloft during the Pearl Harbour attack to flying a Mitchell bomber in the propaganda raid against Tokyo!  Along the way he meets, gains and loses the girl.  Of course, he retrieves her again, but this is Hollywood.  What else could happen?<br /><br />As if the plot wasn't thin enough, some clown put Afleck in the lead role.  Someone should find Afleck a proper day job - cleaning the heads, dumping the honey wagon or robbing graves. Anything but putting him before a camera and inflicting that flat excuse for characterisation on an unsuspecting public.  None of the actors in this film are given a proper role, with the sole exception of Jon Voight.  Poor old Dan Ackroyd would have been super as the intelligence officer Ellis Zacharias, even if he is a bit plump for the part.  Instead, he plays some ephemeral naval officer championing the defense of Pearl instead of the Philippines or Marianas Islands.  Alec Baldwin is slipped in as Jimmy Doolittle, a role that, given the story line, should have been the lead.  But then, of course, all that romantic lead-up would have been wasted.  As was Baldwin.<br /><br />It's difficult to understand the intent in making this film.  All sense of why the Japanese launched the attack is blithely omitted.  Justified or not, we are left with only the \\"day of infamy\\" attitude.  There's relevance in presenting that, but Japan didn't launch the War of the Pacific on a whim.  Their purpose, in their view, was to prevent encirclement.  No lessons are to be derived from the story or the events portrayed.  There was heroism on both sides, but you'd never glean that from watching this.  Yamamoto's American experience and misgivings are overlooked, except for a single line.  The Emperor's role, which was significant, is also omitted.  The United States was attacked, suffering a terrible blow.  Any military historian will explain it was a blessing in disguise as attention was diverted from the ungainly battleships to more flexible carrier flotillas.  All this film portrays are implausible characters, a love story so trite as to be nauseating, and a surfeit of violence.

B00008RH3L|5.0|In the world of gangster movies, there are many titles that deserve to be on the list of the greatest ever.  Classics like THE GODFATHER, GOODFELLAS, and ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA are usually mentioned in the same breadth and deservedly so.  One film that also deserves to be on the list, and isn't but should be regardless, is MILLER'S CROSSING, the third feature from the highly talented Coen Brothers released in 1990.  The Coens are mostly known for their later-day masterworks like FARGO and THE BIG LEBOWSKI, not to mention their second film RAISING ARIZONA which starred Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter.  After seeing MILLER'S CROSSING for the first time, as well as numerous times after that, I have to say that this is their crowning achievement.  It's practically flawless from beginning to end; even most so-called \\"perfect\\" films have at least one or two small flaws in them.  Everything fires on all cylinders during all two hours of MILLER'S CROSSING, and if there's any flaw whatsoever, I can't find any.<br />Gabriel Byrne, in probably his best performance, stars as Tom Reagan, the wise right-hand man to Leo (Albert Finney), an Irish crime boss who is engaging in a turf war with his former protege turned rival Johnny Caspar (Jon Polito), the leader of the Italian mob.  In the first scene of the film, Johnny wants Leo to order a hit on a nervous nelly named Bernie (a terrific John Turturro) who he claims has been selling out his fight bets to various others, making him lose money in the process.  Leo refuses to do the favor for Caspar, since Bernie is the brother of his lover Verna (Marcia Gay Harden).  Tom thinks that not killing Bernie is a bad idea, but remains loyal to Leo and his decision.  However, Tom is also having an affair with Verna, and it begins to test his trust with Leo.  Caspar, meanwhile, orders a hit on Leo which fails miserably (in a hilariously bloody sequence with the music of the Irish song \\"Danny Boy\\" playing in the background), but that is notgoing to stop Caspar from trying to claim the throne.  When Tom finally confesses to Leo that he is sleeping with Verna, Leo is through with him for good.  This leaves an open door though.  Knowing all the angles from every side, Tom decides to play all of them, remaining loyal to Leo while getting all of his enemies out of the way, and to also pay off his enormous gambling debts.<br />This is about as far with the plot as I go.  The plot for the movie is very complicated, and you may need a second viewing to figure out what's going on, but this is one of those rare movies that rewards repeated viewings.  The plot itself is so well-written and it shows on screen.  There's a surprise lurking around every corner, but it never detracts from the story like most movies do.  It enhances the experience, which is the right way to go.  And thankfully, the Coens don't sacrifice character development, which helps because we really do care about these characters (yes, even the bad ones).<br />The performances are all top-notch.  Gabriel Byrne is perfect as Tom, a man who has the brains and chops to be a leader, and isn't as big of a sap as Leo, yet decides to stay in the shadows until called for.  He also lets his flaws be known and doesn't want to be forgiven for them, which is refreshing considering that in this lifestyle, flaws are usually seen as a virtue.  Albert Finney is both tough and vulnerable as Leo. He can be downright sweet with his friends, and be very vicious with a tommy gun if he gets his hands on one.  Marcia Gay Harden is slinky and seductive as Verna - so much so that you can't tell what her motives are and which side she's on.  John Tuturro is awesome as Bernie, who develops him as a nebbish fellow in way over his head at first, but makes him more devious later on in the film and he turns out to be important to the plot than we realized.  Jon Polito is very funny as Caspar; J.E. Freeman is dark and menacing as Caspar's long-time friend and hit man Eddie Dane; and Steve Buscemi has a small cameo as Bernie's friend Mink, who also plays a vital part later on.<br />The set design and cinematography also warrant a mention.  The camerawork is just stunning in this movie, showing the 1930s atmosphere in all its lurid glory, and evoking the feel of a Dick Tracy comic book at the same time.  The buildings and stage sets also show what is was like at that time period, and makes you really feel like you're there.  Heck, even the dialogue crackles with the zing and style of what they must've said back then (almost everyone in the movie asks at some point, \\"What's the rumpus?\\").<br />This is as close to perfect as a movie is ever gonna get, in my opinion.  MILLER'S CROSSING is an absolute triumph in every sense of the word, and my only complaint about it is that it ends too soon like most great movies do.  Highly recommended.
0440180295|5.0|This book stunned me from start to finish...this was my introduction to Vonnegut and probably my favirote book that ive read by him.I love how Vonnegut can blend the two concepts of WW2 and the Aliens produced by Billy Pilgrims Schizophrenic mind.With those kind of ideas alot of times books are confusing and hard to follow but somehow Vonnegut makes everything seem like perfect sense.<br />I would highly recommend this to anyone that is looking for a book to read...read this book!!!

Give it up D12 cause you guys suck. I could make a better album then this in one day. Anyone who thinks this album is worth buying has got to be smoking something.
B00003CXCT|1.0|'A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...' there were three great movies. Movies with incredible special FX - incredible great handmade stuff! Now Lucasfilm want to sell us (what they call) the same movies again. And still they have incredible special FX - incredible bad CGI this time!<BR>Come on, Lucasfilm. Anyone can handle CGI today, this is nothing special! Can't you see and feel the original magic dying, when you try to mix the outstanding originals with really not so special CGI-FX??? Don't you realize, you're destroying the historic integrity of the movies when combining 20+ years old story, footage, music, performance, whatever with todays computer FX and new scenes? For me that simply does not work...<BR>Have a look at all these amazon-reviews. Go to [...] or [...] and read the forums. Can't you see, that what you're doing is not exactly what really a lot of people want? Are you not afraid of killing the franchise?<BR>Sadly I can't prevent what you're doing, I can only mourn the loss of three great pieces of cinema history. So go on with whatever additional changes you have in mind - but don't count on my money, you won't get it that way...
B00000F1D3|5.0|After several not well recieved albums from Cher she finally hits the mark.  She melded great with Rock in the 80's and came back to dance music at the end of the 1990's!  What can I say, every song on this album is a gem.  A few I didn't like a first but they grew on me and now I love em.<br />Her follow up album, Living Proof, was created with the same writers and producers but lost a lot of the magic this album had unfortunately.<br />For Cher fans this is probably the best album of her career.

B00005R62N|5.0|This album is  excellent. I have the LP and i can tell you that all the songs are very good. The First Song &quot;EXCITER&quot; is a very powerful song, is the best performance of metal. &quot;RUNNING WILD&quot; is a mix of power and style. &quot;SINNER&quot; is a clasical song of metal (song of 7 minutes) and very full. &quot;THE RIPPER&quot; good guitars and sound. &quot;THE GREEN MANALISHI&quot; i love the voice of rob halford. &quot;DIAMONDS AND RUST&quot; is my favorite song, my tears begin to appear of emotion. &quot;VICTIM OF CHANGES&quot; is the way to live the heavy metal!!!. &quot;GENOCIDE&quot; jajaj, thank you genocide!. &quot;TYRANT&quot; heavy heavy powerful song. This cd must be in the best albums of metal and if you are a rocker you must buy it. Thank you.
B00008LOS1|5.0|By the time `The Who' unleashed their new album to the public, it had been over two years since the release of their previous studio work, the double album of the rock opera 'Tommy' (1969). During these intervening two years `The Who' had released a stunning live album called `Live At Leeds', which was to set the bench mark for all live albums that were to follow. They toured almost continuously - with headlining appearances - at such major events like `The Isle of Wight Festival' (twice) and Woodstock. The latter gave the band immortality on the silver screen when the movie of the 3-day event was released to cinemas worldwide with the center piece of the music being `The Who's' finale of the opera.<br />After two years, a long time in rock and roll, the band was desperate to get something recorded in the studio that was more representative of what the band was like at the time live on stage. Pete Townshend was still working on his latest concept called 'Lighthouse', which was supposed to be an amalgamation of live concerts, new songs, audience participation, a stage show, and a movie. To this day Peter Townshend has never brought the `Lifehouse' concept to its full conclusion, but what `The Who' wanted was a new album now.<br />At first the boys went over to America to work with their manager and producer Kit Lambert, but by now relationships between manager and band had deteriorated beyond a working relationship being a viable proposition. So although several tracks were laid down at the famous New York Record Plant with Lambert producing and several session musicians including Leslie West of Mountain fame to spice up proceeding, the recording was deemed disappointing by the band. The split with Kit Lambert became formal and final, and the band re-camped to London.<br />Back home the young Vic Theatre was rented, the Rolling Stones mobile recording studio was moved in, and old mate Glyn Johns was brought in to help with the production. Each week the band would give free concerts for an invitational fan club only audience to try out the new material they were recording, mostly songs that Townshend had ready for his `Lifehouse' project. The results were simply devastating from the opening ARP Synthesizer of 'Baba O'Riley' to the final crashing chords of `Won't Get Fooled Again'. This is rock music that was hard edged, brazen faced, steeped in East end class.<br />Although `Lifehouse' was very much a Peter Townshend creation, `Who's Next' was without doubt a triumph for `The Who-le' band. Roger Daltrey's singing was uniformly superb with vocals ranging from the raw power and screams of 'Won't Get Fooled Again' (anybody who has ever seen this song performed live will never forget the bellow of celebration that Roger Daltrey lets fly as the band breaks back in for the final verse), the moving delicacy of 'Behind Blue Eyes', to the altogether more demanding material such as 'The Song Is Over', 'Getting In Tune', and 'Goin' Mobile'. Across the full scope of this material Daltrey's range and power are tested to the limit, resulting in one of the most commanding vocal performances in rock history.<br />As well as his fine song 'My Wife' (still my favorite song on the album, the opening lyrics always brings a wry smile to this dog's lips)...<br />\\"My wife is after me, murdered in cold blood is what I'm gonna be,<br />I ain't been home since Friday, and now she's after me.<br />Give me police protection, I need a bodyguard,<br />I'm against a judo expert with a machine gun.\\"<br />John Entwistle brought his usual stunning bass playing to the sessions, enhancing the songs immeasurably with not only a solid foundation, but with effortless melodic frills.<br />Keith Moon's drumming was as supercharged as ever, but  more disciplined and precise. The full expansive range of Moon's drum kit was recorded with depth, clarity, and power. Almost making him the star of the show.<br />Apart from Peter Townshend himself - aside from his songs and synthesizer arrangements - confirmed his status as one of rock's master guitarists, providing rich acoustic textures, inspired lead work and his unrivalled use of power chords. He sang often and well, too. The contrast between Daltrey's up-front power and Peter's mellower refrains gave `The Who' a unique vocal attack that invested songs like 'Baba O'Riley', `Bargain', and 'The Song Is Over' with a more thoughtful cerebral slant.<br />`The Who' functioned not only as a creative experimentalist, but as a visceral guitar-driven rock and roll band. (Listen to 'Bargain' for instance, to hear one of the most dynamic ensemble rock performances ever recorded.) `Who's Next' offers prime evidence that the real power behind `The Who' was the cohesive unity of all four of its members in equal parts.<br />With the new Deluxe Edition of `Who's Next' you get six of the tracks from the aborted New York recordings (I am sorry boys, but the version of 'Love Ain't for Keeping' was better the first time round), plus on the second C.D a complete concert from the young Vic. The band plays all the new songs (with only the odd nod to the past) at full pelt and with more verve and freshness than a Ferrari. You also get a 40 page booklet with all the facts and figures, packed full of color photographs, and two reviews of the album from Peter Townshend himself and John Atkins.

B000000W6X|4.0|&quot;Protection&quot; is another classic Massive Attack album that breaks the mold in what trip-hop/dub music is.  Not as strong as their debut &quot;Blue Lines&quot; or the phenomenal &quot;Mezzanine&quot;, &quot;Protection&quot; still impresses with its sinsiter grooves, nigh-disturbing lyrics and poignant vocals.
0446310786|4.0|This book is powerful and compelling...Lee's story is classical fiction at its best...very powerful message..<br />My only gripe is u can tell the ending about 40 pages before you actually read it and u know the fate of the trial probably before u read the book.<br />If u havent read this book i highly suggest it...and if ur still in school i would suggest reading it for fun before u have to do assignments on it and it ruins it for u.
B00008S2VG|5.0|This album is the most personal among all Madonnas releases. Its where she shows up her face after 2 decades of success who made her an undeniable icon of the pop musical culture.<BR>In this album, Madonna sings even better then in Evita and the arrangements are a mature avant-garde mixture of contemporary electro and accoustic guitars giving it a folk texture and eventually modern hip hop elements like in the title track.<BR>Its crazy if you think that in the past decades acts like Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston, Toni Braxton, Janet Jackson, and others sold more copies of her albums than Madonna (in the US, theirs biggest CDs market), but they simply left the stage without being able to transform the pop culture, without becoming true icons, without bringing new elemnets to this culture - just immitating others.<BR>Although American Life didnt sell as well as her previous efforts, its clear that it is influencing the new generation of pop singers - and what is Janet Jackson saying that shes &quot;living the diva life&quot; on her new CD? Ok, its time to think of celebrity - Madonna is doing that, so why cant we?<BR>For those who thought for the 10000000 time she could be over, her sold-out new REINVENTION TOUR proves them all that they cant destroy Madge - shes gonna DIE ANOTHER DAY - and shes gonna be GONE only if and when she wants.<BR>We cant do anything about it: the womans got the power.<BR>Brave new CD, a masterpiece of a genius.

Their performances in this movie are flawless (Diane Keaton won a Golden Globe and was nominated for an Oscar) and I also think that they made the perfect couple for the story.<BR>The story is about an ungry and solitary , successful writer (Keaton) that goes to her Hamptons house for the weekend with her sister without knowing that her doughther (Amanda Peet) was also going to be there with her much older boyfriend (Nicholson). They all stay in the house even tough Erica (Keaton) didn't like Harry (Nicholson) at all.<BR>The story has a twist when Harry almost suffers a heart attack and has to stay in Erica's house because the doctor (Keanu Reeves) recommended Harry not to go back to New York.<BR>And well to make this short and to not tell you the whole story so you can see it. Harry in Erica fall in love and Harry's doctor also falls in love with Erica and there are some other twists in the movie and make it very interesting.<BR>I also like this movie because shows how &quot;old&quot; people can also fall in love in a very cool way.
0201633612|2.0|This book serve mostly as historical note. In its time pepole use to think that &quot;the answer&quot; is OOP/OOD. If this book prove anything is that OOP/OOD is NOT the answer. For begginer this book is usless since they do not have the knowlage to read it and evaluate it ideas. For experience programmers this book may serve to prove that in some implemention they were using some ideas that other were using. For those with experience that realy find something new here then I think it only time for them to realized that they are very poor designers. You see in C++ you have many tools to use (and OOP is only one). This book seem to be writing by people who start to program in programming laguages that force you to use object - such as smalltalk. C++ is much more then that and now we know (I realy hope that those who are using C++ know) that OOP is just anther thing to use and not the most important one. Anther problem is that it may lead people to use those patterns in much the same way as OOP - seeing pattenrs everywhere (like many programmer who using OOP see object everywhere). Anther problem is that it like those books about &quot;how to succeed in life in 10 steps&quot;. Well like there is no magic in being successfull (you can't realy learn how to become one) there is no way in becoming good designer. If you don't know how to design system, no book can save you. Designing good software is like art, if you don't have the gift you cannot do it - and ideas from architecture are the worst to take from. When you designing a system, look in the system that you are building for ideas and not in a book that try to solve problems that are not even there. By the way for Java/C# programmers it maybe more usefull (beacuse those lagauges only support OOP). If you are C++ programmer then learn the laguage realy well (there's much to learn), this is the  only thing that will realy help you.
B00005O5CM|5.0|Reese Witherspoon stars in this fantastic, delightful comedy about a valley girl named Elle Woods who is the president of her sorority and lives right next door to Aaron Spelling! After when Elle is dumped by her boyfriend to go to Harvard Law School, Elle takes matters into her own hands and does all that she can to get into Harvard Law School in order to win her boyfriend back. Unfortunately, her boyfriend is also engaged to some other girl who also goes to Harvard, and at first, they're rivals, but as the movie flows along, they become nicer to each other. This movie is packed with delightful fun and laughter, and has a great storyline to it! Reese Witherspoon does a good job of playing the role of Elle Woods, and I'm glad that Reese Witherspoon was picked to play the lead role in this movie, and no other actress would've played Elle Woods better than Reese Witherspoon did. YAY 4 REESE WITHERSPOON!!!

And it kills me to say this, but I really feel like they're just another Hot Hot Heat (a Canadian band from the Vancouver area- it rains there a lot so bring an umbrella if you ever visit).   Their fifteen minutes of fame is in countdown mode and  soon they'll be joining a festering pile of fried marsbars, Haggis poutine, and other Scottish contributions to the world.  But, hey, this is just one man's opninion

B00005MCX2|5.0|This is a digitally remastered (1996) offering with considerable improvement on the sound quality of the vinyl copy (my 2nd - the first wore out) that I own. Lemmy's bass lines drive the whole performance along and you can hear them crisp and clean on this CD. This is a monster album to shake the walls.Play it loud in the car so that the bass makes doors and floor reverberate and the rest of the Hawkwind sonic assault washes over you.I agree that Space Ritual is 'a brutal sensory onslaught'and is best listened to in its entirety when in the right mood.It is not everyone's cup of tea.It is difficult to pick out highlights from this one but if I cannot listen to all of it in one go I tend to go for Master of The Universe , Brainstorm and Space is Deep.
B0000E1ALR|4.0|As a long-term fan I see this as a collection of great songs, but also a missed opportunity. Why include all the greatest hits again, some of which are quite average by Bruce's standards, while missing out on his truly exceptional moments such as Loose Ends, Roulette, Stand On It, Janey Don't Lose Heart and many more, which are not so well known but better than many released tracks? Also some of the selections from his albums are really bizarre, especially from The Rising, from which he actually seems to have chosen the weakest songs on the album, not the best! <BR>Having said all that, no album of Bruce's songs can ever really be less than exceptional. Truth be told, had I come to this fresh having just discovered Bruce, I would see this as probably the best couple of CDs ever made. Bruce's talent is that he has everything - a genius for perceptive lyrics, a wonderful voice and a great ear for a melody. Highly recommended for any new fan, but a little disappointing for 'tramps like us'!

B00005JKCH|3.0|Q. What kind of lab is it that's letting (a) genetically engineered spiders (b) escape (c) without sounding some kind of alarm and evacuating?<br />A. A lab funded by the same (a) government that's (b) funding the development of superhuman drugs! Wow. Now that's not a grim take on the moral status of our society, is it? Read: politicians are all just (a) a bunch of greedy klutzes, who are (b) in mismanaged cahoots with evil, EVIL corporations. Come to think of it, take out all the questionable science and gross caricatures and it's probably a pretty accurate depiction. Too bad, sob, there're no superheroes to foil evil corporagovernment plots in the real world. Or, maybe there are.....hmmmm. Yes, that's right, the real heroes are ordinary people just like you and me. (Cue strings.) (Thank you, Ms. Brockovich.) But then Spidey's not ABOUT ordinary people (and arguably neither is Erin B.). With the exception of course of the cheer-begging scene in which a group of \\"average\\" citizens (who for some reason look a bit like gangsters) throw sticks and stones at the Green Gobby. There, this one's for you NYC: \\"You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us.\\" In an era without conscription, it may be the closest thing we ever get to a draft-peer pressure - which, relatively speaking, might just be a good thing.<br />Q. What kind of film has a geeky 17-yo late bloomer suddenly (a) get muscles, stamina, coordination, pubic hair, and The Girl (but also the power over raging hormones to reject a Girl like Kirsten Dunst) and (b) realize that he can, um, well, er, shoot white bits of stuff out of his body in spurts? (Sorry, but I couldn't help read it that way. Watch again if you're not convinced.)<br />A. Why, a coming of age film, of course. The mantra: \\"With power comes responsibility.\\" Or something like that. Brought to you by the writers of other such meaty works as Gone in 60 Seconds and The Lost World: Jurassic Park, Spidey seems a little more keen on moralizing about what it might actually mean to be buff than most movies with explosions. It may be that it doesn't even come close to contributing anything substantial to the post-9/11 talk of heroism; heck, boil them all down and the kernel concept of Batman, Superman, and X-men, et al. is really just to have a guy go out and rescue kittens out of trees (in which helpless citizens caught in a cruel world stand in for the kittens and trees). As always, the real world, a great deal of which-perhaps even the most important part of which-takes place at home, is a lot more difficult and complicated. Even so, after seeing the coming attraction for yet another Adam Sandler bit of tripe in which he plays yet another 35-yo regressed \\"big kid\\" who acts irresponsible all over everyone and tries for yet even more uncomfortable chuckles with yet even more oops-I-pooped-my-pants looks, a kind of entertainment in which the overall idea seems to be that a young man should try to act his age and try to have some consideration for other people was yet even more welcome.<br />Minor complaints, file under \\"Violations of Realism Above and Beyond the call of Entertainment\\":<br />1) Uncle Ben gets shot and killed in (a) (I know...it goes with the genre) a seemingly constantly violent city in which (b), sadly for dear Aunt May, the authorities don't seem to make a practice of informing the families of homicide victims.<br />2) Longtime uncoordinated school (...) Peter Parker does a triple summersault in midair from a standing position and punches a guy halfway down the hall...well, you see where I'm going with this, or maybe where he would have gone in a real world: into restraints.<br />3) Oh, and while I'm at it, there are obviously witnesses to the cafeteria tray incident as well (webs and all), and then this Spider-Man guy starts appearing all over the city? And no one stops to think, hey...could it be...maybe. Okay, okay. Now I'm picking apart the whole genre. I guess ever since we collectively agreedto believe that all it takes is a pair of fake glasses for Superman to fool everyone.... Shows you what we think of ourselves, doesn't it! And maybe that's the best lesson of all.to believe that all it takes is a pair of fake glasses for Superman to fool everyone.... Shows you what we think of ourselves, doesn't it!

B00004T9UF|5.0|No matter which side of controversy around Eminem you support, one cannot deny his talent. After all, there wouldn't be so much fuss around an empty one-dimensional pop-culture product like some of the reviewers try to label him. No way! We're treated to an album written by some very clever, sarcastic, and witty person, who's hobby is to make provocations. Nay-sayers, you've got to realize that with each anti-Eminem speech you just do what HE wants you to do.<br />As for the album under question here, I find it very good. Perhaps the best rap-album since Snoop Doggy Dogg dropped out \\"Doggy\\" from his moniker. And it's officially named the fastest selling rap-album, too. It's success is largely based on Eminem's infamous debut, \\"The Slim Shady LP\\". But Eminem moves way further and develops his style. You can't deny his incredibly rhyming skills. You can enjoy all styles of rhyming on this album, each done with finesse. The amazing thing is that this guy is really doing it better than 90% of present rappers, even if he ethnically belongs to entirely another culture! The way he organizes his musical accompanement is amazing, too. And \\"The Way I Am\\" with its piano sample is one of the better written music accompanements in a rap-song ever. Eminem displays varying rapping styles, sounding confident every time. Good job, Marshall!<br />The point of controversy is the lyrics on the album. I don't know if we should talk about it. Just from listening to the introductory blah-blah, and especially the \\"Who Knew\\" song, one would understand what it's all about. Just like many other rappers, Eminem mixes parody with frustration, truth with fiction, offence with irony, explicit lyrics with undeniable rhyming talent. Only that he makes this mix perfect. Hot debates around the album only prove that we are treated to a very talented performance, and we should value what we've got here. Because, frankly, at the moment there's no noticeable competition for Eminem anywhere close.
B000002I25|5.0|Wow....amazing CD....hardly even know waht else to say. Wonderful though.
B000002UAI|5.0|When I was a teenager in the early 90s I only listened to the Beatles and Mersey beat bands, and British bands with some roots in American rock and even rhythm and blues. I was not very interested in all the &quot;intellectual&quot; bands that were springing at the time. And all their big successes and complicated sophistications are not very appealing to the kind of people who like traditional rock. We see music as something simple, as &quot;popular culture&quot; and not high culture or career. For me to love a song, it´s just got to have a lot of &quot;come´n&quot;s, and &quot;whoa, whoa&quot;, and &quot;hey, hey, hey&quot;. And  that´s the simplicity and beauty of it. <br />With their publicity, big record companies sometimes make even rock fans pay a little more attention to other kinds of music. It is alright, might be interesting for a little while to get to know how other people see music. But they should not think that all of us are ready to fall for those weird super-hypes that are created. Listening to indie, pop, hard rock or electronica has given me more than a bad headache in the recent past. Why do we all have to pay homage to &quot;everything&quot; that is released? From now on I´ll stick to my Chuck Berry and punk rock and I´ll be much happier. And nobody can force me to listen to electro-indie any more, no way!!
B00008PC2O|4.0|This is incredible! One of the reasons why i bought this collectors edition was to collect the Metal collectible sculpture embossed package. When I saw what i received, I noticed that the Metal collectors box was replaced with a metal colored cardboard. This is an outrage, I really wanted that metal cover. The descriptions of this dvd said that it contained a metal package, not that it was replaced. Oh well, aside from that, it's one of the best collectors edition when compared to the previous collectors version.
B0000VD04M|5.0|As you may notice I did quote Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi in Ed Wood, Tim Burton's masterpiece.I totally agree with him, I can't believe that it was released Big Fish in DVD, and Ed wood was censored by Unversal and Buenavista.  I do have the VHS, that's highly recommendable for all of us that are waiting for the DVD.  Ed Wood, tim burton's tribute to this un-acclaimed director, tarred by Johnny Depp (Edward Scissorshands)as Ed Wood, Martin Landau (Sleepy Hollow) as Bela Lugosi and Sarah Michelle Geller (Sex and the City) as Ed's principal love interest, along with Bill Murray (Lost in Translation) As Ed's best friend.  I say it: Tim's Best Movie is Ed Wood.  Why?  It's fuuny and it's deep, it makes you think about Hollywood's Studios.  It's like a behind scenes look inside Hollywood.    Well, As you may be aware Ive been waiting for this DVD, since it was first announced by BUENAVISTA.   When I noticed that it was pospoed I had a heart attack, Finally I have it in my hands (Well, its on my DVD shelf, along with Edward Scissorhands, Ghost World and American Splendor).  Ive seen it all!  Its quite a good special release, with surprisng bonus features. An splendid doccumentary on how mr Martin Landau prepared for the characterization of Bela Lugosi. An alternate audio with Tim Burton himself. Amazing deleted scens.  Im glad its finally here!    See you.
B00008PC2O|4.0|Hello, I currently own both Ultimate and Extreme editions. <BR>The main differences when comparing both films are already explained here in the amazon Editorial Review. One difference that is not talked about is the fact that the Extreme edition lacks the Special &quot;Extended&quot; Version option. The Ultimate edition has the theatrical version, the special edition version and the special edition extended version as options to choose from. The Extreme edition only has the special edition and the theatrical version options to choose from. The scene when the T1000 scans the room with his hands is not implemented directy onto the film (a feature of the special extended version from the Ultimate edition). That's my only complaint of the Extreme Edition, but when comparing both films, I believe that the Extreme edition is better due to it's superior scene quality as well as everything else mentioned in the editorial reviews.
B00006G8HX|4.0|First, here's what I didn't like: Kirk's son dies, and the Enterprise is destroyed. I know they wanted gripping drama, but still, doing ether one of the two seemed a bit too much. The Enterprise has been home to it's crew (and, in a way, to the fans) since the first T.V. episode, and the death of Kirk's son, well...it's his _son_. Otherwise, why does everyone concider this one of the weaker episodes? SPOCK LIVES. His ressurection should have been enough to make any true fan stand up and cheer. There's also enough action to satisfy anyone. Kirk and crew (minus Spock) must face off against not only the dastardly Klingons, but also against their own superiors at Starfleet. This is also the first film where we see the Excellcior, my favorite Star Trek ship. Check this film out.
B00005ATZT|5.0|Harrisson Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are a action duo match made in heaven.  This film ROCKS.  The action is non stop and the tenstion of the &quot;who dunnit&quot; question is always hanging in the air.  The plot is one of the most heartpounding and thrilling I have ever watched.  The cinematography is really shot well.  The villain comes out of nowhere, and even the keenest mind will be surprised when you figure it out.  Julianne Moore makes a breakthrough role as the suspicious doctor in the hospital scene.  This film in a sense reminds me of the old cop TV series, because you are always wondering if Harrison Ford can ger out of the predicament he is in.  I highly reccomend this film for any action buff.
B000083C49|4.0|O.K., first my one complaint-The plot where a mysterious, massive, invincible alien force that threatens the Earth was already done before. (Remember the first Star Trek film?) Otherwise, this is a wonderful addition to the Star Trek legacy. Just about everyone already knows the story, where the crew of the now destroyed Enterprise must pilot a captured Klingon Bird Of Prey back in time to the present day (well, 1986 WAS the present day when this came out,) to bring back some humpback whales. It seems to be a toss-up between which is the best Star Trek movie-this one, or part II. The second film, where Kirk and Khan have their last battle, has the most action, but this one has the most comedy, so they both have their strengths. Unless you absolutly hate Star Trek, check this one out.
B0000640SB|5.0|Men in Black surprised me.  Coming from a comic without an iconic hero like Superman or Batman, instead it had two men in suits.  When I saw the movie I was amazed at the funny chemistry between Will Smith and Tommy Lee.  It was almost like Alien Exterminator Odd Couple.  The Alien effects were very real but very cartoon-cool at the same time (come on Rick Baker worked on this film what do you expect.)  The movie was very funny, very thrilling, and very good.  I highly reccomend this film for anyone who loves action and sci fi.
6304711891|5.0|This is one of the best action adventure movies of the past decade.  Michael Bay (Armageddon) lays on the action thick and it's one heck of a ride.  Without going into the plot, all I can say is it's one frantic moment after the next:  an FBI scoundrel gets dangled from a high rose hotel; there is a wonderfully staged and frenzied car chase through the streets of San Francisco; a whole crew of navy seals is wiped out by the bad guys; Cage and Connery exchange barbs and save each other's lives several times; a harrowing chase in a mining car; planes ready to drop bombs on Alcatraz; mutiny by Ed Harris' underlings; it goes on and on, and it's great.  This is how action movies should be made.  Connery, Cage and Harris are magnificent; watch for a quick cameo by James Caviezel (Passion of Christ) as one of the pilots.<br />THIS IS A BIG BIG MOVIE.  DON'T MISS IT@!
B00000F14B|4.0|Before I complain I liked the Music Man.  It is one of the most light hearted and charming movies I have ever seen and it does have good music.  In the days of West Side Story, My Fair Lady, Mary Poppins, and The Sound of Music, somewhere in their is The Music Man.  It failed to be better than all the films I have mentioned above.  It was more slapstick and mediocre, and somewhat reminded me of some of the musicals MGM did in the 30s and 40s.  All the performances were average but not something to hand out an Oscar for.  Robert Preston, Ronnie Howard, and Shirley Jones did well.  All in all it is enjoyable and very likeable, but it just did live up to the other film musicals of the 1960s.  I do reccomend this film.
B000021XS0|5.0|What could I say to make you buy this album?  CONSIDER IT SAID! <br />This is, BY FAR, the most original, intriguing, and musically advanced album I have heard. Period.

0767812166|5.0|This should shut up the people who think Carpenter does nothing but horror flicks.  Carpenter was working with the Hollywwod machine here, but he didn't stick with that long before going back to what he does best.  Still, this detour is one of Carpenter's finest films in terms of good movie making.  Once again he's dealing with aliens here.  However, this alien doesn't come in the form of martian ghosts, a shapeshifting beast, yuppies or a beach ball with feet, but as Jeff Bridges.  In fact, most of the sci-fi aspect is shown right off the bat but takes a back seat to the story and performances as the films goes on.  Jeff Bridges is right on target with his performance.  He's totally convincing as a confused alien with his jerky movements, dialogue and looks of confusion and curiosity.  These things also account for most of the humor in this film, and this movie is quite funny in spots.  The story isn't totally complex or anything, but that doesn't matter.  The performances are the real stars in Starman.
B00006690G|5.0|If you don't have it, buy it. Its true Eminem from the first beat to the last. Buy it.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|If you take The Adventures Of Baron Munchausen and crossed it with Forest Gump, then you'll get a good idea of what Big Fish is like.  Tim Burton has always had a knack for taking bizarre subject matter and making a heartwarming movie out of it(like Edward Scissorhands).  Burton has certainly redeemed himself here after that rotten Planet Of The Apes remake with Marky Mark(Feel the vibrations!  Feel it, feel it!).  It's a whimsical, bizarre, funny fantasy with just the right amount of sappiness thrown in.  Some people might think the movie's just plain weird, but the human interest aspect of the story should overshadow the goofiness.  Interestingly enough, the opposite is true;  If you're too much of a man, the fantasy element is plentiful enough to make you forget about the touching father/son drama being played out.  Pretty well balanced if you ask me.  It doesn't look like other Burton films, most of this is in the daylight.  That's small potatoes coz his humor and style do still shine through.  I really hate to use this lame cliche, but this is a very good film for children and adults alike, though the adults are gonna get alot more out of it.
B000089RVR|4.0|This album in is not quite as good as &quot;No Angel&quot; but it isn't far off. If you like Dido's style it's definately worth it to buy.
B0009IOR6Q|4.0|Cry Baby's finally out on DVD! Yeh!!! It's taken me quite a while to get - something more important always came along - but then it came out at work, for pretty cheap. I snatched it up instantly. I had this on video (taped off the TV) for ages, and also an illegal copy, and I loved it. It's such a feel good movie, and of course Johnny Depp is easy on the eyes.<br /><br />Cry-Baby was made in 1990, or was at least released then, featuring a very clean cut, and very young Johnny Depp. John Waters has basically tried to do a cheaper version of Grease, cos it's set in the same period. (A lot seems to be borrowed from Elvis movies too - and Johnny's singing is a take off of Elvis, with the whole hip swinging, oh, I'm off drooling again). The first half is very much in the same Grease-style, but kinda loses it towards the end.<br /><br />There's some familiar faces in this, including Ricki Lake (looking very big, before she hit the big time as a chat show host, and a John Waters regular), Traci Lords (ex adult film actress, so one for the guys to check out), Iggy Pop, and a blink and you'll miss it prison guard role played by none other than Willem Defoe! Hehe, I never manage to spot him properly, until I watch the credits. I'm used to seeing him with long hair (Speed 2), so it's hard to spot him.<br /><br />Most of the acting is seriously overacted most of the time, just watching the acting is hilarious. But this film is definitely a must see for Johnny Depp fans. He's so HOT in this movie! And he reminds me of someone, so it's always a must for to watch it, and blush constantly. I blushed rewatching it, cos I actually learned how to french kiss from this film - embarassing I know - and I have since tried it out. It seems to work out quite well.<br /><br />The music is a total spoof of all those kind of fifties movies. But it's very memorable - as well as the dance moves! (I'm one of these people who seems to memorise dance moves, never mind the words to songs!) What's my favourite song? Probably \\"Please Mr Jailer\\", or \\"Teardrops Are Falling\\".<br /><br />What's my favourite scene? It has to be either Johnny Depp tugging on his crotch after getting off his motorbike, or when he's trying to get out of the jail, and loses his trousers!<br /><br />There's quite a few scenes added into the director's cut, and I applaud John Waters for this, although I'm disappointed there wasn't more of a back story to Hatchetface - what was with her? There's not MUCH more scenes added in time wise but the die hard Cry Baby fans out there will spot very easily, the 6 extras minutes added in. And it's not 6 minutes of nothing either! I kept going during the film \\"That's new! I haven't seen that before!\\" It's mainly the first half of the film that gets the extra scenes, but judging by some other reviews, there's some stuff cut OUT too, but I haven't watched my illegal copy since I added this to my wishlist. Extra scenes include: Hatchetface's parents selling cigarettes by the school (\\"You still owe me from yesterday!); Lenora's \\"gunboats\\" are now \\"goldmines\\"; the third verse of Allison's song, \\"Teenage Prayer,\\" is included (not that it makes much difference); extra footage of Cry-Baby driving his motorcycle to the charm school and an air raid drill that interupts Allison's act (strange); Cry-Baby arrives during \\"So Young\\" instead of before the song beginning, as in video version; there is a longer scene with Wanda, her parents, and Inga, the Swedish exchange student; and the showdown is at Turkey Point instead of at the press conference in front of the prison.<br /><br />This film is a classic to add to anyone's collection. It's definitely going to be the main feature in mine - just try and stop me from playing it all the time! I don't understand why people slate it, as some reviewers have, it's easy going fun, and definitely leaves me on a high.) What's my favourite song?

B0001XAPY2|5.0|I'm probably going to be in a minority in naming this my favorite film, better even than Spirited Away or Princess Mononoke. It's different from most of Miyazaki's other movies, in that the protagonist is middle-aged and most of his character development is subtle. It pays off in a tone that is considerably more adult than anything Miyazaki has done before or since - regardless of the slapstick air pirate sequences.<br />One of the other reviews here says Porco has become a pig due to a \\"tragic accident.\\" As far as I can tell, he became a pig because he was disgusted with humanity; whether he did it to himself deliberately or whether it just happened seems ambiguous.<br />For my money, Porco's description of his near-death experience during the war is one of the best scenes ever animated.<br />I should note here that I've only seen a Japanese version, with somewhat poorly synchronized English subtitles. I don't care about the dubbed version at all, in fact. (There is a French language version with Jean Reno as Porco. That would be worth seeing.)

I increase volume for some of the quieter pieces then have to decrease volume for some of the louder pieces. It's best listened to in a quiet environment. Enya composed and performed a couple of the songs on the Fellowship CD - very nice. If you like the Rings music, you might also like the Best of Enya and Loreena McKennitt's The Book of Secrets.
B00000ICN5|5.0|Texas Flood is Stevie Ray Vaughan's first debut album including the opening track Love Struck Baby with a beautiful texas tone. Then their is the songs that most guitarist never forget including Stevie Ray Vaughan's greatest hit Pride And Joy, and Texas Flood. Lenny is the softer track on the album dedicated to his wife Lenny. I think one of the coolest Blues Shuffles is on Rude Mood. I think Stevie Ray Vaughan had a wonderful talent doing what he did he was one of the greatest guitarist the ever lived. Their are some old great blues songs on here like the Lonnie Mack orginal Wham. The greatest guitar song on the album is Texas Flood. This album has got plenty of radio play that it deserved. Any guitarist should buy this you will not be disapointed. Highly Recomened! Only The Best
B0001N1RU8|5.0|I've been a great fan of Diana eversince \\"Only Trust Your Heart\\"<BR>debut. I've bought every albums she made. When I heard that her new album has no Harold Arlen, Nat King Cole or Peggy Lee, I was disappointed. But when I purchased this new album, I was completely amazed and mesmerized with the songs she co-wrote with Elvis and the exceptional interpretations of songs such as Black Crow and Stop This World. What a superb album ! My congratulations to Diana for this great departure. She's only just begun. I can't wait to see her perform this songs in her concert. I strongly recommend this stylish and stringless album.
074325144X|5.0|[...]  This book is a brilliant print presentation of Danny's methods which are revolutionary.  He deserves the much wider following he will get with this (his CD is great too).    My story: I've been a runner for 45 years.  I nearly gave up running at age 57. The pain in my knees and lower back made me seriously think of quitting.  I literally saw an ad in the newspaper for Danny's class and took it as a last resort.  He was at the time in his 50's and a nationally ranked ultramarathoner. I figured he ought to know something about efficient running.  I learned his initial techniques in two hours.  It took about five or six runs to feel comfortable with the changes in my stride, but from the first day, there was no back pain and such minimal knee pain at the end that I couldn't believe it.  I've taken his advanced techniques workshops too (all in the book).  The \\"sidewise\\" stride up steep hills is another brilliant technique that literally makes running hills fun.  I went from struggling to run for 30 minutes at a time to 1.5 hour runs on steep hills without pain.  I'm not a ranked runner.  I run for fitness, for weight control, and for the sheer joy of it.  I did finish third in my age group in a local race a year ago -- first medal I've ever won (I'm 62 now).  But I got my running life back, and that's priceless.  I plan to be running into my 80's now -- pain free!  And for what it's worth, I have a doctorate and I'm trained in physics.  Danny's techniques are scientifically valid.  There's a spiritual side to his methods too.  If you don't think running has a spiritual side, I feel sorry for you, but don't ignore his methods just because of that.  Jerry L Fletcher
0393317552|4.0|What processes enabled certain societies to become powerful and innovative? Why did Europeans come to dominate much of the world and the New World? Why did history unfold differently on different continents? These are the questions that this culturally significant work sets out to answer. For the most part the author does a good job. Without going into detail some of the reasons are; the east-west axis orientation of Eurasia as compared to the north-south axis orientation found on other contients like Africa and the Americas, Eurasia's abundance of plants and animals available for domestication as contrasted to the scarcity of them elsewhere, Europeans resistance to germs that were never encountered till modern times by native american peoples, and agriculturally producing societies with dense populations that could support a sedentary lifestyle where people were able to innovate and create new technologies. These explanations for why certain peoples displaced others or why certain peoples such as European colonists who settled Australia were able to form literate agriculturally producing societies in contrast to Aborginies who had been there for 1000s of years and never managed to do it are much better than previous outdated ones. The causes and reasons leading to different histories of different peoples have much more to do with geography and environment as opposed to being caused by innate differences in the peoples themselves. The author has obviously researched the subject in-depth (as far as possible upon him) and presented his findings in several chapters. The chapters take these reasons and expound upon them while offering evidence and showing different chains of causation. I found the book mostly interesting and lively although it read somewhat slow because of the statistics and facts contained throughout. By the time you get to the end of the book you will definitely have the themes of it pounded into your head as the author details them over and over. Inmy opinion it would have been better to condense redundant details but still a fantastic book that's definitely worth a read. Sometimes I found myself getting a little dulled because in the latter part of the book the author focuses on the expansion of languages and the conclusions we can draw from them as to whom settled where and when. Some of the other parts of the book were a little techincal as well but there were also some fascinating chapters that kept your attention like the ones talking about the Spanish invasion of Incan lands. I recommend this book for its ability to change racist (and incorrect) views of human history and also its ability to enlighten and hopefully educate humans to the point of understanding causes of events and outcomes better.  Good read.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|It's often been said that the Ramones invented punk, the Pistols perfected it, and the Clash popularized it. I don't know about that. The Clash didn't resort to the stOOpid/brain damage image of the Ramones nor the self-conscious attitude of the Pistols. Right from the onset, the Clash saw punk as a vehicle for social criticism. On their first album, songs like &quot;White Riot&quot;, &quot;I'm So Bored With The USA&quot; and &quot;Complete Control&quot; indicated that the Clash was interested in more than the up-yours/I'm-gonna-shock-you pablum of some other punk bands. LONDON CALLING epitomizes the Clash searching for other venues for its message.<br />LONDON CALLING marks the end, basically, of the major punk movement of the 1970s. In fact, there are only one or two truly punk songs. However, there is a great deal of reggae, power pop, disco/dance, Calypso, even Motown (&quot;Train In Vain&quot;). This double album also caps off the best of the Clash's creative output. SANDINISTA which followed two years later is an overblown mess. And COMBAT ROCK, rocked the casbah and not much else. Punk wanted to destroy rock and roll. In the process, they allowed it to renew itself. LONDON CALLING is the best of the post-punk creativity that emerged from that time.
B0001HAISG|5.0|This adaptation may well be the closest any film maker has ever gotten to capturing the alluring beauty of J.M. Barrie's original story. The film is absolutely fantastical and captivating. It all begins with a classic Peter Pan beginning, but with new technology and a director that stayed so true to the book it was absolutely worth every penny. The emotional bond that builds through several of the characters throughout the film is wonderful, enchanting and you feel like you may as well have been one of the lost boys yourself. It ends not as happily ever after as Disney would have made it but it certainly touches your heart and you feel for Peter Pan as every child has at some point of their life.<BR>  This film was remarkably cast with Jason Isaacs as both Captain Hook and Mr. Darling. No one could have done or played the part more convincingly. Mrs. Darling is captivating. Peter splendid and Wendy is as wondrous as she was always meant to be. I highly recommend this movie for a family outing, the violence is rather mild and only meant in a humorous way rather then mindless. It's moral nothing to be embarrassed about when seen with small children.<br />Worth all five stars.
B00004RD54|5.0|SOME OF THE SHARPEST GUITAR LICKS I HAVE EVER HEARD,THE MAN CAN FLAT OUT ROCK!!!
B0000TB05A|5.0|This concert is a must have for any music lover, not just U2 fans.  While it is very fulfilling for U2 fans to see the band playing in their hometown, anyone can, and will be caught up in the magic of the moment that U2 creates.  The band is in rare form during this concert and it is unlike anything that I have seen before, especially from U2.  It must be the home crowd that brings this out of the band because I have never seen a show of theirs to match this one.  They are extremely relaxed and having a good time.  Even Larry is seen smiling often.  This DVD is a must have and should recieve a rating of 10 stars.
B00005JN0A|1.0|Eurotrip might have been kinda funny a few years ago. Unfortunately, Road Trip and Old School, used in all the ads, beat it to the punch, and while neither of those are particularly intelligent movies either, they're much better than the nearly laughless hell that is Eurotrip. <br />The movie is overbearingly annoying to start with, using pointlessly loud and cluttered credit sequences that intend to be but are remarkably unfunny. From there, it segues into a concert that has a few amusing moments, but nothing of takeoff velocity. After that, the few high point include a couple of Snatch cast members (Rade Serbedgia and Vinnie Jones), and a song that actually manages to become a little more funny with each successive appearance.<br />Don't watch this dreck. Not only are Old School and Road Trip smarter and funnier, but this year's The Girl Next Door trumps all of them with more charming, witty and funny material. (And as an added black mark, the use of Old School and Road Trip's logos in the previews have resulted in the permanent cancellation of Old School 2...what a waste).
B0000CDLA7|5.0|The first time I heard this album I was pretty pleased. Although the first few songs seem like Metallica rip offs, I still found them very enjoyable. Dream Theater gets pretty heavy on this album yet still maintain their 'Signature Sound'. I heard some people say they don't like it because they think it's 'soulless.'<BR>I don't think they know what soul is. This album is full of heart and unbelievable music. My second favorite DT album.
0790729725|5.0|GoodFellas immerses you in the strange, violent world of armed, ignorant thugs.  The Mafia depicted here clings to no pretenses of civility.  Everything is about money and power, and no one--not even &quot;made&quot; Mafiosi--are immune from a bullet to the back (or front or side) of the head for just about any reason.  Walk a little funny?  Get shot.  Talk back?  Get shot.  Bust someone's chops?  Get shot.  GoodFellas, in fact, spirals into a blood bath of gangster killing ganster for reasons ranging from revenge to keeping mouths shut permanently.<br />The story is told from the perspective a young Irish-Italian boy who becomes an errand runner for thugs who hang out across the street from his blue collar home.  The money, power, and freedom of being above the law are too much for him to resist, and, soon, he becomes a young, murderous thug himself.  Ray Liota, who plays this central character (and provides splendid narration), follows this path to its natural conclusion--a cocaine-addled, unfaithful, narcisstic mob informant.  The transformation is spectacular to watch, particular in the scenes leading up to his final arrest, complete with overtones of paranoia, a mysterious helicopter that seems to be shadowing him, the creation of an elaborate meal, a remarkable scene between the drug-snorting Liota and his junkie mistress, and a cranky, crazy drug courier-baby sitter.<br />A word of warning: GoodFellas is brutally violent.  People are dispatched, graphically, with guns, knives, and ice picks.  Frankly, the story wouldn't be as gut-wrenching or honest without the casual brutality of these animals in full display.  It makes the ease with which they kill all the more bizarre.
B000021Y77|5.0|Phone call from her boyfriend - he needs 100,000 marks in 20 minutes (because he lost it). They argue, but bottom line, she's going to help him. From the second Lola throws down the phone the clock is ticking.<BR>The theory of this movie seems to be based on that everything we do (or don't do), every action effects someone. For good or bad. If she's a minute later - 30 seconds earlier - whatever - there is a different outcome. People that she runs into on the street - a pause in their actions... it changes their fate.<BR>She goes thru the day 3x. Different days for everyone.<BR>The way it's shot is somewhat different and reminds me vaguely of QTarantino's Kill Bill flicks. Just the openness of it - structually - not so much the dialogue. <BR>All in all a good movie.
B00005JMEW|4.0|at this point, most of the people who are going to see it and would like it have already seen it...and like it. this is for those people. get ahold of the japanese version which has the full uncut version of the movie. no cutting to black and white for one, and about 2 or 3 minutes of added fight for your buck(or yen) for another. i saw that version first and then saw the american version and i noticed quite a difference. all i can say is, i thought amercians were supposed to like senseless violence?! well anyways...get it and see it as it was meant to be seen.
B0001GL3K4|4.0|Director Richard Curtis has a charming vision of love surrounding us and affecting everyone's lives in a multitude of ways.  He also has a terrific all-star cast.  What he does not have is a script worthy of either the vision or the cast.  While the film is enjoyable in a breezy way, several of the many story lines are superfluous or gratuitous, and often situations and lines are much too predictable.  Hugh Grant is, of course, charming in his blinky way, and Emma Thompson is terrific, but the most consistently good scenes go to Bill Nighy, who shines as a comeback rocker, charming Brits with his profane comeback attempt.  Grant, Thompson and Nighy rise above a trite script, but others don't fare so well.  This is not an evil film.  I don't resent the time I spent watching it.  But it is a shame to have such a nice idea and such a talented cast wasted over this cliched script.<br />The dvd extra features are good, and include a commentary track with director Curtis and stars Nighy, Grant and Sangster; 37 minutes of deleted scenes; 8 minutes of music; and a Kelly Clarkson video,  The film can be heard or subtitled in English, French or Spanish.<br />Chances are, if you like these stars or this premise, you will enjoy the film, but it's not as good as one would hope.

B0001GOH6Q|4.0|Tim Burton (Edward Scissorhands) is the perfect director for this film about a dying father (Albert Finney) and his son (Billy Crudup), alienated by the father's habit of grabbing the limelight with his elaborate tall tales.  The film is a bit confusing, with multiple actors playing characters as the timeline jumps back and forth, but the fantasy sequences show Burton at his best and the cast, including Ewan McGregor, Helena Bonham Carter, Danny DeVito, Jessica Lange and Steve Buscemi, is flawless.  The film uses elaborate folk stories about circuses, giants and warfare to address the relationship between fathers and sons, and is thus a film that will be entertaining for children even as it touches men in a more personal way.<br />The dvd extras are very good and include a commentary track by director Tim Burton; a trivia game about Burton's previous films; and many fine featurettes concerning several of the characters, Burton, myth, special effects, and the book on which the film is based.
B0001N1RU8|4.0|Diana sounds lovely, and there are some cool jams.  Perhaps it does have some contemporary-pop leanings, but please don't let this deter you from experiencing this album.  <br />Diana gives the songs she covers a smooth, elegant touch, and the originals upon which she collaborated with Elvis Costello are great, too.  The highlights for me are her covers of Tom Waits' \\"Temptation\\" Joni's \\"Black Crow\\", and also the originals \\"the girl in the other room\\" and \\"departure bay.\\" Really, the entire album is great: It is a slightly different Diana Krall album, and a successful one at that.<br />This album might not blow you away, but it's a wonderful companion on a rainy day or while taking a leisurely drive or walk.  It really is great, and I definitely recommend it!
0066214122|3.0|Well, MC is allowed to write a so-so book every once in awhile - and this is it. If anything, I would normally be accused of going too easy on Crichton, since he's probably my favorite contemporary author. I've read all of his books, including the John Lange and Michael Douglas pseudonym novels, and I saw some uncharacteristic errors in &quot;Prey.&quot;<br />First, &quot;Prey&quot; is written in first person, and I don't particularly enjoy his first person writing (Case of Need, Rising Sun, etc.). It's not just a style preference - it actually stems from Crichton's intrinsic writing style. As any of his readers know, what makes his writing so amazing is his ability to seamlessly integrate in-depth research into fiction. However, the first person perspective naturally limits a writer's freedom to do this, and in Crichton's writing this tends to lead to awkward inner-reflections and cumbersome bursts of dialogue. While &quot;Prey&quot; manages this far better than say, &quot;Rising Sun,&quot; it still limits what is arguably the best reason for reading Crichton to begin with.<br />Second, this is the one novel where I would surrender to his more ardent critics that the &quot;technology&quot; portion of the novel competed with the plot. In past novels the unbelievably deep science has been woven into the story with amazing clarity, and the technology serves the story itself (Jurassic Park, Timeline). In &quot;Prey,&quot; however, I found in more than any other novel that Crichton was using a contrived and cookie-cutter plot as a soapbox to enlighten us on scientific ethics, in this case artificial intelligence. The plot is simple and in my opinion jaded - scientist screw up, release something bad into nature, it needs to be contained...I've already read &quot;The Stand&quot; and &quot;Outbreak.&quot; While Crichton normally takes the normal and elevates it to the sublime, in this case he didn't. The plot was nothing more than the obvious outcome of a given situation.The science was also much more complicated than in previous works and I would imagine the average reader will be lost throughout much of it, or at least struggling so hard to understand nanotechnology they'll miss the relevance to the story.<br />Third, the dialogue is off. Thinking back throughout his works, I realized that Crichton hasn't written many teenagers. This book shows us why. There are sections of the teenagers' dialogue that are literally embarrassing to read. Example: &quot;...I'm trying Dad. But he is a majorly turkey (...).&quot; &quot;I am not! Up yours, weasel poop!&quot; No it's not a typo - &quot;a majorly turkey (...).&quot; I don't know if Crichton (or his editor) has actually spoken to a teenager in the last 25 years, but in my experience no kids - nor any other human being I've ever known - actually talk like this. The teen dialogue is utterly unacceptable.<br />These are the major problems with the novel, and I feel it's at the bottom of Crichton's efforts. If you're a fan it's definitely worth reading, but for me it just didn't have that special thing that all his other novels have.
0385507755|5.0|This book cover to represent what is within is just perfect.  It was published by Nan A. Talese, an imprint of Doubleday, but I doubt if any editing was done whatsoever.  There are too many ill constructed sentences and words and sentences repeated to add emphasis.  However, none of this detracts materially as the story is just too powerful.  James Frey was a drug/alcohol junkie from around age 8 and lasted until he was on his last leg at age 23 when he entered a residential treatment center.  You learn of his unconventional life, but you also find out what it is like being an addict.  How one lives from one hit to another.  One man by the name of Leonard literally saves James's life and to read of how this is accomplished is worth the price of admission.  Even though fraternizing with the opposite sex is forbidden in this residential center, there is a love affair that is an important result of Mr. Frey's recovery.  This true story is amazing in its complexity and you find out what happened to all of the characters you meet on the very last page.  Whatta read!
B0001ENY6M|4.0|I liked this music much better the first time I heard it in &quot;Glory.&quot; The Passion is perhaps the most powerful movie ever made, and during the crucifixion scene I really didn't want to be sitting there thinking, &quot;Haven't I heard this before?...oh...right...Glory.&quot;<br />Other than lifting 8 bars straight from James Horner, Debney did a fine job, giving appropriate and moving music in each scene. Gibson would've done better to go with Horner again, who is notorious for ripping himself off (compare Glory and Braveheart). At least that way the inclusion of Glory's main theme in The Passion would've been a little more acceptable.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I saw the musical on Broadway and was stunned by it. After seeing it, I immediately went and bought the cd, along with about 30 of the friends that I was with. A month later, each of us is still in love with the beautiful music by the pit orchestra and the great vocals. The music on this cd is very well written and never ceases to send shivers up my spine.

B00003CXCT|2.0|Lucas has been raised upon the shoulders of fanboys for ONE movie he directed, \\"Star Wars; A New Hope\\". He can't write well and he can't direct. Why did the first 3 (yes the FIRST) do so well? Fox had control. He didn't write the screenplay for \\"Empire\\" or \\"Return\\" nor did he direct either of them. <br />\\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" you say? Sorry, but Lawrence Kasdan (writer of Empire Strikes Back and ROJ) wrote the screenplay and Spielberg directed it. Lucas deserves credit for the idea and many details but it ends there. <br />With SW he knew what the story was, but he didn't tell it-better men did, which is why the original Star Wars was the franchise it was, and not a laughable joke like \\"Phantom Menace\\" and \\"Attack of the Clones\\" and most likely the next one.<br />George Lucas has contributed to filmmaking like no other, with THX and ILM etc.-there is no denying that-- but the creative genius is in reality nothing more than an overrated idea man, who wants us to believe he's this maverick who had his whole story figured out. I guess that's why Luke's sister kissed him full on the lips in the Empire Strikes Back. Go ahead; argue that Leia didn't know Luke was her brother when she kissed him. Guess what, neither did Lucas until he began developing Return of the Jedi-but he continues to assert that it was all part of a well laid plan. Not.<br />A reviewer here decided to make comparisons to Lord of the Rings, stating that Lucas used elements of Tolkein's writings. I don't know about that, but I do know that Middle Earth (one continent on one planet) has more character, depth and creativity than Lucas' whole \\"universe\\".<br />One reviewer here asserts \\"It's Lucas' universe and he can do what he wants with it\\". Yes he certainly can and boy did he ever, but let's be honest. Lucas' worlds have little depth. One whole planet that is a giant planet-sized city, one that is nothing but a swamp, one that is nothing but ice, one that is nothing but a forest, one that is nothing but a desert, and one that is nothing but water and so on. The entire Star Wars universe, spanning galaxies far, far away is really just Earth all spread out in space.<br />The truth is to create whole planets with more than one land or sea variety would be too much for Lucas to wrap his brain around, and he probably doesn't have the patience, or the brains to work it out. So let's not compare him to JRR Tolkein, okay? Tolkien died while still developing middle earth. If Lucas croaked and didn't leave some kind of condition in his will saying no one but he can make Star Wars material (he probably did), then SW might have a real future. Now Lucas has to make a third prequel, and just get it over with. Hopefully he will have learned that, yes, he does suck and his own Star Wars fan base is telling him so. <br />As dull as he is, especially when he forces us to fast forward through his \\"making of\\" junk that he strategically placed before the actual movie starts rather than after (the VHS trilogy), he still can corral grown-up children wanting to relive their childhood and force their kids to sit through two HORRIBLE Star Wars \\"prequels\\". I watched \\"making of\\" materiel of Lucas shooting on a set with his little kids running around the set everywhere, getting in everybody's way, but who could argue with him? <br />If George Lucas wasn't such a control freak, and allowed better people than him to take over the production of these movies, and perhaps allowed others to continue his work they'd probably have been as great as Empire and Return, but no. It's HIS, and HE must control ALL aspects of his masterpiece, which is why the new films suck so bad regardless of the visual aspect.<br />He's made enough money from Star Wars. How much is enough? I own the original Star Wars trilogy, and I have no need of his special edition. I like the trilogy better when it had no connection with the crappy prequels. Adding CGI to the original Star Wars is the same as putting a bunch of CGI in The Wizard of Oz, and it doesn't serve the story and it frankly stains a movie that was fine the way it was, but Lucas wants us all to see his vision, so he'll jam it down our throats. I'm inclined to spew it back up at him and forget that there ever was a Star Wars.<br />Naturally, this didn't help anyone so click away on how it didn't. I know that it's all just sci-fi dorks flaming over how I mock one of their gods.
B000068VHQ|5.0|I don't care that much for special edition CD's there just too much time wasted in muzik, The Cranberries sophomore albu it'0s their pick moment, none will they repeat it, well who am I to know?, Cher cameback with a vengeance, Paula Abdul got a second chance as a judge, so maybe The Cranberries will record another timeless masterpiece like this, ZOMBIE it's such rock classic, ODE TO MY FAMILY is so depressing and sad that it's an anthem for uncomprenhended people, DAFFODIL LAMENT wow! this is what music it's all about, giving you the chills, NO NEED TO ARGUE slow, sad, uplifting, this record should be in your shelves and in your grandmas, so shut up about it and click on ADD TO CART, Dolores Oriordian has a privilage voice, just as Nelly Furtado, Macy Gray and yes! yes! Paula Abdul....it's all about gettin' the rhythm!

B000001OAA|5.0|After this album and \\"Push IT\\", the Garbage musik became Garbage...I don't understand why they change their depress mad attitude for sappy snappy happy good relatioships love, could it be they hang out with Paula Abdul and Britney Spears?...wassup with that, but enough!, this is the most essential album of GARBAGE, yes!, so rock, so depressive, so much anger, I BOUGHT THIS for \\"Only Happy When It Rains\\" could a song get any better than that!, \\"Queer\\" it's boring, \\"Vow\\" it's understandable, \\"Milk\\" should have been a massive hit!, so delightful! so much sadness, I don't get the song!, but it's in a sad mood, so i like it!, there is another song?, I guess it's the first one!, has such an amazing beat!, this album it's so good I hear it from beginning to the end, that's why I dunnot rememebr some tracks names, but it's good, better than the two that followed, something happen to Garbage as the same as for The Cranberries, they went from perfectly done albums to lame poppy releases that nobody except Jessica Simpson cared.

B00004ZAV3|5.0|Arguments between generations about who's popular culture is 'better' is never going to be fully resolved,(you can't argue taste), but the fact of how well this cd has done,(in addition, of course, to how -great- it sounds), pretty much gives the baby-boomers bragging rights for growing up when music really mattered....My only bone to pick is how \\"Please Please Me\\" could be left off. First of all, it's qualified, being a number one hit in the UK; second, it's my favorite Beatle song, and I must assume the favorite of many fans.

B00005JM02|1.0|Nemo has its moments. Vegetarian sharks? Wonderful idea! A dentist that inflicts mahem on his patients? Ah my childhood nightmares take flight again! The world's dummest fish as a companion? Hilarious!<br />Yes this film has its moments and the animation is quite first class.<br />But if you want to see how a cartoon made for kids can appeal to adults, try &quot;Ice Age&quot;. For me the humor in &quot;Ice Age&quot; was far more sophisticated and endearing to adults.<br />Nemo wins out for animation but for a compact, well told story without a minute of waste, it just doesn't compare to &quot;Ice Age&quot;. Overall I rate Nemo as a young kid's movie that parents can chuckle over. Much better than Monsters Inc which was really just a one-joke flick.
B000001FO4|5.0|Long Cold Winter is an outstanding rock album, beginning with a blues song (Bad Seamstress Blues), and thereafter pulling the listener through one hard rocking song after another, slowing only for &quot;Don't Know What You've Got (Till It's Gone),&quot; the exquisite &quot;Coming Home,&quot; and &quot;Long Cold Winter.&quot;  It is an excellent album...a tribute to some of Keifer's more obvious musical influences.  It is also one of those rare albums that one can enjoy every song on.<br />The amazing thing is that it is only Cinderella's second album...and a mere prelude to what Keifer accomplishes later, in Heartbreak Station and Still Climbing.  While there may be room for improvement, it is improvement only Keifer himself would be capable of, as he surpasses, with his artistic genius, the work of some of the very best songwriters of the previous era, still known for their long-reaching influence on rock and roll.

B000002JSN|5.0|Physical Graffiti was released in 1975, after Houses Of The Holy. It contains a couple of older songs from their previous albums but mostly new ones. There is a problem, however. Why did they put this on a double disc, when they could easily put all the songs one one disc. This would lower the hassle of always having to change discs, and would probably lower the price. But price is no object with a great album like this. The Rover and Custard Pie are worth the price alone, they are so heavy and good. This is essential to any 70's metalhead.
B000069HK2|5.0|the used has a great cd here, although i haven't actually heard their older stuff so i'm not a true expert, but i know my music and this IS a good cd. I love the screaming and you should add this cd to ur collection if u dont got it. :)
B0001CCXZW|5.0|In the true Gilmore style (Pro/Con list), I thought I'd add my 2 cents about the Season 1 DVD set.<br />Pros:<BR>-Packaged beautifully, all 6 disks in one booklike case.<BR>-The included booklet has all kinds of good information-show names, original release dates, directing and writing credits, episode summaries and chapter listings.<BR>-Special Features: <BR>  *&quot;Welcome to Gilmore Girls&quot; is a cute behind-the-scenes kind of look at what went into making Gilmore girls happen. Nice interviews with cast members about auditions and the show's obscure references. It'd be nice if they continued this for each season's set.<BR>  *&quot;Gilmore Goodies and Gossip&quot; haven't watched it all the way through yet, but this feature is a &quot;Pop Up Video&quot; kind of feature on the &quot;Rory's Dance&quot; episode that gives us extra information. (You can also watch the episode without the goodies, they're on 2 seperate disks.)<BR>  *&quot;Gilmore-isms&quot; is a montage of cute little phrases/references said in Gilmore girls.<br />-Clarity. This is a big Duh since it's a DVD set, but I've been watching old, VHS-taped episodes, so it's nice to see them with the right colors!<BR>-Shipping through Amazon was practically overnight, very impressed.<BR>-And the biggest Pro of all...Gilmore girls on DVD, period!<br />Cons:<BR>-Additional Scenes: There are only three. I wish there were more of them.<BR>-Special Features: They're all nice, but I would have really liked to see something like bloopers/outtakes. I bet they'd be hilarious.<br />-No episode listing anywhere besides the little booklet. Meaning, to figure out what disk to put in to watch &quot;Kiss and Tell,&quot; you have to look in the little booklet. No listings by or on the actual DVDs. <br />All in all, this set is great! I can't wait til Season 2 comes out.

B00005RDSM|2.0|i've always loved Peter Pan, and I grew up watching this cartoon along with the Mary Martin version. But after seeing the new live action Peter Pan, I have to conclude that this version is dull as dirt!!! First of all, Wendy and her brothers aren't SUPOPOSED to be telling stories ABOUT Peter Pan...the kids aren't supposed to have heard of him!! So when Peter flies in, it's very anti-climatic. Wendy is just like, Oh, Peter, you're here finally. Yawn!! I think Wendy had a lovely voice but the character is just annoying!! All she does is babble on while she sews Peters shadow. There is zero connection between Peter and Wendy, and that's a big problem. Tinkerbelle is the best character in this, but, she doesn't even get her famous death scene where everyone claps to bring her to life!! Hook using a bomb to hurt Peter instead of poisoning his \\"medicine\\" was really lame. Worst of all, with the exception of \\"You Can Fly!' all of the songs are lame. Do I even have to mention the idiotic \\"Red Man\\" song?? eww. Plus, the Lost Boys aren't supposed to be morons with retarded voices. Very dissapointing. This bland version is ok for little kids, but, to get the REAL story of Peter Pan, watch the NEW movie!!!
B0000636UN|5.0|Sheryl Crow is an artist that I've liked since her first album. I keep expecting her to lose her groove like some other new female artists (Jewel...0304), but she keeps getting better! <br />When I bought this album I was on a cross-country road trip and NEEDED some new music. I fully expected to be disappointed just because I thought Sheryl would eventually get 'stale'. Amazingly, some 2.5 years later this CD still stands up to any other! She's still got her edge!
B00009Z576|4.0|I had to be reminded that I like this album, the whole album, but it &quot;really happened,&quot; thankfully. I don't think I can find a bad song amongst the songs that originally appeared on it. I'm not one of those who's moved by Horn's lyrics being more directly descriptive of anything that Anderson's, but the vocal melodies are pretty catchy if it the words don't lead to spiritual enlightenment, and not easily being able to get a song that you like out of your head, counts for a lot.<br />The &quot;bonus&quot; tracks were a bit misleading, at least to me. I was expecting more songs by the album's unique line-up rather than tracks with Jon and Rick, for one thing. Rather than adding more music, they add more insight, but much of that insight is worthwhile.<br />Maybe the last 3 or the 4 tracks with Jon and Rick help to understand their departure at the time, I certainly didn't find them as striking or as brilliant as Yes at their best, to put it mildly. For the other extras, I'm glad that &quot;Satellite&quot; (sounding unfinished here) didn't originally make the original product, and... well, there's a very good reason it's called &quot;Do We Really Have to Go Through This?&quot; - it's almost painful to listen to, but at least these two tracks make me respect and appreciate what the album was originally made of, all that much more.<br />For me, the biggest insight comes from the bonus rough take of &quot;Tempus Fugit,&quot; and from &quot;Dancing Throught the Light&quot;. Maybe it was the articles I read at the time, but I always thought the addition of Horn and Downes was incredibly contrived. Exit Anderson and Wakeman, and &quot;oh lookee here, we just so happen to have a keyboardist and high pitched voice with some Scottish accent right here in our very own stable,&quot; saith the management, &quot;New Age becometh New Wave!&quot; and ka-ching! saith the cash registers...<br />Somehow I'd ended up thinking that the writing on Drama was just as contrived, that &quot;The Buggles&quot; had written a whole album of &quot;Yes songs&quot; on demand as if they were writing jingles for soap commercials. In the bonus version of &quot;Tempus Fugit,&quot; it's all there already except the keys and Horn's vocals and lyrics, Horn sounds like he's making it up as he goes along and even then doesn't have words for it all, and resorts to just scat singing. Somehow, I find it rather endearing to hear him not being the calculating, pre-fabricated monster I'd been left to believe, it sounds more like he and Downes had to WORK HARD at being Yes, and I have a whole new respect for them, for the band, and for and the whole album, for hearing it.<br />Granted I could get more familiar with Yes biographic materials, but still no amount of biography would be as believable as hearing it for myself.<br />&quot;Dancing Throught the Light&quot; isn't much of a bonus track but it also helps dispel this awful myth of this album being a die-cut, plastic-molded Buggles version of Yes, it's a crude version of &quot;Run Through the Light&quot; with Jon through a vocoder, proving the song basically existed even before Trevor and Geoff stepped in to fill Jon and Rick's great big shoes.<br />And maybe, just maybe, somewhere in what you hear in the tracks that show how the songs developed, could be a possible antidote for what seems to often come up in Yes reviews as even hardcore fans wishing Jon would leave some of his &quot;Yes&quot; stuff for his solo albums, to put it kindly. Howe, White and Squire are apparently only in peak form here not only as performers, but as composers, and it made for a very solid album easily capable of outshining even some of the better moments of what followed.
B000001E21|5.0|Not too long ago, Def Leppard was one of the most exciting bands in rock; they were popular AND talented, a dynamite combination of one part brain, one part heart, and one part libido, that mixed up one of the best formulas around. Unfortunately, critics started blaming them for just that - \\"The Formula.\\" Then, in recent years, as they've been trying to fight their way out of \\"The Formula\\" label, fewer people have been noticing/caring, and critics that DO notice make sure to slam them for trying to be something they are not. Alas, in the case of Def Leppard, I DO agree with that unfortunate claim.<br />Regardless of what type of person you are, Leppard Hater, Leppard Lover, Leppard \\"They [stunk] since Hysteria\\" -er, Leppard \\"I stumbled on this page by accident\\" -er, or other - er -, if you, like me, wish the real Def Leppard would please stand up, buy Retro Active and prepare to get more of your 15 bucks worth than you have in awhile. It's been a decade since this last great Def Leppard Album, but a decade isn't as much as one might think, given it would take another quick decade after this to go back to their Pyromania days. And the bottom line is that, not so long ago, they really were on a role, musically speaking. I can't believe how much I almost forgot how much I loved this band till I threw this on the stereo a few weeks ago - and subsequently haven't been able to stop listening to it. \\"X\\" really is a bad album, so bad, it brainwashed me into temporarily losing too much respect for the band. It's hard for me to tell if they really have always been a little too money hungry, but regardless, if you like good music, let's put everything aside and proclaim the wonderful evolutionary direction the band was going in the early 90's, with the wonderful succession of Pyromania to Hysteria to Adrenalize to ironically, a \\"retro\\" album.<br />Without giving it all away, here's a quick runthrough of the wonderfully long (did I mention you get your money's worth) and successfully diverse (keyword - SUCCESSFULLY) song roster. \\"Desert Song\\" took awhile to grow on me, but once it did, I woke up to the AMAZING guitar solos -- they were showing signs of prog with their choices of scale usages and rhythmic motives! And they STILL managed to be catchy. I wish they would have taken that idea and made all of their subsequent music with that in mind. \\"Fractured Love\\" has highly effective percussive elements while still keeping a shoutalong chorus (think the next logical step after \\"Rocket\\"). The way they covered \\"Action\\" really blows me away, as I wish their own writing was as experimental yet quality filled as those that influenced them. There are the hits \\"Two Steps Behind\\" and \\"Miss You in a Heartbeat\\", both with acoustic and electric versions. The latter has a piano/vocal version also.<br />Personally, the electric version of \\"Two Steps Behind\\" is one of their best all time moments, it just takes me to another world. Fans of the \\"Leppard Layering technique\\" - with guitars upon guitars and vocals upon vocals - will not be disappointed. Joe Elliot plays some cool (albeit inexcusably short) boogie woogie piano as the intro to a revision of one of their earliest songs (\\"Ride into the Sun\\"), and REALLY hits the jackpot with the gutwrenchingly highly artistic collaboration with the Hothouse Flowers (\\"From the Inside\\"). The marriage of music to lyrics here is supreme. The driving d minor riff to \\"Ring of Fire\\" will have you hypnotized into playing it yourself for hours on end, and \\"I wanna be your hero\\" and \\"She's Too Tough\\" are way too strong to merely exist as B Sides.<br />I could go on forever, but I believe my point is made. Who REALLY is Def Leppard? It's always controversial to answer a question like that with one particular album, released, years ago, and ESPECIALLY when the answer isn't \\"Hysteria.\\" And in fact, it's not that it's not \\"Hysteria\\". Again, \\"Retro Active\\" is a collection of all sorts of various material, much of which was originally given birth along with that landmark album from 1987.<br />Bottom line: THIS is why today's rock music is inexcusable. It (including Leppard) has only gotten worse since then, and with an album like this, there really is something here for everyone. Why aren't today's bands feeling more of a kick in the [rear]? It's because not even the record companies think that music is in a lot of trouble.<br />If you feel the same way, email me.
0451196716|5.0|Stephen King's &quot;The Long Walk&quot; was a great story.  As well as following through on King's natural horror story lines, King also depicts a horrible truth about mankind and it's search and thirst for entertainment. The crowds that line the roads to watch the Long Walkers, cheer even louder as child after child is shot, after falling and passing out from exhaustion or just being driven to the point of insanity, and... ripping his throat out.  In the book, a boy named Ray Garraty, signs up for The Long Walk.  A contest where the losers are given a &quot;ticket&quot; and shot.  100 boys begin the contest, one ends it, one lives.  Ray walks on as he sees his own life compromised and watches boys just like him have thier blood paint the road.  I STRONGLY reccomend reading this book. As well as chilling you and causing temporary insanity, hehe just kidding, this book will truly horrify you.  &quot;The Long Walk&quot; should be read by anyone looking for a scare and a stomach to handle King's signiture, extremely detailed descriptions.
B00005YW4H|4.0|As a progrock and classical music nut, I am PLEASED to report that atleast SOMETHING has come along to relieve our numb ears of 10 years of disillusionment in the music industry.<br />Most likely the immense success of this album (reaching #1!) has been something of an unpredicted fluke from left field, but... THANK GOD!!!! I absolutely give maximum respect to those with incredible musical sense that play the game and straddle the fine line between art and commercialism, in order to get their music out to the masses. This album is pure mellow soul with jazz lacings and a rock subconsciusness. Not a commercial sellout by any means, but a &quot;crossover&quot; (stupid term) success nonetheless. Bottom line, this is the best new thing since Dream Theater. Musically worlds apart, of course, but both made sure to only do what they were musically motivated to do, not compromising to the record company... and both happened to get many people to tune in. All songs on this album are similar in atmosphere, yet within the atmosphere, there is subtle diversity that flows from track to track and concludes as it is meant to be, with a cover of a standard. This girl has my support.<br />If like many people, you want to just take a breath and a time out from what the music industry keeps shoving down your throats and ears, buy this and come away with Norah. Amen.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|Oh, we should all be thanking God above for this band.  Jet is the world's only indication that rock &amp; roll is NOT dead, at least not yet!  <BR>Taking their inspiration from seventies rockers AC/DC, Jet has managed to make an album that any band should be proud to claim.  And best of all, the songs are original!  None of this &quot;I'll just copy an old song and throw in my own lyrics&quot; stuff for this Austrailian band.  <BR>So, all I have to say is, &quot;Thank you God&quot;!<BR>love, woodstock
B00007BH5C|5.0|In as grand a scale as can exist, this is Shore's second movement to the most epic cinematic symphony of all time. I think I did a solid Fellowship review, so my commentary on &quot;The Two Towers&quot; = my first review + the following:<br />Shore now wildly intertwines some of the beloved familiar themes with new ones. The instantly classic violin signature for Rohan erupts triumphantly from a well prepared three minute bed of a lush string lead-in.<br />The Ents, always a favorite part of mine, are given musical life in quite the spine-tingling fashion. Sparse percussion and atonal bassoons make you feel like you yourself are lost and wandering in an atmosphere that is so silent but eerily ready to bubble over with an ancient life.<br />And here's the gem:<br />Just as with the tasteful Enya tune from the first installment, someone hit a grand-slam with the idea for &quot;Gollum's Song.&quot; Penned by Shore with Fran Walsh (and perfectly sung by the appropriately off-center voice of Emiliana Torrini), this also gives monstrous credit to Shore as a songwriter as well! &quot;Gollum's Song&quot; is EVERYTHING that a good song should be, regardless of genre/style. Some of the freshest chord changes I've heard in quite some time are topped off with a frighteningly haunting melody, touching lyrics, careful orchestration, and excellently alienating emotional aesthetics. And along with all that - it's peculiarly catchy! One may feel him or her self really feeling for Gollum with this gutwrenching piece of music, without any real visual accompaniment. The movie crew made you feel for a computer-generated character, and now the sound crew has you feeling those same things all over again - but this time, blind. A++++ on this one.<br />The careful detail of language, period instrumentation, awe-inspiring chord progressions, and musical story-telling remains as solid and passionate as ever, and it leaves you just begging the question of how will Howard bring it all home withthe climactic final disc (if you don't have it already!). In case you feel that the middle installment is less significant than its surrounding partners, be advised: that would be a mistake.
B0001HAISG|5.0|eventhough i'm 24 this movie made me feel like a toddler it's really worthseeing, it'll make you dream, and i can only say &quot;I believe in Fairies!!!&quot;
B000002HK4|5.0|To paraphrase the liner notes, &quot;Here's a little ditty that we came up with in 5 minutes to hold you over til our next full album.&quot;<br />The little ditty, mind you, is a megamasterpiece, a multiple movement epic, a true rock symphony. And although nobody else in the universe should adhere to what I'm about to say, it does hold true in the single case of DT; this is the greatness that this band can produce when they don't think too much.  A good bit of their music is sometimes littered with coldness, a plethora of empty notes that don't lead anywhere.  This is particulary apparent on their &quot;Train of Thought&quot; album.  But here, in an effort to just get anything out, DT clung to their emotions as much as their technical beastiality.  Don't get me wrong, there's alot of &quot;notes.&quot; But on this album, they often get placed perfectly.  Some sections even have anthemic shout-along chorus type parts, reminiscent of Bon Jovi - &quot;Innocence caressing me...&quot; and &quot;O come let us adore him...&quot; are two highly distinctive examples.  <br />What makes &quot;Change of Seasons&quot; so remarkable is that it doesn't just stay on one plane, as with many shredder bands out there.  There's a real pacing, give and take, development of themes, progressing to epic climaxes, then denoument...just like a good book.  And that's what puts this music above the risk of hollow, empty notes. Having achieved that, they are free to intermingle all the extra trappings of &quot;prog&quot; without the danger of losing the point (innovative harmonies, time signature changes, instrumental sections, etc.). <br />Thesis statement: instrumental arrangements and emotional songwriting are balanced superbly, yielding 23 minutes of rhapsodic greatness that you'll just want to listen to over and over...as you should, or you won't pick up on half of what's going on.  It rocks, it makes a statement, and it tastefully pushes the envelope in a way hardly ever dreamed of by anyone else.  Oh, and throwing in the best performance of covers EVER at the end wasn't a bad idea either.  Bohemian Rhapsody and Carry On Wayward Son are two of the greatest songs ever written, and here they are in the same breath.  This album's achievement is so colossal, it's almost humorous when you try to really think about it. Don't be without it.<br />If you are of the same opinion, you are highly encouraged to drop me an email...
B00005ASOI|3.0|Argento has a talent for inserting subtle clues in his movies (maybe the best example being the initial scene in Deep Red). <br />In Suspiria he inserts at least two intriguing clues, by willingly subverting science, as a way to alert us to the presence of unearthly evil. Just a few seconds before the scene in which maggots fall from the ceiling, we see some water draining from a sink, and rotating clockwise. This contradicts the myth (if not the reality) of the fact that in the upper emisphere the Coriolis force would impose a counterclockwise rotation (...). It seems to me that the deliberate choice of rotation in the sink is not casual, but rather a clue that Argento is giving us that 'not all is well' in the school. A second clue comes towards the end of the movie, when we see water spurting from in a gutter, in an apparent violation of basic principles of pressure. Once again, this violation of physics occurs just a few seconds before the horror begins.   <br />I am not a fan of this particular movie (though it is quite rich in atmosphere, and the use of color -from the very beginning- is intriguing), but I did found these subtle uses of science to be interesting.
B000148KK2|5.0|After owning this album for 48 hours I have literally listened to &quot;The Girl in the Other Room&quot; non-stop. Being  a former fan of Diana Krall's music, I fail to understand the general outcry and disapproval of this album from her former fans. They are missing so much... I applaud Diana for her boldness to follow her desire to grow in her musical talent and refusal to crank out slick cookie-cutter jazz albums. I truly believe time will reward her efforts.<br />  This album is a treasure and certainly promises to become the cd I play the most as I sit by the ocean sipping a cold drink this summer!
B00005R2M3|5.0|i was looking inside the album cover for the thank you message from shakira but there was none and an explanation of what her album title means but whatever lol her music is unique and i love it..i like whenever,wherever (weird but different lyrics) but i get its point, objection (shes kinda dissin herself), and many more! this album is hot..theres another song i like but i forgot what the songs called..anyways this cd has a refreshing cover to it as well..she looks really nice her curly hair and i like her tatoo, buying this cd was something new for me.. i mostly buy rnb and pop albums but this has a different sound not in the latin sense but the rock or alternative or whatever u wana call it..cool interestin cd!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I preface this review by confessing to being a sci-fi junkie.  I watch Star Trek (in all its incarnations), Babylon 5, Farscape, heck, I even watched Lost in Space as a kid.  Make that, USED to watch.  Now, I do not watch TV at all.  I was angry when Farscape was canceled by the Sci Fi channel, I was sad when Star Trek: TNG and DS9 went off the air, and I still miss Babylon 5.  But never have I been as outraged, despondent, and all around frustrated as when Fox gave Firefly the premature boot.  Here was a series with great writing, great acting, great production values - after only a few episodes, I had really come to care about there characters, about what happened to them.  I wanted to know their history, I wanted to follow their exploits.  In short, this was one of the best shows I had ever seen - and how did Fox treat it?  They preempted it at least twice (on the US West coast), showed the episodes out of order, and canceled it after a very brief run because it had not turned into an instant mega-hit.  That was it for me - in a world where a show as good as Firefly can be unceremoniously scrapped and frelling dreck like \\"reality TV\\" can proliferate, there is no TV left that I care to watch.  If you want to see something different, something stimulating, something fun - something that after only a few weeks of actual airtime has managed to build a devoted fan following, then watch this DVD.  I do not think you will be disappointed.
B000002OZY|5.0|The original versions of these songs I have to say are better than any I've heard.  Sure, some of the songs on the movie soundtrack are pretty good(i.e. Cousin Kevin, The Acid Queen, Sally Simpson, Fiddle About).  But, others on this album are far better(I'm Free, Pinball Wizard, Christmas, It's A Boy, Amazin Journey).<br />After hearing this album, I really want to write a rock opera myself.<br />Overture - 10/10<br />It's a Boy - 10/10<br />1921 - 10/10<br />Amazing Journey - 10/10<br />Sparks - 10/10<br />Eyesight to the Blind - 10/10<br />Christmas - 10/10<br />Cousin Kevin - 8/10 - I think the movie version is better.  But, this one is equally good.  Slow and melodic and creepy. =D<br />Acid Queen - 7/10 - I really love Tina Turner's version better.<br />Underture - 10/10 - Just beautiful to listen to all by itself.<br />Do You Think it's Alright? - 10/10<br />Fiddle About - 7/10 - Very good, but I prefer the movie version.<br />Pinball Wizard - 10/10 - Better than the movie version.<br />There's a Doctor - 10/10<br />Go to the Mirror - 10/10<br />Tommy, Can Your Hear Me? - 10/10 - Very folk sounding.  And when they get to saying 'Tommy' over and over, sounds like a broken record.  Very good. =)<br />Smash the Mirror - 10/10 - Very good to dance to.<br />Sensation - 10/10<br />Miracle Cure - 10/10 - Interesting little 12 second song.<br />Sally Simpson - 10/10 - I love this song.<br />I'm Free - 10/10 - Good music.<br />Welcome - 10/10 - Very laid-back song.<br />Tommy's Holiday Camp - 10/10 - This song is very fun and creepy in a way.<br />We're Not Gonna Take It - 10/10 - Better than the movie and a great way to end the album.<br />This album is nice to listen to on a rainy day or on a long car trip.
B0000AMRJC|4.0|If anybody says that al pacino isn't one of the greats shouldn't be watching movies, Period.<BR>The first time you watch this movie and the first scene with al pacino you feel his presence and i was in awe of the way he played the part of Tony Montana.<BR>It is without a doubt an amazing story and a great job has been done by Francis Ford Coppola-esque director Brian De Palma.<BR>In brief this is a story of when CUban dictator Fidel castro deported most of his criminals to america in boats which was thought by the states to be reuniniting families.<BR>Cue the crime rate soaring and Tony montana, a small time cuban villain.<BR>The film shows him start at the bottom of the bottom of the business and work his way up with his long time cuban accomplice Manalo Ray. Eventually he takes over the business even tho you could tell it was inevitable it was well thought out and shot.<BR>But by far the best part of the film has to be the ending, i have never enjoyed the ending of a film before but i loved it, it also has the immortal line &quot;say hello to my little friend!&quot; which has been voted numerous time to be the best film quote ever.<BR>All in all this one of the great gangster films ever produced along with The godfather and Goodfellas, this film is a MUST SEE!
B000002OVJ|5.0|This is what live rock and roll is meant to be. The songs practically bristle with electric intensity, and the performances are second to none. Daltrey has never sung better, or with more conviction and swagger. Moon and Entwistle provide a razor sharp rhythm behind every song: Moon at his frenzied best, and Entwistle, stomping his way through the songs like Godzilla invading Tokyo. Ringleader Pete Townsend just slays the guitar parts, earning him the title The Best Sloppy Guitarist Ever (AKA the Neil Young Award). Standout cuts include &quot;Amazing Journey/Sparks&quot;, &quot;Young Man Blues&quot; (Wow!), and &quot;Summertime Blues&quot;. If this album does not give you goosebumps on every listen, then go back to letting your brain rot as it chews on the saccharine goop offered forth by the pop stars of the day. For all others, buy this record and ROCK!!!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I don't care what other people say about this film: IT IS BORING AS WATCHING YOUR HARD DRIVE REFORMAT ITSELF. It has no plot. It's just one boring event after another, spiced with vulgar elements that do nothing to help the story. This movie sucks. If you want to watch a foreigner trying to fit into the Japanese culture, watch Wasabi instead. It has humor, action, and a 45 calibur revolver. LiT will likely end up &quot;Lost in the back of my mind&quot; within a few weeks. It is JUST THAT BORING. The one star I give this movie is because it has some nice footage of Tokyo and the Japanese culture, and because I like Bill Murray, even if he was poorly used in this movie and wasn't 1/10th as funny as he was in his other movies (in fact, he's not very funny at all here). This movie deserved to get snubbed at the oscars, as much as it pains me to say it. I'm not even sure if it deserved the one oscar it got (which I can't even remember what it was).
B00005QJDG|4.0|Not entirely sure why this is labeled as a &quot;box set.&quot;  It's a 3-CD set.  With the exception of tracks 6, 7 and 10 on disc two (which are just filler IMO), and &quot;The Mirror&quot; and &quot;Just Let Me Breathe&quot; (which I'm simply not partial to), the material here is strong.  The production quality is just OK, however.  For whatever reason, DT has NEVER been able to do justice to John Myung's bass work on any live recording (for that matter, JM's sound has always been deficient at all of the shows I've attended).  His solos on &quot;Metropolis, Part 1,&quot; and &quot;The Dance of Eternity&quot; are muffled and garbled.  The other production issue relates to Petrucci and Portnoy's backing vocals.  As these guys start doing more and more background vocals, they REALLY need to take some voice lessons.  I'm at a loss to understand how they could leave in the COMPLETELY off-key harmony part on &quot;Fatal Tragedy.&quot;  Finally, and unfortunately, this CD is not flattering to James LaBrie as a vocalist.  I've never liked it when singers can't hit the high notes live that they hit on albums.  If you can't sing the part consistently, re-write it so that you can.
B00006RU5B|3.0|Audioslave's self titled debut was probably one of the most anticipated hard rock albums of 2002.  Many were eager to get a piece of the fusion of two of the greatest hard rock bands of the 1990's.  While Audioslave's first album is a good work, especially in these days of corporate punk rock, it lacks the depth and creativity that could propel the band to greatness.  <br />I have been both a huge Soundgarden fan and a Rage Against the Machine (RATM) fan since the early 90's, and have had the privilege of seeing both bands in concert.  I eagerly anticipated the release of Audioslave, and bought the album within a day or two after its release.  I have truly enjoyed listening to the album, as I am sure most who own the album have.  Still I can't help but compare their album to earlier works by both Soundgarden and RATM.<br />Audioslave plays hard, in your face, rock.  They are extremely good at it.  However, they lack depth because they tend to rely too much on RATM's formulaic approach to song writing.  Every song carries a very similar straight forward drum beat.  Brad Wilk's drumming style worked well for RATM but is noticeably lacking for Audioslave. A more creative percussion style would work better for Audioslave.<br />Also, Tom Morello always feels the need to do a wild solo in every song.  Not that his guitar solos don't sound cool, but they often don't flow with and sometimes take away from the song.  I thought Tom's solos were the best when he broke out of his own mold and played a smooth sounding solo like on \\"The Last Remaining Light.\\" Audioslave also needs to realize that not every song needs a guitar solo to sound good.<br />Chris Cornell is an outstanding lyricist and vocalist.  He has proved himself with Soundgarden, as a solo artist, and now with Audioslave.  But, Audioslave is failing to take advantage of another talent Chris has-playing the guitar.  Chris could add a lot of depth to Audioslave's sound by playing rhythm guitar.  By utilizing Chris onthe guitar, both Tom and Tim are free to experiment with their parts a bit more.  I really think it would add a lot to their sound.<br />In conclusion, I realize that my write-up was more a critique of the band rather than the album, but if Audioslave is to be remembered as equally great with their predecessors, they have to break out of their mold a bit more.  Both Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine were great bands.  Audioslave is a good band that can become great.  They just have to, pardon the overused expression, \\"think outside the box.\\"
0743455967|5.0|I've read and heard of Stephen King for years. He's aced the popular fiction markets for years, but within this book I think I received a peep of Stephen King. With all his success, he's still retains a bit of the regular &quot;Joe&quot; sort of a guy. And as he promised, this book is not just another book of BULL to sell to wanna' be writers.
0060527978|5.0|To truly be kind and good, you need time, patience and morals. The Guide to The Warrior of Light, by Paolo Coelho, is a remarkable and inspiring book. I could feel Coelho's message to the reader, that he believes that there can be a Warrior of Light in each and every one of us. To wake up the good and the true within us, that is what Coelho wants to achieve for the people who read the book. When he tried to get through the point, about generosity, love, pity, and compassion, you feel as if the writer is in front of you, opening up his soul like you're old friends, sharing those feelings and emotions. The story line is more philosophical than any other of Coelho's books, and wakes up beliefs within the reader, that all of us can change and aspire to be Warriors of Light. It is a beautifully written book that I would recommend to everyone.
0792842073|2.0|I did not like the movie really.It is filled with many feelings and impressions and is many sided but I think it is not so close to the  reality although it tried to show the truth.<BR>The movie was a bit too religious and Matthew Poncelet's part was not well presented by Sean Penn. He acted more like an actor and not like a guilty man who denies having comitted the murder.<BR>To put it in a nutshell I would say that the story and the idea is great but it is not very well done.<br />I would recommend this movie to others because it shows the different angles and views of the people very well although I did not like the movie. <br />--A student's opinion from Germany--
B000000W6F|5.0|Here is The Smashing Pumpkins' full-length debut album from 1991. The Pumpkins' sound here displays what we would come to expect from the gang: heavy, searing, multi-tracked guitars (which often gets compared to Brian May - of Queen fame), melancholic, dreamy soundscapes and lyrics, contrasts from heavy sounds to soft sounds. However, these are the beginning stages of what would fully blossom on later efforts like 1993's _Siamese Dream_, and 1995's _Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness_. While the heavy tracks feature the ethereal wall-of-sound that the Pumpkins are known for, this heaviness is not as full, lush, and oceanic as it would become on aforementioned following discs, but you can hear where the band was headed.<br /><br />However, when taken as it is -- an album showing the band in it's earliest stages -- _Gish_ is an excellent, highly enjoyable album. It is hardly a disappointing album -- far, far from it. The Pumpkins' amalgamation of heavy (but melodic and dreamy) rockers and dreamy, atmospheric, psychedelic-tinged mellow tracks appear here, giving ample proof that the Pumpkins didn't necessarily change their sound over the years, but rather refined it. \\"I Am One\\" and \\"Siva\\" open up the album on hard-driving notes. The former could be heard on alternative rock radio stations, even to this day. Do you think that because The Smashing Pumpkins made hard-rockers, they used nothing more than simple power chords? Well, both these tracks feature arpeggiated chords that are beyond simple.<br /><br />The hard-driving rockers are interrupted for what are possibly the most ethereal, wispy, mood-inducing six minutes on the album: \\"Rhinoceros\\" is such a heavenly beauty, and is without a doubt, my favorite track on this album. Billy Corgan's acquired vocal stylings blend perfectly with the dreamy atmospheres brought on by the guitar arpeggios, textured arrangements, and the treatment of them all. Many complain about Billy's voice, but what other vocalist could complement the Pumpkins' music as perfectly as his? Nobody I can think of (except maybe one of the other Pumpkins.. ), but regardless, his voice was an ethereal instrument unto itself.<br /><br />Elsewhere, \\"Crush\\" seems to foreshadow \\"Thirty-Three,\\" as it's a dream-folk track (it's very hard to categorize in exact terms.) Billy's vocals are lovely here. \\"Snail\\" is a moody piece that seems to share a kinship with most adult contemporary music -- except this rocks harder, and the lyrics are probably a bit more inscrutable. The rocker \\"Tristessa\\" sounds like it could have been a dry run for \\"Cherub Rock.\\" Listen to some of those whacked-out fills from drummer extraordinaire Jimmy Chamberlain. \\"Window Paine\\" is almost as mood-inducing as \\"Rhinoceros,\\" and takes it's time by resting on one or two chords, which build up to an explosive, cathartic climax, and the ethereal, acoustic closer \\"Daydream\\" features bassist D'Arcy on lead vocals, followed by a brief coda from Billy.<br /><br />An excellent album from an excellent band, of whom I miss dearly. Definitely worth owning, but if you're new to the Pumpkins, start with _Siamese Dream_ first.kins' music as perfectly as his?

B00003CX95|5.0|This movie is great. As we all know, It's about Willaim Wallace battling the English for the Scot's freedom. A must se film.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is the best albume of the decade. Its complex music made it much better than Nirvanas Nevermind. Maybe is not the best album of all times, as some people says, but is one of the best stuff I have ever heard. Buy it, you wont be deserved.
B00000DLVA|5.0|It's dark and not so sickeningly sweet as some of the Cardigan's earlier work but that's what makes this particular CD shine. This melancholic Nightmare-Pop of an album is the perfect vehicle for Nina Persson's perfect voice. All the songs are well crafted and complement each other.
B00004R99U|1.0|this movie was rubbish from the start and had a spactacularly rubbish ending. the animation wasnt up to much. it loored like they had taken the original charaters from the first movie and melted them! all the walt disney \\"classics\\" have all had their own style. ie. the lion king had very pricisely drawn figures and was done in bright colours. pocahontas was made of more subtle colours and had a slightly abstract feel about the charcters. in this movie, the drawings just melted into the style of all teh other recent, rubbish disney sequals, nothing special or significant, the sort of animation taht can make you feel sick after watching it to long. this movie didnt quite reach the stage of making me naucious but it very easily could have if it was drawn with a few more of the really rubbish \\"pictures\\". the voices were all different, allthough that might not have been disneys fault.it only had about 3 songs in it and all them sounded like the writen had written them in his/her sleep! <BR>allthough im not sure if the hole ball thing was actually a reference to hitory (i suspect not)i think that was completely FAKE and unrealistic. and since when has pocahontas been able to speak english?!? i know that in the first movie she and john smith could speak in the same languge but 1) you dont know what language that is 2)that was only because the tree did something weird.<BR>was it js me or did pocahontas look completely hidious for a cartoon in this movie?<BR>everyone was SO(...) mean to the little dog (what was his name?!?). pocahontas was hugin meeko all the time but she ignored the dog untill the end. meeko was just evil to the dog, apart from in the rare occasions that he was being sweet to the dog. bt i will admit that meeko (and the dog, and, yes, evan flit) was sooooooooooooo CUTE!<BR>finally, the RUBBISH ending. firstly, pocahontas rejects john smith, who is like, the love of her life(in the first movie anyway)!!!!!! he was completely cool with it as well. she was like \\"we walked the same path once, but no i know my place.\\" and he was like \\"i hope you find happiness.\\" ok. im 13 and i definately know that my boyfriend isnt long term but evan if HE rejected me like that i would proabl slap him. and john smith was like THE LOVE OF HER LIFE. and then, to make it worse, she went with that pathetic excuse for an animated character JOHN ROLFE who had an unaturally posh accent anf \\"falls in love with him\\". THAT WAS                   W(...)-R(...)-O(...)-N(...)-G(...).!(...)<BR>and john smith was SO(...) SWEET to her throughout the entire movie. one of the fisrt things he said to her were \\"ive though about you every day!\\" that was soo sweet. and pocahontas still loved him at the begining.SHE SHOULD HAVE GONE WITH JOHN SMITH!!!!!!! like ive already said THE ENDING WAS WRONG!!!! walt disney movies always have the same two messages <BR>\\"friendship\\"<BR>and<BR>\\"TRUE LOVE\\"<BR>theyre not supposed to be making films about players.<BR>this movie is RUBBISH!!!!!!!! save yourself the agony and DONT WATCH IT!!!!
B000092ZYX|4.0|As you listen to Radiohead's &quot;Hail To The Thief&quot; you sort of feel like you are listening to a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; CD where you recognize the style but don't without know any of the songs.  This is not as great as it sounds.  &quot;Hail To The Thief&quot; encapsulates the different sounds and styles that Radiohead have experimented with on their other five studio albums and puts all their talents and tricks on one record.  Their recent ventures into electronica and studio trickery can be found here on songs like &quot;Sit Down. Stand Up&quot;, &quot;The Gloaming&quot;, and &quot;Sail To The Moon&quot;.  All of these songs are decent, but none of them match their best work done in this style like Kid A's &quot;Everything In It's Right Place&quot; and &quot;Ideoteque&quot; or Amnesiac's &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot;.  The better part of &quot;Hail To The Thief&quot; comes when Radiohead returns to (slightly) more straightforward rock that recalls The Bends and the My Iron Lung EP.  &quot;Go To Sleep&quot; is reminiscent of Bends era ballads like &quot;High &amp; Dry&quot; or &quot;Fake Plastic Trees&quot; and &quot;We Suck Young Blood&quot; is in that same vein as well.  While &quot;Myxomatosis&quot; and &quot;A Wolf At The Door&quot; updates the rock stylings of their earlier albums with some of their new studio tricks.  Finally, &quot;2+2=5&quot; and &quot;There There&quot; recall sound and feel of their greatest album - OK Computer.  About the only thing not represented is the Morrissey meets Grunge Rock blend found on their breakthrough single &quot;Creep&quot; - which should surprise no one since the band has long separated themselves from that song.<br />However, &quot;Hail To The Thief&quot; doed not add up to the sum of its parts.  Aside from the opener &quot;2+2=5&quot;, the faintly Zepplin-esque &quot;Go To Sleep&quot; and a trio of classics found spread over the last four songs: &quot;A Punchup At A Wedding&quot;, &quot;Myxomatosis&quot;, and&quot;A Wodl At The Door&quot; - this album can only be called better than Kid A and Amnesiac, but not the equal of The Bends or OK Computer.  That said, it is very good, but should be the third Radiohead CD you purchase.
6304068441|3.0|I think the movie is alright. But I did not watch the whole movie.<BR>I think that the movie was well made. I like that it is a religous movie, because I am religous, too. But for those who are not religous, the movie might be to be exaggerated.  <BR>I also liked that it showed both sides. Matt's sight and the victim's parents sight. <BR>I liked sister Helen's role in this movie. She had a very interesting role and the way she dealed with this situation was goos, because it was very problematic.<BR>But I really have to say that I would not watch the movie by myself if we didnt watch it in school. Although it was well made I do not like that kind of movies. But this is my personal opinion.
B00004R99F|3.0|After first sitting through this movie with my elder sister, I wondered how she managed to rope me into it. I was tired, groaning inwardly, and vowing to avoid this movie at all costs. Why three stars then, if it was such a brain killer? Because, for children around 8-13, and the occasional person such as my dear sister, it was a smash hit that would be remembered for years, or at least for a week. The Goofy antics, and a star cameo by none other than Bigfoot, had her rolling in stiches of laughter even while I was just rolling my eyes. Goofy stays in clutzy form with the extra trouble of single dadhood, while Max is the stereotypical &quot;selfish only child&quot; for a good part of the movie. However, there are a few characters I have to sheepishly admit liking, no matter how... colorful they where. As a Father-Son bonding movie, with memorable characters, and crazy antics it's so-so for adults but great for children.
B0000009TJ|5.0|This is definitely one of the best live recordings of any band that I have ever heard.  This band is so tight, ripping through some of Zappa's more complicated arrangements at break-neck tempos, it's almost inhuman.  Chad Wackerman sounds so relaxed - like it's freakin easy.  Zappa must have been giddy when he found this drum dork. All of the musicians give incredible performances as they execute Zappas vision to a tee.  A lot of work went into rehearsing this material, but it was worth it.<br />I have heard a lot of live Zappa records, but this takes the cake.  If you prefer the looser aesthetic of the old Mothers stuff, then you might not dig this.  However, this is really what Zappa wanted all along: a machine to play his music.  In the end, that is literally what he was using.  I, for one, cherish these performances.  <br />If you are a Zappa fan and you do not have this record, you must buy it.  If you are not a Zappa fan, it might be a good place to start.  If you like to hear great music played by extremely skilled musicians, you can't go wrong.  This album really showcases many aspects of Zappa's music, always in its best light.  <br />Oh, and the guitar solos rip as usual.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|Tim Burton once again proves that if nothing else, he's capable of very odd and arresting visuals done at the service of his story.  Some quite funny moments (my favorite is the North Korean ventriloquist) and just some really odd and unusual images, along with some endearing and likeable characters made this an entertaining film.  However, I found the &quot;moral&quot; of the story to be fairly wishy-washy and lukewarm (we live on in our stories), devoid of any real intellectual sustenance.  Still, a film certainly worth watching (and yes, that really tall guy is pretty much really that tall-about 7 feet), especially for the humor and visuals.
B0001HAISG|5.0|I'd never understood the story of Peter Pan. The Disney version is still probably my least favorite fairy tale adaptation of all of the Disney animated films. And every play or televised version featured a Peter Pan who was played by a tiny, female actress or gymnast, doing very little to bring the story to life for me. So last year, when I took my children to see the movie, I figured I'd settle in for a little nap while they enjoyed the kiddie flick. Boy, was I ever surprised when I walked out of the theatre completely bedazzled.<br />Never before has this story been presented with the very important angle of the innocent romance between Wendy and Peter, an angle that goes a long way in explaining both the reluctance and the desire to grow up. Finally, with this adaptation, I understood why Wendy might decide to grow up despite the allure of Neverland, and why Peter might regret his eventual decision to remain a forever-boy. <br />Adding to this the wonderful chemistry between Jeremy Sumpter and Rachel Hurd-Wood and you have a movie that appeals to kids on an adventure level and to adults on an emotional level. The vulnerability and grief in Peter's eyes during the final scene were enough to bring tears to my own. And I have to say that this movie contained one of the sweetest on-screen kisses I've seen in a long time. Using actors that are (or are very near) the actual ages of Wendy and Peter was a spot-on decision, because their very natural fascination with each other and awkwardness about these new and amazing feelings showed in every one of their scenes together.<br />The film itself is beautiful and lush. Only complaint I have is in the final battle scene between Peter and Captain Hook when the red lighting is used to an extreme, making it difficult to see properly and distracting from rather than adding to the feel of the moment. <br />Finally, I simply loved the casting of this film. Jason Isaacs showed the perfect balance between cartoon evil and human realism with his Captain Hook. Rachel Hurd-Wood was amazing as the fearless girl who could hold her own against pirates and Lost Boys, yet still showed that special romantic, dreamy quality of all young girls. And Jeremy Sumpter perfectly nailed Peter Pan - confident and cocky with a grin that is going to turn into a wicked lady-killer someday, yet still he showed Peter's ultimate sadness so very well.<br />Wonderful movie. I'd pick this one over the Disney version any day of the year.
B000067CPX|4.0|this is a good album, it may not be as good as previous albums(californication or BSSM)but this has a different sound, its a very mature sound having ditched funk for rock it is still good as it gets with stand out tracks like venice queen,tear,can't stop(only traces of funk) and minor thing this varies its sound like the traces of ska(on mercury)this album has been critised by many fans for taking the pedal off from the funk sound but it still is a very good album so if your thinking of getting it buy it now.
B00005RDRO|5.0|My family and I affectionatly refer to this movie as the 'the world's greatest movie,' and we've seen it so often that my sister and I, when we email each other or call each other, end each message with a quote from the movie.<br />In order to truly appreciate the tremendous amount of laugh lines, you've got to watch it at least a dozen times.  My sister and I have watched it at least 30 times if not a lot more, and just this past weekend while I was visiting her in Ithaca, she picked up on another laugh line that we'd never even noticed!<br />The movie seems a bit dry at first, and would probably be a better fit as a stage play; a hilarious one at that.  The movie is a spoof on Agatha Christi's \\"And Then There Were None,\\" and has characters who are spoofs of other TV detectives; i.e., instead of Nick and Nora Charleston, it's Dick and Dora Charleston.  This movie is not necessarily for everyone, but it starts to grow on you.  The first time I saw it I really didn't think it was that funny, but the more I watched, the funnier it got.  Buy this movie!
6300213803|1.0|this movie was really cool, i liked how they CGed in new effects for the special editions and made the wampa more scary. this awesome sequel to star wars is the best ever and is surely irvin kershners masterpiece. &quot;the apathy of khan&quot; is cool not only because of its magnificent sense of mystery and light-hearted puns, but also has a really neat plotline. when it starts out, kirk is battleing the evil forces of khan on the ice world of hoth, and his menacing AT AT walkers. all this, while savik and spock are being pursued across the galazy by khan and his evil star ship. spock is finally lured to genesis and thinks he has found shelter with his friend sarek, but is betrayed, and when kirk come to help him, he faces off in a terrifying chess game with khan.
B00000JG41|5.0|When I first placed this CD into my player, I wasn't sure what to expect. Right off the bat, I was amazed to hear what sounded like a typical Hawaiian beach song, something I never would've expected based on the self-titled and Disco Volante (both summed up as circus speed-metal). It only got better from there. Mr. Bungle covers a lot of musical territory on the album, from jazz to 50's surf, even a surprising combination of traditonal Russian folk and techno. They have definitly stayed true to what makes them a unique band, and Mike Patton certainly doesn't fail to deliver his trademark off-time noises and creative lyrics. The musicianship is flawless, with each song staying true to it's roots. Even if you're unfamiliar with Mike Patton's previous bands, you're practically guarenteed to find a song on here that tickles your fancy. A must-have for anyone that takes music seriously.
B000099T2L|1.0|Who told this woman that whispering and moaning is singing?  Her music is slick, overproduced schlock.  Nothing interesting.  No voice.  Overrated.  Boring!
B00008H2LB|5.0|This group is the best band ever...All of their songs are awesome, including the instrumental ones, without vocals =D<br />These people have amazing talent
B0001ADAVK|1.0|i rented this movie thinking that it would be the perfect chic flick movie to settle me into the weekend. i knew not to expect an intelligent movie, but i very disappointed.  horrible movie. pretty actresses without much of a plot to deliver.  if you want to waste two hours, this is a good, albeit unbeneficial, way to do it. no direction to this movie whatsoever.  i was left wondering, so this is it? it's pure fluff.  i'm sorry, i'm not a genuine movie critic, but i'm telling you as a regular, everyday, just-want-to-watch-a-movie-to-relax, kind of person- this movie is pointless.
6300216748|5.0|This film is very relevant today, as is revealed in the ending (which I won't reveal). I agree with the reviewer that, after countless viewings, I can't put my finger on why it is so mesmerizing.  There is Redford's performance, probably his most nuanced and all round best on film.  There is Pollack's direction, which keeps the film moving so well that you don't have time to think about some of the questionable parts of the script, which nonetheless, serves the film well.  The plot, while a bit convoluted, is superior in my opinion to that of the book on which the film is based.  Max van Sydow is superb as usual, as a hitman who actually finds his job relaxing, and whose hobby is painting little ceramic figurines.  He does not worry about the right or wrong of the cause ... only who is paying him.  John Houseman in a small part plays a menacing career bureaucrat in the CIA.  And Cliff Robertson is excellent as Condor's contact.  You wonder if he is Condor's friend or not.  Well, watch the film.  <br />This is not one of those films that, because it is a suspense film, you might not view again after you know the ending.  &quot;Condor&quot; is delightful upon repeated viewings, even if you know the ending and can recite many bits of dialog by heart.  Again, I can't exactly say why, but has to do with the contributions of the people I enumerated in the previous paragraph.  In &quot;Condor&quot; the whole is more that its quite considerable packet of parts.  It is one of my favorite films of all time.  I'll never tire of it.  I don't think you will either.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Beatles fans take their love for the Fab Four very seriously, as evidenced by some of the disappointment espoused by some enthusiastic fans over this compilation.  I think we can all agree that this is not the ultimate Beatles CD, but - my gosh - you get 27 of the band's most familiar songs crammed on to one single CD.  Even if you have all of the essential Beatles CDs already, it's nice to have such a great one-CD collection.  I would much rather take this little jewel case out to my car than to try and put together a single disc of my own, and this has better sound than any disc I could make myself on my computer.  I'm a big fan but not an expert on the Beatles, so I can't comment on the issue of stereo mastering versus the original mono versions of the earliest hits - to my ears, all of these songs sound great on this CD.  I also won't quibble over what tracks got excluded.  This is a collection of #1 hits, not a greatest hits collection.  These are the songs that hit #1 on the charts of either the UK (Record Retailer) and/or the US (Billboard).  Apparently, even such a seemingly straightforward approach to choosing the tracks allows room for debate - it apparently comes down to what your definition of &quot;#1 hit&quot; should really be.  In the end, the fact that the three surviving Beatles (now, sadly, only two) authorized this compilation is more than enough for me to accept it with open arms (and ears).<br />It's easy to get lost in the enjoyment of such stellar individual songs, but when you take a step back you realize that this CD affords you some interesting insight into the evolution of the band over the course of eight years.  The early songs, while fantastic, are actually not that musically complicated.  By the time you get to the tenth track, Yesterday, you begin to get a wonderful sense of how the Beatles began to innovate and push the boundaries of rock and roll.  They redefined music in their own image, and in the final five years of their existence they established a legacy no band will ever equal - they became the greatest band the world will ever know.  If you want to really see what stereo can mean, there is still no better teacher than Yellow Submarine or the songs from Sgt. Pepper (none of which, rather ironically, are included on this compilation).  I still marvel at the amazing variety of music the band released in its later years - All You Need Is Love, Lady Madonna, Hey Jude, Get Back, Something (the only George Harrison specialty on this CD), Come Together, Let It Be.  What can one say about the amazing variety to be heard in such high-quality songs?  Just compare the first and last track on this album; Love Me Do and The Long and Winding Road could hardly be more different, yet they are both vintage Beatles classics.  <br />This CD was in a certain sense unnecessary, especially for decades-long Beatles fans, yet look what it accomplished.  It immediately jumped to the top of sales charts and inspired yet another grand awakening among the music-listening population of Beatlesmania.  Young people had the chance and the means to discover the Beatles on their own; while that experience will never compare to the craziness and excitement of Beatlesmania in its original form, it is still important.  Decades after their breakup, the Beatles were #1 once again, and that is just one of many reasons why I love this 27-hit compilation CD.
B0002234LS|3.0|\\"Secret Window\\"<BR>Release Date: March 12, 2004<BR>DVD Release Date: June 22, 2004<BR>Genre: Thriller<BR>Studio: Columbia/Tri-Star Pictures<br />Directed by: David Koepp<BR>Starring: Johnny Depp, John Tuturro, Maria Bello, and Charles Dutton<br />Based Upon the novella \\"Secret Window, Secret Garden\\" by Stephen King.<br />MPAA Rating: PG-13 (for violence/terror, sexual content and language)<br />Rating: C+<br />The Story:<BR>Author Mort Rainey (Depp) is going through many problems in his life. He is in the middle of an ugly divorce with his wife (Bello) and he has terrible writer's block. So he goes to live in the middle of the woods in his cabin...alone...to try and write. Not with the arrival of John Shooter (Tuturro) claiming that Rainey had stolen his story, Mort's life slowly slides out of control.<br />The movie is based upon the Stephen King short story \\"Secret Window, Secret Garden\\" in his \\"Four Past Midnight\\" collection and does at times have the feel of a Stephen King novel throughout the movie. With a PG-13, the blood and gore level is not as high as some of King's other movie adaptations (\\"Dreamcatcher\\", \\"It\\", \\"The Shining\\") but there is not a lot of suspense and I called the twist 40 minutes in.<br />What Worked?<BR>Well, the cast is great! Depp, Tuturro, Bello, and Dutton are all great actors and give the best performances they can. Like always, Johnny Depp (\\"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\\", \\"The Ninth Gate\\") is amazing and entertains. He really saves the movie. John Tuturro (\\"Mr. Deeds\\", \\"O, Brother Where Art Thou?\\") gave a creepy but not that menacing performance was John Shooter. Maria Bello (\\"Coyote Ugly\\", \\"The Cooler\\") gave an emotionally driven performance as Depp's soon to be ex-wife. And Charles Dutton (\\"Against the Ropes\\", \\"Gothika\\") was good as well. The cast is the high point of the film.<br />Next I loved the scenery and the music. Since the movie was not all that scary the creepy wilderness scenery and the great score by Phillip Glass (\\"Taking Lives\\", \\"The Hours\\") really made the movie a little scarier.<br />What didn't work?<BR>Well... the movie was extremely predictable! I called the twist not even an hour into the movie! I was very disappointed that I was right! The way the movie looked from the trailer was a suspense filled thrill ride with action and plenty of scares. It was scary until Shooter kept showing up and making threats and then would not do anything! There could have been some freaky chase through the woods, lurking in the shadows type scenes...but there was noting like that. Shooter never jumped out of nowhere or anything, when he showed up he would just talk to Depp character!? <br />The worst part of the movie was the ending! Like I said anyone who likes murder mysteries, horror, thriller movies will be somewhat disappointed because if you know how to watch then correctly you can call this movie from a mile away! So this is a not so \\"secret\\" movie in the end. I am not going to tell you the ending because people will get mad. <br />Bottom Line:<BR>I think this would be an entertaining movie to fans of Depp or anyone in the cast. Teens will flock to see this for a good scare but I recommend renting the DVD because its not that great of a movie.

B0000AQVCL|4.0|I like Jet's style of playing for such songs as &quot;Cold Hard B*tch&quot; and &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot;, but I really dont care too much for some of the slow songs on this album, songs like &quot;Timothy&quot; that just seem to drag on forever puts the album down a bit. I really love the rockers on this album though, and I think these guys should stick with the rockers if they want to be a bit more successful. I like the way they play, influenced by favorite band of all time, AC/DC, I appreciate the way these guys can rock out. Im satisfied with it, I really could do without the boring mellow and slow tracks, but as far as everything else, its a good album and a good break from all this nu-metal and post-grunge bullsh*t that stations like Vh1 and MTV spoon-feed us. I give Jet the thunbs up.
B00003CWPL|5.0|You watch Eraserhead and get the feelings of isolation, hopelessness, desolation. It really sucks you in. One of the rare movies which create tunnel vision. I think one of the reasons why is the awesome soundtrack. You can see a lot of Kafka influences in it. I watched the DVD bought from David Lynch's website, and it's wonderful. They really did a fantastic and meticulous job on the DVD transfer. It's worth the money; polished. Amazing.<BR>It's a movie for people who delve into these sort of things. If you're a person who likes Navy Seals or Julia Roberts movies, don't think about it. If you like Naked Lunch, Alien, Blowup or Man Bites Dog, you should get it.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I dont understand why or even how people can say britney is a great singer.  She couldn't sing to save her life.  This album, just like the rest is overrated and horrible.  Whats with the song &quot;touch of my hand&quot;?  I hate the fact that she is desperately trying to be daring and controversial as Madonna.  Madonna is great and britney is not!! There is no comparison between the two.  Madonna is extremely talented.  Britney just needs to be her own person.  She cant sing.  The only sing she has going for her is her looks, her dancing ability and the fact that she is marketed so well.  Thats it!!
B000002JKA|5.0|I would tend to agree that this is one of DT's darkest/moodiest efforts. This is a serious departure from the more commercially flavored Images and Words and Falling into Infinity releases. Simply put, the songwriters seemingly bore their souls and poured them into a classic. From the catchy &quot;6:00&quot; to &quot;Erotomania&quot; the band showcases musical mastery in a way not unlike the epic prog-rock of Triumph or Rush. DT obviously took the raw genius of their previous release and refined it into a stellar, cohesive production that integrates the excellence of every bandmember. Not quite a concept album, the thread that ties each track together is purely musical. In terms of bang for the buck, this CD really delivers at over 70 minutes...and believe me you'll be hooked on every second. My personal favorites are the &quot;Mind Beside Itself&quot; trilogy and &quot;Scarred&quot;--which I consider their best. Whether this may be considered a &quot;heavy&quot; introduction to Dream Theater, I would say Awake is one of the premier albums of the 1990's.
B000002KIE|5.0|This a great album. I am just sick of all the people dissing the clash. They are far superior to the sex pistols. You cannot put london calling and even anarchy in the uk next together and tell me that anarchy in the uk is better.
B0000013GT|5.0|I must confess... I was not an Outkast fan since the beginning.  I was one of the many people who jumped on the Outkast bandwagon in 2000 with Stankonia.  After B.O.B, Ms. Jackon, and So Fresh, So Clean, I completely forgot about Outkast until 2003 (shame on me) when Speakerboxx/The Love Below came out.  I bought this album in haste when it came out and instantly loved it.  After hearing all the songs on Speakerboxx/The Love Below about 100,000 times each,  I decided to buy ATLiens, with a bit of skepticism.<br />And guess what?  I have no regrets whatsoever.  But enough about me.  This album, to put it simply, is off the chain.  Unlike mainstream rap today, where the same stuff is rapped about over and over (at least some of the songs sound good), this album thinks outside the box.  It starts out with &quot;Two Dope Boyz&quot;, a great way to kick off the album.  This track, though short at only 2:46, lives up to its name; it's DOPE.  Next is the eerie, out of this world &quot;ATLiens&quot;, with its funky laid-back alien beat and the crazy wordplay by Big Boi in the 1st verse.  Then comes the best song on the album in my opinion, &quot;Wheelz of Steel&quot;.  This one definately should of been released as a single, its got a really catchy hook, mad scratching and sweet beat.  Tracks 5 &amp; 6, &quot;Jazzy Belle&quot; &amp; &quot;Elevators&quot; are both excellent slow tracks with the same crazy lyrics and beats you'd expect from Outkast.  Other standouts on this CD include &quot;Mainstream&quot;, &quot;E.T. (Extraterrestrial)&quot;, &amp; &quot;13th Floor/Growing Old&quot;, a piano-based with a touching melody.  The rest isn't quite as good, but it's nothing worth hitting the fast-forward button on.<br />If you want to see where the Album of the Year Speakerboxx/The Love Below came from, pick up this album.  Definately a CD to add to one's collection.<br />P.S. Pick up Speakerboxx/The Love Below if you haven't already!
B0000C6E4D|4.0|This is actually my first experience with Sarah Mclachlan; it will certainly not be the last. I am primarily a jazz fan, but I have found this record complements my jazz collection well.  It has a very surreal sound to it- lots of layered vocals and sustained chords over mid tempo and slow beats.  On the surface, it is very simple music, but it is definitely made for adults- if you listen to the words, they actually do mean something.  This is rather unique in the field of popular music today, and a very refreshing change to the mind-numbing lyrics and singers that think singing involves screaming we are regularly subjected to.  Also unlike typical popular music, it does not make me want to break things or commit other random crimes; it is very relaxing.  Overall, I would say Ms. Mclachlan has one of the best voices in music.  This is well-written music for adults.
B00006V9A0|4.0|This is a fantastic album. All of you nirvana haters dont know what music is. And if you think that the darkness has brought rock n roll back, you have no taste in music. The lead singer of the darkness sounds like he had his balls chopped off or something. Anyway back to nirvana, this c.d lost .5 of a star because of songs like: about a girl, pennyroyal tea and the man who sold the world. They didnt need to put those songs on the c.d. They should have included: Drain You, Polly, Lounge Act, and On A Plain. BUY THIS CD!!!!
B000089RVX|2.0|Evanescence is all about contrast.  Amy Lee's smooth voice over heavy, rock guitar riffs, with some piano and synthesizer just to keep you off-balance.  Despite five million records, there is very little groundbreaking material on this record, just three good songs and filler.  On the contrast theme, I do think Ms. Lee has a great voice.  It's strong and powerful, but also very smooth and even silky at times.  As far as the songwriting, Bring Me To Life is just a great song- I believe the record sold five million to date on the strength of that one song.  It looks like there is some great potential here in the songwriting department; but it's not on this record.  My advice: You've already heard the best songs on the radio. Save your money for next time- there is great potential here.
0385336810|5.0|Sophie Kinsella has done it again. If you're a huge fan of the Shopaholic series like myself, then you are bound to enjoy this one. You might be able to guess the ending at the halfway point, but it's still a hillarious, laugh-out-loud story and the secret-keeper, Emma, is a lot more plausible than most chick lit female leads.<br />The best parts are the embarrassing office scenes with Jack Harper, because they make you cringe for poor Emma. The boring market-research obsessed boyfriend is also very plausible. This is one of the best chick lit books of the year. It definitely lives up to the previous books.
0066620996|3.0|Good to Great stands strong on its good research team.  The book details eleven successful companies and their competitors.  One main issue is that these successful companies thrived because of leaders who did not let adversity defeat them.  They perservered without letting egos get in the way.<br />Another point that Goods to Great makes lies in the steady periods of marketing their products.  The great companies did not rely on the latest fads.  Rather these companies relied on a business model that was modified due to changes in the conomy.<br />The book does repeat itself in several chapters.  To some degree its for emphasis and in other respects the wording just could be better. Smart yes, engaging not always.  This could lose some audiences.  However, the statistics and research give this summary on business conditions some strong merits.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|Sometimes it hard to listen to a soundtrack entirely. We skip tracks, or only listen to 3 ,4 and #9. The Last Samurai soundtrack is simply outstanding. We can spend hours and hours listening all the tracks once again. You cannot really avoid to buy this cd, firstly because Hans Zimmer is giving a spectacular performance as always, and because you cannot totally enjoy the beauty of this music in the action.<br />If you're a fan of japan, you probably liked this movie.If you're a real fan of japan, you probably noticed that music in the movie doesnt match the music around years 1870 in japan.To that, Zimmer said: &quot;Japanese music of the 1870s is completely inaccessible to most Western audiences,&quot; explains Zimmer. &quot;It would not work dramatically. In fact, it's the antithesis of drama.&quot; He decided to mix strings and bass with traditionnal japanese instruments and the result is great.<br />You don't always listen to the music when looking at samurais fighting(until you saw the movie hundred of times).This is very sad because that music is superb.<BR>For fans and people who just liked the movie. You cannot dislike this album.
B00005JMFQ|1.0|Maybe I missed something, but what exactly was this movie about?  None of the characters were ever on scene long enough for me to develop any empathy toward them, none of them were drawn with the slightest bit of realism or depth (except for maybe the washed-up singer), and none of the situations were the slightest bit believable.<br />The entire sequence with the &quot;prime minister&quot; meeting the &quot;president&quot; was utterly pointless and added nothing to the movie.  But then, that pretty much describes every other scene so I guess it fit right in.<br />Like &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral,&quot; this movie was pointless, meandering, unfocused drivel and a complete waste of film.  I'd give it zero stars if I could.

B00000JRTX|1.0|If it's possible for a movie to be any worse, I don't know how.  Oh, that's right... LOVE ACTUALLY!<br />This meandering, pointless hodgepodge of unsympathetic and amoral characters in unbelieveable settings is a complete waste of time and film.  And what was the ending about, anyway?  Hugh and Andie agree to &quot;not be married&quot; for the rest of their lives?  So, like, they're gonna just shack up for life?  We all know that works soooooo well... see Hugh's non-marriage to Liz Hurley for details.<br />One star, but only because I can't give it zero.
0553266306|5.0|This book is a classic. The story is a classic thriller and fast paced. Forsyth is well known to be a classic espionage writer and this book is a testament of that fact. The story is about OAS(A French terrorist outfit) looking to kill the French President. With 6 previously failed attempts at his life the OAS decide to hire a foreign national to do the job. The story revolves arond how this foreign national(code named:Jackal) plans, prepares to do the job and how the French authorities look to foil the plan. A master thriller, a gripping story, hard to put down and Forsyth is in his own league with this book. A great place to start for first time Forsyth readers.
0792839730|2.0|Great movie, everything that has been said about this movie is here so I won't add anything new. Bad dvd, pretty much a vanilla dvd with a small booklet about the operation and film production.<br />However, in Japan, I've seen a special edition 2-disc dvd for this movie in the shops. Has anyone seen it? I've been thinking of buying it but I would prefer an english edition if it comes out in the near future. Could anyone shed some light here...
0606001948|5.0|... in a silent, blinding flash of white light, one hundred thousand lives were blown off the face of the earth by the first atomic bomb ever used as a weapon of war.  &quot;Hiroshima&quot; is the story of what happened when the bomb went off on August 6, 1945 at 8:15 a.m.  Six ordinary citizens were going about their day: the Reverend Kiyoshi Tanimoto was about to unload a cart, Miss Toshiko Sasaki was beginning her work as a secretary; Dr. Masakazu Fujii was opening his newspaper, Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge was perusing a Jesuit magazine, Dr. Terufumi Sasaki (no relatio to Toshiko Sasaki) was walking down the hall toward the hospital laboratory; and Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura was looking out the window, when &quot;everything flashed whiter than anything she had ever seen&quot; and the world turned into hell.  From there we follow the course of these six people's lives, hour by hour, as the darkness descended while the mushroom cloud rose, and all around them was nothing but death and destruction.  One reads this slender book at a single sitting, unable to put it down, and emerges shell-shocked, with a single question going around and around in one's head: &quot;Why?&quot;<br />John Hersey's account of the explosion of the atomic bomb over Hiroshima stands as a classic of wartime reporting.  He doesn't editorialize or sensationalize; he lets the six people mentioned above tell their own stories; and through them, the horror of what was unleashed on August 6.  The apocalyptic destruction of lives and property was mind-blowing.  And after living through the nightmare of the blast, the survivors of the bombing had to cope with the long-term effects of radiation sickness.<br />The question of &quot;Why?&quot; still haunts us almost 60 years later.  Was the bombing necessary?  What better options did Truman have?  The answer may be, none.  A full-scale invasion of Japan, which would almost certainly have occurred if the bombing had not taken place, or if it had not been as devastatingly effective as it was, was estimated to cost a million American casualties, and probably many more Japanese casualties as well.  Was it a question of committing a horrendous act in order to avoid a worse one?  Probably.  We've learned from history that all too often, the choice is not between good and bad, but between bad, worse, and unspeakable.<br />The original version of &quot;Hiroshima&quot;, published the year after the war ended, left the profiles of six lives in suspension.  The updated edition includes Hersey's 1985 article on the lives of the six survivors forty years later.  We learn that, after suffering through so much in the immediate aftermath of the bombing, the &quot;hibakusha&quot; (the Japanese term for the Hiroshima survivors) had to put up with prejudice and discrimination from non-hibakusha who shunned them because they were subject to so many illnesses.  Even so, these six, along with thousands of others, managed to get on with what was left of their lives.  One finishes this book with a sense almost of awe at the resilience of these six very ordinary people who could be any six people in our own country.  And even as we get a sick feeling that somewhere out there, some madman would love to push the nuclear button and unleash a holocaust that would make Hiroshima look like a walk in the park, we feel a deep sense of resolve never to let anything like this happen again, anywhere, at any time.devastatingly effective as it was, was estimated to cost a million American casualties, and probably many more Japanese casualties as well.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|Wicked: A New Musical is the audio CD soundtrack of the popular Broadway musical &quot;Wicked&quot;, which centers on the lives of Glinda the Good, and Elphaba (the Wicked Witch of the West), before Dorothy's tornado arrived in the land of Oz. Emphasizing the turmoil of the two witches' adolescence and young adulthood, Wicked is a moving story and its inspirational music comes through loud and clear in a memorable impressive listening sensation. Tracks include No One Mourns The Wicked (6:40), Dear Old Shiz (1:26), The Wizard And I (5:09), What Is This Feeling? (3:31), Something Bad (1:39), Dancing Through Life (7:35), Popular (3:44), I'm Not That Girl (2:58), One Short Day (3:03), A Sentimental Man (1:16), Defying Gravity (5:53), Thank Goodness (6:23), Wonderful (4:57), I'm Not That Girl (reprise) (0:50), As Long As You're Mine (3:46), No Good Deed (3:31), March Of The Witch Hunters (1:31), For Good (5:06), and Finale (1:42).
067940581X|4.0|&quot;Emma&quot; has been called Jane Austen's most flawed heroine, but I'd rather reserve that title for Fanny Price of &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;, whose very &quot;perfection&quot; makes her one of the most obnoxious inventions of British literature.  How can one stand a hero or heroine who is never, ever wrong?  We'd rather have someone like Emma, who, for all her flaws, or maybe because of them, is a delightful creature.  She's a hopeless busybody, meddling and interfering in everyone's lives, too much the lady of the manor for her own good; but she means nothing but everyone else's good.  Unlike Austen's other heroines who are barely in the leisure class like Elizabeth Bennet or one step away from poverty like Fanny Price, Emma Woodhouse is comfortably well-off; she doesn't need a husband to support her because she'll inherit a fortune from her widowed father, so she's free to cheerfully attempt to marry everybody else off according to her own inclinations.  And her main project is her friend Harriet, the child of an unknown father (an enormous social stigma in early 19th-century England), whom she attempts to pair off with a snooty, social-climbing vicar, unable to see the damage she is doing to both.  Fresh from one blunder, Emma races headlong into another, and yet another, until you want to yank her chain and bring her up short.  And she almost undoes her own self when the man she realizes she has loved all along, her neighbor Mr. Knightley, begins to see potential in Harriet himself.<br />We know the mess is going to get sorted out sooner or later; Austen has a genius for untangling messes and getting everybody back on the right track, but it's fun to watch Emma racing from one hairbrained scheme to the next and getting caught in the traps of her own devising.  And we like her none the less for it.  Because Emma, wrongheaded as she often is, doesn't have a mean bone in her body.  She genuinely wishes everyone well, even though it's on her terms.  It takes an older, wiser and more experienced head like Knightley's to help her see the error of her ways.  Knightley is the perfect foil for Emma, with a wit and intelligence as sharp as her own, but providing maturity and stability to balance her free-floating exuberance.<br />&quot;Emma&quot; is not Austen's best work; just as Emma is a somewhat airheaded creature, &quot;Emma&quot; lacks the depth of Austen's later books such as &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; and &quot;Persuasion&quot;.  Emma, along with Elinor Dashwood and Elizabeth Bennet, is one of my three favorite Austen heroines, but Emma lacks the insight and maturity of the other two.  Too often acts without thinking, but it's just this quality that makes her so endearing at times, even while it makes her so aggravating.  Emma is probably Austen's most humanly fallible heroine, and maybe that's why we like her so much.  Perfection is for gods and saints; Emma is for real.an older, wiser and more experienced head like Knightley's to help her see the error of her ways.

B00001OH7U|5.0|I've read that Bowie was so messed up on coke when this album was recorded he doesn't even remember it.  Maybe his subconcious mind was writing these songs and recording them, if so, let's hear it for Bowie's subconscious mind!<br />I was thinking very carefully about WHY I love this album so much and consider it Bowie's best album, which is saying a lot because he's recorded some fantastic albums.  I hate to endorse drug use, but maybe the coke had  something to do with it.  Would Bowie have come up with this album without the influence of coke?  Would the Beatles have come up with &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; without the influence of acid?  I would say highly unlikely on both counts.<br />Whatever the coke did to Bowie's brain at this time, I definitely find Bowie's musical statements compelling.  Bowie's pre-&quot;Station to Station&quot; albums found him searching for the voice he achieved on &quot;Station to Station.&quot;  <br />All his albums have flashes of brilliance, but &quot;Station to Station&quot; finds that brilliance sustained throughout.  Bowie sings better.  That nasal &quot;Anthony Newley&quot; voice of yore is gone.  There is a depth and resonance to his voice on &quot;Station to Station.&quot;  His vocal control is amazing.  His finest recorded vocal of all time may be his track, &quot;Wild is the Wind.&quot;  Bowie writes better.  Gone are the wordy, precious, pretentious lyrics he could so annoyingly write on his earlier albums.  His words are sharp like razors.  He keeps the words clean and concise, but with an edge of danger.  <br />Like the Beatles did with &quot;Sgt. Pepper,&quot; Bowies hits just the right balance of pop music and experimental music.  His post-&quot;S.T.S&quot; albums with Eno would veer further into the experimental realm.  But none of the Eno projects hit this brilliant balance of pop/experimental music which is achieved on &quot;S.T.S.&quot;<br />The Thin White Duke is not Ziggy Stardust, Aladdin Sane, Diamond Dog, or the reincarnation of Lauren Bacall's 1940's youth.  The Thin White Duke is more of a ghost than a persona.  Where Bowie's pre-&quot;S.T.S&quot; albums were often clearly concept pieces centered around a clearly defined persona, &quot;S.T.S&quot; has no precise concept.  The six songs on the album stand alone with no problem.  There is no looming persona to tie them all together.  The Thin White Duke is only mentioned in the title cut, and the Thin White Duke is essentially a spectre hovering around this album who may, or may not, drift into focus sporadically.  The album works just as well if the Thin White Duke didn't exist at all.<br />Post-&quot;S.T.S&quot; albums in the seventies would find Bowie trying to make &quot;experimental&quot; albums while regaining his health, attempting to live a &quot;normal&quot; life in Berlin, becoming a good father to his son, and maintaining his dominant voice in modern rock while being assailed, or praised, by punk/new wave bands as both a &quot;dinosaur&quot; and a &quot;icon.&quot;<br />&quot;Station to Station&quot; sounds just as vital and progressive today, twenty-eight years after its release, as it did when it was released in 1976.  How many other albums released in that year can claim that credit.

B0000TLA9G|4.0|In spite of the protest raised by fans, G n R's Greatest Hits is a worthy album.  Why?  Despite not being a bona fide G n R fan myself - I marvel at the power the band brought to the rock scene, and this album reminds us of what might have been. For a while, G n R looked like the would-be successors to the great rock bands before them - Led Zep, Aerosmith, etc before they self-imploded.<br /><br />The songs here sound as good as ever - Slash's guitar work is  simply outstanding and soulful while Axl's musical ambitions and idiosyncracies imbue the songs with a unique sound...Put together, the collection of songs deliver a power that shows why musically G n R were in the big league...if only briefly.<br /><br />The only criticism one might level at this is the mainstream choice of songs - but these were the hits after all.  And some 8 of the tracks were covers - but great versions nonetheless (Knocking on Heavens Door and Live & Let Die).  It isn't going to be every G n R's 'ultimate' collection, but greatest hits albums seldom are everything to everyone.  This one though, is nice and shows why G n R were able to wipe the floor against other bands of the era.<br /><br />So - unless you're downloading MP3s or ripping your own greatest hits versions - this collection is recommended.

0385512104|5.0|There seems to be a great deal of books lately dealing with dogs or dog themes. &quot;Dogs of Babel&quot; comes to mind first.  It's a very unusual tale (almost as unusual as this book) and a good read.  Then I encountered &quot;The Bark of the Dogwood&quot; and, yes, it too has a dog theme.  Now I find &quot;The Curious Incident,&quot; which is probably the most unusual of all the books, dealing with not only the canine motif, but autism as well.  While all three books dealing with man's best friend in some way or other are excellent, &quot;Incident&quot; is by far the best and most original.  The other two are worth taking a look at, but whatever you do, read this one first. I'm not usually one for the Today Show Picks, but this one took the prize.

B0001AP12G|5.0|There's something awe-inspiring about this album. From the moment you slide this puppy in you can literally feel Kanye's dedication to hip hop oozing out of your speakers. From start to finish this album is perfectly executed. His production strays a little from the sounds he churns out for the Roc and such, as he trades in the clear soul sampling for more obscured, choppy soul loops. While I'm a fan of his work for Jigga I love what he did with Dropout. Anyone who bites his flow isn't really looking deep enough - at some points dude sounds like a mellowed out Pretty Tony, which is dope because he's not as aggressive (which is more universally appealing) and yet the storytelling abilities still satisfy the more intent listeners. The humor, the honesty and the wittiness make up for Kanye's not-so-stellar flows. He's no Nas or Jay-z, but it's not fair to compare because he's got his own thing going on.<br />If you're a Neptunes head (like me) you might be a little apprehensive at first because you know Kanye's taking over the game that was once owned by Pharell and Chad. Trust me though, Kanye's sound is fresh and because it's completely different from the Neptunes' sound there's room for both of them in your CD catalog. Buy this now and check out the man who put the gift in the Blueprint.
B000000OUE|5.0|This CD is White Zombie's 2nd major label release, this one has White Zombie's most famous song, More Human Than Human. It's overall a 10/10.<br />1. Electric Head Pt.1 - this one is a hard rock song, good way to start off an album, very good music, vocals arent very impressive though.<br />2. Super-Charger Heaven - ahhh yes &quot;Devilman&quot;, VERY good music and vocals; kind of showing their evolution in music style<br />3. Real Solution #9 - Low-fi vocals, great chorus altough all it says is yeah<br />4. Creature of the Wheel - this song is by far the worst on the album, no good chorus or music, just too plain, nothing special<br />5. Electric Head Pt. 2 - VERY good music and vocals, similar to Super-Charger Heaven, more of a funk vibe that Pt.1 much better <br />6. Grease Paint &amp; Monkey Brains - very good vocals, sounds like (go to) California and Spookshow Baby on Rob's solo work. love this one<br />7. I, Zombie - some of the best drums I've heard in a long time! very good song, few vocals, chorus is Astro: 2000, so...very good track<br />8. More Human Than Human - very good, hit single, cool video<br />9. El Phantasmo and the Chicken Run Blast-O-Rama - my favorite song on the album, Rob is carrying a tune with his voice that is uniquely awesome!<br />10. Blur The Techicolor - great song, not much of chorus though<br />11. Blood Milk and Sky - I LOVE THIS SONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

0440241413|5.0|Sophie Kinsella has it down to a science. I'm a shopoholic myself and I found myself agreeing with Becky's reasons for buying all the things she does. It tells a great story of a young twenty-something living in a big city and wanting it all. I flew through this book - it was easy to read, lighthearted and entertaining. If you love to shop , you'll get a kick out of this book! Another book that I enjoyed was \\"Good Grief\\", and \\"He Never Called Again.\\"
B0000DD7LB|3.0|Being that I am an avid fan of more adult-alternative music (i.e, Natalie Merchant, Tracy Chapman, etc., etc.) Britney's latest album, well, I think it's her best one yet.  Okay, so she didn't write most of the songs, but the whole feeling of this album that I have interpreted is definitely a more mature step for her.  <br />I recently got to see Britney perform in Toronto this past April.  She put on a wonderful show, sure, it's teeny bop music, but I seriously think that &quot;In the Zone&quot; will attract more older listeners (21-30), as some of the music in this album has more serious undertones with the melodies and lyrics.<br />So, with a bit of hesitation, I would buy this album only if you want to.  Don't buy it just for Toxic, because there are a few other good songs on this album.<br />3.25 stars
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Does the nouveau style of filming in the dark bug you as much as it does me?  If so, this picture will drive you to drink!  Personally, I like to SEE the movie I'm watching.  90% of Lost in Translation is lost in the dark - you simply can't see it, which is something of a waste of time in my book.  And the supposed &quot;hilarity&quot; of it was also lost.  I did not laugh out loud once.  I stuck with it, and watched it all the way through, waiting, waiting for the funny scenes.  There was a bit of making fun of Japanese people's pronunciation of English words with &quot;r&quot;'s in them, but that's a rather old joke.  Ms. Coppola must have paid off a LOT of people to get the reviews and nominations that she did, because I just wasted about $20 on the DVD.  Clearly, the joke was completely lost on me, which my boyfriend and I think may have been the point of the movie.  The whole thing is truly lost in translation.
B00004T9UF|5.0|I just av to say tht this album is probably one of the best albums i av ever heard. Definately Eminem's best ever album and i don't think he will ever do one as good. Ever song is brilliant. But my favourites av to be, kill you, who knew, the way i am, i'm back, drug ballad, Bitch Please II, Criminal. This album is simply amazing, the best ever
B00005JMKI|5.0|The critics will tell you this film is cynical, misanthropic, etc.  Although this is pretty much correct, they also fail to note that Dogville is also a lot of fun.  Nicole Kidman proves once again she can actually act as the beautiful, distant, and utterly absurd \\"Grace\\".  And Paul Bettany is nothing less than fantastic as the befuddled and clueless \\"Tom\\".  Jim Hurt's narration, a Brechtian parody of \\"Our Town\\", is comic genius.  It sets the tone and lends structure to the film.  Dogville is indeed best understood in the Brechtian tradition of humorous theater.  It is an absurd narrative that teases the viewer's expectations (molded by Hollywood formulas), pokes fun at traditional bourgeois narrative strategies (with Tom as a terrific centerpiece), and finally shocks us by turning the narrative on its head, with Hurt hilariously relating the absurd events to nature and the crisp mountain air all the way through.  And the finish-the finish is inspired, cynical, absurd-genius.<br />The issues Von Trier deals with are certainly deep, but the larger goal is that the viewer should become more suspicious of the hackneyed nature of conventional cinematic themes of selflessness and small town community.

6305428557|5.0|A great test of whether you have subtle taste and a real humorous mind: after the first 10 minutes into the movie - once you adjust your ear to the music-like accent and figure out what's going on - you will smile all the way to the end. A fantastic comedy for suited mind.<br />Warning of the DVD: I bought, exchanged, and finally returned 3 copies of this DVD from various vendors, all of them are defects! If you look at the back side of the DVD, you will see some checker-like patterns on the surface - not as smooth and reflective as usual disk. My player will play partial frames and then stops. I wonder if this particular title is manufactured wrong or bad luck follows me for 3 times. I kept my VHS as a result.<br />If anyone find or own a good DVD on this title, please let me know from which vendor you bought it - there got to be some good stock on this title. The good movie deserves a better DVD transfer.
B000092Q4U|4.0|The riffs on this cd are awesome. Very heavy and catchy. The vocals could have been better though, but it fits with the music. This is a good cd but the last couple of songs get a little too repetetive.
B000002KB8|5.0|when i first heard the black sabbath album sabbath bloddy sabbath i thought they werent that great so i guess i underestimated them in each album and so on,but then after i decided to buy their debut cause it did start heavy metal so i decided to give it a shot.once i bought this i was about to here the title track entitled black sabbath and that song rules big time!!!it starts with rain and church bells and then comes scary defining guitar work and ozzys greatest vocal performance and the lyrics scare the hell out of you i think thats the best song on the album.the wizard unfortunatly i think is terrible cause its guitats drums and bass with ozzy playing harmonica and they prove they made a terrible combination with that crap..but i dont think its THAT bad.next come a LOOOOOONG 4 songs in 10 min...N.I.B. is sooo good and that song is so full of good riffs i droped my jaw in amazment of tony iommis blistering guitar riffs.wicked world and all the rest of the songs are good too.so if you wanna know about how heavy metal began,pick this up and youll know everything about what black sabbath and heavy metal are all about!!!.
0780020685|5.0|This is my first Akira Kurosawa movie, and I thought it was wonderful.  It is almost 3 and a half hours long, black and white, and the subtitles go by qickly sometimes and can be hard to see on top of a white background, but none of that matters.  The black and white adds to the feel of the movie, and it is the perfect length.<BR>The movie starts abruptly, with a village of farmers who need the help of samurai to defeat a group of bandits who keep raiding their village.  All of the samurai, some more than others, have distinct personalities.  My favorite was Kikuchiyo, the loud, enerjetic samurai with a troubled past.  As the movie progresses, and the battle draws nearer, many things are learned about the characters.<BR>This movie deserves to be called a classic.  A must see.
B00006SFLV|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the best series ever the air on network television, but as is the case with some gems, &iexcl;§My So-Called Life&iexcl;¨ never stood a chance at longevity in a TV universe that seems to demand over the top stereotypes, bad stereotypes, or the latest scandal on one of the 100 magazine shows the networks know will attract viewers. Bitter? Maybe º, but I simply loved this show and seeing all 19 episodes almost 1 decade after they aired remind me that it was as good if not better than I had remembered it to be.<br />The show focuses on &iexcl;§Angela,&iexcl;¨ brilliantly played by Claire Danes in a performance that earned her a Golden Globe and an Emmy nomination. Danes is so good that you can&iexcl;¦t imagine anyone else playing this character, much like is the case with Dana Delaney in &iexcl;§China Beach&iexcl;¨ or the entire cast of &iexcl;§Once And Again,&iexcl;¨ other brilliant ratings underachievers that it least were allowed to air for much longer than the too brief season that MSCL got. As much as it was Danes&iexcl;¦ star vehicle, the entire cast was brilliant and as the season progressed the show became a true ensemble piece in every sense of the word. Angela&iexcl;¦s parents are played not as annoying caricatures but as real people who look married and like the parents of Angela and her sister. Angela&iexcl;¦s friends and neighbors don&iexcl;¦t act nor look like the kids of 90210, and really look like young adults struggling to find a place in the world. Even the parents are shown are trying to find their place in the world.<br />Although my favorite episodes center around the Angela and Jordan Catalano, there are certain episodes like &iexcl;§The Zit&iexcl;¨ (horrible name) that never miss a beat. Although the writers do not hit you over the head with a stick with the big issues it tackles, the above-mentioned episode focuses on how society views women and how few people have it as bad as they think or that others have it as good as we may think they have it. The most poignant moments don&iexcl;¦t come from yelling, but from quiet truths or what may seem at first like throwaway lines, many times uttered by Angela&iexcl;¦s younger sister, who is also perfectly cast.<br />If you liked shows like &iexcl;§thirtysomething,&iexcl;¨ &iexcl;§China Beach,&iexcl;¨ &iexcl;§Once And Again,&iexcl;¨ &iexcl;§The Wonder Years&iexcl;¨ (the early years), this DVD set is just what the doctor ordered. Unfortunately, the show&iexcl;¦s producers only got to make 19 episodes and the series just ends as if it were just another episode. Maybe the producers thought they&iexcl;¦d get a chance at a second season or simply decided to conduct business as usual, but either way neither should serve as a deterrent to enjoying one of the very best series period. Although the DVD set does not include many extras and its not cheap by any stretch of the imagination, I give it my highest 5 star recommendation. If you can&iexcl;¦t afford this maybe you can rent them or catch them on cable as they are being rerun on some channel called the &iexcl;§N.&iexcl;¨ the major annoyance in watching them on this cable channel is that they put up the most obnoxious and prevalent reminders on the screen so it&iexcl;¦s difficult to totally block them from the story that you are watching.ts don¡¦t come from yelling, but from quiet truths or what may seem at first like throwaway lines, many times uttered by Angela¡¦s younger sister, who is also perfectly cast.<br />If you liked shows like ¡§thirtysomething,¡¨ ¡§China Beach,¡¨ ¡§Once And Again,¡¨ ¡§The Wonder Years¡¨ (the early years), this DVD set is just what the doctor ordered.

B0001CCXZW|5.0|Gilmore Girls is definitely the top show on television. I cannot get over how witty the writing is and how well-developed each character becomes with each episode. Set in the small town of Star's Hollow, Gilmore Girls continues to entertain me with each episode that I watch. The quirky characters and beautiful Connecticut scenery are part of what makes this show so appealing. Every character on the show brings a smile to my face- from Lorelai's witty comments, to Rory's sensibility, to Sookie's bubbliness, to Laine's need to escape her mother's authority, and to Richard and Emily's disapproval of everything. Not only that, but the episodes never get boring so you can watch them over and over again! This DVD set is no exception to the high quality of the show; the picture and sound quality are crystal clear and the extra features were very well put together. Though it would be nice to see some bloopers, the special features are a nice treat to watch after seeing the heart-warming, feel-good episodes. I highly recommend this DVD set to anyone who wants the best of the best! Keep the DVD sets coming, looking forward to season 2. <BR>Also, if you live in Canada and your set did not include a booklet , as mine did not, visit [...] to find out how you can be sent a free booklet to complete your set. Hope this helps everyone!
B0000B1OFL|4.0|I've seen the &quot;The Italian Job&quot; remake a million times by now. Some people in other reviews have said that this was nothing like the original, but if you would have done some research then you would know that F. Gary Gray didn't intend on making it the same. It was supposed to be a movie in itself...and it is. I watch this movie constantly. It's just a good movie to watch if you're bored or there's nothing on TV. I do like this movie, so I watch it if I want to sometimes, not just because of the previously mentioned reasons to watch it. It's a good time and after you've seen it once you don't have to pay attention to every scene and you can still know what's going on. <BR>    One part I absolutely love in this movie is when Left Ear sees Skinny Pete for the first time. It's too funny. But there's something that I can't quite get over. I can't tell whether or not the red mini that Stella drives is her car or if it's one of the coopers that Charlie got for them to drive. Every time I watch this movie I try to look at Stella's liscense plate to see what state it's for. Also, there's a hole in the plot in the part where everyone meets up to meet Stella. I can never tell where they met...in LA or in Philadelphia (where Stella lives). Also they never say where the other guys are from, so you can't tell at all what the details are. I also wonder why they go to New Orleans at the end. Did anyone else notice that?<BR>    Overall though, I give this movie a good rating. I like it and it's just fun to watch occasionally...if you don't care that much about the details (the only reason I noticed all those holes and questions is because I've seen the movie so many times). Give this movie a try. You never know until you try!
0062502182|3.0|The Alchemist is what I would call an in between book. It has strong new Age undertones with its fantasy aspects mixed with a self-oriented view of the world rather than a truly spiritual approach. In addition, it is a book with some worth. It has a basic message which attempts to divert the modern human being from the overtly mechanistic and reductionistic trend he/she is currently confined within and push them out into the lived world. The world of passion, art and the spirit. This is a current need. However, it does this in a way which does not actually practice what it preaches. This is not a truly spiritual book and should not be seen as such. It is a book in the vein of &quot;The Celestine Prophecy&quot; which, being a kind of offspring of &quot;The Alchemist&quot;, tries the same thing again with little success. One way to express this is in the following way: The Alchemist takes a drop of water from a massive ocean and calls the drop the ocean rather allowing the drop to lead to the ocean in a very subtle indirect path. Only in such an ineffable approach with the merest hint in the right direction can the truth of existence be experienced.<br />Nonetheless &quot;The Alchemist&quot; is an entertaining book as fiction and can be enjoyed wholeheartedly as fiction. Read it and enjoy yourself. For God's sake don't take it seriously.
B000021Y77|4.0|Run Lola Run is an interesting film about a girl and her boyfriend and their struggles to survive the most grueling twenty minutes of their lives.  Manni, the boyfriend, somehow forgot 100,000 marks on a subway train and is in a lot of trouble unless Lola shows up with 100,000 marks to pay off the men Manni was supposed to meet.  The movie plot is based around the chaos effect, which is the idea that every action one makes effects the lives of everyone else.  The twenty minutes is shown in 3 different ways because each time it is restarted, Lola takes different paths in order to get Manni the money that he needs to stay alive.<BR> In a way, Lola is a panopticon during her struggle to find Manni's money.  Manni is always watching over Lola, making sure that she gets to him on time.  Lola knows this and will take any measure possible in order to get the 100,000 marks to Manni on time.  Whether she has to lie, cheat, or steal, she will get the money.  She acts under pressure and runs everywhere she goes just to keep Manni safe.  Manni is depending on Lola to be the hero of the day and show up with what he needs.<BR> Lola plays the role of the strong independent woman during the movie.  Manni is helplessly waiting for Lola to show up with the money.  Lola shows her strengths by not being afraid to do anything in order to save the day.  She'll rob her father's bank, she'll help rob a grocery store, and she'll take big risks in a casino just to save Manni.  The story is played out three times in three different ways because of the chaos factor.  Sadly, the movie ends with Manni saving himself because he finds the money himself.  Lola is once again the stereotypical dependent woman.  She struggles so much to get Manni the money he needs, but it turns out that he never needed her help at all.  She accepts this fact and walks off with him as if nothing happened to her during the 20 minute struggle.
1594200106|5.0|Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n has created a near-perfect novel: seductive and intriguing characters, a brilliant Spanish locale, and a lyrical style reminiscent of past literary masters.  I found myself reading passages countless times just to savor the words.  The language was so solid and mesmerizing, I could not believe it was a translation. The story lingers in your mind hours and days after reading it, and I become nostalgic; wishing I could read it again for the first time.<br />When Daniel Sempere first enters the labrythine &quot;Cemetary of Forgotten Books&quot;, he does not know that this single episode will change his life forever.  Daniel discovers a novel entitled &quot;Shadow of the Wind&quot; and makes it his mission to find other books by its enigmatic author, Julian Carax.  When he learns that Carax's novels have been systematically destroyed by an elusive stranger, Daniel must protect his volume from the flames.  The more Daniel learns about Carax, the more he realizes the similarities and parallels between his own life and that of the author.<br />Allot a good amount of time for this book, you will not be able to put it down.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|&quot;In the Zone&quot; is probably the best pop album I've ever listened to.  Sure, it's not straight pop as it combines elements of hip-hop, techno, dance, etc.  However, the album is clearly pop at its core and it includes some of the best pop songs of recent times.  The standout tracks are: Toxic, Breathe on Me, Touch of my Hand, and Everytime.  Each of these songs are very diverse and unique and great for repeated listening.  Other great tracks include the hip-hoppish Boom Boom and Outrageous, which have killer beats.  The production overall is fantastic and the vocals perfectly suit the mood of the songs.  If you take my advice and give this album a chance, I can pretty much guarantee you won't regret it.
B0001GL3K4|3.0|_Love Actually_ is being touted as &quot;THE ULTIMATE ROMANTIC COMEDY&quot;, and while some of the relationships were sweet and romantic, I became frustrated with the sheer amount of storylines in the film.  The overall film suffered because it had to rotate between the relationships--each couple got their requisite five miunte screen time (with some overlap) and then SWITCH!  The really interesting stories were cut off to show another scene that was silly and unnecessary.  (The biggest example of this is leaving Laura Linney's character &quot;out to dry&quot;--what happened to her?)<br />The reason why everyone is seeing this movie is because of the stellar cast, and while they all performed very nicely, all of their characters were severely underdeveloped, and it was hard to have any connection with the characters when you knew so little about them.  The film would have been much more enjoyable had they focused on three or four relationships (namely Rickman-Thompson, Liam Neeson, and Hugh Grant's characters) and developed them more fully.
B0000AQVCL|3.0|What a hoopla this band has caused to all the self appointed music critics out there- I really don't get why. Their influences are obvious- as they are with MANY a band that comes out every single year. Some of the most beloved modern artists out there ripped more than a couple songs in their day, but with much less backlash. So, in other words, by pointing out this particular band in this light, you're proving you don't pay much attention to music nowadays. And the funniest part is you're only helping them gain attention/sales by crying about it.<br />The album consists of a handful of faster paced songs, and quite a few slower- unfortunately, all of the slower songs leave a lot to be desired. 'Look What You've Done' is the best of the slower lot and sounds like an Oasis B side. The rockers, like most everyone says, are mostly great- and absolutely terrific in the case of Are You Gonna Be My Girl and Cold Hard B!tch. The other faster songs are not bad, but essentially average for a major label band.<br />Jet prove they are capable of crafting great songs, but lacking in making a solid album. But hey, it's their first major- can't expect a 5 star record out of the gate. Interested to see which way their career will go from here- few bands go up from the position Jet are in right now.
B0001JXQEM|5.0|I won this CD from a radio contest.  I already owned Weezer's Blue Album, and I though re-releasing it as &quot;remastered&quot; was just a scheme to make more money.  I was planning on selling my second copy on ebay.  When I went to the radio station to pick up my cd prize, I was plesantly suprized that instead of being the same albulm &quot;remastered&quot;, the cd had 2 disks instead of one.  Disk one is the original albulm, which was all that I thought I had won.  Disk two had a bunch of unreleased songs, live songs, and acoustic songs.  The original disk 1 is good, but the new disk 2 is so much better.  You get to hear live versions of songs like Surf Wax America which is great for people like me who have never been to a Weezer concert, plus lots of other great songs.<br />Needless to say, I liked this CD.  Thanks to the second disk, I kept the cd, and listen to it all of the time.  I just hope Weezer releases a brand new album soon...

1558216847|5.0|If you enjoyed Lansing's Endurance then this is almost a sure bet for you. But you should know before you buy, that this story may not be true. When the walkers see the Yetis in the Himalayan mountains, I was disapointed, up until then everything seemed so realistic. If you don't care if it is fact or fiction and just want read great survival story go ahead and buy it.
B0000C9JFO|3.0|[Audrey Tautou fans, read this first.]  If you are a fan of the star of &quot;Amelie&quot; like me, and want to see this film because of her, please remember this.  Ms. Tautou was cast in this film before the international hit of &quot;Amelie,&quot; so her role here is a comparatively small one.  And her character as the girl-friend of the protagonist does NOT live in the apartment, and that means she stayys onut of the screen for a long time.  <br />Roman Duris stars in this lightweight comedy-drama as Zavier, 25 year-old French student, who decides to study abroad (in Spain) simply because he wants secure a good job.  In the title apartment in Barcelona, however, he learns something much more important during the eventful one year in absolute freedom.<br />That is a rough sketch of the story, and this apartment plays the role of so-called &quot;melting pot&quot; of European people.  (Incidentally, its UK title is &quot;Potluck.&quot;)  In this not-so-clean but still magical place, you see students from France, UK, Germany. Denmark, Italy, and Belgium.  These colorful nationalities of EU represent the unbrindled energy of the youth, and if you have spent young days as they do, in a foreign land with friends, you wil easily relate to the agnst of Zavier, the portrait of average young boy.<br />Director Cedric Klapisch repeats his light touch found in &quot;When the Cat's Away,&quot; and the script was written in 12 day.  The film itself was shot in only 4 months ... well, so he says.  The film, as a consequence, shows little surprise -- there is a love-triangle which is too predictable, just another case of uninterested husband and unhappy wife, which is tradtional since the days of Madame Bovery.  And the silly hubby is a doctor again.  The characters lack the depth -- only the students from Britain show some -- and the commentary on the cultural difference doesn't bite.<br />But the film (shot in digital camera) captures the truth of youth, and the care-free community depicted here has an undeniable charm that would be most appealing to the young people, with its frank descriptions of being really young.  I admit that I feel envious of the people and the place, even though I know (and the film knows) that it will not last forever.
0446613444|3.0|The second harry Bosch novel, THE BLACK ICE, disappoints. Primarily because the character of Harry Bosch steps into the background. By that I mean the reader learns little new about loner, rebel cop Harry Bosch. That plus there is little action or conflict and thus little narrative tension. And the setting for the novel which is mainly in border Mexico is painted dull and drab and gray. Yawn. And I am a Harry Bosch fan. I plan on continuing in the Bosch series because I like the character and have hopes the author will do better. THE BLACK ICE does have a good bull fight scene and the mystery was logically, plausibly plotted. And one still gets the feeling we have a real working cop here in Harry Bosch. Not some fake fictional cop but the real thing. It is definitely noir but dull. Do better Connelly.

0553288105|4.0|As you can read from the jacket of The Gods Themselves, something bad is going to happen to Earth and only three &quot;people&quot; know about it--an Earth scientist, an alien, and someone from the Moon.  What is really unique about this book is that it is basically three different stories that are tied together with only the common thread that the main character of each story knows of this imminent disaster that will befall Earth.<br />For the most part, I don't like to read short story sci-fi.  I just don't like the idea that the story can't get very developed and you can't REALLY get to know the characters.  So, when I first started to realize how Gods is organized, I didn't think that it would end up being that great.  However, I am glad to say that I was pleasantly surprised; all three stories are really quite good.  Also, they all have many similar ideas (other than the disaster thing) that almost make them seem like one story told from three different perspectives (in a sort of socio-political way).<br />The first story has great characters and is sort of a setup for the rest of the book.  The second story has some really interesting aliens--not just your run-of-the-mill, humanoid, Star Trek-type aliens.  Actually, I would say that the aliens in this book are in the top three as far as uniqueness.  The final story wraps everything up.  It also has a few more good characters and some interesting ideas about life on the moon.<br />I gave The Gods Themselves four stars because the book is good, but not really anything to write home about.  If you're in the mood for a short book, that's easy to read, and has some interesting ideas, or if you just want to read about cool aliens, then I would recommend it.
B0000VD04M|5.0|First of all, I will tell you that I was raised in Hollywood in the 1950s and our upstairs neighbor really was the \\"Great Criswell\\" depicted in this film.. so I should be more critical than anyone concerning this movie's authenticity, and it is a perfect depiction in my view. This masterpiece by film maker Tim Burton is not only a sensitive, funny and wonderous portrait of Ed Wood, Jr. and his pals, but also a loving tribute to the spirit of the last \\"Great Days of Old Hollywood\\". The performances by Johnny Depp and the supporting cast is perfection. Visually, this appropriately black and white film takes on the look of those low budget films Ed and many others were making at the time. Even the opening credits AND Howard Shore's INCREDIBLE music score feels accurate to the time and is a joy to hear.<br />I was very honored when staying at the LeParc Hotel in West Hollywood in early March of this year and happened to be in the lobby when I spotted Martin Landau.  I seized the opportunity to walk over and tell Mr. Landau how \\"fabulous\\" he was in his role as the late Bela Lugosi..... he smiled and kindly said \\"Thank you so very much!!\\"... and his performance IS INCREDIBLE... enough that he won the Oscar for his performance in this film. Landau's characterization of Lugosi alone will be worth the price of the DVD when Disney decides to release it (soon I hope!!).<br />This wonderful film HAS BEEN on my personal \\"TOP 10 Greatest Movies of All Time\\" list since I first saw it 10 years ago. A modern masterpiece!!
B00005RFAI|5.0|I'm 42 years old and have been listening to music of all varieties for longer than many of the other reviewers have been alive.  I love this album.  It's fresh, energized and soulful.  Pink has a sense of self and awareness that doesn't usually come until much later in life.  She's an extraordinary young artist; I congratulate her on her initial success and look forward to much more from her in the years to come.  P.S. My kids love this album too!
B000060P79|2.0|This is pure pop, unlike Blink-182 or Good Charlotte (who are pop-rock). I mean just look at Simple Plan; their everywhere a pop band would be- in Snickers contests, playing concerts in Disneyworld, lending songs to Disney soundtracks and little kids movies, appearing in a Mary Kate &amp; Ashley movie, I mean come on. The songs are poorly written and their always about either A. not wanting to grow up or B. girls. Guitar? Fugghataboutit! Theres only one solo/break on this album and its in Addicted. The drums are okay, but the bass is pretty bad I can barely hear it. Yeah they are fun to listen to, and there are definetly much worse bands out there, but they just seem to generic and they seem like their riding off the success of other bands.
B00005JLR8|5.0|The story begins before the movie does. We come in as parents Paddy Considine and Samantha Morton attempt the slip into America with daughters Ariel and Christy, and escape the ghosts of their past. Samantha Morton runs the show with her third Oscar Caliber Performance (Minority Report and Morvern Callar were the others), but the supporting cast is not to be over looked. <BR>Djimon Hounsou is brilliant as Mateo, and overlooked artist, slowly fading away in his dumpy apartment until Ariel and Christy come trick-or-treating. Christy is the unsung star of the movie, narrating the entire film with a divine understanding about everything that her family is going through. <BR>In America is one of the most authentically emotional films I've ever seen. It's truly brilliant.
B00005JKO9|5.0|Warren Beatty's magnificent film, winner of many awards in many areas, deserves a DVD. Beatty, Keaton, Nicholson, Stapleton, etc., have never been better. Oscar winning cinematography deserves a good widescreen. Anyone else out there who thinks a DVD is long overdue? UPDATE: The DVD is fine, lots of extras. This sweeping epic grabs me upon each viewing. Diane Keaton has never been better, and Beatty's vision is timeless; as powerful as when I first saw it in '81. My only complaint: I'm sure this was in a big widescreen, but the DVD is only 1.85:1 and Storraro's Oscar winning photography might have shown more. A wonderful film achievement. David Lean's Doctor Zhivago also tells of the Russian Revolution, and it's interesting to see the different styles and perspectives, though REDS is based on fact.
B0001HAISG|5.0|I do not think that most kids can appreciate how great of a movie P.J. Hogan has made with this new version of &quot;Peter Pan.&quot;  However you really have to be familiar with not only all of the various versions of the story from Disney to Steven Spielberg but also J. M. Barrie's original plays and books to really appreciate everything that is in this movie.  Hogan's purpose was to go back to that original material, but it is impossible not to touch upon everything that has come since then.  My generation cannot hear the words &quot;I do believe in fairies&quot; without thinking of Mary Martin beckoning out from our television sets beseeching us to clap (or when Smee turns and gives an aside to the viewer).<br />On the one hand there are the fantastic elements as Peter Pan (Jeremy Sumpter) and the Darling children Wendy (Rachel Hurd-Wood), John (Harry Newell), and Michael (Freddie Popplewell) fly off to Never-Land.  But this is a more realistic Never-Land than every before for all the wonderful computer generated images.  More importantly, these are more realistic children than ever before.  Peter Pan is the boy who will never grow up, but he is also on the cusp of puberty, as is Wendy.  Into the Darling household comes Aunt Millicent (Lynn Redgrave), who insists that Wendy is not a girl anymore and while her father should start looking for marital prospects at the bank where he works, the more immediate goal is to move her out of the bedroom she shares with her brothers.  When Peter Pan appears on the windowsill and requires his shadow to be sewn back onto this feet, Wendy not only does the sewing but accepts his offer to come to Never-Land because she too desperately wants to avoid growing up.<br />In this &quot;Peter Pan&quot; a kiss is more than just a thimble.  This is not to suggest that there is a sexual element to these children or this film that parents need to worry about, but there is the potential for sexuality in Peter and Wendy.  It is around the corner and that is important because there is a price to pay for never growing up, and never before has the tragic flip side of Peter Pan's joyful and magical existence been so obvious in telling this tale.  Adults will recognize that period of their life it all it's metaphoric splendor in this film.<br />We also have the most realistic Captain Hook (Jason Issacs) of our acquaintance as well.  Hogan continues the long-standing tradition of having the actor who plays Hook do double duty as Mr. Darling as well, but in this richer vision of the story they are as opposite as night and day.  When this Hook crosses swords with Peter we know that they it might look like great fun, but these two are deadly serious about the final, fatal outcome.  More importantly, when this Hook blusters and bellows he manages to do it without falling into parody.  This is Hook as Barrie intended him to be, larger than life, but still a real figure.<br />Ultimately the power running throughout this story is the power of the story.  The Lost Boys are despearate for a mother and to them Wendy can fulfill the role because she has what they consider to be the single requirement: she can tell stories.  But there is another, more important requirement for a mother, and this film remembers that as well in the end when the Darling children return to their mother (Olivia Williams).  I especially liked the way the film plays the beginning of the reunion of the scene, a nice underscoring of the idea that you can wish for something so hard that you do not notice when you have it.<br />This is a stunning visual film, but it is also a film of substance that mines Barrie's idea of the boy who would not grow up for everything it is worth.  This &quot;Peter Pan&quot; has a depth greater than every all the other versions we have seen on the silver screen to date.  This is a glorious film and even if few will really appreciate it the way it truly deserves, there is still the fact that just coming into contactwith it will open the minds of its viewers to the greater realm of meaning and significance.  Besides, there is always the possibility that somewhere down the road as they enjoy this beautiful film again and again, that eventually they will appreciate what it is all about.t with it will open the minds of its viewers to the greater realm of meaning and significance.  Besides, there is always the possibility that somewhere down the road as they enjoy this beautiful film again and again, that eventually they will appreciate what it is all about.
B00008H2LB|4.0|I don't have this cd, but my friend let me listen to it once, and it wus just awesome.  Plus, i hear like a ton of there songs from this cd like on the radio and stuff.  This cd is really good, i want to get it!  It's probably not as good as hybrid theory tho.
B0001HAHXW|1.0|How dare Eric Clapton!  What is up with Clapton appearing on the same cd cover with Robert Johnson? it is completelly absurd. What is the point? A rich Englishman with absolutely no life experience beyond garden parties, drinking tea and eating crumpets, pretending to have some kind of connection to Robert Johnson..........I say again.........Absurd!  What is the point?  Eric Clapton has got to be the most over rated musician of all time.    p.s. Why is Eric Clapton so big on the cover and Robert Johnson so Small?
B00006879E|2.0|I loved Harder To Breathe, but the rest of the album is pure garbage &amp; filler. I understand that the lead singer might have had some relationship problems, but does he have to write about it in EVERY DAMN SONG? Theres too much pop and not enough rock also, theres more synthesizers and FX then there is guitars, bass and drums. It doesn't help that This Love is on the radio 24/7 nonstop either...
B0001GOH6Q|1.0|Big Fish was probably a book never ment to be made into a movie.  But when has that stopped anyone before?  Just look at &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; or the even worse &quot;Cat in the Hat&quot;.  There's no way to SHOW these events other that using uncontrollably ridiculous special effects.  Is it just me or is there something entirely souless and dead about trying to get emotional performances from stuff that doesn't actually exist?<br />As a few people have already noted, most of the characters (with the exepton of Jessica Lang's character) are compellingly unlikable, and their endless rationalizing, defending of a repeatitive and irritating old man, or just being an irritating old man can really drive one up the wall.   <br />I know very well that saying this will almost certainly cause all around hatered of me, but i really believe Tim Burton isn't all that talented.  I mean really, he made Beetlejuice, Nightmare Before Christmas, and Sleepy Hollow, none of which are really GOOD movies, just unusual ones.  Not well made at all, but appealing to a specific cult audience (mostly gothy kids) that will defend him to the death.<br />I Really didn't care for this movie.  Think &quot;Life as a House&quot; with a lot of fluff.  And here i thought that movie was fluff enough...
0385512104|4.0|I will say, to start with, that the story idea was amazing.  I have never been led inside the mind of a person with autism and this book pulls you deep inside.  The way that the main character works out the everyday interactions and reactions of himself and those around him is masterfully done.  My problem really developed towards the end, when I became tired of Christopher and his introspections.  So on one hand I really enjoyed the book, but, on the other it wore me out.
3551744084|5.0|Comic books superheroes are basically fascist vigilantes, with Superman and his dedication to truth, justice and the American way being the exception that proves the rule. Both &quot;Watchmen&quot; and &quot;The Dark Knight Returns,&quot; the two consensus best examples of graphic storytelling of our time, deal explicitly with the underlying fear the ordinary citizenry have of the demi-gods they worship. The one inherent advantage that &quot;Watchman&quot; has over Frank Miller's classic tale is that it requires no knowledge of the existing mythos of its characters because Dr. Manhattan, Ozymandias, Rorschach, Nite Owl, Silk Spectre, the Comedian and the rest of the former members of the Crimebusters.<br />The brainchild of writer Alan Moore (&quot;Swamp Thing,&quot; &quot;V for Vendetta,&quot; &quot;From Hell&quot;) and artist Dave Gibbons (&quot;Rogue Trooper,&quot; &quot;Doctor Who,&quot; &quot;Green Lantern&quot;), &quot;Watchmen&quot; was originally published by DC Comics in twelve issues in 1986-87. Moore and Gibbons won the Best Writer/Artist combination award at the 1987 Jack Kirby Comics Industry Awards ceremony. The central story in &quot;Watchmen&quot; is quite simple: apparently someone is killing off or discrediting the former Crimebusters. The remaining members end up coming together to discover the who and the why behind it all, and the payoff to the mystery is most satisfactory. But what makes &quot;Watchmen&quot; so special is the breadth and depth of both the characters and their respective subplots: Dr. Manhattan dealing with his responsibility to humanity given his god-like powers; Nite Owl having trouble leaving his secret identity behind; Rorschach being examined by a psychiatrist. Each chapter offers a specific focus on one of the characters, yet advances the overall narrative.<br />Beyond that the intricate narrative, Moore and Gibbons offer two additional levels to the story. First, each chapter is followed by a &quot;non-comic&quot; section that develops more of the backstories, such as numerous excerpts from Hollis Mason's autobiography &quot;Under the Hood&quot; or Professor Mitlon Glass' &quot;Dr. Manhattan: Super-Powers and the Superpowers,&quot; an interview with Adrian Veidt, or reports from the police files of Walter Joseph Kovacs. Second, almost every issue has scenes from &quot;Tales of the Black Freighter,&quot; a comic-book being read by a kid near a newsstand, which offers an allegorical perspective on the main plot line.<br />&quot;Watchmen&quot; certainly nudged the comics industry in the right direction towards greater sophistication and intelligence, although a full appreciation of its significance is always going to be lost on the bean counters. The Book Club Edition of &quot;Watchmen&quot; offers the teaser: &quot;He's America's ultimate weapon . . . and he's about to desert to Mars.&quot; As a representation of the work as a whole that description is simply stupid, especially since it is followed by a glowing recommendation by Harlan Ellison that concludes &quot;anyone who misses this milestone event in the genre of the fantastic is a myopic dope.&quot; If you ever spent time reading and enjoying any superhero comic book, you will appreciate what you find in &quot;Watchmen.&quot;  Those of us who first devoured it when it came out in comic book form are still enjoying taking it out and reading it at least once a year in this hardback version.on that develops more of the backstories, such as numerous excerpts from Hollis Mason's autobiography &quot;Under the Hood&quot; or Professor Mitlon Glass' &quot;Dr. Manhattan: Super-Powers and the Superpowers,&quot; an interview with Adrian Veidt, or reports from the police files of Walter Joseph Kovacs.

B00004Z459|5.0|this is the best linkin park cd out there yet!  IT's way better than meteora!
B00005JKC3|2.0|Pirates of the Caribbean was the most disappointing film of summer 2003 because it promised more fun than it actually delivered. The Hulk comes in a close second because its pedigree (from the cast to director Ang Lee) would seemingly indicate we'd get a film that's far superior to the final cut of this horribly overlong clunker.<br />Maybe the Hulk was never suited for big screen material, but it's more likely Ang Lee just mucked up the execution. He clearly wants to inject his films with the deeper meaning, to question and explore the very psyche of the film's protagonist, Bruce Banner (Eric Bana). Truth be told, I'm not partial to this approach, but I could grudgingly accept it if delivered and executed competently. It's not.<br />From the dull performances to the pretentious tone, Hulk consistently does little more than make the viewer every bit as angry as the green beast himself, only because one was foolish enough to actually fork over some hard-earned cash to see the film.<br />Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the fact that Lee wants to put characters over action, an approach that has constantly appealed to me, but there's a catch here; not one single character is likeable and/or sympathetic. Bana is a decent actor, but he radiates zero screen presence or charisma as Banner, I neither felt nor cared for his supposed mental and physical anguish.<br />As his ex-girlfriend, Jennifer Connelly is even less convincing, resorting to little more than shedding tears when the situation goes awry. Connelly is one of those actresses whose marked improvements over the years (she was an awful actress from the mid-80's to early 90's) has impressed me, but this is her worst performance in years. In other supporting roles, Josh Lucas is okay but perfunctorily one-dimensional as the villain, and Sam Elliot does his gruff thing yet again, and it's not nearly as amusing here as it was in We Were Soldiers (where much of it was played for laughs; he's deadly serious here). Nick Nolte is hilariously over-the-top as mad scientist Bruce Banner, it'd be amusing if it wasn't so earnest.<br />The movie as a whole is about anger, that seething, boiling rage lurking under the surface just waiting for the catalyst that'll unleash its ugly face. There is, unfortunately, only so much a film of this sort can do to deal with such a topic, and it doesn't even maximize such potential during the action sequences.<br />The Hulk (the big man himself) is a passable special effect, better than you'd expect, but not as good as you'd hope for, and while the green lug does get in a few pretty cool moments (leaping around the desert, for instance), he's utterly wasted in this movie's few paltry action sequences. There's a general rule of thumb of mine that any superhero action movie should pit our hero against stronger villains (a rule the recent X2 also broke). Not the case here, where most of Hulk's fighting is against the U.S. military. This is without mentioning that the Hulk not only has super strength and super agility, he's also practically invulnerable to harm because of a quick healing factor; a hero who virtually can't die? Bye-bye, suspense.<br />The one scene where the Hulk does fight someone with superior powers to his own is set in the dark, and I could barely make anything out during this battle, which hardly lasts past a minute and is wholly anti-climactic compared to the slightly more engaging Hulk vs. the military confrontation.<br />Danny Elfman's horrible score rounds out the rest of this lackluster picture. It's a rip-off of his own work in Spider-Man, which itself was a rip-off of his superior work in Batman. Lesson to Elfman: a score of this style won't work for every superhero.<br />Ang Lee crafts the film with a &quot;wink-wink&quot;-style camerawork, splicing in lots of comic-book style scene transitions, reminding viewers they are indeed watching an adaptation of a popular comic book. Not only are the transitions themselves annoying, butthey're a persistent reminder of how much more fun it would be to actually skim through an issue of the Hulk than to actually watch this film.
B000003S09|5.0|King Crimson forces you to travel inside yourself and discover your deepest responses to the world around you. The music and lyrics are such that you cannot hear either without being deeply effected. I first heard this music when I was about 19 or 20 years old, and I'm 51 now. It still moves me. I recommend this selection to anyone who loves lyrics, anyone who loves &quot;underground music&quot;, anyone who wants to complete their history of rock collection.
B00005K3LU|3.0|this movie has some great action scenes, but is way to long.  It is two hours and ten minutes.  They could have easily trimmed it down to less than two hours without sacrificing action.
6302878756|4.0|I have to agree with the majority of reviews posted so far regarding this flick. I saw it when it came out in theatres (with my dad; I was just a little kid) but this movie is so cheesy that it's laughable (in a good way) and a lot of fun to watch at the same time. Very adrenaline rushing, action pact destruction and pyrotechnics best define this movie as Stallone and Russle play two cops from the East and West side who cost the local drug lord big bucks by busting all of his drug deals, so he has them framed and sent to prison. They escape of course in order to clear their names and seek retribution. You could probobly find it on VHS for a few bucks at the local pawn shop.....just don't expect Shakespeare. Appriciate it for what it is.
B000002BFZ|5.0|Amazing album, one of pearl jams finest. Hated it at first, over time it really grew on me and now I love (nearly) every single song.<br />Sometimes: Short, soft delicate song. Great to open the album with 8/10<BR>Hail, Hail: My favourite on the album. Fantastic, energetic rock song. Ranks as one of the best Pearl Jam songs ever 10/10<BR>Who You Are: A lot of people don't like this song, don't know why. Great tribal drum beats by Jack Irons. Really good 9/10<BR>In My Tree: This song really puts you in a good mood if youre feeling down. Great chorus 9/10<BR>Smile: Sounds like Neil Young. Great harmonica work in this one 8/10<BR>Off He Goes: Really hated this one at first but now it's my second favourite on the album. Amazing ballad with really touching lyrics 10/10<BR>Habit: Everyone hates this song the first time they hear it, but it really grows on you 9/10<BR>Red Mosquito: Love the guitar work on this one. Great bluesy song 9/10<BR>Lukin: Short, odd punky song about Matt Lukin of Mudhoney (??) Great melody even if the lyrics are a little weird 8/10<BR>Present Tense: Really good atmospheric song. Gets better towards the end 9/10<BR>Mankind: Odd decsision to get Stone to sing on this one, just shows you that Ed has a far better vocal ability in comparison. Still a good song though 8/10<BR>I'm Open: Spoken word song. OK, good chorus but probably ultimately the worst song on the album 6/10<BR>Around the Bend: Love this song. Totally different from the rest of the album, kind of like a lullaby. Sounds a bit like Scitzophrenia by Sonic Youth 9/10<br />Overall Score: 9.5/10
0792833236|4.0|If you've seen this film, then you know what I'm referring to in the line above!<br />Raging Bull is a driven and unforgettable character study of famous 1940's boxer, Jake La Motta. Jake La Motta was a rather pathetic figure.He had raging tempers and outbursts of jealousy and rage that he himself could not control.I'm not even sure he knew where he was coming from.He was violent and ridiculously controlling of everyone and eveything around him.He rode high when boxing was good to him, but when he gave up his career, his angry ways caught up with him and he was left with no one to care about him. And yet, despite Jake acting like an egotistical son of a b*tch,I sympathized with him, deeply.I sympathized with him because in the end, he liced his life the only way that he knew how.He loved the ones around him the only way that he knew how.He wasn't a bad man by choice; he was simply a weak man who wasn't capable of controlling his inner demons.The boxing scenes create the perfect atmosphere of blood and lust and sweat and rage.<br />Joe Pesci, who plays Joey, Jake's brother, and manager is excellent and could've easily been granted his academy award.He deftly moves through the film capturing all his character's many dimensions.In many ways, Joey is not much different from his brother-he was just able to control himself more.Every scene Pesci is in, is an unforgettable one, because he brings something new to each one.Cathy Moriarty is perfect as Jake's wife of eleven years.You witness her descent from a young beauty full of life and vitality into a world-weary housewife with barely any freedom or life of her own.<br />But this film belongs to a man called Bobby D. Robert De Niro is absolutely brilliant.He isn't acting, he is being(no matter how many times you may have heard it, it's  true)&gt;Every single word he says, every grunt he produces, every expression om his face is compelling and impossible to look away from.Towards the end, with 50 extra pounds on him, De Niro produces some of the most unforgettable scenes I've ever seen.He is absolutely wrenching and his performance is everything you've heard and more.<br />This film has a few rough spots in the middle;at times, it's not as compelling of a drama as it wants to be.But these moments are so rare, and so completely overruled by the brilliant acting, and script, that you'd be hard pressed to care. You gotta watch it, that's all I can say.
B00008S2VG|1.0|I've been a true Madonna fan since she had some her first hits like Everybody, Physical Attraction, and Holiday in the 80's.  <br />For me, my favorite music from Madonna ranged from dance, pop and ballad. Throughout the years her music has progressed with the times and she always managed to come up with a hit.  She always had that ability as an artist.<br />Unfortunately, this album, in my opinion, is probably one of her worst albums to date.  I purchased it and found myself skipping each track in hopes of finding something that sounded anything like Die Another Day.  Boy was I disappointed. I honestly tried to listen to the entire cd one day in my car, and just couldn't.  It wasn't anything I wanted to hear.  When I buy a new cd I usually like at least more than one of it's tracks - this one was a failure.  It just sounded like Madonna trying to re-invent herself again but with bad music.<br />Her Music cd was much better, and I must admit I was hoping to hear more of that music on this cd.
B000001A3H|5.0|I bought this album when it first came out in '92, and I still listen to it today. It opened up many musical doors for me, and my friends as well.  Really trippy, groovy, and totally absorbing... such a great album. Highly recommended from a fan of many different styles of music.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|although the tittle for her fourth album sounds alot like product placement for &quot;the zone&quot; diet plan,<BR>it has a little less comercial appeal in comparison to other albums and tracks she has made over the years.<BR>before i begin on the music perspective of my reveiw i would like to say i am not a supporter of britney spears, however i had to give her props for her accomplishments on &quot;in the zone&quot;.<BR>it most defenitly has a more mature sound a also lyrical astrabutes, but what surpised me the most was how original some of the songs were.unlike her past albums which are the same songs with semi-similar lyrics, this album strays away from anything britney has ever done. the music itself is lacking the shallow superficail pop/dance genre. she has managed to recrute all the right people and as a result her final product has the same sound just more depth(not that much but a improvment non the less).
B0001Z53AQ|1.0|This cd is so boring I fell asleep listening to it.  5 of the members are ok sometimes but eminem is sooooooooo annoying!  The reason why eminem takes credit for the group is because he is white.  I am sure you heard about eminems recent racism controversy, and you probably heard his phony apology.  In eminems old song called white america he says that the only reason he has fame and fortune is because he's white.  What he doesn't tell you is that he is proud of that.  Eminem is a greedy egomaniac and he will do anything for money.  He is cocky because he knows he can make crappy music and his fans are dumb enough to buy it.  That's why you see him on trl acting like a bigshot.  WHAT A JERK!
B00009W0U4|5.0|&quot;Irreversible&quot; is one of the most violent and cruel films I have ever seen.  The rape scene is brutally honest, shot in one long eight minute take without interruption, and the beating at the beginning is so graphic you feel as if the camera is participating in the violence, rising and falling with the blunt instrument.<BR>    And yet, because of the films honesty, it becomes a film that does not at all condone violence.  Instead, it seems to demonstrate it's unnecessary existence in society as it completely destroys two lives, seemingly bound to this destiny by fate as the movie is told in reverse.<BR>    Brilliant, althought unwatchable to most.
B0000BWVCM|4.0|You want to read aaaaaaall about the movie and it's long strides and short comings? Read all the other reviews.<br />You want to know if this is a fantastic movie that, regardless of critical comparison to the comic books, is worth watching? Read below.<br />Yes. Movie good. You watch.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I am a HUGE fan of Britney Spears and I think that this cd has made it to the top! There is alot of good sayings about this album, so if I were you I would give this cd a chance, it's very danceable, and I've loved every cd she has made, but yet this cd seems the most popurlar. Even though Touch of my Hand isn't the best song, it still has the best beat, so please give Britney a chance.
B000002UAO|1.0|this is a great song; but on the cd, the ending fade-out has been clipped by a few seconds.  Big difference between american lp/cassette and this cd.  It's a beautiful fade-out, but this cd has truncated it. I want my money back.
B000148KK2|4.0|Upon first listen, this struck me at 3 and 1/2 and I was going to give this 3 stars, meaning I wasn't going to review it (since, with one exception, I don't write reviews with less than 4).  But I listened to it again, and decided to up it one star.<br />The reason is that most of these songs were written by Ms. Krall's husband, Elvis Costello, and actually they are very good.  (One, &quot;Almost Blue&quot;, is practially a modern-day standard already.)  They get better with each listen, and that's particularly impressive given that this is Ms. Krall's first foray away from the Great American Songbook. Kudos for the artistic stretch.<br />And, IMO Ms. Krall's piano chops have improved.  I like her barrelhouse blues licks on &quot;Stop This World&quot; and &quot;Love Me Like a Man&quot;, and her break on &quot;Black Crow&quot; is one of the album's highlights.<br />The problem is that the gulf between her piano and her voice is ever widening.  This is the woman who is voted, year in and year out, as the best contemporary female jazz vocalist.  That title is a lot to live up to, and here, she doesn't.  She never had that big a range, but here, her voice is getting huskier and huskier and she sings more and more in a whisper, thereby diminshing what range she had.  Plus, for the first time, I detect occasional intonation problems.<br />A perfect example of what I'm talking about is &quot;Abandoned Masquerade&quot;, arguably the strongest cut on the album.  It is very good, indeed; but sung by a singer with a richer voice and greater range, such as Janis Siegel or Jackie Ryan, it would be sensational.  No doubt, Ms. Krall will win this year's &quot;Down Beat&quot; critics poll, while Ms. Ryan and Ms. Siegel won't even make it to &quot;Talent Deserving Wider Recognition.&quot;<br />So, I grudgingly recommend it--but not to people who can't fathom Diana Krall singing something contemporary.  If that's where you're at, avoid, because there isn't enough else here to compensate.nsate.
B00005JM02|4.0|My 5-year-old loooooves this movie, and I find it to be pretty harmless.<br />Yeah, good, cute, family flick.

B0001DI0FI|5.0|The capitan -played by Russel Crowe- displays the admirable ethics of naval warfare. It starts out when anoter frigate (a huge ship that surpasses the 'Surpise') surprise attacks Crowe's ship. Unlike other movies, this movie doesnt just focus on the revenge. It also unveils the life of a sailor, and shows the hardships that they had to go through. <br />I really like the story this movie put up. While trying to find the ship and take it over, the crew is met with horrible and gleeful situations. This movie does a marvolus job in describing the world they live in, such as thier expeditions to find new species and thier zeal to explore more lands, also thier doctors and medicine (only other gory part besides the battles) becaue they dont have the medicine that we do today. This movie did an amazing job showing battle ethics, and I think is a masterpiece of it.<br />What I didn't like personally, was the dry parts, like nothing but talk for a long time but those parts were far in between. <br />All in all this movie is a masterpiece, all credited to the acting and towards Bruchemier's brillant mind. So 5 stars
B0001BKAEY|1.0|Enjoyed the first one so much I eagerly awaited the second. The second left me feeling disappointed and blue because it sucked. The third made me feel better because it was so lame that I kept laughing until the end. The only good parts of the third was the key master and the oracle's protector. <br />The directors went 'Hollywood,' as we like to say in the industry.
B00009TB5G|5.0|You want to read aaaaaaall about the movie and it's long strides and short comings? Read all the other reviews.<br />You want to know if this is a fantastic movie that, regardless of critical comparison to the books, is worth watching? Read below.<br />Yes. Movie good. You watch.
B000148KK2|2.0|Any trace of originality she may or may not have had certainly won't be found on this CD. It's at best a well-produced, sappy pop album. <BR>   I have enjoyed her other CDs, and like Alfonso mentioned (see his review) -- if you are interested in listening to richly textured, well-sung, swinging jazz classics, then put your hard-earned money elsewhere.
B0001AVZA8|4.0|Great film.  Diane Keaton certainly steals the show in this one, still looking Dynamite and exuding that girlish vulnerability that makes her desirable.  What a charmer--and that impassioned kiss she gives Nicholson, like lovers who can't get enough of each other.<br />The movie  very quickly touched on the gender issues and cliches i.e. men vs. women, youth and aging, and then moved straight into the meat of the story...all the facets of falling head-over-heels in love with someon. I especially loved honest truth expressed by that fabulous line Diane's character imparts to her daughter, &quot;Honey, do you really think you can outsmart getting hurt?&quot; <br />The message seems simple:  you cannot hide from love forever.  Get over yourself and enjoy it.
B000002LGQ|5.0|It is unfortunate that so many people judge Madonna by her image rather than her music. Even among those who listen to her music, some quickly spot her limited vocal range and instantly decide that she can't be any good. All those people are missing out on one of the finest - as well as one of the most successful - singers in the history of pop music. Although this album is not my favorite Madonna album, it is the kind of album that only Madonna could have recorded. Perhaps more than any other, it shows why Madonna should be taken seriously as a singer-songwriter of true quality.<br />The album yielded four top five UK hits, these being Like a prayer (which made number one), Express yourself, Cherish and Dear Jessie. In the USA, Dear Jessie was apparently not released as a single but Oh father and Keep it together both were. Oh father was not originally released as a UK single, but made the UK top twenty in 1996 following its release to promote the compilation, Something to remember. On the assumption that you are familiar with most of these songs, I'll focus on the others.<br />Love song (a duet with Prince that the two of them co-wrote), although interesting in its own way, does not quite live up to its billing. You would think that a duet featuring the two hottest pop singers of their day would be an automatic choice for a single. It wasn't even released as a single because there are several other songs that are stronger - actually, all the other songs are stronger except Act of contrition, the brief final track that features Madonna talking over the reversed tune of the title track.<br />Till death do us part is a very sad song about a violent marriage, but with an up-tempo melody that hides the real meaning of the song. This kind of paradox is not unusual in pop music. In the sixties, Baby now that I've found you by the Foundations used a similar idea. Maybe one day somebody will re-interpret the song, just as Alison Krauss did with that Foundations song, slowing it right down to highlight its sadness.<br />Promise to try, a touching ballad, is a tribute to Madonna's late mother and the difficulty of living without her. Pray for Spanish eyes is another excellent ballad, this time with a touch of Latin.<br />This is not Madonna's most instantly appealing albums but is certainly one of her most interesting, containing a lot of deep personal messages. If you doubt Madonna's talent as a songwriter, study the lyrics to some of these songs. As a singer, she knows about her limited vocal range and works within it, never over-stretching. It does not surprise me that Madonna has been continuously successful for twenty years. Long may she reign as queen of pop.ng it right down to highlight its sadness.<br />Promise to try, a touching ballad, is a tribute to Madonna's late mother and the difficulty of living without her.

B0001GOH6Q|2.0|This movie felt a little too much like Forrest Gump.  The movie definitely carried Burton's stamp with its dreamy, gothic surrealism; fantastical characters; and the familiar lofty themes from Danny Elfman's score. However, the story-line seemed a little too familiar...just a different person telling a tale to a different listener.  Is it a coincidence that the main characters in both movies loved story-telling, lived larger-than-life adventures and were from Alabama?<br />Nice approach...but already been done.  Skip it.
B000005JU3|5.0|Compared to what they did in the sixties, everything the Rolling Stones did subsequently seems (at least to me) modest by comparison - yet, judged on its own merit, this collection of their later music is easily worth five stars. In fact, Brown sugar and Wild horses (the first two tracks here) were actually recorded in 1969 but not released at the time. The extensive liner notes are taken from an interview with Mick Jagger and Keith Richards.<br />Although less successful than their sixties music, they continued to have plenty of hits. They didn't reach number one in the UK but they had two American number ones - Angie and Miss you. In the UK, Brown sugar, Tumbling dice, Angie, It's only rock'n'roll but I like it, Fool to cry, Miss you, Emotional rescue and Start me up all made the top ten, while Undercover of the night and a cover of Harlem shuffle both came close. All those hits are here although there is one serious omission, Far away eyes - it was released as the B-side of Miss you but the single was later credited as a double-A side.<br />My favorite tracks from this album are Tumbling dice (later covered by Linda Ronstadt on her classic album, Simple dreams), Miss you, Brown sugar and Wild horses.<br />This compilation is (as I write this) the only compilation of Rolling Stones music covering the seventies and beyond that does not also cover the sixties. (Note that the double CD, Forty licks, covers their whole career.) As such, this is an ideal companion to a collection of their early work (in my case, the triple CD London years).
B0001BKAEY|4.0|That it didn't appeal to the minority of &quot;Ahnold-shoot-em-up-blow-wm-up&quot; fans is no real loss.<br />It's a good movie that sort of &quot;wraps up&quot; without &quot;ending&quot; the story.<br />Don't look for all the heroes to ride off into the sunset, and don't look for geeky, campy one-liners.  This is actually the more cerebral of the movies to date.<br />Bueno.
0375751513|4.0|The Picture of Dorian Gray is a terrific melodramatic Romantic-era novel. It is a pleasant story of an artist-Basil-and his relationship with a young man named Dorian Gray. Basil often paints portraits of Gray, and one day a man named Lord Henry Wotton comes and changes Gray's life. Though I don't want to spoil the rich plot, Gray is faced with the reality that he will soon age and the sketches will not, and he is horrified.<br />The book is a quick read, despite mostly long chapters (fifteen pages or so). I was able to sit down and read the book, often finding myself enjoying a book assigned in English class. Though it is quick moving and a reasonably short book, it is a book meant for high schoolers and older.<br />For a story out of the Romantic era, I really enjoyed reading this book. It wasn't one of the books that I had to turn to Cliff's Notes to understand-it was an easy read. The book kind of reminded me of a soap opera, though not nearly as lame, it had some parts that would appear in the script of a soap. I found myself hating Lord Henry for ruining Gray, and enjoying the choices that Gray made.<br />Overall this book is definitely worth a quick read. It's not your typical Romantic book, because it isn't a cheesy novel, it has some real depth. I recommend it to anybody looking for a quick and easy read or if it's on the reading list for somebody's summer required reading for English. Enjoy!

B00008IAMD|5.0|When I was growing up, I loved country music.  Johnny Cash was a particular favorite until I was around 13, and stopped listening to anything from Nashville.  From 1995 until 2000, I didn't buy country albums, watch country videos, or listen to country songs. Gradually though, I started to listen to the songs of Hank Williams, Willie Nelson, and others again, but for some reason I never picked up my Johnny Cash cds.  That was until I saw the video for \\"Hurt\\" on the internet.           I was shocked to see the Man in Black so ravaged by time, so obviously weak and frail, his voice losing it's power.  I was also amazed at how wonderfully the song fit the man, and how well he delivered it regardless of his ailments.           Within a month I had purchased this album, and discovered that there was not just one gem on this album, but rather an entire cd of amazing music.  Soon after buying American IV, I completed the American Recordings collection (including the Unearthed box set), and finally began listening to those great albums I had had all along.  Now everyime I listen to songs like \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\", \\"I Walk the Line\\", \\"San Quntin\\", \\"Long Black Veil\\", ect..., I have \\"American IV: The Man Comes Around\\" to thank.  Do yourself a favor and pick this modern classic today.

B000003TAL|4.0|It's hard to take the alternative rock of the `90's seriously after listening to Sonic Youth.  Out of  the experimental, alternative/ art/ alternative rock between 1985 - 1990, Sonic Youth was the only one to come across as unpretentious and energetic.  There's no need to listen to My Bloody Valentine, Stereolab, or Pavement if you have \\"Evol,\\" \\"Sister,\\" and \\"Daydream Nation.\\"      On \\"Daydream Nation,\\" Sonic Youth began using more predictable rock that marked the beginning of their descent into typical `90's rock.  Thurston Moore's voice became less animated at this point, which really took away from the overall energetic feeling they once had.  Kim Gordon's voice had much more of an edge to it, but female vocals in rock just don't work as well as some males.  On the other hand, the feedback work on this album was the best they have ever done.  Maybe that's because it's a relief to the rock they were using on the rest of the album.  The normal rock they use on the album is really good, but its drug down by the vocals.  The worst song is the lightweight opener, \\"Teenage Riot.\\"  The next three are their most energetic, but then they fail to carry the momentum with \\"Eric's Trip,\\" just because it's a bad song.  The one song that makes this album worth owning is \\"Total Trash,\\" which is probably the best Sonic Youth song.  The way the song self-destructs is absolutely incredible.  Then comes \\"Hey Joni,\\" which is where the album begins spiraling down.  The only songs that save the rest of the album is \\"Providence\\" and \\"Trilogy: the Wonder.\\"    Even though Sonic Youth were not the first to use feedback in their music, they were the best at it.  Perhaps the strategic manner in which they use the feedback is what make their music so powerful.  It would really be interesting to see a metal band use feedback and arrangements like Sonic Youth does.  It would make sense to have self-destructing metal songs caused by the heaviness they can deliver.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This phenomenal miniseries was co-produced by Steven Spielberg & Tom Hanks, a pairing that gave us one of the most talked-about battle sequences in history with the opening scenes of the Normandy invasion in \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\"  Well, if you're one of the few who haven't yet seen \\"BoB,\\" prepare for several scenes that are equally impressive in their intensity and realism.  <br />Nothing has made me appreciate the combat soldier like this miniseries.  Nothing has ever come close.  We can all wag our heads and say, \\"War is hell,\\" but the remarkable portrayal of these true stories, filmed by a production whose stated goal was to be as accurate as possible in every way, brings it home for me in a way that neither Hollywood, nor the press, nor the tales of returning veterans ever could.<br />But it's not just those laudable results that make it happen.  It's the characterizations of such standout individuals as Winters, Garniere, Nixon, Compton, Toye, Spiers, etc., the real heroes (although they shun the word) who eagerly went forth to slay the Nazi dragon and got burned, to varying degrees, in the process.  I am grateful that we live in an age when such bravery is given its due, rather than that of 30 years ago when it drew suspicion.<br />We live the war with these characters, from their soul-killing boot camp at the hands of possibly the worst company captain you could imagine (played brilliantly by David Schwimmer---yes, THAT David Schwimmer, clearly nobody's \\"Friend\\" here), to the nervous jump under fire over Normandy, to the firefights in the forests and fields of France and Holland, to Hitler's vaunted Eagle's Nest.  Our innocence and enthusiasm are shattered and rebuilt just like theirs, and our view of war, even of life itself, is forever altered in the process.  Thankfully for the viewer, we are not as deeply haunted as these fine men.<br />Having watched the series a couple of times, the only nitpicks I have are that the primary military advisor on the series was a Vietnam vet who, I am told, wrongly approved two anachronisms:  The amount of foul language was much less among WWII veterans than presented here, and the extensive hand signals were not in use by the paratroopers whose story this is.  Both would be very familiar to him from 'Nam, a generation later, but don't belong in this WWII arena.<br />Other than that, I have only praise and heartfelt thanks for this terrific 11-hour panorama of man's inhumanity to man and man's mechanisms for coping with same.  It'll be a long time before anyone can match \\"Band of Brothers\\" in its scope, feel, and impact.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|As a fan of The Beatles for over 40 years, I've broken down The Beatles career into 5 phases: '56-'63 The Working Band Phase, '63-'65 The Fab Four Phase, '65-'66 The Folk-Rock Phase, '66-'67 The Psychadelic Phase and finally '68-'70 The Disintigration Phase. After Brian died, the band was splintering and barely able to function as a unit. No fault to any individual member mind you (I am NOT one of those Paul &amp; Yoko conspiracy theorists), the pressure of being one of the biggest musical forces of the 20th century was taking their toll. &quot;Let It Be&quot; reflects the peak of Phase 5.<BR>When I bought this album in 1970, it was a disappointment, especially after the polished perfection of &quot;Abbey Road&quot;. But still, it's The Beatles! And whatever reasons John, George and Ringo (not Paul) had for giving Phil Spector the duties of producing and incorporating his annoying Wall Of Sound trademark on these recordings, I still accepted this album.<BR>Well now that the Spectoring is gone, this is definitley an improvement. With the master tapes at bare-bones, you can now hear some instrumentation that you didn't know existed. You can actually feel like you're in Twickingham Studios or the roof top during these recordings.  Even &quot;The Long And Winding Road&quot; (one of my least favorite Beatle songs, BORING!) sounds great without trying to sound over-majestic. Only 3 other songs were Spectorized, Across The Universe, I Me Mine and the title track, and they sound great just to show that The Beatles, bickering or not, were still in good form.<BR>Parting thoughts, it would've been nice to keep in Dig It and Maggie Mae in this package. But I'm not going to complain. This recording was done during The Beatles' most troubling times, and now this new bare-bones release shows that even then, they can still pull a rabbit out of a hat.
0425173755|5.0|this would be a good choice.<br />MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS is one of the most well known mysteries of all time, and for good reason, it is brilliant.  The story begins with Hercule Poirot beginning a journey on the famed Orient Express.  His fellow travelers are a mixed lot; an American businessman and his secretary/assistant and his valet, a Russian Princess and her maid, a Hungarian Count and Countess, a governess, a missionary, a British military man returning from India and two salesman, one American and the other Italian. <br />On the second night out one of the group is murdered, murdered several times over by multiple stab wounds. The train is also snowbound.  Poirot quickly discovers that the murderer must still be on the train and works to solve the crime before the train is freed and the killer able to escape, or kill again.  He soon learns that the victim is not exactly who he seems, and in fact was connected with a famous kidnapping/murder case.  <br />MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS is an example of how Christie took the events of her day, in this instance the Lindbergh kidnapping, combined with her own experiences (she traveled on the Orient Express many times) to write her novels.  Christie also pushed the rules of detective fiction in this one, as she did in THE MURDER OF ROGER AKROYD earlier and would again later in AND THEN THERE WERE NONE (TEN LITTLE INDIANS), to come up with a novel solution.
B000062Y98|4.0|German metal band Blind Guardian spent the majority of 2000 and 2001 recording this album, and from listening to it, you can tell that quite a bit of time, and meticulous detail went into it. 2002's _A Night At The Opera_ is grand, majestic, stately metal of the highest order. Mystical lyrics, dense, smothering production, long time-lengths, loads of double bass drumming, and not to mention a healthy dosage of melody: it makes for a meal that is both rich, and at times, over-quantitated.<br />Many reviewers have compared this album to Queen, and a few others have compared it to ELO. On the whole, those are appropriate comparisons. This album is ambitious like most Queen material was, the vocals and vocal harmonies are soaring, majestic and operatic (vocalist Hansi sounds slightly like Queen vocalist Freddie Mercury at times), and then, there's the over-production (which both Queen and ELO are often criticized for.) The production on this album is so densely layered, and stuffed, you'd think you were listening to a trainwreck, and a 12-car pile-up on a mono recording. OK, that's an exaggeration, but this overstuffed aspect of the production could make or break the album: it'll take painstaking effort to pick out the subtleties and nuances buried beneath, since everything seems piled and clogged together. However, this can be fun, this can be a challenge for the listener who stumbles upon this album. Either way, the production techniques used here help to create a powerful wall-of-sound, that is even capable of giving listeners the goosebumps often (like myself.)<br />Besides the band members themselves, there is a 5-person choir to add choral voices when needed, and there are also some strings that are apparent throughout the album (something ELO did quite often.) I rate this album 4 stars, because I don't necessarily love every song on here, and more importantly, I'm not tempted to listen to this album very often: power metal is not a genre I'm very fond of, nor is metal a genre I'm nuts over on the whole.<br />My favorite songs would be &quot;Battlefield,&quot; the ornate, Baroque classicisms that run throughout &quot;The Maiden And The Minstrel Knight,&quot; make that a favorite, as well as the loud vocal chorus-soaked &quot;Wait For An Answer,&quot; and others. But, my absolute favorite track on this album, without question, is &quot;The Soulforged.&quot; Such triumphant soundscapes, loud, soaring vocal harmonies and a majestic melody blend magnificently to give me the goosebumps every single time, and not to mention nearly sending me to tears. It's *that* powerful.<br />It's my love of Queen's music which brought me to this album (and apparently, Blind Guardian love Queen, too.) When attempting something as big as this, it is more often than not that there will be some loose ends, or flaws, but I applaud this record more than I despise it. Recommended for fans of power metal, or anything mystical and ambitious. It's an acquired taste though, so purchase with caution.metal a genre I'm nuts over on the whole.<br />My favorite songs would be &quot;Battlefield,&quot; the ornate, Baroque classicisms that run throughout &quot;The Maiden And The Minstrel Knight,&quot; make that a favorite, as well as the loud vocal chorus-soaked &quot;Wait For An Answer,&quot; and others.

B00004VVND|4.0|I don't think a lot of sci-fi fans today appreciate the really thought-provoking material of much of the sci-fi movies that were made between '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Star Wars'.  Then again, this WAS a cycle in the genre when everyone was apparently convinced Charlton Heston would be the last surviving human on planet Earth, but that's another can of worms entirely.  My point being, it took someone with the kind of courage Michael Crichton had to be pitching a script like 'Westworld' to movie audiences.  And it worked. While Crichton is known for his literary pursuits rather than his directorial efforts, he was no slouch in the area of the latter, and 'Westworld' definitely proves that.  The premise is a little hokey, almost left over from 1957, but in the age of Disney World it's terribly effective; even after all these years 'Westworld' is laced with as taut a level of suspense as you can possibly hope for from a film of its time.<BR>'Westworld' basically is the story of Delos, a dazzling theme-park of the not-too-distant future, which, like its counterpart created by Uncle Walt, charges insane admission fees in order to cater to its guests' every whim and perverted pleasure.  Like Disney World, Delos has separate themed 'worlds' - Romanworld, Medievalworld, and of course, Westworld.  And just as with Disney World, much of the park's starring 'cast' are robots - only these are true androids who are willing to go as far as their programming allows to please the customers.  Of course, as ancient Rome and the Old West practically beg for bloodshed, park administrators can't simply let the guests up and take their chances; the robots, therefore, can't kill anything that gives off body heat.  A clever idea.  For about fifteen minutes.  <BR>Then swanky singles Jim Brolin and Dick Benjamin walk into the saloon, rub black-clad Yul Brynner the wrong way and pop a cap in'im.  And everything just goes downhill from there.<BR>Needless to say, Yul Brynner owns this movie,even with as little screen time as he's allowed.  Put his Gunslinger character up against Ah-nuld's cyborg from the future, and I could guarantee the Gunslinger would win the fight just by staring the Terminator down.  Brolin and Benjamin do their best to offer some humanity to the film (and distract from some of its more glaring discrepancies), as does Dick Van Patten in a comical role as a nerdy guest and Majel Barrett of 'Star Trek' fame (and Gene Roddenberry's wife) in a small but delicious role as the owner of Westworld's brothel.  The acting in the film is pretty good, which takes some of the dating off of this technology-gone-wrong tale.  <BR>There are some touches of wry humor, but in the end 'Westworld' goes for the gut by steadily building toward a harrowing climax when the park finally goes completely haywire and the blood starts pouring.  Crichton's guiding hand and Brynner's wickedly icy performance offer all the credentials needed to ensure that, where enjoying this movie is concerned, 'nothing can go wrong'.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|A lot of films have an elaborate, complex storyline where not much really happens.  This film has a seemingly simple plot where a great deal happens.  Put simply, it's a funny, sweet and endearing film which is beautifully directed.  I can't really understand why so many people found this boring.  This is one of the few films I've found truly enthralling.  One quote which stays with me is when Charlotte says &quot;Let's never come back here again... because it will never be this much fun&quot;.
1400031524|2.0|This is the weakest of the six books I have read in the series. The translation into English is flat and the language drab. Usually, the element of mystery and suspense is stronger as is the character development of the detective Kurt Wallender and those surrounding his life. Here, the mystery lacks tension and at the end I hardly cared about the resolution. Also, there was little depth in the portrayal of Wallender or his personal circumstances. If you want to read two first rate Wallender mysteries, choose either One Step Behind or Sidetracked [they are quite similar in plot --and both are extraordinary mysteries].
B0001HAISG|5.0|When this movie first came out, I thought it would be like all the other horrible renditions and therefore didn't want to see it.  I only saw it because my mom wanted to go see it for her christmas, and I couldn't say no.  Now I can say that I was definately mistaken....<BR>     I thought this movie was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!I know own the DVD, and have already seen it twice.  Let's start with the actors.  Jeremy Sumpter was perfectly cast as Peter Pan.  A clever, cocky young boy that is only interested in having fun.  Rachel Hurd-Wood made an excellent Wendy, and I thought that she and Jeremy Sumpter had great chemistry on screen.  Many people say that there relationship was to mature for this film, but those people haven't read the book!  They are supposed to have feelings for each other!  Also, one cannot forget Jason Issacs as Mr. Darling/Captain Hook.  He was a strict father and a terrible evil Hook, and he managed to make teh roles so different.<BR>     The special effects were amazing, the movie stayed very true to the book, and it was basically flawless.  The only small flaw was the music.  I own the CD, and I love it, but they play the main theme way too much.  It is beautiful I will admit, but they could tone it down just a bit.  Other than that, it is an incredible movie that I suggest everyone should see!
B0000AQVCL|1.0|&quot;are you gonna be my girl?&quot; I think that's what this song is called.  This single just grates on my nerves. I had a friend ask me if I  had heard it and if I liked it. And I said &quot;Sure, but I liked it much better when Iggy Pop recorded it and called it Lust for Life.&quot;<BR> Pastiche is one thing. Plagarism is another. And listening to the rest of the CD ( I didn't buy it, I was roped into hearing it by same said friend) reminds me why so many people are still downloading music illegally. They here this song, they like it, and don't want to pay 18 dollars for it and 10 or 12 songs that sound just like it. This is really sad.
B00009V7RF|4.0|When I first listened to this album,I said \\"What the hell?!This album isn't saying anything!\\"But that's what's good about it.All the Black Eyed Peas want you to do is have fun,and they succeed with Elephunk.This album is one of the best of 2003,especially since it's a great piece of fresh air from all the materialism and/or \\"hardness\\" of hip-hop today.And,like their hip-hop fellows Missy Elliot and Outkast,this group has their own sound(funk mixed with hip-hop mixed with rock)that is still able to appeal to everyone,especially the genius proudcing,from the obviously latin-flavored \\"Latin Girls\\" and the go-crazy anthem \\"Labor Day(It's A Holiday)\\".And,I have to say that Fergie is a great addition to the group,especially for her attractive voice.And you can't help but get in a good or partying mood when you listen to the infectious tracks \\"Hey Mama\\" and \\"Sexy\\",which makes you wonder why the Black Eyed Peas weren't noticed a long time ago.Also,each member has their own turn at rapping,and it isn't just one person taking the spotlight,like a few groups I can mention(Eminem and D12,50 Cent and G-Unit)<br />But,you really can't seem to take this group very seriously with this album,especially with the stupid track names(\\"Let's Get Retarded\\" which actually has a really good beat to it) and \\"Smells Like Funk\\" actually has a part that says \\"we keepit stanky\\" in it!Even when they are trying to sound serious,they sound stupid,one example being the political and obnoxious \\"Where Is The Love?\\" featuring the also obnoxious Justin Timberlake.<br />In other words,this album is good if you want to dance all night,or if you want to hear one of the best bands out there today!
B0001ENYKS|1.0|I was prepared to love this cd, after reading the glowing reviews. But I don't. The songs just aren't there for me. Nothing here has a hook that grabs me, or an interesting vocal melody or lyric that sticks in my head. I have incredibly diverse taste in music, I can listen to literally almost anything, but this is just plain old over-hyped nonsense. If this is the future of Rock N Roll, God help us all.
B000002MY3|5.0|All I have to say is thank you Alanis,for making a classic that still inspires people.This is album simply amazing,no doubt about it!Sure,it sounds exaggerated since it's an album from the '90's and all,but just listen to it,and you'll agree with me that this is undoubtedly one of the greatest albums of all time.<BR>All things aside,there are the lyrics.I can't even think up a word that describes Alanis' authenticity.She is definitely one of the greatest songwriters in history.You know that every single track here is from her life,especially since she wrote every word by herself,not ANY help whatsoever!From women's anthems that don't have the \\"Annoying Factor\\"(\\"You Oughta Know\\",\\"Right Through You\\"),to beautiful vulnerability(the teenager's autobigoraphy \\"Perfect\\"),to thought-provoking intellegence(\\"Ironic\\",\\"Hand In My Pocket\\"),even to just straight-up honesty(\\"Wake Up\\",\\"Forgiven\\",every damn song on this album!).And anyone who isn't a huge fan of rock music,you will become one,me being an example.I used to hate rock,and only listened to rap(blechhh!) until I found out about this genius.And Alanis may not have a Mariah-Whitney songbird voice,but that's the greatness of it.Her voice comes right at you,and has an amazing uniqueness to it.And Glen Ballard sure as hell knows his stuff,making the guitars and bass so infectious that you have to like the songs.<br />Flaws:ABSOLUTELY NONE!<br />If you're reading this,by now you should know that this album is one to buy,(...)and get it already,you won't be disappointed,and 16 million copies sold in the U.S. alone says you will!
B0000VAFO0|2.0|Imagine a movie with tired ideas, ridden with cliches from the insiddious goth ledgends of vampires and the like.  Now add on some terrible acting, and some of the worst special effects I've ever seen.  I mean, the werewolf's transforming would have looked better if it was stop motion for gods sake.  So, you have imagined it?  Good, now don't see it.  I might have set your expectaions too highly with this review, for as bad as I have made it sound, it is actually far worse.  Not House of the Dead bad, mind you, but pretty terrible all the same.
B0001I55OC|3.0|Richard Donner has given us some fine films at his helm:  LETHAL WEAPON series; THE OMEN; CONSPIRACY THEORY, and countless others.  TIMELINE will not be remembered as one of his best.  Based on Michael Crichton's excellent novel, TIMELINE tells the story of time travelers who venture back to 14th century France, to rescue a professor who is stranded there and needs help.  Of course, this experiment is top top secret, and when the time transporter is damaged by a hand grenade, we find our heroes may be trapped in the past.  Crichton's book was a wonderful blend of modern day technology and medieval derring do.  Donner sacrifices a little in the former and much in the latter.  The adventures in the medieval days are purely trite, and even the battle sequences, though vividly filmed, lack the power they so richly deserved.  Along with the script, the film suffers in other ways:  Paul Walker and Frances O'Connor (our supposed romantic heroic leads) pale in comparison to Gerard Butler (so good in DRACULA 2000) and the lovely Anna Friel.  Despite less screen time than the other couple, they generated true chemistry and were much more exciting.  Billy Connolly is miscast as the professor father; David Thewlis as the heartless head of the secret experiment isn't malevolent enough to create tension.  However, in supporting roles, doing nicely are Neil McDonough (Gordon); Michael Sheen (Oliver); and Ethan Embry (Josh).  TIMELINE needed to be in the hands of a true visionary director like Stephen Spielberg or a recklessly adventurous action director like Michael Bay.  As it is, TIMELINE is merely okay, and doesn't achieve the excellence the book deserves.
B00005OWEG|4.0|Look this was a good movie, im gonna say if youve never seen it before you can even skip the renting stage and just buy it and you'll be very pleased with your purchase....im just posting because im so sick of seeing these people actually use the 1,000 word maximum......i probably speak for most people when i say that when i see these big long reviews i just skip right through em....i mean a simple plot summary and opinion is really all thats necessary...you supposed &quot;movie -gurus&quot; need to get a life and stop boring everyone with your insights because most of the time its a bunch of garbage anyway
0790730960|5.0|not much i can say about this movie that fans of the movie dont already know!what i can say is this movie needs better dvd treatment and almost every one can agree with me on that,2disk special edition anyone?!
B0001Z52RU|4.0|Let's face it, Ashton Kutcher isn't much more than a pretty face, but he is funny.  When I heard about this movie, I thought that the premise sounded AWESOME.  Then I found out that Ashton Kutcher was gonna be in it.  My next thought was something like \\"WHOA, Ashton does drama?\\"  I have to give the boy credit, he pulled it off.  The Butterfly Effect is awesome.  The imagery and story telling are phenomenal, and the movie is at times, deeply disturbing.Amy Smart is, as awlays, great.  Each time Asthon's character changes something in the past, it is like Amy Smart has to play a whole new character.  She plays the jaded child who had to grow up WAY too fast.  She plays the sassy sorority girl who has it all.  She also plays the poor downtrodden [prostitute] next door.  Each time Ashton makes things better for one person, he messes it up for another, and all to make her happy.  T%his movie is an exact telling of why one cannot and chould not play god.  You can't make eveyone happy.  Someone is going to get the short end of the stick.
0385336810|5.0|I borrowed this book from my sister after hearing her laugh through the entirety of her reading it. I've got to say, she was right, I've never laughed so hard from a piece of literature.  In fact, I enjoyed this book so much that I lent it to 4 girls that lived in my dorm, we all loved it, and would recommend it to ANYONE and EVERYONE.  It was a refreshing change of pace from the boring textbooks and &quot;classic&quot; literature I had been reading.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Upon first hearing about this movie, I was unimpressed.  It sounded kind of cheesy.  It wasn't until I saw an extended trailer, and the beautiful images that are captured by the ever so talented Tim Burton that I knew I had to see this movie.  This movie made up for Planet of the Apes being so bad.  Ewan McGregor is great as the sweet and somewhat innocent Ed Bloom, a saleman with a big imagination.  He has a story for everything.  However, his son Will, did not inherit his imagination and believes that all of the stories are phony.  Once he delves into the world his father lived in, he starts to see the reality of the life his father claimed to live, and the myth becomes the man.  This is one of the sweetest stories ever told.  And the imagery is breathtaking.  I have nver been so captivated by a film in my life.  A must see for any film lover.
B000024D4R|5.0|Animals, which was introduced in 1977, most definately finds its place in my top 5 Pink Floyd albums list.  I have to admit, it took a little bit of getting used to (I was just transitioning from rap to classic rock), though I found it to be a pretty enjoyable ride.  Beginning with Pigs on the Wing (Part 1), listeners are mislead by Water's smooth vocals and fantastic acoustics.  Dogs, however, steers in a totally different direction with a much darker mood.  Because the \\"dogs\\" serve as ruthless money-grabbers, you can expect the many guitar solos in this track to sink deep, almost put you down (the sound effects of dogs howling were great too, especially Roger's voice changing into a barking dog).  Pigs (Three Different Ones) serves as a refreshing transition from Dogs, as the mix of synthesizers, brilliant and humerous lyrics, and mean guitar solos boldly state the band's main message in the album.  Pigs slowly transitions back into darkness with Sheep, which also adds a spooky tone to the album.  Sheep is quite similar to Pigs (Three Different Ones) in that keyboard/guitar are stressed, but a completely different theme is thrown into play.  To rap it all up is Pigs on the Wing (Part 2), which is once again another transition into serene acoustics and a transition out of one amazing album.  I highly recommend this for listeners of all kinds, who can tollerate pain, humor, and politics all in one sitting.
B00005JMSE|4.0|Hellboy is beautifully directed, and fantastically acted.  Ron Perlman is the best thing to happen to comic books since Stan Lee.  He plays Hellboy like he was born to do it.  Selma Blair is fragile and delicate just like you would expect her to be, but oh man..  Don't make her mad.  I think the coolest thing in this movie tho, is Abe Sapien.  He is just awesome.  Hellboy is proof that the monsters aren;t always the bad guys.
0743454529|5.0|Jodi Picoult is one of my &quot;must buy&quot; authors and she does never disappoints.  As a parent, one always wonders how far you would go to save a critically ill child and My Sister's Keeper goes a long way in examining that question.  Do you let a child's disease shape a family?  I still don't have an answer to that, but Picoult will keep you thinking about it long after you finish the last page.  Some may be put off by multiple point of view novels, but Picoult does an excellent job giving each character a distinct voice that creates a satisfying harmony within the story. Picoult has also developed a talent for writing one slightly dislikeable, yet completely understandable, character.  It is one thing, among many, that I admire about Picoult's work.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Quentin Tarentino has always been a genius.  He can take any genre of film and turn it into gold.  Kill Bill Vol. 1 gives new life to the old Kurosawa samurai films and breathes new life into them.  Add in some anime and kung fu fighting and you have a hack em and slash em revenge flick for the ages.  Uma Thurman plays the Bride, the most bad ass character ever to grace the silver screen.  Once a member of the Viper Assassination Squad, now seeking revenge on them for trying to kill her.  We get to see every step of her revenge plot unfold.  Uma makes revenge seem like childs play as she works her way thru her old co-workers.  One of the brightest shining stars in this movie is Chiaki Kuriyama who plays GoGo Yubari.  If ever there was a chick that deserves a video game, it's her.  She is O-ren Ishii's (Lucy Lui) bodyguard.  She is the best thing since fried rice.  She's cute, she's cheeky, and she can kick some major butt.  This is Quentin's best work yet, and a must see film.
B000063DFN|5.0|It's really tough to say which is maiden's best album but powerslave is right up there with &quot;number of the beast&quot; and &quot;seventh son of a seventh son&quot;. If you are starting out with maiden this is definitely your best bet.<br />  The guitar solo in two minutes to midnight is probably one of my favourite maiden solos for the simple reason that it doesn't have too many trills.<br />  Every song on this album is amazing. It doesn't have a single filler. My personal favourites are &quot;aces high&quot;,&quot;two minutes to midnight&quot;,&quot;rime of the ancient marine&quot;r and &quot;back in the village&quot;.<br />  Dickinson's &quot;air raid siren&quot; vocals are at a all time high on &quot;aces high&quot;.<br />  If you wanna know why Iron Maiden is still one of the greatest bands ever in the history of heavy metal, Powerslave is one of the reasons.
B0001HAISG|1.0|I ask myself now: what could really in all honesty be expected of this oft-retold story? Though I find no fault with the Peter Pan story in general, this movie is a big disapointment for several reasons. Firstly, the parts of Wendy and Peter I can only say are annoying, and rendered a little disturbing by the semi-repellent, underlying Pre-teen romance that intrudes itself unceremoniously throughout. Tinkerbell is nothing short of irritating likewise. And Captian Hook is dull. I must admit that though there are some funny scenes and lines, the overall effect of the movie was uninteresting and tedious.     One of my friends spoke highly of this movie, and trusting her taste I did go into the theater with an open mind, however it proved to be just disapointing. I am very fond of the Disney cartoon version, and even \\"Hook\\", with Robin Williams is enjoyable, but this Peter Pan is a little much. They should really stop trying to remake this movie every five years, it's getting very monotonous.
0385510438|1.0|I want to start by saying that I loved The Firm and liked several others of John Grisham's books.  But this book was a huge disappointment.  There was way too much time spent talking about church visits and introducing yet another new undeveloped character.  The middle of the book drags and lacks direction. The best part of the book was the relationship he has with Callie's family.  The nine years that Padgitt spends in jail could have and should have been condensed!
B00011D1OA|4.0|Who did the sound mixing on this commentary track?!!  It is the worst ever!  Sounds like the person has the microphone across the room or is speaking into styrofoam!  Shame on Warner Brothers for putting out such a crappy mix.  The original DVD is much better quality.  The extra features on this are good, but if you want to listen to the commentary, get the original!!!
0385121679|5.0|This book is excellent. Its so unlike his other work ,It builds up slowly to the good part and then, some of the freakiest things start happning. I wont spoil this for you but you have to read this book. Definutly one of stephen kings finest novels. (apart from maybe the dark half uncut).
B00006IM9Q|2.0|After reading people gushing about the remastering job on these tracks, I snapped up the disc.<br />But rather than just cleaning up the tracks for these songs, the producers have altered the basic balance between instruments. It's a subtle business reworking classic songs, and the remastering here doesn't improve the sound. If anything, it muddies some of the guitar-bass dynamic in favor of a more &quot;contemporary&quot; sound and adds unnecessary echoes to Clem Burke's drumming.<br />One element they didn't change is Deborah Harry's singing, but they should have at least raised the volume of her vocals, because with this mix, her voice is relegated to a reedy, background role.<br />Call me a diehard, but I'll stick with the &quot;Best of Blondie&quot; album, warts and all, over this slickified version that changes the basic tenor of the band's sound.<br />I give it two stars only because it is Blondie, and the songs are still great. But that's not an endorsement of the disc, just the artistry that's been needlessly tweaked here.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Reviews of the film are numerous here, so I won't go into plot detail other than to say this is Uma Thurman as the ultimate killing machine killing other people who are almost, but not quite, as good at killing as she is. Kill Bill vol. 1 is the more action oriented of the two volumes, not that vol. 2 isn't without its good share, but vol. 1 is NON STOP ACTION. The final 30 minutes of the film is one big, bloody fight at the House of the Blue Leaves. This is director Quentin Tarantino's homage and entrance into the genre of revenge films. It's also his homage to the Japanese genre of samurai movies, Yakuza gangster films and anime all rolled up into a blood soaked, sword swinging sushi roll. <br />However, I can only recommend putting THIS DVD version of the film in your collection if you're a die-hard \\"gimme my Uma fix now\\" fan that wants to own the US theatrical release version. Director Quentin Tarantino has already put together a re-edited combined version of both volumes for the 2004 Cannes film festival. And Miramax has already let it slip a &quot;special edition&quot; of vol. 1 will likely coincide with the release of vol.2 on DVD. I hope that these future DVDs will include the full color House of Blue Leaves scene Tarantino made for the Japanese and Hong Kong release versions of the film. I've seen both the US and Asian versions and I must say the full color rampage Uma goes on is much more intense than the partial black and white US version. The 20 minute  \\"making of\\" is informative, but you can tell there's a lot more to be said by all involved on this film, and we'll likely see and hear it when the \\"special edition\\" is released.<br />Bottom line: The film gets 5 stars. This extras-bare DVD version gets 2.5 stars.
B000002GVO|1.0|This album has the merit of containing the only worth song of the Eagles: HOtel California.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|What first pulled me into the movie theatre to see this movie was all the big names. A steller cast doesn't aways mean a great movie, but in this case it was.  It was good for it's audience. Some material could have been deleted from the movie (like some of the swearing and the scene between the body doubles) but you have to remember this is English humor. It is funny, but it wouldn't be for a 12 year old.  The different stories are all woven together to make a good movie. Whether or not you decide to own it depends on your own taste, but it is definatly worth seeing once.
B00005B36H|5.0|tool is the type of band that, the louder the volume, the better they are. to make a long and awsome story short- get this cd and turn it up LOUD!
0767836324|4.0|Sure Hook isn't Steven Spielberg's best but it's still a good movie. I think Peter Pan growing up and forgetting his past was a clever idea. If anything is bad about the movie it's the set pieces. The lost boys hide-out and the pirates village all seem like they are obviously a movie set. I think everything looks better in the new Peter Pan. I also didn't think it was necessary for one of the lost boys to get killed by Captain Hook. Critics were still too hard on it though.  It's still fun and imaginative and the actors are great. Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell is surprisingly the best casting in the movie though. Bob Hoskins makes a good Smee as well. Dustin Hoffman is really good as Hook but he's not very scary. I think Jason Isaacs made a better one in the new version of Peter Pan. Hook, I just think has minor flaws but not enough to call it a bad movie. It still deserves a fair chance.
B00006V9A0|4.0|Nirvana didnt ruin rock and roll, MTV did i agree with you, todays version of rock and roll isnt the same as the classical rock from the 60's 70's and some of the 80's but it wasnt nirvana at all, nirvana could even be considered a classic, at least to me they are, linkin park isnt that bad but i wouldnt call what they are singing rock and roll, i think it would be nice if we saw some more people like Led Zeppelin, Kiss, Pink Floyd, Bachman Turner Overdrive, ZZ Top...just some of the greatest rockers we know, overall this cd is pretty good....<br />ohh, and 1 more thing, im only 13 and i can tell you all of this because i lived throughout the 70's, not in person but in spirit i could tell you most of the things that happened, adn the 70's never died and never will some of the longest bands that ever stayed together were all ROCKERS!
0385504209|4.0|The Da Vinci Code follows the model that Dan Brown set in Angels and Demons.  Robert Langdon, ostensibly a symbologist, visits Paris, where he is dragged into the investigation of a killing - not as a consultant, but as a suspect.  In the Louvre lies the body of a famous curator, with Langdon's name beside the body.  The sudden appearance of the curator's daughter triggers the opening glimpses of a plot nearly 2,000 years old and Langdon finds himself fleeing for his life across Europe with the beautiful Sophia.<br />As the story deepens we discover that Sauniere's death was the opening salvo in a renewed conflict between the Priory of Sion and the Catholic Church.  The target is the grail and its unlimited power.  Typical of a Brown story, the plot unfolds frantically of a short time window (no one every sleeps in Dan Brown novel).  Be prepared for a short course in the alternative history of Christianity and the forces around it.<br />Brown creates the basis of his plot out of all the paranoid plots of the ancient world, as well as drawing heavily on some of the Catholic Church's less salient moments.  I wouldn't say that the book is totally anti-Church, but a very grim picture is painted of both the origins of modern Christianity in the Council of Nicaea, and the present day Opus Dei movement.  To say that this is controversial is to understate the point.<br />Despite Brown's tendency to be overly didactic (everything gets explained in excruciating detail), the book is much better written than its predecessor.  Adventure/suspense stories are rarely stages for much character development, and this is no exception.  But in terms of a continuous flow of action and an intricate plot with countless twists, the book is quite readable.<br />Keep in mind that Brown has woven this story out of an unlimited number of legends and half-truths.  In other words, don't take it seriously or mistake the book for an attempt to defame the religious.  Don't make it any more real than it actually is.han it actually is.
B00005JLRT|2.0|Continuity is abused and The Wrath of Khan is ripped off in the ten installment of the Star Trek movie franchise. There are a few good lines of dialogue but it's probably best avoided altogether.
B00000K3CK|5.0|1947's \\"Miracle On 34th Street\\", starring the great Maureen O'Hara and Edmund Gwenn, is a motion picture that can be watched over and over again without losing one bit of its original flavor.  And its flavor is quite tasty, in my opinion!<br /><br />A very spunky 8-year-old Natalie Wood helps to make this movie an even bigger treat.  Natalie shows an acting talent in this film that belies her tender age. She gives one of the best performances by a child actor in a film I've ever come across.  \\"34th Street\\" was Natalie's 4th screen appearance, in a successful career that would eventually span 52 films before her sudden and tragic death at the age of only 43.<br /><br />Miss Wood seems well-suited for her good-sized role as \\"Susan Walker\\" in this movie. She blends perfectly with the other actors, and her scenes with Gwenn (who, of course, plays the part of \\"Kris Kringle\\" to utter perfection) are highly memorable.<br /><br />Could the studio have possibly found a better choice for the part of \\"Kris\\" (Santa) in this motion picture?  Well, perhaps.  But ONLY if the REAL Santa Claus were to have taken a break from his duties at the North Poll and played the part himself.  Oh...wait...Gwenn turns out to BE the REAL Santa, doesn't he? LOL! :)<br /><br />Yes, Edmund Gwenn actually DOES become \\"Santa Claus\\" for the 97-minute running time of this movie. He's *that* believable in the role. Gwenn was so good here that he won an Oscar for his memorable performance (Best Supporting Actor).<br /><br />This is a perfect movie to show your children. It must be a lot of fun watching a child's reaction to seeing Mr. Gwenn's very realistic portrayal of the portly fur-clad Christmas-time gift-giver. To a child that still does believe that Mr. Claus visits his or her house every December 24, this movie must be quite an eye-opener.<br /><br />This 20th-Century Fox DVD version of \\"Miracle On 34th Street\\" brings us the film in its intended (original) screen ratio of 1.33:1 (Full Frame); and the picture looks just dandy!  The film, which was shot in \\"glorious black-and-white\\", exhibits outstanding clarity on this DVD. I can't spot a bit of grain or \\"noise\\". An absolutely beautiful digital transfer. Especially considering the age of this flick.<br /><br />The audio comes via an English Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono soundtrack. The audio comes across nice and clean, with just a small amount of background \\"hiss\\" present. There's also a foreign-language track here, too (French). This French track (which is also 2.0 DD Mono) sounds a bit on the \\"muffled\\" side. Not nearly as clear-sounding as the English track.  There are subtitles in English and Spanish.<br /><br />There's not a whole lot to talk about in the way of \\"Special Features\\" for this DVD release. But there is the Original Theatrical Trailer and a short \\"TV Spot\\" advertising the movie (which is a bonus *not* shown on the DVD's packaging).  Plus: there's also a small text-only area on the disc, featuring \\"Cast Credits\\".<br /><br />I *must* say, however, even though we don't get many bonus extras with this title, I'm very pleased that the Trailer is included.  This Theatrical Trailer is one of the very best, and most innovative, I think I've ever witnessed. It's a relatively-lengthy trailer, which features a studio executive bumping into multiple actors while on the FOX movie lot. He asks several of these actors what they thought of the just-released picture, \\"Miracle On 34th Street\\". And what he receives in return (naturally) are glowing reviews for the film.<br /><br />It's a very well-done trailer, and doesn't seem overly \\"hokey\\" or staged. And it's very fun to see stars the likes of Rex Harrison and Anne Baxter pop up here, promoting \\"34th Street\\".  Harrison even speaks briefly in this trailer of his then-current work on \\"The Ghost And Mrs. Muir\\", which, ironically, also featured young Miss Natalie Wood as one of Rex's co-stars.  This trailer is a real treat. And it's in remarkably good shape too. Very good video quality. The audio for the trailer is in DD 2.0 Mono, and sounds just fine.<br /><br />Menus .... I like a good (and simple) Menu design.  And this disc has just that. The Main Menu is a \\"static\\" one, with separate links to other Sub-Menus (such as Language Selection, Chapter Listing, and Supplements). When you select any of these three items, you'll be treated to a very short (but fun and well-designed) animated transition, which then dissolves into the chosen sub-menu screen.  These short \\"transitions\\" are all slightly different, with each one featuring a Christmas tune playing as \\"background\\" music as the screen fades from the Main Menu to your desired selection.  This themed music seems as though it's being played over a Department Store's P.A. system (which is appropriate for this DVD, since we often hear the soft playing of Christmas tunes during the \\"Macy's\\" scenes in the film). One menu transition also features a \\"snowflakes falling\\" visual effect, along with the music. Very cleverly done, IMO.<br /><br />Additional Disc Information for this title ..............................<br /><br />>> Enclosures? .... Yes. There is one here. A one-page Chapter List insert is included (21 chapters), with an excellent promo picture of actors Maureen O'Hara, Natalie Wood, and John Payne on one side; and on the \\"Chapter\\" side, an image of \\"Kris\\" (Mr. Gwenn).  I particularly like the fact that FOX Home Entertainment used a different picture for the insert than what we see on the front cover (normally on DVDs, the two pictures are identical).  I might also add, in case one or two picky people might be interested in such trivial matters, that this insert is made out of better-quality (thicker) paper than what we usually see for such paper enclosures.<br /><br />>> Region? .... This is a \\"Region 1\\" (NTSC) disc. Single-sided.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />\\"Miracle On 34th Street\\" is one of those films that deserves to be seen more than once, and not only in the month of December either (IMO).  It holds up very well even in the summer months.  And this clear-as-a-bell DVD from FOX Home Entertainment makes viewing this 1947 classic an even more enjoyable experience -- no matter if it's in December, March, or August.st fine.    Menus ....

A one-page Chapter List insert is included (21 chapters), with an excellent promo picture of actors Maureen O'Hara, Natalie Wood, and John Payne on one side; and on the \\"Chapter\\" side, an image of \\"Kris\\" (Mr. Gwenn).  I particularly like the fact that FOX Home Entertainment used a different picture for the insert than what we see on the front cover (normally on DVDs, the two pictures are identical).  I might also add, in case one or two picky people might be interested in such trivial matters, that this insert is made out of better-quality (thicker) paper than what we usually see for such paper enclosures.    >> Region? .... This is a \\"Region 1\\" (NTSC) disc. Single-sided.    ----------    \\"Miracle On 34th Street\\" is one of those films that deserves to be seen more than once, and not only in the month of December either (IMO).  It holds up very well even in the summer months.  And this clear-as-a-bell DVD from FOX Home Entertainment makes viewing this 1947 classic an even more enjoyable experience -- no matter if it's in December, March, or August.
B0000256RB|5.0|Arjen Anthony Lucassen's third Ayreon creation is a conglomeration of multiple music and singing styles.  His multi-faceted story is both fantastic and unbelivable.<br />If his work continues to be offered to us at this level, I will alway be there to purchase his next creation.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|Watching this is equivalent to being served my own excrement on a dinner plate. Cold. And a few days old.
B000089RVX|5.0|I only bought this CD so I could hear My Immortal.  I didn't think I would like any of the other songs because I'm not a hard rock/goth kind of girl. <br />I was totally wrong.<br />Evanescence has introduced me to a genre of music that I will forever love.  I like this CD so much that I don't think I've listened to another one of my many albums since buying this.<br />Here are the songs in the order I like them from best to worst(I like all of them, but some more than others!!)<br />My Immortal(Remix): This version of the song doesn't come on every CD.  But I am so thankful it came on mine!  Even after hearing this song at least twice a day on the radio I am still not sick of it because it is one of my favorite songs EVER!<br />My Immortal: This version is very pretty, still not as good as the remix though.  I do think the strings add a very nice touch to the small musical interlude in the middle.<br />Hello: Alot of people think this song is depressing and dark.  It is very emotional, it was written by Amy for her sister.  I think it is a very lovely song.  This song proves just how impressive Amy's voice can get.<br />Taking Over Me- Alot of people don't like this song, but I do.  I think it's a very nice song about love.  The piano at the beggining misled me a little- I thought it was going to be a slow song, but it turned out to be faster.<br />Whisper- This song IS a bit overdone, but it is still a perfect song.  The only part I don't like is the choir at the end.  It's very weird- they speak some latin, and if you go to a lyrics site you can get what they're saying.<br />Haunted- Some people don't like this song, either, but I think it's very creative.  The beggining is a little weird, but the rest is cool.  I especially like the guiatar.  Impressive!<br />Everybody's Fool- This song totally rocks!  And it speaks the truth.  There are some people out there who just lie.  I can't wait to see the video- still yet to view!  It looks awesome though!<br />Going Under- This song is pretty hard.  I think it's a good single and if you don't like it at first you should get used to it- I had to give it time before I started liking it.<br />Tourniquet- Everyone really likes this song but it just isn't my favorite.  It is a good song- yes- but it's just not the best on here.  I like the verses alot, but it kind of drags on a little.<br />Imaginary- This is an interesting song about ones imagination.  The lyrics are very cool.  The tune- well- that's the reason it's placed so low on my list.<br />Bring Me To Life- This is my least favorite single, even though I like it alot.  I guess it's just worn out.  They play it every day on the radio (I don't see why I dislike it more than My Immortal though, since I said the same thing about that- I guess My Immortal bears beauty).<br />My Last Breath- Oh well.  At least I tried.<br />Don't say this band is overrated or average until you've heard for yourself.  The only problem I have with the band is that the album focuses mainly on pain and death and that's kind of bad.  There are only 2 slow songs on the whole album and that made me kind of mad too.  But still great nevertheless.<br />Other bands I reccomend: No Doubt, Good Charlotte, Simple Plan
B0000696I1|2.0|How can anyone say this movie is -good-? The animatronics were horrible...the turtles looked nowhere as realistic as the suits in the second and first movies. Splinter looked the worst of all...and check out the object interaction with him and the window at the beginning after Raphael has a temper tantrum. He moves his hands with the window to slide it down, but they don't actually *touch* the window. Since -when- did he learn telekinetesis? O_o Anyhoo. The script totally reeks. Come on, time travel? That's a bit farfetched, even by a standard TMNT comic plot, and something was just a bit offsetting about seeing Raphael flying kites and cooling his temper down like that. The only reason I gave this two stars was: THEY BROUGHT CASEY JONES BACK! He was one of the best characters, and even though he isn't in it much (bah, forget that character that's supposed to somehow *coincidentally* look like Casey in the movie.), Elias Koteas does a great job. Other than that and the nice sceneries, the movie stinks worse than a sewer on a hot day.
B00006RINF|5.0|how can people say that this group is an evanescence wannabe when lacuna coil has been around longer anyways this album kicks ass i love it evrey song has that creepy sound and the volcals are angelic the the guitar riffs are awsome this is death metal i dont care what any body says the good songs are well all of them
B00013EY7Q|4.0|The rating for this movie rests on the above question, as numerous reviewers here have pointed out.  If you answer in the affirmative, taking his mostly improvised performance of a somewhat bored and successful married middle-age actor doing a liquor promotion in Japan seriously, then you have to give this movie at least 4 stars, maybe 5. It is understandable that some would not like its impressionistic quality. As a travelogue and comedy of manners in the urban metropolis of Tokyo, you have to be impressed with the cinematography which covers a lot of territory, both exterior and interior. The shots of historic Japan are particularly lovely. And as a platonic love story between two lonely and really somewhat ordinary, intelligent Americans (despite the fact that one is a famous actor and the other a Yale graduate) lost in the modern concrete jungle,and trying to enjoy each other's company if only for a brief weekend while their spouses are away  in the city's many bars, video game parlours,restaurants,karaoke and other haunts of nightlife, the story works just as well. There are good reasons for this relationship to work,age difference being one of the main ones, and we are shown its development in some detail. I have watched this movie twice and was more impressed with the second viewing. I think the impressionistic and understated beauty of this film puts it probably on a par with \\"Master and Commander\\". I wish I could have such a rollicking good time in a foreign land as this couple apparently did.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|I'm a Dylan fan. In Dylan's &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; album he mentions Neil on the last song &quot;Highlands.&quot; So, I bought some of Neil's early stuff: &quot;Rust&quot; -- &quot;Harvest&quot; -- not much reaction. I was walking at the mall and picked this up awhile back. I was shocked to find a DVD in with it (I didn't look that close when I bought it and it didn't cost more than normal). The DVD is full length acoustic style and the album is the same songs electric. I love them both -- it's a bargain, it's a great story, the songs hold their own independently! I just can't stop watching the DVD! And I just can't stop listening to the CD! This is great!
6302293553|5.0|Monty Python has always been funny. In this film they're at their laugh-out-loud best!<br />This is the \\"grand tale\\" of King Arthur and his knights as they quest for the Holy Grail. Watch as King Arthur faces the Black Knight (\\"All right, we'll call it a draw\\") and the stupid French soldier (\\"I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelled of elderberries!\\"). Laugh as the knights battle the Killer Rabbit (\\"Run away! Run away!\\") and buy a shrubbery to save themselves from the dreaded Knights Who Say Nee. And gasp for air as they face the Bridgekeeper and Sir Lancelot kills... the wedding guests!<br />This is a slapstick comedy that will keep you laughing for an eternity. It's worth every penny!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This movie stank and it stank out loud.
B00000K0DQ|4.0|The movie Death Man Walking is definitely worth to be seen. Overall the movie presents a neutral point of view by dealing with both sides, the victim's and the murderer's one. The movie has not been made to convince people to switch sides, whether they are pro or contra death penalty, but it makes you thoughtful about your own opinion.
B000070IXT|5.0|i have both versions, i dont knowhow i ended up with the regular one, but i put them to the test and man can you tell/see a BIG differance.all of the colors are more vivid, the shadow detail is amazing, you can see the texure on th wall in the dark manson.Superbit is winning me over by a landslide, i wish everything was on that version but, i think it is only put out by tri-star pictuers, so that sux!!!just go and buy this movie, and The Fifth Element, the color detail in that is awestrucking!!!
B00008ADPF|1.0|listening to a Nickelback cd is not unlike having a maniac dismember you with a rusty, dull blade. It is a horrifying, brutal experience and the best part is when it is over. Shame on anyone who likes this band.
B000000OQF|5.0|one of the best albums ever, and definitely the best GnR album. every track is brimming with raw musical appeal. First CD i ever owned (got my first job just to buy this album lol) and will always be one of my personal favorites. If you havent listened to this whole album, you either were in a cave in the late 80s, or you werent born yet =) give it a try
0767827716|1.0|It looks like I might be in the minority on this one, but here goes...  &quot;Christine&quot; sucks.  It sucks hard.  It sucks on toast.<br />Maybe it was scary when it first came out.  But it does NOT hold up well.  I remember watching it as a wee lad and thinking it was cool.  But I also remember not being scared by it at all.  The mere concept wasn't scary to me.  I knew that cars can't come to life with no one behind the wheel and run over fat bullies named Moochie.  A car that runs by itself?  Kinda cool, but not the stuff of MY nightmares.  That's fatal flaw #1.<br />But wait, there's more!  The acting is atrocious.  The dialogue is weak.  The plot thuds along.  By the time the head bully gets run over, it's so anti-climactic it's as if the movie itself gave up trying to scare us, or even impress us in any way with any sort of flair or visual style.<br />Carpenter fans will slap their heads in disbelief.  King fans will projectile-vomit.  But I guess Keith Gordon fans, if there are any, will enjoy themselves.  And if you want to see a really cool car, this movie will hold your attention for a few minutes.  But otherwise, stay away from this big, smelly turd of a movie.  It easily competes with &quot;Maximum Overdrive&quot; as the worst King adaptation EVER.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Lost in Translation was a waste of talent, time and money.  The plot (what plot?) is horrible.  For intellectual stimulation this is not the movie to see.
0880389052|5.0|Wow! Bob outdid himself once again. What a great book. It's amazing how you can get sucked in and understand Drizzt's situation. The infamous horrors of Menzoberranzan are revealed and horribly detailed. Drizzt has to live through all this... <BR>I'm amazed how one with his special attitude survived the horrors of the underdark.<br />Very emotional book. Best read of Salvatore yet!
B00008H2LB|5.0|to all you slipknot-loving, mudvayne-moshing, metallica-blasting lifeless stoners out there, i have a message. You can listen to your 20-minute boring solos, you can memorize every satanic lyric and go worship the devil in your little lucifer shrine, and sell your soul for front-row tickets to get spit on by a 40-year old screamer band, but leave linkin park alone. They have something all other &quot;metal&quot; bands don't have. Emotion. Emotion you can relate to. And Meteora is a triumph in rock history that everyone can enjoy. Im sick of all you screamer-rebels insulting something you don't understand. So go back to your mom's basement and put on 100 dollar headphones and head-bang quietly to yourself while wallowing in your own depressing life-style. You will never make anything of yourselves except for manager of a liquor store, because linkin park is better than you ever will be.
B00003CXHJ|1.0|Firstly, I should like to pay tribute to the crew of HMS Bulldog, the British Navy vessel who actually did perform the heroic deeds portrayed in this insulting film. When Enigma really was captured, America hadn't even been forced into the war yet. Britain and her allies, on the other hand, had been fighting since the summer of 1939. I find it worrying when history is revised in this way. It happened with Pearl Harbour, Saving Private Ryan and The Patriot too. When and where does Hollywood/America stop? Your own history is sufficiently full of stirring deeds to make this theft of heroism unnecessary. In answer to those who have stated that us 'Limeys' need to lighten-up and the film is purely entertainment, I feel I have to disagree. It's naive to adopt this POV when one realises the well-documented effect of Cinema on society. Great Britain and a few staunch allies stood alone for almost 3 years before the Japanese attack on Pearl forced the US into the war. We too, fought on more than one front. North Africa and the Far East, for the benefit of the earlier critic who mentioned that the US Navy was fighting in two oceans as opposed to only one. As for the tiny sop at the end of the credits, well I ask you, who reads the credits? The damage has already been done. So, what comes next, one wonders? America triumphs at El Alamein? The USAF wins the Battle Of Britain? Oh, sorry, I forgot . . . Just read that's already happening, in a new film starring Tom Cruise!
B0000A98ZP|4.0|Another great film produced by John Hughes. The Breakfast club was released in 1985 but is still a classic today. This film is about five very different high school students from 5 very different crowds who all end up in detention together. Each of these students is played by well known actors like Molly Ringlwald, Emilio Estevez and Judd Nelson. Through the courses of the movie, not only do the students learn something about one another and learn to ignore the usual social barriers that contain them, they each also learn something very important about themselves. This movie has excellent acting, storyline and script. I'd recommend The Breakfast Club to both highschoolers and college students alike. Four stars.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|This CD is amazing, I seen the video for One Armed Scissor on MtvX back when there was such a thing. I really didn't care for it, and then I kept hearing it on the radio and It grew on me, so I decided to get the CD. I was glad I did, the CD is just greatness. There is nothing bad to say about any of these songs. If you like At The Drive In, pick up the Mars Volta CD. Mars Volta and At The Drive In are almost one in the same. Mars Volta only has different beats in the back and kind of has a techno feel.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I am a big fan of Smallville.  This is a great show if you are an action guy, but there are some comedy, and romance.  If I was you, I would get this. No question asked.
B000003TAR|4.0|In Utero is really good, the songs are very catchy and get stuck in your head easily. The CD is just not worthy or 5 stars, the lyrics are just so random and lacking. And why at the end of the songs does he have to repeat things over and over again. The songs just kind of get to you a little after a while. The best songs on this CD are: Heart Shped Box, Rape Me, All Apologies, Dumb, and Pennyroyal Tea. The rest of the songs are just so-so.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is Britney's best Cd to date. Although some of the songs aren't great, it still is a good cd.<br />1. Me Against the Music (7/10) When I first heard this song, I liked it, until I heard the album. It's an OK song, but not a good first single.<br />2. (I Got That) Boom Boom (8/10) This is a different style of music from Britney. Although I really don't like the rapping, it is a good song. Could possibly be a single.<br />3. Showdown (7/10) Loved this song when I first heard it, but after a while, it's just ok.<br />4. Breathe On Me (8/10) At first, I did not like this song, but after listening to it for a while, I changed my mind.<br />5. Early Mornin' (4/10) This is the worst song on the album. Don't really care for the beat or lyrics<br />6. Toxic (10/10) Another song I did not like at first. But ended up loving this song. Great beat &amp; lyrics. Wonderful video.<br />7. Outrageous (7/10) This is an Ok song. I like the beat of the song. <br />8. Touch of My Hand (10/10) Loved this song. I would like it to be a single, but more than likely it won't. Great Song<br />9. Hook Up (8/10) Different sound for Britney. Good Beat.<br />10. Shadow (7/10) Ok ballad. Nothing really great.<br />11. Brave New Girl (7/10) The rapping part is ok, but sounds like it could've gone on one of her older albums.<br />12. Everytime (9/10) Great ballad song. Has a fantastic piano beat. Great lyrics.<br />13. Me Against the Music remix (8/10) Liked the remix better than the original<br />I also have heard 2 other songs that weren't released in the US:<BR>The Answer (9/10) Great song, should have been on record instead on Early Mornin'.<br />Don't Hang Up (7/10) Good song. Nice beat. <BR>Overall, this is a fun album. 8/10
B0000027RL|5.0|This CD is truly amazing. Ten is just great. It has most of Peal Jam's most important songs to their career. The first 6 songs of the CD they released, they are also the best songs on the CD. Once, Even Flow, Alive, Why Go, Black, and Jeremy. Jeremy is one of their most controversial songs and one of their most meaningful. This CD is a good CD to listen to when you are bored and just want to space out for a while. Just let this CD take you away. This CD is a staple of 90's music, and will always hold it's place in music history.
B00000DG1R|1.0|Ew A Compilation from Turdran Turdran. Could there be anything worse than this? Not Likely. This \\"Group\\" or whatever you want to call them was one of the first MTV \\"creations\\" that the pop world has endured. Hungry Like A Wolf was a surprise hit...and one of their few. It's the only popular song they have on 80s pop radio these days. So,just listen to your local pop station.....they'll appear on there...right after Britney Spears. Gag.
B000002NFM|5.0|If this CD does not get you moving you are dead. This CD basically has all of Prodigy's best and most well known songs on it. The CD is truly amazing! A little lacking with lyrics, but really good strong beats. Play this CD on a system with good bass and you will be in bliss. This CD is almost like a greatest hits of Prodigy.
B000002UUX|5.0|what an album, i have to admit though, when i first got into megadeth i didnt particularly like Dave Mustaine's voice, but its something that grows on you i guess, it takes egtting used to.<BR>heres my thoughts on the tracks<br />1.Holy wars...the punishment due: one of the best on the cd, and one of megadeths finest. it has lots of different parts to it. i thought the little classical guitar bit in the middle was a nice touch and the solo at the end was amazing 5/5<br />2.Hangar 18: Another amazing song, i find that this is most people's favourite track on the cd. All the solos are cool and the singing etc, i just dont like the chorus particularly it isnt really catchy, but thats just my opinion, its still another one of megadeth's best. 5/5<br />3. Take No Prisoners: How could you not like this song? Brutal, heavy, agressive, another excellent stand out track on this incredible album. 5/5<br />4. Five magics: I would have to say this song is another of my favourites on this cd (there are so many!) but i find nobody shares my opinion on this song. i find it to be extremely underrated. From the cool basslines in it, and all the cool solos and the bit at thye end where Dave says a line and it is repeated by this satanic voice this songs is pure genius. 5/5<br />5. Poison was the Cure: This one isnt one of my favourites but its still good. Really fast and wild soloing at the end. 4/5<br />6.Lucretia: the main riff sounded a bit too happy for me and didnt really fit in with the rest of tyhe song but who cares this is still a good heavy song with good vocals and  guitar solos. 4.5/5<br />7.Tornado of Souls: Another one of my favourites, it has everything, fast heavy verses and a really catchy chorus. This song'll get stuck in your head really quickly. 5/5<br />8.Dawn Patrol: a short slow little song with just a bassline and drums accompanyed by Dave sort of mumbling. This song took a while to grow on me but in the end its just a 2 minute filler but is worth listening toand its probably as good thing they didnt make it any longer beacause the bassline doesnt change much and Marty must of been on his coffee break. 3.5/5<br />9.Rust in Peace...Polaris: hmmm, well i guess this song's still growing on me because i dont really like it as much as everyone else seems to. maybe its just me. Like holy wars.. it has different parts to it, and at some points you'd think it was two different songs. Still a good solid song. 4/5<br />Overall a great album that should be in any metalhead's cd collection. Definately worth every one of those 5 stars, if not more.
038073186X|5.0|Another amazing book by Dennis Lehane.<br />Truly a stunner, Shutter Island sucks you in and won't release you until you've read it's shocking conclusion.<br />It's a disorienting, disturbing, utterly absorbing, and rewarding experience, every bit as powerful as Mystic River, but in an entirely different way.<br />Buy it, read it, enjoy it, pray you can recover from it.
B000002HMH|4.0|i can't believe some of the stuff im reading in these reviews for load! It isn't nearly as bad as some people make it out to be. although i onli like a little more than half the songs on it, it's still a good album. <BR>it definately can't be compared to the early metallica who made such powerful metal songs like blackened or master of puppets, but this album definately has its highlights, namely, Until it Sleeps, king Nothing, Hero of the Day, Bleeding Me, Outlaw Torn, actually the 1st 7 songs and the closing track the outlaw torn seems to be the ones to listen to.<BR>Don't get me wrong, im a metalhead who'll listen to all sorts of metal from the great iron maiden, Megadeth or Slayer, to slipknot, sepultura or guns n roses and Led Zeppelin (all though the last 2 arent really metal, just damn good). <BR>now to all those narrow minded metal heads that say Metallica's 'sold out', they havnt. They started exploring different styles of music strting with the black album, then they changed their style again with load and reload. <BR>Also, after listening to Saint Anger, i have to admit it was not an album to be proud of, but how can you call making a loud heavy album like that selling out? Selling out would be making an album full of Enter Sandmans(which by the way is an excellent song) or other radio-friendly tunes.<BR>On the last track in saint angerby the end of it james is saying 'kill kill kill kill kill!' as dumb as that sounds, you could never call htat selling out.<BR>Although i prefered the complex some writing styles and lyrics to the earlkier albums,on load james's lyrics become more personal, deep and meaningful.<BR>In conclusion, if you are a huge fan of metallica's early stuff, chances are you won't like this, but if you are a metal head with an open mind, a die-hard metallica fan or just appreciate good music, then you should check this album out.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|well i u sed to think Godsmack reakky sucked. but when i saw them opening for metallica, i said &quot;THese guys f***n' rock!! i went and directly bought this cd. its a great cd . very heavy and loud. i recommend it cuz it simply rocks with all the great guitar work and ver y loud-*ss vocals. JUST BUY IT.
B000066NW0|5.0|lets go thru the gr8 trax of let go!!!! <br />1. My World - gr8 opening song. 9/10<BR>2. Anything But Ordinary - another gr8 song. 9/10<BR>3.

B00009L1UP|2.0|Back in the early 90s all my friends worshipped this album. So, what the heck, yesterday I decided to get this remaster/bonus edition. I realized why all my friends worshipped the album--because they were all 16 years old at the time.<br />Sadly, I'm no longer 16, nor is my musical taste. I'm no longer impressed with big snare reverbs, cadence chords and thumping 1-note bass lines. This has been called Queensryche's &quot;commercial&quot; album; the liner notes talk about the &quot;accessibility&quot; and MTV-ish-ness of Empire in contrast with the raw complexity of prior albums, as if to say &quot;Sucker! You should've bought Operation: Mindcrime instead!&quot;<br />Remastering: I find it absurd that record companies are all rushing to remaster/reissue albums that were digitally recorded in the first place (like this one)! Save yourself. The original mastering was fine.<br />Bonus Tracks: &quot;Last Time in Paris&quot; is good and has a lot of driving energy. The bonus remake of &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot; is a bit melodramatic but interesting. The 3rd bonus track is entirely forgettable.
B0000CAQ27|2.0|pink, Y r u a rockchick now like da rest of them??? I LOVED missundaztood, but this aint as gd. i mean, its ok, but not in the same league as missundaztood.

B000089RVX|5.0|A lot of people have had very different opinions of Evanescence. Some call them posers, others call them amzingly talented. This is what I think: they aren't posers, but they aren't geniuses. Despite this (and it's not a bad thing) Fallen is a very promising debut.<BR>The album kicks off with &quot;Going Under.&quot; This is one of the album's strongest tracks. Amy Lee shows off her excellent and classical-style vocals in this one.<BR>Following that song is &quot;Bring Me To Life,&quot; the one we've all heard. Even if it was terribly overplayed, you can't say that it's not a good song. It was the song that began it all for the group.<BR>&quot;Everybody's Fool&quot; is 3rd on the CD. This song has just been released to radio. Hopefully it will be a hit with listeners, because it too is a very strong track.<BR>&quot;My Immortal&quot; has become the group's biggest hit. It's a great ballad. When I bought the CD in December, it was this song that got my attention. I prefer the version with the piano over the blazing guitar solo. It's much more personal. The song was also recently showcased in the series finale promos of Friends.<BR>&quot;Haunted&quot; is one of the best songs on the album. Many people are indifferent to the track, but I think it's excellent. Evanescence is one of the rare groups that can utilize a religious choir to make a song perfect, and this is a near-perfect song.<BR>After these 5 songs we reach a song which left many asking questions. &quot;Tourniquet&quot; makes blatant references to God and religion. As an atheist, I don't care, but this led many to view Evanescence as a religious band, something that is very obviously not true. Either way, it's another good song.<BR>&quot;Imaginary&quot; is another song that had many listeners scratching their heads. References to paper flowers and such fit the title, but the song is very strange and hard to listen to. It still makes for an...interesting listen.<BR>&quot;Taking Over Me&quot; follows next. I don't know, but I don't really seem to listen to this one. I'm not sure. It's not a bad song, I just think it's lost in the first 5 songs, which are excellent songs. <BR>&quot;Hello&quot; is another interesting one. However, I don't listen to this one much either. Like the track before it, &quot;Hello&quot; is lost in the CD.<BR>&quot;My Last Breath&quot; is another good one that brings us back to the first 5 songs that are the backbone of this CD. It's excellent.<BR>The last song on the album, &quot;Whisper,&quot; is easily the best song on the entire CD. The 5:30 masterpiece is so powerful and organic that you are lost in it. Amy Lee displays her amazing vocals here, complete with a choir that seems right out of hell itself. This song whould be released as a single.<BR>All in all, Evanescense has a very &quot;epic&quot; style to their music. It's a 'love it or leave it' kind of band, where people hate it or they can't get enough of it. I'd count myself in the latter. If you don't have the CD, buy it. 5 million other people already have...
B00006L7XQ|5.0|There are only three true American music forms: country, jazz, and gospel. No one best exemplifies the first of the three than the late Johnny Cash. Although I was most familiar with his 60's and 70's hits, it had been some time since I paid attention the music of the man in black.<br />It wasn't until this year, while watching an episode of the WB's &quot;Smallville&quot; that I was reintroduced to Cash. On one particular installment, Cash's &quot;Hurt&quot; was played. I was blown away by the poignancy of the singer's performance, knowing that he had lost the love of his life: wife June Carter.<br />I had to have the entire album.<br />Cash sounds like a man that has seen it all, the good and the bad, the highs and the lows, and is still standing. Unfortunately, his own demise was a few months away when he made the recording.<br />But, if this was to be his &quot;last hurrah&quot;, he came out triumphantly. Taking a stab at popular favorites (&quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water,&quot; &quot;First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,&quot; &quot;In My Life,&quot; &quot;Danny Boy,&quot; &quot;I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry&quot;), the singer infuses new life into them, as only Cash could. Dusting off his spurs, Cash magnificently takes on some true country and WESTERN with &quot;Desperado,&quot; &quot;Sam Hall,&quot; and &quot;Streets of Laredo&quot;.<br />My favorite is &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; and after one listening, you'll understand why.<br />Cash must've held back the tears as he sang &quot;We'll Meet Again,&quot; the last cut on a triumphant disc. This one is, without a doubt, one of his finest performances, a testament to his unbending love for his wife.<br />This is a disc that is worth the accolades that have been bestowed upon it
B00008BRBG|5.0|I was introduced to The Police the same way that most everyone was: through their later work, namely \\"Every Breath You Take\\" and \\"Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic\\".  When I was in fifth grade, having heard a few of their songs, I purchased their first album: OUTLANDOS D'AMOUR.  I did not like it. <br /> <br />Gone was the dreamy lyrics and vocals by Sting.  Gone was the distinctive guitar work by Andy Summers.  Gone was the unpredictable drumming of Stewart Copeland.  This sounded like a punk rock band.  At that time, I considered that to be a bad thing.  Years later, I have come to appreciate punk rock - and this album.  It took a few listens - well, many, actually - but I have finally come to appreciate The Police's 1978 debut.  You see, if you really give it a chance, OUTLANDOS D'AMOUR is an excellent album.   <br /> <br />For one thing, it has three of The Police's finest songs: \\"So Lonely\\", the classic \\"Roxanne\\", and \\"Can't Stand Losing You\\".  The biggest problem with OUTLANDOS D'AMOUR is that the band sounds amateurish, as though it's trying to imitate the greats and failing.  The reason that those three songs are so wonderful is that on those songs, the group lets it all flow.  They do their own thing, completely ignoring what was hot at the time. <br /> <br />That's not to say that the rest of the material is filler.  Hardly.  The fast-paced opener, \\"Next To You\\", is an excellent song, one of The Police's best early recordings.  \\"Hole In My Life\\" features a great guitar part and heavy drumming, topped off by great singing from Sting; it's arguably one of the group's best songs.  \\"Truth Hits Everybody\\" is another fine early recording from the band.  The nostalgic feeling of \\"Born in the 50's\\" makes it worth noting.  Andy Summers' \\"Be My Girl-Sally\\" may have been a little too much for audiences in the late-70s to handle, but it's a very fun song, thanks largely to Summers' zany vocals.  The album closer, \\"Masoko Tanga\\", gives a taste of what was to come onfuture albums from The Police. <br /> <br />Though it does feel a tad amateurish, OUTLANDOS D'AMOUR is an excellent and underrated debut.  Sting's vocals are some of the best and worst of his career.  Stewart Copeland's drumming is strong and inventive, but nowhere near as impressive as what would come later in his career.  Andy Summers' guitar is probably the highlight of the album, particularly on tracks like \\"So Lonely\\", \\"Hole In My Life\\" and \\"Truth Hits Everybody\\".  On OUTLANDOS, the group was trying to fit in.  They hadn't yet realized that in doing the opposite - going their own way, doing their own thing - they would become one of the greatest bands of all time.  For someone looking to try something new, I would recommend this album; needless to say, for Police fans, it's essential, if only for the three singles. <br /> <br />TRACK HIGHLIGHTS: \\"Next To You\\", \\"So Lonely\\", \\"Roxanne\\", \\"Hole In My Life\\", \\"Can't Stand Losing You\\", \\"Truth Hits Everybody\\"
B00005U8EM|5.0|And they are transformational ones too.  Phil Connors is an egotistic, sarcastic prima donna weatherman for Pittsburgh station WPBH who's sent with producer Rita and cameraman Larry to cover the Groundhog Day celebration in Punxsutawney.  There's no love lost between the trio, as Rita and Chris don't care too much for their conceited colleague.  And yep, it's six more weeks of winter according to Punxsutawney Phil, the groundhog. Unfortunately, a blizzard that he did not foretell in his own forecast makes chances for departure back to Pittsburgh 0%.  The next day, at 6:00 AM, it's no... not 3 February, but Groundhog Day once again!  Connors becomes stuck in a weird timewarp where everyday is Groundhog Day.  Nothing can happen to him, and every day starts anew for the folksy people of Punxsutawney, but he remembers everything else that happened the day before.<br />The rest of the movie is variations on a theme--how Phil spends the day trying to figure out his predicament and how he interracts with certain people on different Groundhog Days.  There's Ned Ryerson, a nerdy former classmate who tries to sell Phil life insurance, a hefty fellow lodger Connors encounters as he leaves his room, and an elderly bum on a street corner, which later turns out to be one of the most poignant scenes.  Surprisingly, repeated segments don't detract from the movie.<br />The main point of this comedy is that the attitude we emanate is what makes one attractive or endearing to people.  It also states that the choices we make affects everyone else for better or worse, and how to be the best we can be so others respond in a positive way or how simple kind words can make a person's day.  Connors exudes nothing but a bad attitude from the beginning.  He makes chauvinistic remarks to Rita, and in one of his broadcasts, refers to his namesake as an overgrown squirrel.<br />Rita is the catalyst here.  Phil's attracted to her and tries whatever he can to score with her, by finding out her favourite drink, what she studied before her journalistic career, but it's when he actually comes to her for help after she's touched by his truly beautiful weather report that he realizes how nice a person that he turns over a new leaf.  He learns detachment and emanating a positive aura that makes others attracted to him instead of trying to focus on a single person.<br />This is one of Bill Murray's best movies, as his character goes from obnoxious jerk to someone who emanates so much positive energy that he's the most popular guy around.  Andie McDowell shines as Rita, with those crinkly eyes and sweet smile making her even more endearing than in Four Weddings And A Funeral.  And director Harold Ramis, Murray's costar in Stripes and the two Ghostbusters movies, has a brief scene as the local neurologist.  Chris Elliott (Larry) has the funniest word in the movie when MacDowell asks him why Murray would kidnap a groundhog.  He says he can think of a few reasons, and then says, \\"pervert!\\"<br />To be sure, this will be the movie that did to Sonny and Cher's \\"I Got You Babe\\" what mad cow disease did for cows.  And hey, at least it gave Bill Murray a chance to work with a real rodent as opposed to a bogus puppet in Caddyshack.  But it's a delightful comedy that stresses that if we emanate positive energy by becoming the best person that we can to others, others will return the energy.urite drink, what she studied before her journalistic career, but it's when he actually comes to her for help after she's touched by his truly beautiful weather report that he realizes how nice a person that he turns over a new leaf.

B0000AFQS0|5.0|This DVD deserves its title as one of the greatest rock documentaries of all time. It is a beautifuly edited collection of live performances, TV performances and interviews; opening with the infamous Smother's Brothers episode in which Keith exploded his drumkit. The sound quality is amazing, the performances (as you should expect from The Who) are phenomenal. Young Man Blues, See Me/Feel Me, and Won't Get Fooled Again stand out as my particular favorites. There is no sentimental narration to get in the way of the performances; only a few short interview segments and special inserts (ie- the promotional video for 'Happy Jack')<br />I admit a certain bias towards this DVD because of the fact that I am a rabid Who fan, but I honestly believe that even a person new to The Who, who enjoys music, will love every second of this DVD. And if you, like me, were unfortunate enough to be born after The Who's prime, this DVD is the best subsitute available.
1400031362|5.0|Morality for Beautiful Girls is a great book and a wonderful series. While the mystery aspect of the book is not strong, the character development and descriptive writing allows the reader to transport to a part of the world that (literarily speaking) we don't often get to visit. Another Amazon quick-pick: The Losers Club by Richard Perez
B0000CFW87|5.0|This CD is amazing! I was speechless when I heard it for the first time! Josh has an wonderful voice and he is so talented!! All I can say is that I hope we are so lucky to get another, new Josh album! Proudly Grobenite!!!
0790729652|2.0|listen, YES this is one of the greatest comic book movies ever made. It is one of my personal favorites across the board, but what is Warner Brothers thinking about not giving this DVD an upgrade to a special edition. Look at how many movies have been given this honor that have been flops. U.S. Marshalls for one. Knowing Tim Burton there has to be a ton of material waiting to be used to have hours of extra features. I would love to see even some new interviews with the cast reflecting back. PLEASE GIVE US SOMETHING THAT IS WORHTY OF THIS MOVIE!!!!
B00008PW2D|3.0|Why pay $30-$50 for eight episodes, is my only question.<br />This is one of the best television series EVER, but unfortunately HBO decided to be ridiculous and put a $50 list price on four hours of footage and some bland extras.<br />I ask you - why pay this? Two-three hour films with extensive bonus footage (see Gangs of New York, Moulin Rouge, Pirates of the Carribean) are less than half that cost, and while Amazon and stores such as Wal-Mart are nice enough to sell the disc for $30, we are STILL paying too much!!<br />I do own Season One of SATC and plan on compelting my collection as soon as possible, but this does not change the fact that I feel a unjustice was made in overpricing this disc and all of HBOs DVDs. Unfortunately, the HBO shows ranks alongside Friends, Alias, Will &amp; Grace, and The O.C. as the only TV-on-DVD discs worth purchasing.
B00009P1MP|5.0|SO BEAUTIFUL!  can't say anything more.  this man is amazing.  <br />I especially like Crossroads and Till Tomorrow, but of course I like American Pie and know all the words to every track.  I also reccommend Tapestry and Homeless Brother.
1592400876|5.0|Grammar, spelling and punctuation are very important when articulating one's self liguistically, especially if you are writing e-zines, or articles for online or print publication. Presentation is everything in this capcity.<br />Lynn Truss has given us a great offering in this fare.

B000002A3T|5.0|Yes, we all miss Roger and his wonderful bleak anti-war songs, but the magic is still there. Musically I think this rates with the best Floyd ever...it must be I'm still listening to it after 10 years. Mind you I'm still listening to Dark Side too, though not as often. Obviously the whole Floyd experience is to cerebral for some of the head bangers out there, but those of us who remember the release of Dark Side don't have to make any excuses for Division Bell. So its different....but its damn good.
B00003CXA6|5.0|They have fashioned a very moving (and at the same time informative) epic, of a terrible battle where the fate of this nation hinged for 3 days. Some Civil War hobbyists may say there are numerous historical inaccuracies in this flick. Maybe; but for me, I didn't know the story or layout of this battle beforehand. This film presented and focused on the major attacks of these 3 days, and the decisions and strategies rendered by the major players. It stirred my interests to learn more about this battle and the principals involved. It was eye opening. The only thing that could be improved on in this film is showing the gore of battle. Although the battle scenes are  good -- the horrendous carnage is sanitized. The great and bloody slaughter of this conflagration should in no way be diminished for modern day audiences. It's a film that can be watched over and over again, and the DVD has plenty of extras. An extremely good flick whether you are a Civil War nut or not.
B0001HAISG|4.0|We probably all know the story by heart now. Three kids whisked away from their London nursery by an elflish lad and a jealous sprite. A mean ol' pirate with a grudge the size of Neverland Island. One hungry croc. So while the story is not new, this new verison of it is a sumptious visual feast, wonderful for both adults and children alike.<br />Based on the classic children's tale &quot;Peter Pan&quot; by J. M. Barrie, this movie attempts to be a somewhat faithful adaptation to the original story. P.J. Hogan's retelling allows for some dramatic departures to help propel the story along, but generally stays to the well-loved pattern.  What he takes in creative licenses, he returns fourfold in absolute charm and beauty.<br />This Peter Pan is lucsious. With generous use of special effects, and stunning visual displays, Neverland has come alive as never before. It is storybook real, with scenery so thick it looks like you could cut it with a knife and find it full of frosting. A review aptly compared the visual style to that of a Maxwell Parrish painting, rightfully so. This is a dreamy film.<br />Also, some different touches I appreciated. First, Pan himself finallly played by a boy. While I LOVED Mary Martin's Pan (she, along with Disney's, was my first), this character begs to be played by a boy, and Jeremy Sumpter revels in his role. He brings a childish sensuality to the role, as he interacts innocently with Rachel Hurd-Wood's Wendy. Jason Isaacs follows Pan tradition and plays both Mr. Darling and Hook with appropriate meance and glee. Plus, there is a natural attraction to the very Englishness of the story. Much of my early childhood was formed between the pages of Pan and Poppins, so the righteous properness of this story comforts and charms.<br />There is a real need for good movies that both children and adults can watch, and this is one of them. A classic book will become a classic movie for generations to follow, to enjoy.
B0000AI45P|5.0|So what are you looking for in this review?  An affirmation of this band's place in history?  I'm sorry, I cannot offer that.  For you see, this band will be forgotten.  When the mists of history come sweeping down, Television will be forgotten, but the Clash and the Sex Pistols will be remembered.  But, for those who were ever still, sitting in silence with headphones wrapping them up, protecting them when Tom Verlaine's second solo in Marquee Moon hit... well, you know.  His fingers needling those aluminum strings might as well as been plucking your heartstrings.  This I know.  I have never heard a guitar express sorrow such as this.  Such furious, raging, flamboyant sorrow.  Tom's playing on this album is ghost-like, otherwordly.  His fingers are aliens transplanted from a world drowned by feeling.  Cities under oceans of emotion.  Richard Lloyd, Fred Smith, Billy Ficca are not background players here.  They create the fabric of the dream, Tom's guitar couldn't play in the clouds if these three men didn't send him there with a beautiful rocket up his ass.  Need proof?  Listen to Television, then listen to Tom's solo albums.  The music on this album is something, if given time, precious time, will in Oscar William's words, immortally wound you.  It will stay in the folds of your heart until you're old, and the opening chords to Friction still give your crippled ass a januty step.  The feeling and conveyance of sweet dread in Elevation will stick to the bottom of your feet forever.  Prove It's rambling nature being saved by an insane solo will stir in you a belief of redemption.  Torn Curtain's dark emotional melodrama will send you seeking scenes of your life in the stars.  Every track here tells a ragged story of glory.  Like Joe once shrieked, love and glory all becomes another story, but the question, will you.... listen to this story?  If the Ramones were a beautiful drunken girl with huge (...) reading Dr. Seuess in a lovely voice, then Television was a Doestievski lookalike high on opium reading in a jittery voice some ancient text whose words, though wonderous, are no longer understood....   And, that's all I have to say.
B0000C7PRY|2.0|I bought this record because I'm a great Dream Theater fan. Outside the box was incluided a banner: &quot;The new progressive masterpiece from Spock's Bear lead man with Mike Portnot at drums&quot;. I imagined, this cd will be awesome... Big mistake!! It's full of preaching about the existence of God and how Morse try to brainwash us. The only pro here is that Portnoy plays his drums like always.. Excellent. Better download &quot;Interlude&quot; and all the Intermissions, you'll appreciate a true drummer. Don't waste your money on this crap.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|The Album is just too good to be expressed in words <BR>there is a perfect blend of Guitars,drums &amp; vocals <BR>Any one who likes the songs St. out of line &amp; faceless will like the whole Album.And all the People who rated it less than 5 stars r jurks.
B000001FDQ|5.0|This album was and still is one on the top of my list. Rising Force influenced the entire music generation I was fortunate enough to be in. Yngwie's style and aggressiveness cast a broad shadow across the slackers and the lipstick crowd and challenged every guitar player to strive to be better. An ethic in music that has been missing for many years. I for one think Jeff Scott Soto's few (but incredibly powerful and distinct) additions to this album are some of my fav's and to say the least outstanding! I love this !! I'm done......,
B000002J1O|5.0|One of the best albums of all time is a fair statement, and yet I feel that Foxtrot was better. Genesis had an unbelievable 6 album arc - Trespass, Nursery Cryme, Foxtrot, Selling England..., The Lamb... and Trick of the Tale - and it WAS and arc, peaking with Foxtrot and Selling England. This IS the EARLY Genesis with Gabriel out front as well as leading the collborative creative explorations. The metamorphosis to pop band took place after Trick... and Wind and Wuthering, although Collins took over out front after Gabriel's departure after The Lamb... (and theloniouz is right about his vocal debut on Nursery Cryme).<br />Enough history. &quot;Firth of Fifth&quot; is one of the most powerful songs ever recorded - get a listen to it live in the Gensis Archive box set, you wont believe your ears! Hackett truly does tear it up with his guitar in the title track (his work in this band was always sterling - maybe equal to Fripp). The big hit, &quot;I Know What I Like&quot; is a throw way by comparison, even if thoroughly enjoyable. &quot;...Epping Forest&quot; is a hoot of a political satire. And &quot;Cinema Show&quot; has one of the deepest lyrics in pop music: &quot;Once a man, like the sea I raged. Once a woman, like the earth I gave. But there is in fact more earth than sea!&quot; Think about it before you say he's wrong.<br />And that's what is so good about Prog Rock. You have to use your brain to enjoy it, but the rewards are worth it. Woburn is right, this is the best place to start to get into EARLY Genesis, but as soon as you are ready for it, move on to Foxtrot. You won't be disappointed.
B00006EXL5|5.0|i have to say from only hearing this band for about 3 months and being a hardcore fan already, this is the best cd i have bought in a long time. if anyone who is into bands such as thursday or the used i recommend that u listen to this amazing band. the music and lyrics combined are a perfect match. any singer with a voice that can go from high pitched singing to low screaming is talented in my opinion. for some reason i just cannot get enough of this band.  from only being a band since around 2001 and having a new cd coming out on june 8th 2004 this band is well on its way to fame. I think everyone should go out and buy this cd immidiatly. u will be in for one hell of a ride.
0553381350|5.0|Although Tom Wolfe's way of writing may seem strange and at times weird, the story of these test pilots and pioneer astronauts is a classic. Beginning with the stories of pilots like Chuck Yeager, the man who broke the sound barrier, the book develops into the grand drama that was the space program and the race against the Soviets to the new frontier, chronicaling the pilots who took such great risk in participating in it. If you liked the movie, you'll love the book. A great work that I highly recommend to all readers.
B00003CXSP|3.0|Julianne Moore is no Jodie Foster whom she attempted to emulate.  The man with deformed face is hideous.  The suspense may keep one on edge, with the scary music, but personally I was disappointed with this production.<br />This may be the sequel to SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, but it is not in the same class.  That one, I liked!<br />Anthony Hopkins (whom my late friend, Roz Mahoney, called 'Tony') is one of my favorite actors.  He is marvelous in anything he attempts.  He's made a multitude of entertaining films enjoyed by a vast, diverse audience of all ages.
B00008S2VG|1.0|It's tasteless, highly unimaginative, and boring in content, just like the singer(so she calls herself one). Now that's stretching the truth. Madonna couldn't sing if her life depended upon it. She is dull, and grossly overrated. Please go away Madonna...Enough is enough.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|By the trime that The Last Samurai was released here in the Netherlands, I already was totally blown away by the score. This most be Zimmers best effort till now. While I saw the film the first time I could dream the music and that was a very special way of watching it. This is a great score, that perfectly expresses what there is to be seen on screen. But not only that, just for listening, without having seen the film, this is a great piece. I listened the cd countless times by now and I cannot stop thinking this is the best thing he ever did. The Japannese atmosphere comes through really perfectly an so suddle. This is indeed the prefect score for the perfect film. What Zimmer in fact is doing great here is keeping the music away from Bombastic when the action breaks loose, the same trick he did with Thin Red Line as we'll, or with certain parts of Pearl Harbor. I think that is indeed very very smart and really good to express drama and makes the picture. often so much more powerfull. A shame he was not even nominated for best score with the Oscars. But same story with all his scores that way. Gladiator, Hannibal, Black Hawk Down, Thin Red Line, Pearl Harbor all masterpieces. Even while the movie was not that good due the score Tears Of The Sun was a great one too.
B00008S2VG|1.0|It's tasteless, highly unimaginative, and boring in content, just like the singer(so she calls herself one). Now that's stretching the truth. Madonna couldn't sing if her life depenede upon it. She is dull, and grossly overrated. Please go away Madonna...Enough is enough.
B000005JA8|5.0|Isn't it great how many 5 star reviews there are for this album right next to plenty of 1 star reviews?  This makes complete sense to me, even as a 5-star person.<br />Trout Mask Replica is NOT an easy album, and it's not for everybody.  A very common experience for people who do love it is that they were at the minimum initially puzzled by it, and at the most completely hated it at first.  While I didn't completely hate it at first (although I did feel that way the first time I heard a different Beefheart album), I was totally puzzled by it, and could only listen to it in short bursts.  One thing this album is REALLY good at is producing a REACTION.  That's not a great thing in itself, but great revolutionary art does seem to elicit such a response.<br />I can proudly now say that I have listened to this album all the way through MANY times, and for God's sake, not to be cool.  It's probably one of the most uncool things to say you love this album, but I listen to it truly because I love it - it's just pure brilliance all the way through.  <br />The lyrics are some of the most poetic, strange and beautiful in modern music, the musicianship while admittedly VERY strange, is totally unique, revolutionary and mind-blowing, and the creativity is at a zenith.  <br />Some won't have the patience to listen to this enough to fully appreciate it, others will never appreciate it no matter how hard they try, and often those people prefer to just trash it, and that's fine.  They're entitled to their own opinions.  If anything, that just adds to the enigma that is Trout Mask Replica - perhaps the most hated and most loved album of all time.  They can enjoy hating it as much as I enjoy listening to it over and over and over again knowing what some of us have been priveleged to know, that it's perhaps the finest piece of recorded music in the 20th century.<br />So there.<br />P.S. One thing to add as an addition here.  Please take a look at the first 50 or so reviews of this album.  There were a FAR smaller percentage of 1 star reviews than there are now.  Someone I know rated it 5 stars back in 1999 and for a LONG TIME it had a very high percentage of people finding the review helpful.  Now he has 33 of 75 finding it helpful, and most positive reviews are more like 2 out of 20 finding it helpful.  Why would that be?  Could it be some people out there who hate it are trying to artificially drop the rating on this album and convince people not to buy it for some strange reason?  Again, this album elicits a response and I think these people are so offended by it that they've made a huge effort to try and discourage people away from this brilliant album to the point of acting like the people who love it are messing with you.  I feel sad for those people, but more sad for the people who will believe it and be scared away from giving this album a try.  They even go as far as suggesting there's a conspiracy out there trying to get the people to buy the album.  Could it be the other way around?  (Oh what a fragile web we weave, when we practice to deceive.)  The fact that a small group of people would go to SO much trouble would make me even more curious to see what the fuss was all about, but it's up to you.  You can vote over and over again and make this review seem as unhelpful as you want it to appear and even get all your friends to help you, but you can't erase my words.  After all, it is #28 on Mojo's greatest albums list and #58 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest album of all time, so it has earned some modicum of respect somewhere.  If the people who rated it so highly here and at these highly respected magazines are all elitist snobs, then there sure are a lot of us, aren't there?  How many people have to love it before it's acknowledged that it's generally considered to be a classic?  The people who love it TRULY DO love it.  I know I do, and proudly so...
B000003TAW|5.0|Not many CDs are as good as this one is.  There is absolutely filler material.  The band doesn't try to be anything it isn't- they realize that they aren't the average rock n roll band.  The CD whips right past with 10 excellent songs that are as straight-forward and catchy as they come.  I fell in love with this CD the first time I heard it and it remains one of my all-time favorites.  &quot;My Name is Jonas&quot;, &quot;Buddy Holly&quot;, &quot;Undone&quot;, &quot;Say It Ain't So&quot; and &quot;In the Garage&quot; are my favorite songs, but the whole album is pure perfection.

0140283587|2.0|Picked this up on a whim at an airport, seeing the glittering reviews on the book's cover from big tyke publications (NYT, LA Times, Publisher's Weekly). They said this travelogue to India was &quot;funny, very funny&quot; or &quot;hilarious&quot;, yada yada.<br />Sadly, the book is not only extremely unfunny, it also is an idiotic novel. Chapters after chapters brim with juvenile attempts at humor, cuss words and all.<br />The theme is grounded on discovering India with a supposedly foreign eye, which could have made for a great pretext for some intelligent cultural barbs (and they can be quite funny, India lends itself to quite a bit of ethnic humor), but it is just plain uninteresting. For instance,  Indian-isms such as &quot;curd&quot; (yoghurt) are described in painfully unfunny style between the novel's main protagonists.<br />One wonders what so many reviewers have found entertaining about this bland travelogue. Want to know India? Pick up William Dalrymple. Want to read funny/witty travelogues? Pick up Bill Bryson or Eric Newby.
0440224764|4.0|This is a good Grisham book and keeps you interested all the way through as you uncover the secret past of the main character, but the ending is horrible.  When reading, you get to rooting for the fellow and hoping all goes great, but then at the end it just falls apart.  Not a good ending, but Grisham is sort of known for this, isn't he???
B0001Z52RU|2.0|What did I just watch? A sci-fi thriller? A modern \\"horror\\" tale, as advertised? Or was this a semi-serious attempt at that \\"Simpsons\\" episode in which Homer creates a time machine out of a toaster and keeps altering his universe? Guess it doesn't really matter because whatever it was, it was fairly perplexing.<br />First, the central quasi-timetravel theme is so dense and doozy that it hogs about 1/3rd of the movie just to present itself. We are led to believe that an adolosecent possesses the mystic ability to get back into his childhood memory and restitch some key components that were too painful for him.<br />Fine and dandy, but the screenplay with which this is told is messy and unriveting. There are scenes of ragging (bullying, hazing) that just add very little to the overall texture of the movie. There's also a scene with Kutcher waking up in the buff with no memory of the girl in his bed last night, which is followed by a walk to the communal showers from where hot women with no clothing emerge. Sounded more like like a showcase rather than an important bit of script.<br />Third, the metaphysics are just plain questionable. How come Evan's personal diaries and notes remain unaffected when the rest of his world is warped into intended \\"Life, version 2.0\\"? Looks like we make up our own rules as we go along the film, which makes the minor sting of the \\"ultimate sacrifice\\" as numb and vague as the rest of the humorless ordeal.<br />Overall, perhaps a worthy ride if you're into insanely \\"different\\" themes but it's hard to care about this stuff and the actors in it.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|The group at national lampoon have a real winner in this one.  It is the christmas from hell, and about the greatest christmas comedy there is.  It is decided to have an old fashion christmas... all the family on both sides gathering together to celebrate christmas, and the joy of family.  Well, it is national lampoon, so you know thats not all together whats going to happen.  When you mix in-laws, snooty neighbors, alcohol, and the less desirable part of any family, you get something great!  It's 97 minutes of National Lampoons best!

B00007GZQZ|5.0|When I watched this movie for the very first time, I was 18 yold. It was and it is one of the most loved movies I ever seen in my whole life and it meant so much to me because I felt like Tom Hanks when I was rising up my new house and I seen myself in that movie with all the hard time to make the house of my and her dream nice and cozy. We did it but I miss those times.<br />Thanks &quot;The money pit&quot;.<br />Luca

And as long as hell boy is here, i dont think you could get even an ice cube in there.  Action, yes all the action you could ask for.  But whats more... theres a little beauty and the beast romance in it too.  But i wont ruin it for yea so you'll know what im talking about when you see it.  Hell boy and his fish man friend are like the new batman and robin, the new super man and... fish boy. you get the point
B0001BKAEY|2.0|I am a Matrix fan. I saw the first one three times in the theater and countless times on DVD. The second Matrix delivered almost as much with the &quot;New Smith&quot; reproducing countlessly-- balancing Neo's new superpowers. The third in the series is a disappointment. It departs from the person to person combat that typified the first and to some extent the second. Instead we are treated to more cryptic dialogue, religious symbology to the point of storyline distortion and overblown special effects that become much less satisfying--just as they become the most intense. <BR>The final battle between Neo and Smith was a letdown. The repeated use of water exploding when they clash was just too much. I expecting something cleverer from the Wachowski brothers. <BR>If you want to see this just to tie up the loose ends in Matrix Reloaded, rent it. If you want almost mindless action, eye candy watch the second half
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is another well written series from the fertile imagination of creator Joss Whedon. It is extremely well written and the acting is excellent. The effects are as good as any seen on TV, and the overall feel is classic Star Wars, mixed with the post Civil War wild west. The cast is one of the best ensemble groups I've ever seen, and each character is unique and interesting.<br />A person lacking imagination, might recommend Star Trek The Next Generation over Firefly, but anyone who enjoys something fresh, new, and imaginative should love this show. Sure, Star Trek is good, but to compare it to Firefly is like comparing apples to oranges. Fortunately, not all Trekkers are that close minded, and most can recognize a great show when they see it, without feeling their tired old franchise is threatened.
B00005JMEW|5.0|There's a scene in Quentin Tarantino's &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1993) where Butch (Bruce Willis) just nearly escapes a most gruesome violation.  He is tied to a chair, but is able to free himself.  As he leaves the building where he was held captive, Butch takes a samurai sword off the wall, and proceeds-with his newfound weapon of vengeance-to hack away at those who took him captive.  Keep that momentum going for 95 minutes, and you've got \\"Kill Bill.\\"  It's been six years since Tarantino's last movie, \\"Jackie Brown\\" (a movie I always thought was underrated) but the wait has been worth it.<BR> &quot;The Bride&quot; (Uma Thurman) is gunned down and left for dead on her wedding day by a group of assassins that she originally belonged to, and which is led by a man named \\"Bill\\" (David Carridene).  Comatose for four years, she wakes up and seeks revenge.  Uma Thurman's character makes a hit list comprising of her former colleagues, including Bill, and proceeds to go after them one by one.  In Vol. 1, The Bride makes it through two of her former companions: Vernita Green (aka &quot;Copperhead&quot; played by Vivica A. Fox) and Oren Ishii (aka &quot;Cottonmouth&quot;, played by Lucy Liu).  Don't worry, I haven't given anything away.  While there is one plot twist (that I will not reveal), this is essentially the kind of movie that one cannot spoil.  We know what's going to happen-but that's not why we watch.  We want to see how it happens.<BR> Pop culture references abound: There are references to Bruce Lee, Kurosawa's jidai-geki (period films), American sitcoms, Star Trek, breakfast cereal, Japanese TV dramas, and the Spaghetti Westerns of Sergio Leone.  Tarantino is so steeped in film lore, that nearly every frame is paying homage to something or other.  And as always, there is that feeling in scene after scene that Tarantino loves what he's doing.  This is a man who loves cinema, and it shows.  The pacing of the movie is also excellent.  Even when there are downtimes,you will not look down at your watch.<BR> What's different?  One realizes early on that this is a movie about textures. Tarantino takes us through many in this movie: The movie is shot in color, of course, but we also get black-and-white, and slow motion sequences when he wants to empathize emotion or drama.  There is also one animated sequence telling us the origin story of the Lucy Liu character--which is simply superb.<BR> And there is one point in particular where \\"Kill Bill\\" is different from any Tarantino movie before it.  If  \\"Pulp Fiction\\" and \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" were both characterized by long bouts of conversation, with short, intermittent points of action, \\"Kill Bill\\" is the opposite: wall-to-wall action, with brief, intermittent points of conversation.  He has literally turned his own style upside down.<BR> \\"Kill Bill\\" is Tarantino's homage to the kung fu and karate movies of the seventies.  Needless to say, this movie is quite violent, and this presents itself as a problem in the world that Tarantino creates.  More so than his previous movies, in \\"Kill Bill\\" he juxtaposes his own vision of hyper real violence with the hyper fantastic of the genre he is exploiting.  The conundrum is: How to rationalize the two?  Anyone seeing &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; or &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; will remember the first time they saw either one how brutally real the violence looked, so much so that it has become one of Tarantino's trademarks.  In &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, when Uma Thurman's character ODed on heroin, it really looked like she had ODed on heroin.  &quot;Kill Bill\\" has that, (witness the opening scene of the film) but it is combined with the pure fantasy from the Kung Fu genre: the power leaps, spurting, candy-cane blood from decapitated mannequins, characters with elevated levels of hearing, etc.  Tarantino is sometimes asking the audience to identify, or empathize, with his characters, while other times we are asked to step back and laugh, when the violenceis so over the top.  One or the other is fine, but putting the two together seems problematic-and I'm not sure that the movie resolves this issue.<BR> This is definitely a movie to see.  You have the pleasure of watching a movie made not only by someone who knows movies well, but also honestly respects the genres from which he steals.  Tarantino has borrowed a fantasy world, and added his own brand of quirkiness (and realism) to it, with great success.  This is a violent movie, to be sure, but we already know that: We go not only to see the violence, but how it is delivered.
0805076476|5.0|true the title is from a quote in the movie but i think it fits.  I dint know there was a book when i first saw the movie, and I acredited the genius and the beautiful Zen philosophy with whoever wrote and directed the movie (who were those guys?)  now that I have read the novel, I know where the genius lies.<BR>Palahniuk is never boring, never slows down, and never flat.  Everything that was meant to be funny is, and all the shocking moments are.  When I read the first two pages I heard Edward Norton reading them to me in my head.  After about ten chapters I myself was thrust into Fight club and it took my precious neat and organized world and slapped me in the face with a deranged yet beautifully simple alternative.  Great to read, it feeds your mind.
B00005JL96|5.0|I loved Lilo and Stitch. It was the most adorable cartoon I've seen! The story idea was hilarious, and the way it was presented was equaly funny. Stisch is an adorable mischif maker created by Jumba, an evil genious with a Russian accent. The cast of characters was great.<br />I also loved that the drawings in this movie were not Disny's usual perfect-figure drawings. It made the movie much warmer.
B00004BZ0V|4.0|This is a very good compilation of the clash. This contains all of their singles. It is not as good as the essencial clash. There are many great songs on this cd. Some of the very notable songs are White Riot, Clash City Rockers, I Fought The Law, London Calling, Train in Vain(Stand By Me), Rock the Casbah, Should I stay or should I go, and the highly overlooked This is radio clash. This is a great cd and i do recomend but I would recomend The Essencial Clash instead of this.
B000092ZYX|1.0|Radiohead's last album Hail to the Thief has to be the worst album they ever did. Despite the fact I am a Republican and Bush supporter, I gave this album a fair chance seeing as I liked its four predecessors The Bends, OK Computer, Kid A and of course, Amnesiac. However, this album is a mess. The band are tired, uninspired, bland and the material is forced. 2 + 2 = 5, Wolf at the Door and There There sounds like something babies would come up with. I can see why this album was a flop when released because the material was boring and also competing against R&amp;B great Luther Vandross and Metallica's St Anger didn't help matters. I tried listening to this album four times for it to grow, just wouldn't cut it so I sold it. Buy any other Radiohead disc except this album!
B000001IQH|5.0|This cd starts off strong and never lets up. This is the perfect cd  for all punk fans. Rancid could stack up against any of the 70's punk bands like The Clash, Ramones, and even the Sex Pistols.<BR>Some of the natable songs are Maxwell Murder, Time Bomb, Ruby Soho,  Junkie Man, Disorder and Disarray, Wars End, and the best song on the cd, Journey To The End Of The East Bay.
0375420525|5.0|This book is an amazing feat. It does take a lot of work to read but the outcome is rewarding. Rooms that grow, doorways that lead to places that shouldn't exist, and a house that knows of its own existence are parts of this story. It grows from the ordinary horror story in that it is told from the perspective of one transcribing notes of a man who saw the video based on the home owner's experiences. If that thought makes you dizzy, you might be experiencing some of the magic that this book can give. The book contains at least three different storylines that are each amazing by their own right. My recommendation: if you don't have the time to get involved in the book, or are looking for a quick and light read, avoid this one until you can afford the time it will take. But if you are up for the challenge, by all means, jump for it. You will not regret the effort.
B000001FI7|5.0|Wow! Is the first thing that jumps to mind when I first heard this CD. The first release from Portishead set the benchmark that all Trip-Hop should be measured against. There is so much to take in when listening to this CD, that it requires several differnt sittings to capture all that is going on.<br />If you had to pick one Trip-Hop CD to have in you collection, this would be it.
B000148KK2|1.0|I have to admit I am not a Costello fan to say the least( listening to Mr. Costello sing Bacharach in his previous venture made me gag in horror) period. <BR>The single star I gave this album goes to the non-Costello influenced songs and Diana's talent for trying hard to make the quirky Costello song style work with her own. <BR>I have to say this is the BEST sounding ELVIS COSTELLO album I have heard ...thanking Diana for that and one of the worst DIANA KRALL albums ditto....thanking Mr. Costello for that.<BR>...and I hope Ms. KRALL will keep her maiden name....<BR>You will not find me in the audience if DK goes on tour with this album.
B00003CXCT|1.0|With the special edition, you'll never see a more wacky hive of scum and villany.  I've never seen a more clear example of falling in love with one's own footage.  With Lucas' refusal to release the original remastered theatre print editions, he is betraying the trust of an entire generation of people whose lives were shaped by these films.  The special edition changes them substantially.  There was a pleasant balance of slapstick in the original, and now \\"A New Hope\\" is uncomfortably brought down to the level of \\"Return of the Jedi\\" with additional cutsey animal/droid/human/hut antics. It's not the money, we all know it would make bank.  It's 100% Lucas' ego.  No, I'm sorry, I believe Lucas has no right to tamper with or hinder the release of this work; it has become far, far bigger than the man himself.  I look forward to independently produced (and of *necessity* pirated) DVD's of the cleaned up originals.  And if Lucas ever manages to escape the fog of megalomania, I'd be happy to pay him almost anything to never have to see Han step on Jabba's tail again.  Please please please!  It is especially sad to note that, with the capacity of DVD, both editions of each film would have fit on the same DVD but for the selfish, willful petulance of one man.
B0001AP12G|5.0|I got this CD from a friend with a sense of skeptism... I don't really like new rap and I've especially been turned off by what I've seen on TRL and Direct Effect lately. I know, that doesn't describe all rap but I was more interested in buying Eric B and Rakim's &quot;Paid in Full&quot; than this. In fact, the only reason I watched the &quot;All Falls Down&quot; video was to check out the girl all my friends were talking about. So I traded my buddy my &quot;A Tribe Called Quest: The Anthology&quot; and I brought this home.<br />Needless to say, If there was one word to describe this CD with, I would use &quot;refreshed&quot;. It's definitely not Chingy. Multiple songs have choirs, accoustic guitars, pianos or R&amp;B singers in the background and not the generic standard of electronic thuds or beeps. It didn't bring me back to Q-Tip and Phife but it certainly made me feel good. It also feels like Kanye is rapping about real life issues, like college, his faith, and his injuries instead of constant flows of cars, cash and women. I think we all agree that the latter gets old rather fast, and I quickly went from knowing virtually nothing about the guy to having a knowledgable idea of what his life consisted of.<br />There isn't really anything that jumps out at you when you first listen... since I didn't have the track listing with me the whole cd felt a little scattered. I don't like all the skits, and besides skits there are a couple spoken conversations that just overall feel unnessicary. Although Kanye is trying to get across a point.<br />My favorite track on the album is &quot;Jesus Walks&quot;; A lot of my friends like track #2 (I can't think of the name offhand) but I personally go for more of the darker tones in hip hop. I don't think there is a single song on here that I just don't like.<br />So I gave it 5 stars... that means that I feel it's a great CD and a great addition to your collection. Maybe I came across a little too average in this review, and it's true the overall impression is still sinking in a little. But this is only the 4th time listening all the way through and I already feel this is going to be one of my all-time favorites.
B0001ZX0OM|5.0|Erwin Rommel was supposed to have made a similar comment to one of his Lieutenants while he was preparing the defenses at Normandy in April of 1944. Of course we know this is not true. It wasn't true for General Rommel any more so than it was or Sean, Jimmy and Davey when at about the age of 12, Davey is kidnapped by 2 pedophiles off the apartment bordered avenue where the three friends are playing 'street hockey' where they lived in south Boston.<br />There's a remarkable scene at the end of the movie when Sean Devine, a State Police Detective, asks Jimmy Markham if he's seen Davey? Jimmy turns to Sean and says \\"I haven't seen Davey for 25 years, since he disappeared in that car.\\"<br />This is a dark movie from a dark book by Dennis Lehane of the Patrick and Angie series. The book was a painful look at people, for the most part normal people or at least people we are familiar with, traumatized by an event so miniscule that it nearly goes unreported with no room on the agenda of the Rathers and the Brokaws, but sufficient enough to last a lifetime for the three boy-men.<br />In the middle of the movie Sean Penn, who is brilliant, explains how he got together wth the mother of his now murdered daughter, Katie. The mother was apparently well above the social strata of the then 19 year old Jimmy. Penn says, \\"I get into that car when we're kids, I'd never have the juice to ask her out.\\"<br />Clint Eastwood does an extraordinary job just following the book. It is scary and haunting with wounded has beens acting heroic and heroes making awful mistakes. Everyone knows their part, Laurence Fisburne as Kevin Bacon''s Sergeant is excellent, Tim Robbins as the adult Dave Boyle's superior performance nearly won him a best supporting; and Sean Penn is positively the best I've ever seen.<br />The endings remain the same; perhaps there is more to the final scenes in the book as Lehane wrote it, yet Eastwood does a remarkable job in juxtaposing one scene against another. I would be astonished if after 10 years, this didn't still rank as one of the best movies of the decade. A great, haunting, disturbing, memorable, critically acclaimed movie. Larry Scantlebury. 5 stars.astonished if after 10 years, this didn't still rank as one of the best movies of the decade. A great, haunting, disturbing, memorable, critically acclaimed movie.

B0001BKAEY|4.0|As far as I am concerned, this movie almost makes up for the pile of excrement that is the second movie. After previewing the review board, I am compelled to write a review myself. Up until I actually saw the third movie, I would have agreed with all the negative reviews on this board simply based on the fact that the second one sucked SOOOOO much. But after seeing Revolutions I must say that I was pleasantly surprised.<br />All the things that plagued the second movie are gone from this one. This one seems to be properly edited, well paced, and centered on human emotion. Some people take issue with the ending, but honestly, I like it. It makes complete sense. Any other ending (from what we have found out about the matrix) would have been preposterous.<br />If the series had only 2 movies, (the first and the third) with some explaination to bridge the gap, then the Matrix would have turned out to be an excellent experience. An experience like none other. If you are putting off seeing this movie because of a bad taste that you got from the the second film, I encourage you to at least give it a try. I am happy that I did.<br />Now... all I have to do is pretend the second one never happened.
B0000541AM|5.0|Picture this: West Side Story - Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim - Dancing - Singing + Gangs who look cool + actual fighting. Thats....sorta the warriors. also take out Shakespeare. There you go.<br />The Warriors finds a gang attempting to get across 27 miles of enemy gang territory until they reach their home of beautiful Coney Island.<BR>Also, every other gang in New York is on their tale (having been set up for murdering the leader of a conference trying to establish peace, so the gangs can overtake the cops, and rule the city - don't worry, this is all during the opening credits).<br />Considering how different each gang had to be, the director just went nuts. My personal favorite is the &quot;Baseball Furies&quot; (think of the Yankees + Kiss).<br />And while it is actually filmed in New York, it isn't 100% geographically accurate (the 72nd st 1/2/3/9 line is used as 96th st - but it comes pretty close. Union Square actually is Union Square (he's running up the steps of the 4/5/6 platform - I should know, I live there....no, not on the tracks)<br />All in all, this movie is awesome and cool. Very cool. <br />CAN YOU DIG IT?
6304493681|4.0|Ghost in the Shell is a very profound anime, its definitely not for everyone. The action comes in bits and pieces, so action fans will be disappointed, the technology in the anime is mind-boggling, and will no doubt wow techies. But the ending would probably register a &quot;HUH?!&quot; to most entry-level viewers, since the main theme of the story is not really what you'd think it is watching the whole show(don't wanna spoil it for u :P). I'd personally reccommend it to someone who can sit through the whole movie, and at the end of it still ponder about the issues the movie brought up.
076790592X|5.0|&quot;Tuesdays With Morrie&quot; is a touching story about a student's connection with his college professor. They enriched each other's lives in more ways than one. Everyone hopes to find that professor who will change their life. Morrie was that professor, and Mitch Albom was that student.<br />Every student should read this book. Albom made you feel for Morrie. You laughed with him, you cried with him, you loved him. Every Tuesday during school, Mitch would meet with Morrie to discuss his papers. Years after college, Mitch found out Morrie was sick. He had ALS. Mitch had lost contact with Morrie because he was so wrapped up in his own life. Mitch decided to pay his old professor a visit. He ended up coming back every Tuesday for his &quot;final class&quot; and Morrie's &quot;final lesson&quot;. Morrie never feared death or his illness. In fact, he embraced it. This book is very inspirational. We shouldn't lose touch with those who have touched our lives. Albom grew into a more mature and intelligent man. You could see his growth through his words. He grew because of Morrie.<br />An old man, a young man, and life's greatest lesson. That is the subtitle of this book. Nothing could describe it more perfectly. Mitch's meetings with Morrie became his last class. On those Tuesdays, Mitch and Morrie talked about such things as death, forgiveness, and the perfect day. Morrie's perfect day was just spending it with family and close friends. He didn't need to spend money or travel the world. He taught Mitch, and now, anyone who reads this book, that the best things in life are the people who love you. Through Albom's writing, you could get a vivid picture of Morrie. Mitch made you care about what happend to him and Morrie.<br />This book was beautifully written and was easy to read and understand. The fact that it's a true story makes it even more touching. Morrie was a real person. He wasn't just some thought in someone's imagination. He helped so many people during his life, and now, because of Mitch, he will touch many more after death.
B00005MAM2|4.0|Need i say more, Akira is one of the animes most anime-connoisseurs swear by. Heck, this might probably be the first anime most anime-connoisseurs watched. Powerful, graphic, and yet another existential action anime. A classic work of art, and no anime collection is complete without this one.

B000148KK2|5.0|First of all, let me say that while I have been hooked on Diana Krall since the first time I heard &quot;Peel Me A Grape&quot; on my car radio, and have been sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for the release of this new CD, it took me well over a week to actually decide to purchase it. The first single &quot;Temptation&quot; did not grab me (see my review); the snippets of songs I heard impressed me less; and gosh, some of those reviews and comments! I only hope Diana is thick-skinned, because they are totally off-base and often unacceptably crude. Diana a Norah Jones-Wanna-Be???  Is this a joke?  It's like accusing Meryl Streep of aiming to imitate Courteney Cox.<br />Fortunately, I stopped by a music store listening-station on a lark, and decided to give &quot;The Girl in the Other Room&quot; a fair shot. From the teasing drum opening to &quot;Stop This World&quot;, I was mesmerized, and practically stayed to listen to the whole album. In my opinion, this may very well be Di's best recording to date, although like others, I will always love her smooth touch with the standards. Listening to &quot;The Girl in the Other Room&quot; makes me feel as though I'm suspended and floating in some timeless bubble.  In fact, I think that was the whole intention of this new repertoire: an enormously successful singer stopping the train and re-evaluating life. This collection could easily have been a complete downer, but miraculously, it isn't. Every song is an evocative, reflective winner that makes me feel that some untravelled path is just around the corner, after I sit down and take a breather. The title song about self-disassocation would fit well in a David Lynch movie; &quot;Temptation&quot; takes on an unexpected excitement within the context of the other songs; &quot;Almost Blue&quot; is just plain lovely; &quot;I've Changed My Address&quot; reminds me of that great, obscure detective musical &quot;Gunmetal Blues&quot;.  In fact, the whole album has a kind of film-noir feeling.  &quot;Departure Bay&quot; is deeply heartbreaking and yet somehow hopeful at the same time.<br />No need to go on about the material, I have no reservations, just raves.<br />Diana sounds absolutely spectacular, her best vocals ever, &quot;wild honey and scotch&quot; as one critic so perfectly summed up her style.  Here she is more lyrical than ever, and shows a much wider range of notes.  The arrangements and recording egineering are to DIE FOR, a feast for audiophile ears.

B000002HIK|5.0|Just great. I am a fan of his music for quite a while and all of his records are special in their own way. Tracks with a little twist only RDJ can add. Sometimes a bit sinister, but thats ok for me! Most of his tracks are sertainly refreshing and energy boosting. A philosopher teacher once said: &quot;to enjoy and appreciate the quality of sertain aspects (of whatsoever) you have to have rotten spots besides it&quot;. In case of some of the tracks (&quot;ventolin&quot; (medicine for asthmatic patiens) for example in which you hear a sample of a person hyperventilating), annoying bleeps, cracks and sounds are added in such way that when they fade away in a track you almost feel a releef....a contrast between serenety and rotten (no offence)
B00005MP58|5.0|wow! this movie is the best movie i've ever seen in my entire life!..the characters, costumes, acting..after reading the book and watching the video with my english class, i wanted to get the movie right away, although it was difficult for me to find one,  but now that i have it, i am obsessed with it, i can watch it again and again..colin firth and jennifer ehle make a cute couple, i must say..they are both so talented, i could not be more impressed...i have become obssessed with both of them and mostly the whole movie itself!i've been printing out pictures of mr. darcy and elizabeth, and other pictures associated with the movie..one little thing that i think could have been made it better would be to have a part where mr. darcy proposes to elizabeth and see both of them hapy, but i think they wanted to save hte kiss for last, though they cold've made it a bit more passionate..lol..more kissing between them, but over all, it is by far, the best movie on earth!
B00005Y1TL|5.0|Just great. I am a fan of his music for quite a while and all of his records are special in their own way. Tracks with a little twist only RDJ can add.

1401300901|5.0|I was amazed to read that this is the first novel of Cecelia Ahern, because it was amazingly well written.<BR>Great approach of the different feelings of the main character.<BR>Simply I book I just couldn't put down and which you can easily add to your favourites.
B0001WTVUW|3.0|\\"The Day After\\" is one of the most hyped films ever made for TV and it almost (and I stress almost) lived up to its advertising.  The problem with the film is not so much the acting, although the yells of \\"Jolene\\" come in far too many times and in far too shrill a voice, but with the story-line.  Far too few of the many characters are built into full human beings--particularly the young farm family.  When the characters are given more time, alas, the film tends to move towards soap opera with the farmer's daughter (no pun intended) having such lines as \\"I wish he would have left me a baby,\\" etc.  At the same time, several of the characters are rather unsympathetic--I really didn't like the eldest daughter or the father.  This takes away from the film's power.  With characters that you have seen far too many times and really do not care for,especially the rebellious daughter and dad, the viewer begins to not care that their world is about to be blown into atomic cinders.<br />The film would have worked better with more emphasis on Jason Robarbs and the the people at the hospital in Lawrence, KS.  His character, a pediatrician (msp?), is fully alive and rounded--you see his daughter and his wife and know enough about them to realize what they are like and how much they mean to Robarbs.  The viewer can build some interest in them and their problems.  The characters in the hospital bask in Robarbs glow (no pun intended) and become more than just stick figures as they interact with him and the strain of life after the attack. <BR>The hyped special effects of the attack were not so special, even for the time it was shot with the use of x-ray pictures during the blasts to show people being vaporized and the use of stock footage, seen far too many times--it didn't work for me then nor does it today. <br /> The film does try to make its point, but with the exception of Robarbs, excellent as usual, the film falls flat.  A truly good film about nuclear attack was released about the same time and was shown on American Playhouse.  \\"Testament\\" had one small special effect but packed the full wallop that \\"The Day After\\" missed so woefully.  The British made a dandy one called \\"Threads\\", but alas, these have yet to come to American DVD.
B000092Q4U|1.0|This is a heavy band (don't get me wrong) but there's nothing drop dead amazing about this band. This is text book death/thrash metal, which is why I give it one star. With the way people make it sound, they talk like this band is breaking new ground or invented an amazing new style of metal, that is not the case. Many may enjoy this album, I mean it is head banging fun, just an &quot;old&quot; sound. Upon first listen it's like &quot;Hey, I've heard this before!&quot; For something new and imaginative try Meshuggah, Opeth or Origin. :-)
B0001AP12G|5.0|Most rappers can't produce, meaning they don't come up with their own music, they just get some othe producer to do it for them.<br />And most producers that try to rap, well, can't. They suck.<br />Not Kanye! Despite what haters say, I think Kanye has a skilled flow, full of metaphors and syllabic rhyming and all. Plus, he's a producer first, so he's a full-fledged musician - he writes the music and the songs. There aren't many of these types today!<br />Not a bad song, though some are better than others. Here's the best songs (In my opinion):<br />All Falls Down: One of those few songs that is catchy AND has social content. This is rare: most conscious rappers get too serious when they think their song's content deserves attention.<br />Syleena Johnson provides the vocals for the chorus, which is flawless, in itself.<br />Jesus Walks: I'm not one for gospel rap, but the bass on this track is something you have to hear to believe. It's songs like these which makes me wonder why people question Kanye's talents.<br />Get 'Em High: A club track, featuring Common, my favorite of all rappers, with his long-absent battle raps, and Talib Kweli. The track's made for dancing, and Kanye's West outshines Common's, in my opinion.<br />Breathe In, Breathe Out: This song's just dope. It's kind of like &quot;Stand Up&quot; by Ludacris, and not just because he's in this song, singing the chorus. The bass is similar, and it also has horns playing at the chorus.<br />Two Words: This is the hardest song on the album, with collaborations from Mos Def and Freeway. It's really cool, and I think it further proves that Kanye's a good RAPPER! At this point, he's already proved he's a great producer! He's a talent with a mic, too!<br />Last Call: A short song toasting his label, Roc-A-Fella (just for those who don't know), followed by a short autobiography from the words of West, himself, explaining how he got his record deal. The track's great.<br />People are gonna accuse me of being a d**k-rider for saying this, but there isn't a bad song on this album (even the skit's are funny), Kanye is a better rapper than people give him credit for, and he DESERVES his hype! I ain't saying this out of loyalty to Chicago, either - I wasn't born here.
B0000D96NW|1.0|Heres the rundown; in 1994 'Burn My Eyes' debuted San Francisco's Machine Head, they were rooted in 80's thrash but had a brutality that was unheard until the 90's. To put it bluntly, they were alot like an alternative Pantera. 'The More Things Change' began the downfall, and then in '98 with the release of the 'Burning Red'. Burning Red was a band that saw that thrash/brutal metal wasn't as profitable; so they changed to a watered-down sound which fit right in with the nu-metal trend emerging at the time. (much like the move Sepultura made) This switch allowed them to still be cool with a new generation of kids; but it didn't work. Most people hated Burning Red and most people hated 2001's 'Supercharger' equally.  They were completely drenched in nu-metal, they even had a nu-metal looked and toured with nu-metal bands; so this isn't just a coencident.  <br />   Fast Forward to 2004 and we find yet again another new face and sound for Machine Head with 'Through the Ashes of Empires'.  Most people praise the album saying things like 'they found their roots' and 'this band is back!'. But guess what? All Machine Head did was copy another fad in an attempt to broaden their fan base and appeal to a new 'scene'. <br />  This time arond MH are trying to sneak into the metalcore/new american metal scene (equally as lame as nu-metal). For starters there is the name of the album 'Through the Ashes of the Empires' which is, if you must know, a very cliche-sounding metalcore title. The music itself relies much on thrash-riffage, more spastic than usual time signatures, and a very large Swedish death metal influence. Much of this album sounds as though the band listened to some In Flames records right before writing their material. To me it sounds like a terrible marriage of In Flames and Adema; and in their video their frontman looks like a fool. This band would of never been invited to play the New England Hardcore and Metal Fest three years ago, yet they were apparent at thisyears.  If you want my opinion, which you are going to get regardless, this album stinks and is an attempt by this band to prove they are heavy again.  Sure they could easily be a heavier band than their last albums, but did they have to do it in such a boring, generic, and obviously trendy way?
B00005MAM2|1.0|I understand that this anime is revolutionary and i respect it for being the first anime movie in America. This, however, does not make up for the fact that it is long and boring. The plot is terrible and the characters are almost unhuman in their weakly drawn emmotions and phyci. I have never read the manga behind this movie so I can't judge that (in fact I have not heard anything but good reviews about it).<br />  I at first purchased this anime because it had such a good review. I like to read and follow reviews. Now I know better. If your like me, you won't buy this anime. It's a waste of money and alot of time. If you are a newbie to anime stay away. The only reason I would buy this is if I were an avid fan and wanted to see where it all began. This one should be left in the vault.
B00003CXB4|5.0|When I first saw this film, I was more impressed with the experimental animation, especially in some of the most violent scenes of the film.  The movie is lush with eye-catching colors, realistic images, and detailed textures.  It was not until I watched the film several times that I caught on to the depth and impressiveness of the story, as well.  The Lion King is epic and Shakespearean.  It borrows from one of Shakespeare's most famous, Hamlet.  Scar is the jealous brother of the king, Mufasa.  He plots the murder of the king and cleverly directs the blame upon young Simba, the king's son.  It is not until many years later, after Simba is visited by his father's ghost, that he returns to the kingdom where Scar has taken Mufasa's place as king.  Simba vows to avenge his father's death and with the help of two tiny but strong friends, succeeds in reclaiming the throne and defeating Scar.<br />Disney proves in this film that their films are not mere children's stories directed to young minds.  Though they have released a few stinkers over the years, Lion King remains one of, if not the most impressive animated films of all time.
0452282152|5.0|Being an enormous fan of Vermeer for years, I HAD to read this book when it first came out. Now, waiting a while, I read it again, and it holdS up as well the second time as it did the first.  Chevalier is a master talent and this is one of the best pieces of literature I've come across in a while.  If you're looking for car chases (DA VINCI CODE) or a page turner (BARK OF THE DOGWOOD) this is not the book for you.  Instead, it's a well thought out and expertly paced piece of writing.
B00005JMCW|4.0|After my reluctance wore off, I finally watched this film.  I was surprised to find a mildly entertaining return to old parent/child bickering films that I enjoyed during the 80s.  Freaky Friday explores the world of teen angst and the stress-filled responsibilities of adulthood equally and effectively places one inside the other.  Like an intrusion, teenage Anna and working-mother Tess find themselves magically transferred within one another's body after cracking open two fortune cookies at a Chinese restautant.<br />The rest is history.  The two learn about one another's hectic lives and adapt just long enough to find a way to return to their own bodies and lives.  It is also long enough for the two of them to develop an understanding of one another that was much needed long ago.<br />As I said, this film is a satisfying return to a lost genre.  I remember the 80s and the genre of films that captured both a young generation and an older generation, reflecting effectively the gap between the two.  Freaky Friday returns to that concept successfully and manages to entertain both generations.
B00005NOOH|5.0|History enthusiasts, think about a war or period in history, and summarize the major events on a piece of paper. Now write some questions on those events. Now gather researchers to provide film, eyewitness, music, and literary accounts, and professors and historians to provide commentary and insight to your questions.<br />Although many of us do not have the resources to follow this tact, Jeremy Isaacs and his researchers have done this for &quot;The World at War&quot; produced in the early 1970's. Most observers of World War II know summaries of the major events and battles: the Rise of the Third Reich, the Fall of France, the Battle of Britain, Barbarossa, Pearl Harbor, Stalingrad, Midway, D-Day, the Holocaust, the Atomic Bomb. However, this film series gives the basic summary of World War II plus much much more.<br />Although there are many great one hour summaries of the major events above, I particularly find the lesser known topics very interesting. The &quot;Distant War&quot; episode tells of the fumbling and bunglings of the early war against Germany. The &quot;Alone&quot; episode describes the relocation of children and the preparations for war. &quot;Burma&quot; and &quot;Japan&quot; tell of the early war battles of east Asia. &quot;Occupation Holland&quot; tells many fascinating underground resistance stories. All these in depth episodes not only tell of the battle sacrifice, but the total-war, planet-engulfing nature of World War II, something not witnessed before or since that conflict.<br />In addition, the DVD provides 6 bonus episodes that provide more depth to the regular &quot;The World At War&quot; series. Although some of this is repeatedly replayed on the History Channel, episodes such as &quot;Warrior&quot;, &quot;The Third Reich&quot;, and &quot;The Final Solution&quot; help nail down why this was such an important conflict. No, this was not a war over territory or barons testing their skills, for the most part this war was fought over simmering hatred and imposing ideological will.<br />I wish there were more history programs which examined a period and dissected the participants and the results more carefully. This series, &quot;The World at War,&quot; summarizes this conflict and truly deserves the title of &quot;the definitive story of World War II&quot;.
0062502182|5.0|The people trashing the book in there reviews need to go through the book and try and get the deeper meaning that Coelho is trying to bring out. I read it once, but didnt find it too great, went back and read it again, this time looking to understand the underlying philosophy. Following that the second read was enchanting, and each of the philosophies fitted in so well with what i had experienced and learnt in my own life. The writing is simple and the characters plain, but it is this simplicity that is endearing and the main emphasis is not on the story, but on the message that he is trying to give...Overall an excellent book.
B00005JKQZ|1.0|Did the screenwriter even read the book? Perhaps just a one paragraph summary. Nearly every important event of his life is left out, and almost none of the events in the movie are in the book. This might be an entertaining inspirational movie, if they hadn't used John Nash's name and the title of his biography. It's not about him. It is 99% fiction. The real story of his life is much more bizarre and would make a better movie. Crowe really knows how to play the part of a tortured soul, but he did it better in &quot;The Insider&quot;. I think he could have done it here with a story actually based on the life of John Forbes Nash, Jr. I hope someone makes a movie or miniseries about the real man.
0553579908|5.0|This book doesn't need a lengthy review: if you liked the first book, then buy this one, you'll like it exactly as much. The follow-up to the first book is so well-crafted and exactly in the tone of the first, that the two could well be two halves of one book.<br />The story progresses somewhat slowly in the first half, but at this point, the reader has come to know and care so much for the characters that this is not a problem; anyway, the finale more than makes up for it. The shining star of this book is definitely Tyrion, the ultimate anti-hero if I ever saw one, who manages to totally defeat the classification between hero and villain. I found myself wishing the next Tyrion chapter would come along, although all characters, in their own way, made me yearn for their next chapter.<br />Two new characters are given their own chapters in this novel, Theo and Davos. I found this somewhat irritating at first because I felt they did not contribute to the story, but both have a role to play in the story that makes it more than worthwhile to read their chapters through.<br />I look forward immensely to 'A Storm of Swords', after two such incredible novels.
B00009V7P8|5.0|This album is pretty amazing. At first it would appear that Mr. Rice hasn't done much of anything new or original here; he's created an album mostly of love songs and songs about past loves. It's more of how he's done it. The blend of violin, guitar, piano, are pretty common, and mixing in a female singer isn't all that rare, but those elements somehow combine to make this a pretty solid, not-so-run-of-the-mill album. There is really only one weak song on the album, which is &quot;Older Chests.&quot; The lyrics on this album are simple, but they send strong messages, and there really aren't any lines that don't fit. The melancholy feel of the music meshes well with Rice's voice and that of his female accomplice. This album is definitely worth a listen.
B00000273M|4.0|This greatest hits package is essentially a collection of the Bangles' singles.  Except for the final track, the playlist matches exactly, the singles released by the group in chronological order, starting with their first full-length album.<br />Susanna Hoffs sings lead on about 10 of the 14 songs, including their biggest hits like Manic Monday, Eternal Flame and Walk Like an Egyptian.  This may give the mistaken impression that the sultry Ms. Hoffs is the main voice of the Bangles.  But this is actually far from the truth, as each of the other members, drummer Debbi Peterson, guitarist Vicki Peterson, and bass player Michael Steele all sing lead on various compositions throughout the long history of the group.  A few examples of which are included in the collection.<br />This compilation will probably do for most casual fans, however if your exposure to the Bangles is limited only these songs, you are really only hearing a fraction of the true sound of this versatile group, and you are definitely missing some of the best music the band has to offer.  To fully appreciate the band's music, look into the recordings Different Light (1985), Everything (1988), and the reunion release Doll Revolution (2003).  You'll be glad you did.
B000001G5A|4.0|After comparing this performance to other's (I have 5 other versions) I must say that this one is the most powerful performance of Requiem. The power, the intensity, the emotion is simply unmatch by others. The first time I hear this CD, it almost make me cry.
0452282152|2.0|I heard a lot about this book, and it was a bestseller, so the reading group I'm in decided to read Girl With a Pearl Earring. We were all pretty disappointed...<br />The young girl Grit becomes a maid in the household of Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer. We hear about her life and passions, and her family, but she is a very unrealistic character, and you really feel that she is being written by a much older woman.<br />The writer shows none of Grit's emotions, just tells you what they are, in a very unconvincing and detached way.<br />It seems unlikely, that a girl so young should be as confident, unimpressed by life and manipulating as Grit is! It hardly affects her leave her family, to fall in love or loose her virginity, nothing really surprises her, and she apparently can do everything better than everyone else: this uneducated young maid is even able to tell the master painter how to paint better!<br />Appart from a cliched fascination with her MASTER Vermeer(that seems more like a badly formulated erotic fantasy of the author's than anything realistic) Grit shows no emotion, and the plot is unbalanced and boring. You never develop any sympathy for any of the characters, and the symbolism is MUCH to heavy.<br />The book left me cold an bored. The only reason why it gets 2 stars, is the description and information about Vermeers paintings, which were interesting. Chevalier completely fails to make a credible portrait of a young girl (Grit is more like a 40 year old woman), and the historcal descriptions aren't very good either.
B000060P79|1.0|HORRIBL IS ONE WORD THAT DESCRIBES THIS ALBUM AND THE BAND. THE WORST PART IS PEOPLE THINK IT IS PUNK WELL THEY CAN SHOVE THIS CD UP THEIR ASS AND BUY &quot;FULL CIRCLE&quot; BY PENNYWISE&gt; DONT WASTE MONEY ON THIS GARBGE
0316666343|5.0|I shall spare you a summary of the book, as that can be read in many of the other reviews and in the synopsis.<br />My reason for giving this book 5 stars : This is a very well written book, and the author is a great storyteller. The plot and the way the story evolves is original and unpredictable, and I was very moved by this book! The characters are wonderfully 3 dimensional, and it really gets under your skin - without being too sentimental or overly dramatic.<br />The description of how the girl and her family copes with what happens is deeply moving, the sinister bad guy gives you the creeps, and the pace of the story is just as it should be!
B00005JKC3|5.0|I'm not a fan of Hulk, the tv show was my worst childhood nightmare, specially the scream of Lou Ferrigno, but when I knew a few years ago about Ang Lee directing and Nick Nolte taking a role, couldn't resist to face the old monster and I found one of the best movie I seen in my life.<BR>         Beyond the superhero movie, this is a very dark drama, about how the pain of the past became in the inner monster who is killing us.The story is wonderfull, Eric Banna make great work as the Dr Banner, a deeply disturbed man who lives a real inner war to keep all his pain without killing himself or hurt anyone. It's not an easy to watch movie, need patience to pick up every symbol of Ang Lee, but it makes better every moment.<BR>          The only thing bad is the soundtrack, is very weak for a strong drama like this, it could be better but is so predictable.

B000000WA4|5.0|'Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness' was probably the most influential double album of the 90s, and arguably moreso than Pink Floyd's Wall album or the Beatles' White album (neither those artists greatest). And although I prefer NIN's Fragile album, this is more diverse and eclectic.<BR>I was first exposed to the entire album nearly three years ago, and I kept listening because every track stood out so much to me.<BR>The band's first two studio albums, Gish and Siamese Dream showed the band's ability to have many midtempos and a solid mix of soft and more rocky songs on their discs. On this album, there are several hits, yet it's also an album needed to be heard with an open ear, but surpringly, many people have caught up to opening their minds on this one. And even though Billy isn't the greatest singer to everyone, I like his vocals because they never fail to show the emotion intended in the albums.<br />The singles aged well, also. \\"Tonight Tonight\\" has some of Billy's best lyrics ever, and is a good way to build an album up from an awesome piano instrumental. It's got many strong things in it. As well as the fact that \\"Zero\\" has the craziest guitar solo ever, even though I don't care as much for the lyrics admittedly. As well as the fact that \\"Bullet With Butterfly Wings\\" is instantly catchy and everyone knows the chorus. \\"Thirty Three\\" kind of reminds me of \\"Disarm\\", but it's distinct enough from that one to where it stands out on its own, and I still love it. As well as the fact that it has their biggest hit ever, \\"1979\\", with a bit of a new wave influence, as that one also had well-done lyrics and some memorable bass from D'arcy. One thing I remember about the time when I was 8/9 years old and this album came out was the music videos, all which were experiences. MTV actually played music videos then, and Smashing Pumpkins vids for that matter.<BR>The band's electronic side even slightly comes in on this album. That's how much it's got in it. Songs like \\"Love\\" and \\"We Only Come Out At Night\\" have elements of that, although the latter is more of its own style.<BR>Some songs, I feel, are as long as they should have been. \\"Thru The Eyes of Ruby\\" is just amazing, so that song's placement is very valid. \\"X.Y.U.\\" is just explosive, one of the album's heaviest, with an amazing guitar solo, and some of Corgan's most memorable yells in music.<BR>As well as the fact that there are other ways to describe tracks unlisted. There is cool guitar on \\"Farewell and Goodnight\\" that stands out, <BR>Jimmy Chamberlain's drum talent still shines through, whether it be the memorable cymbals of \\"Lily\\" or in many other tracks on the album. I was shocked that I liked the follow-up album which lacked his drumming.<br />So all in all, this album has almost everything. Music has influences that range from heavy rock to even classical and jazz influences, as shown in the title track.<br />This was their most diverse album ever made, so if you look in that for an album, pick this up first from the band. However, I prefer 'Adore' and 'Siamese Dream' to this, but it's still excellent, and that's not by much that I prefer the two. I wonder how you wouldn't own this in the first place, but it's a double album, so I guess that's why. So I guess, if you see it used and have the money for a full album and wouldn't be willing to spend 25 dollars, buy this used.
B00001MXXH|4.0|Ferris (Matthew Broderick) skips a day of school by pretending sickness and takes his girl friend Sloane (Mia Sara) and his best friend Cameron (Alan Ruck) to enjoy a day of Chicago downtown. His school principal Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) doesn't trust Ferris and tries to trap him. Ferris's sister (Jennifer Grey) thinks this is so unfair that Ferris can skip school while every other students are staying classes with boring lectures. She decides to bust his brother out as well. Ironically, she saves Ferris at last. There're lots of hilarious things in the movie, and some quite classic like singing &amp; dancing scenes almost make you want to shake your body with them as well. Is that simple just skipping school for fun? Not really, Ferris in fact wants to take this one day adventure to show his friend Cameron nothing to be afraid of, and should have brave to deal with his parents and fears. Overall, the comedy is very funny, I did have a good time watching it.
B000089RVX|3.0|I must to say I really like 'My Immortal', Hello' and 'Bring me to life' but that doesn't tell much, actually. When 'Bring me to life' first came out I though it was a brilliant song and Evanescence were quite close to become one of my favourite bands.After hearing their 'Fallen' I'm pretty dissapointed and surprised. Surely, noone can deny Amy Lee has an absolutely gorgeous, emotional and strong voice and plays the piano to a good level but I'm afraid this is all Evanescence are. I can't get rid off the feeling that without Amy, the band would be not even as nearly as they're right now.<BR>Listening to the album, I spent most of my time skiping through the tracks trying to find at least a few songs without the repetitive guitar playing and I'm somewhere,let's say,stuck in the middle: I don't mind this album but I wouldn't play it whole on my own. I DO try to like Evanescence, I really do. But as much as I hope I'm gonna really enjoy this band one day, most of their music just doesn't seem to have any special effect on me. Sorry.
B000000W9Z|4.0|After seeing the decent \\"Black Tie White Noise\\" slip into failed record company oblivion -- even after getting decent reviews and radio exposure -- Bowie suddenly found himself being listed by the likes of Trent Reznor as the artist who influenced them the most. That proclamation led to a friendship and subsequent tour with NIN, and a juicing of Bowie's creative muse.<br /><br />The result was this semi-conceptual album about the \\"Art Murders\\" investigated by the latest David Bowie alter ego, detective Nathan Adler. Brian Eno came back on board as producer, and the jagged edges of \\"Outside\\" were suddenly making Bowie in tune with a whole new set of fans. Reznor's effect weighs in heavy on what was the album's first single, \\"The Heart's Filthy Lesson,\\" which was also featured in the dark and similarly themed movie \\"Se7en.\\" (Also curious that spiritual kin in film making David Lynch chose \\"I'm Deranged\\" for his similar trip into darkness \\"Lost Highway.\\")<br /><br />Most of the songs are thematically linked by Adler's investigation into the ritual murder of \\"Baby Grace,\\" but it's a bumpy ride to be sure. Bowie's immersion into the mid-90's subculture inhabited by the likes of performance artists (some real, some fictional) informs the liner notes as much as the music, and made for a pretty good read. Those segues sometimes subtracted from the songs, but at least it's nice to see that the music still holds up so well. If a lengthy tour of weirdness ala Bowie would be the kind of album you'd like to add to your collection, then this was the beginning of a creative wave for Bowie that has continued through the current \\"Reality.\\"
0380820846|5.0|Perhaps Penelope Featherington is the ancestor of the loser-heroine who finally got the best of the bunch!  Sure, Anthony and Benedict Bridgerton are both handsome, charismatic, rich and gorgeous but the best of the Bridgerton men is Colin.  Why? He has a very good sense of humor, totally cool and totally clueless that his one match in all the world is just the one person he never thought he would want to marry:  his sister's best friend Penelope Featherington.  Penelope started out as an awkward teenager who is used to being a wallflower, who is usually rescued by the Bridgerton brothers from embarrassment in all the balls, and who secretly loves Colin Bridgerton.<br />Colin might be clueless in how Penelope felt about him and how he felt for her but his feelings developed in a realistic way.  He came to appreciate Penelope not only for her looks but also for her intellect, her wit, her personality --now how many men in this lifetime still has this trait?  \\"Romancing Mr. Bridgerton\\" is a must read for people who still believe that love is not only skin deep.
B0001LYH9S|4.0|That line, taken from &quot;Outside's&quot; best song &quot;The Motel,&quot; pretty much sums up Bowie's magnificent return to form. After seeing the decent &quot;Black Tie White Noise&quot; slip into failed record company oblivion -- even after getting decent reviews and radio exposure -- Bowie suddenly found himself being listed by the likes of Trent Reznor as the artist who influenced them the most. That proclamation led to a friendship and subsequent tour with NIN, and a juicing of Bowie's creative muse.<br />The result was this semi-conceptual album about the &quot;Art Murders&quot; investigated by the latest David Bowie alter ego, detective Nathan Adler. Brian Eno came back on board as producer, and the jagged edges of &quot;Outside&quot; were suddenly making Bowie in tune with a whole new set of fans. Reznor's effect weighs in heavy on what was the album's first single, &quot;The Heart's Filthy Lesson,&quot; which was also featured in the dark and similarly themed movie &quot;Se7en.&quot; (Also curious that spiritual kin in film making David Lynch chose &quot;I'm Deranged&quot; for his similar trip into darkness &quot;Lost Highway.&quot;)<br />Most of the songs are thematically linked by Adler's investigation into the ritual murder of &quot;Baby Grace,&quot; but it's a bumpy ride to be sure. Bowie's immersion into the mid-90's subculture inhabited by the likes of performance artists (some real, some fictional) informs the liner notes as much as the music, and made for a pretty good read. Those segues sometimes subtracted from the songs, but at least it's nice to see that the music still holds up so well.<br />If a lengthy tour of weirdness ala Bowie would be the kind of album you'd like to add to your collection (or in the case of this remaster, probably replace), then this was the beginning of a creative wave for Bowie that has continued through the current &quot;Reality.&quot; The remastered version brings out a lot of the dense production's nuances, and offers a UK bonus cut with the OK &quot;Get Real.&quot;fers a UK bonus cut with the OK &quot;Get Real.&quot;
B0001LJC2K|5.0|a couple ppl have said they took off stars because Muse sounds similar to Radiohead...here's something: WHO CARES!  this band is amazing, this cd is awe-inspiring and believe me, no one has a truely original sound, you may think so, but you haven't heard every single song in the entire world so don't play the critic.
B000000WCX|4.0|Barely past a year from &quot;Outside,&quot; Bowie switched outfits and came out clubbing. Gone was the dark and foreboding atmosphere of Detective Nathan Adler's diaries, in was a very British romp through Jungle and bass dance music. No concepts this time, just great single after great throbbing single. &quot;Little Wonder&quot; was the kind of song tailor made for dance clubs circa 1997, and the bass heavy sound made my apartment walls shake back then.<br />Keeping Reeves Gabriels back as a full time collaborator (from the Tin Machine days) certainly added to the glorious racket. His feedback laden leads and quirky rhythms elevated &quot;Dead Man Walking,&quot; &quot;Telling Lies&quot; and &quot;Law.&quot; The sole drawback to this album is that it has dated itself (Drum'n'bass lasted what? Two months?), but having songs as amazing as &quot;Seven Years In Tibet&quot; and the genuinely disconcerting &quot;I'm Afraid Of Americans&quot; (wherein Bowie mumbles &quot;God is an American...&quot;) makes &quot;Earthling&quot; a Bowie disc still worth seeking out.
6302968100|1.0|(...). This movie MIGHT have been great, and I know why some enjoy it, but Slater and Arquette were one of the most annoying, self-absorbed, and incredibly stupid couple in movie history. I really wanted them (of all the characters) to die all throughout the movie! And in the end they have a son. You can tell this kid is going to end up in prison or worse by the time he is old enough to vote. But worst of all is the stupidity. Clarence, the main character, somehow manages to take $500,000 worth of cocaine after committing mass murder, but leaves his ID in a dead guy's hand--even though the ID was the reason that he blew his top in the first place? And after his wife is almost killed, Clarence chooses to put them all in even more danger... suddenly the \\"coke\\" and $200,000 has become more important to him than his wife's safety or his own... even though their \\"romance\\" was the supposed catalyst for his transformation from comic book geek to mass murderer? Not to mention the title of the movie??!? These characters are stupid, unbelievable, the embodiment of immaturity and self-absorbedness, and end up becoming the murdering drug dealers they're supposed to be up against. And they actually concieve a child! No actually there's soemthing worse than all that...its that the movie tintilates you with the possibility of one or both this nefarious couple dying as a result of their own mistakes and self-degradation as they deserve, but doesn't follow through. If this movie were true it would be a serious concern about the viability of the human race. Thank goodness it is not. And thank goodness the movie is over.
0671027344|5.0|If ever there was an anthem for the high school teenager today, this is it! Stephen Chbosky has given a stunning insight into the world of a high school student in his masterpiece &quot;The Perks of Being a Wallflower.&quot;<br />Being a high school student myself, I was floored at the accuracy of Chbosky's portrayal of a high school environment. Through the magnetic main character, Charlie, he portrays real issues facing high school students like teen-pregnancy, drugs, relationships, homosexuality, depression, suicide, love and acceptance. <br />The way the novel is written brings you into Charlie's world. It entraps you and won't let you put the book down. The book is written as a series of letters written to you from Charlie. I found myself growing closer and closer to Charlie through every hilarious comment and the most serious and sad of moments. The language used is so genuine and simple, yet you see exactly what he wants you to see. I could truly relate and empathize with what he was going through as almost any other high schooler would. With each heartfelt and honest letter you grow with him and become his friend. To be honest the book was almost torturous because after each letter all I wanted to do was write back to him.  <br />The strange part of the book is that it really has no huge plot. There is no hero, no villain, no murderer...it's just an honest story of someone struggling through life.  You see him fall in love, you see him depressed, you see him have fun, you see him grow, but no one wins or loses. The climax, I believe, is finding Charlie everyday in something.  It's something that happens to you and you wanting to write to Charlie about it.  It's reading the book multiple times (which I have) and finding something new you didn't catch the first time. <br />\\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" by Stephen Chbosky is an honest, and truly moving novel. I strongly suggest you read it.
B00005JLKN|3.0|Loved SILENCE OF THE LAMB and was disappointed with HANNIBAL.  And I remember and enjoyed MANHUNTER back in the 80's.<br />So I wasn't in a big hurry to see RED DRAGON, despite having such a stellar cast.  Edward Norton, Ralph Fiennes, Harvey Keitel AND Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lector?  Now that's a cast.  I watched it and enjoyed it, especially the departures it made from the novel and the original movie.<br />If this film came out in the mid-1980's (before MANHUNTER), would be one of the greatest thrillers of all time.  Everyone's great in it.<br />But, despite hitting on every piston in everything else, my enthusiasm for the movie was lost because...I already knew this story.<br />(I think this is a huge problem in Hollywood: the acting, the technology, everything has exceeded the writing.  The stories, for whatever reason, have been up there with everything else.  Lack of development, rushed deals, whatever.  In this particular example, the story was exhausted.)
B00005JMKI|1.0|(...)  Endlessly and relentlessly grim, nonsensical and boring.  There is no town like that - especially in the Rockies.  I found myself wanting the vapid Nicole to whiz up into the flames.  Never have liked her and even less in this mess.

0316168815|5.0|This may be the best book you'll ever read this year.Alice Sebold tells a chilling story without histrionics or sensationalism, and her self-discipline makes the story all the more poignant. If you want a first-hand experience with what writing should be, treat yourself to The Lovely Bones. Another two books that I recommend is \\"Good Grief\\", and \\"He Never Called Again.\\"
B000002MTR|5.0|This album has great singles, great tracks, and great playing all over it.  I listened to the whole thing without skipping a second!  This record sounds so fresh and it's 9 years old!  The band was put in a hard place, no one wanted to see another RHCP guitar player, and they did although, Dave Navarro is by far the best guitar player they ever had,(even though John is great).  If people would have gotten over John leaving then this album would not have gotten such a bad rap.  I love the playing on this, it is the swan song of Flea, even though he was good before,he was even greater after this record.  Buy this record if you are tired of listening to the radio right now
B000060P79|1.0|This group may say they are a punk band, but nothing is further from the truth.  They are nothing but a few kids who realized they could make money if they imitated the early years of Blink-182 and the overly-commercial Good Char.  While the Goods have not stopped torturing me with their prepackaged sound, why should I have to listen to another sound-alike 'punk' group who probably did just fine in social circles.  faux-outsiders like Simple Plan are taking Punk Rock, the interesting bastard-child of rock, to a new, juvenile, lower level.  In their last two CDs, blink-182 has changed from childish ideas on sex to sadness and more adult themes.  'Miss You' is the cry for punk to grow up.  Any CD titled 'just balls' deserves to be put on the back shelf.  While other true punk bands have grown, Simple Plan and all the others like it insist on dragging it back down.
B0001LNN5W|1.0|d12 are mainstream what rap is NOT about, there lyrics are COMPLETELY wack, and the beats are just as bad.  just listen to &quot;40 oz.&quot; that song absolutely cracks me up....not because it is a funny song - the song has the worst lyrics ever none of them make sense AT ALL and the beat is pathetic, but the reason it cracks me up is because d12 cop what all the great rappers rap about.  N.W.A, Eazy-E, DJ Quik, 8 Ball, etc, they all have there 40 Oz/8 Ball song, and now d12 think there so good so do the same, they probably dont even drink at all but think that since the ORIGINAL groups did it to success then they can.  They make 40 oz bottles sound like a disgrace and that no one should ever drink.  They copy esham and his group natas with the topics they rap about, but d12's lyrics fall WAY below natas and esham.<br />The bottom line is - DONT BUY THIS TRASH

0684800713|4.0|Ernest Hemingway's entry to fame was when this piece of work was put into mass production.  Over time, Hemingway's style of writing has changed quite a bit and by reading this, one of his first novels, one is able to see the progression of a man outfitted with an artistic and utterly brilliant mind.  The Sun Also Rises was rather difficult to read, however, the time spent working through the novel, evaluating each character, following the plot, and picturing the development of the theme was well worth it.<BR>      The novel consists of many different types of characters.  The novel's main character and narrator, Jake Barnes, an ex-militant, is a journalist stationed in Paris where easily more drinking and partying takes place than any sort of actual work.  Barnes is also quite possibly the reason the book is somewhat difficult to read.  His tendency to keep the reader unaware of what his actions are, but describe everyone else's actions makes him quite a difficult character to understand.  A second important character happens to be the love of Jake's life, Lady Brett Ashley.  Ashley, like all of the rest of the characters in the novel is a heavy drinker.  Barnes loves her so much, and even she loves him back but refuses to make any sort of committment because she has a very indecisive attitude.  Unfortunately, her life seems to be leading to an endless sea of sadness and depression, no positive goals are in sight.  Outside of Jake's relationship, he shares good times with a group of friends, one of the closest being Robert Cohn.  Cohn is one of those friends that everyone enjoys picking on, but he doesn't what he would do without him.  Cohn is also a drinker, but shares different ideas on opinions such as casual sex and also happens to be jewish.  A fellow, yet more consistant drinker than the rest, Mike Cambell, is a rather perfect depiction of the feelings expressed throughout this novel.  He is a poor alcoholic with a horrible temper.  Barnes has a few other friends and meets many others throughout the journey of this novel, but none shed too far from the typical drunken aquatance.<BR>      When The Sun Also Rises was published in 1926, it tells a story of the concerns a group of Americans residing in Europe during the mid 1920s.  The two main characters are Jake Barnes and Lady Brett Ashley.  During the beginning of the novel we are told that Ashley's husband was killed in World War 1 and happened to work in the same hospital that Barnes was sent to after he was injured in combat.  This is the beginning of Barnes' loving feelings for Ashley.  Jake begins his story by telling of his pre and current relationship with a fellow drinkig partner, Robert Cohn.  The morning after Jake begins his story, he is at breakfast with Cohn.  It is here where Jake points out Ashley to Cohn and he is very overwhelmed by her beauty.  A few weeks after this small get-together, Jake and Cohn are traveling in a small town near Paris where heavy drinker, Bill Gorton is introduced.  Jake, Cohn, and Gorton spend their time together fishing, drinking, and partying following their train trip to Spain.  Following 5 days of partying, Jake and Bill decide to make another trip to a small town outside spain, but Cohn decides to stay.  Jake and Bill check into a small hotel where they meet a young bullfighter, Montoya, who tells them of a bullfighting festival coming up in a few short days.  This festival is highly enjoyed by Jake and Bill being that it consists mostly of heavy drinking, dancing, and everything that generally goes along with it.  A day or so later, Cohn arrives with Ashley.  This is a suprise to Jake, who becomes extremely enraged.  There is a fight and Cohn ends up knocking out both Jake and Bill.  After a well thought out apology, there is forgiveness among the group of men.  Following this agreement, the next day the three men rent a car and head their seperate ways.  Jake chooses to go back to spain with Ashley, who has once again become indecisive about the man she chooses to be with.  The ending scene takes place with Jake and Ashley speaking of how good they would have been together, but unfortunately never were.  The novel ends with a depressing quote from Jake, \\"Yes, isn't it pretty to think so?\\" after Ashley tells him of her feelings for him.  <BR>      The characters of this novel provide the reader with quite an obvious theme.  A theme depicting a society with no goals or any general direction in their lives.  Instead of taking the time to plan on the future, their time is spent partying and drinking, which leads them no further to happiness, even though they may think it at the time.  All this partying is merely a distraction from Jake and his friends from seeing the downfall of their futures.
B000000W5N|5.0|Following on the heels of the tremendous release Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers retains the great sound and red-blooded lyrics that made its predecessor so great. This album also saw the first extensive use of the versitle Mick Taylor, who replaced the outgoing Brain Jones. The Stones continued the perfect blending of soulful blues, extended ballads, and gritty rockers that had by that time become a trademark. In doing so, they not only produced two of their biggest hits, but some of their most underrated and accessible material.<br /><br />Brown Sugar- Undoubtedly a beloved and essential part of the Stones' catalog. This rocks harder than just about anything they ever did.<br /><br />Sway- Great lyrics and guitar make this very listenable.<br /><br />Wild Horses- The second of the big radio hits to come off Sticky Fingers. Arguably the most beautiful and heartfelt song the Stones wrote.<br /><br />Can't You Hear Me Knocking- The king of the disc. A rocking mix of sax and guitar punctuate the killer first two minutes with a rumbling wall of fury. A must listen.<br /><br />You Gotta Move- The weakest track of the bunch still has some groovy moments that will appeal to many listeners.<br /><br />Bitch- Another classic hard rocker with some hard hitting lyrics and a great brass accompaniment to boot.<br /><br />I Got the Blues- The pace is slowed down and Mick gets a chance to sing his heart out. A wonderful blues piece.<br /><br />Sister Morphine- A harrowing and gritty tale of drugs that may take a few listens to warm up to. It's well worth the time.<br /><br />Dead Flowers- The group's sense of humor shines through in a countrifed honky-tonk rocker that's sure to please.<br /><br />Moonlight Mile- Sticky Fingers ends on a high note with another beautifully melodic and soaring ballad. Easily one of the best songs they ever wrote.<br /><br />The success would continue after this with Exile on Main Street, considered by many to be the Stones' crowning achievement. There's alot to love about Sticky Fingers, and any Stones fan would agree it's right up there with their very best. And while it may not be the greatest rock album of all time, it certainly belongs on a very short list of qualifiers.with their very best.

B00005Y1TL|5.0|When I bought this CD, I was familiar with Aphex Twin as someone who twiddled with weird and shocking noises to produce something that didn't exactly sound like music, but was so interesting and flat-out crazy that one's attention was instantly captured (despite the headache and ringing in the ears that inevitably followed). <br />This is a very different Aphex Twin from the one that I was familiar with. The album is atmospheric, subtle and intricate - entirely unlike the watered-down Muzak sound that so horribly plagues most so-called &quot;ambient&quot; music out there. Actually, &quot;ambient&quot; is a bit of a misnomer; most of the tracks have a subtle, but persistent beat, so perhaps &quot;intelligent techno&quot; would be a better term. If you like Orbital, Boards of Canada, Future Sound of London, then you will love &quot;Selected Ambient Works 85-92&quot;. If, on the other hand, you are a dance-happy trancer who walks around with lightsticks, then you probably won't have much fun with this ablum.
B0001V07ZQ|5.0|I think this is Peter Weir's best work to date.  The characters came to life and worked very well as an emsemble.

0671027387|4.0|The other Dan Brown books (Da Vinci Code and Angels &amp; Demons) employ a different model of storytelling.  That is, they deal with a lot of art history and symboligy. Deception Point is more like Brown's other thriller 'Digital Fortress.' 'Deception Point' employs more of a James Patterson type read.  You don't need to think much, the story just sort of plays out like watching TV in your head.  That said, 'Deception Point' is a highly entertaining Science Fiction meets Science Reality stuffed together into a break-neck-paced-thriller that is tough to put down.<br />Great use of political power elements, Science fiction that borders on reality and naturally, a love story intertwined nicely in the middle of the whole story.<br />Go out and get a copy of your own, worth the time.
B00018D44U|5.0|Norah Jones seems to live in a dreamy world of Jazz, Soul and Country music. At times it is difficult to figure out which direction she is taking all while it feels like her voice drifts back and forth between lazy summer days and melancholy remembrance. I like her style and the pace of the music because it brings out the subtle beauty of her sexy voice.<br /><br />If you are looking for an upbeat CD, you might want to take a different path home. If you want to be bathed in the soft silky notes on this CD, then you are in the right place. This is music for a leisurely walk out in the country, a bubble bath or just laying around in bed dreamily reading poetry or making love on a summer afternoon. Kissing slowly on a rainy day might also be a good option. ;)<br /><br />\\"Feels Like Home\\" is definitely a calming, almost country escape. The lyrics are intriguing and I enjoy the metaphors and especially the lines:<br /><br />The current is strong from what I've heard<br />It'll whisk you down the stream<br />But I never seem to have the time<br />So my toes just touch the water<br /><br />As I sit here in my fluffy pink slippers I was thinking that the entire song of \\"Toes\\" seems to be speaking of the desire to fall in love and you can just imagine if Nora jumped in she would be swirling in some whirlpool of desire. The image is relaxing; yet there is more, there are future possibilities still undiscovered. I like the fact that her songs never hit dead ends and it always feels like the lyrics are open and Nora is leading the words through the music.<br /><br />I was wondering if her style is in any way connected (in a hereditary kind of way) to how her father plays the sitar. It could be because she doesn't seem to ever seem rushed or at least, she sings as her heart tells her to sing, just as her father improvises when playing the sitar. Nora Jones' family is fascinating for many reasons. Not to mention, her father's influence on the Beatles.<br /><br />Norah Jones was born in Brooklyn and raised in Dallas, Texas. Her love for Jazz evolved while attending Dallas' Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts. She then majored in jazz piano at the University of North Texas for two years. Nora's Texas roots are showing more than ever in this new album.<br /><br />If you love \\"Feels Like Home,\\" you will really love \\"Come Away With Me.\\" Both have a laid back feel and Nora's voice is sultry and teases the listener mercilessly. There are times when you just want to think about lyrics and this music gives you enough time for contemplation and is definitely relaxing. I enjoy the consistent tranquil mood and while this music might not be for everyone, there is definitely room for music that \\"feels like home.\\" I'm pretty sure Norah's voice could adapt to a variety of musical styles and I'm sure she will follow her heart. What she is doing is magical, but I'm sure the future is wide open for whatever she is dreaming about.<br /><br />Look for her father's music in Pather Panchali (1954) and the rest of the Apu Trilogy by director Satyajit Ray.

B0001DI0FI|5.0|This is one of those big movies that I would've dearly loved to have made it to the theaters to see but never found the time which is a bit of a personal disappointment as this film, I'm sure, would've been even that much better on the silver screen.  While this great film has it's glorious battle scenes, it is a film based not so much in big action sequences but more in the intelligent dialogue and narrative.  Few films have so aptly displayed what a harsh life sailors of this particular era lived as well as this film does.  Youthful dreams of such a life may have been deftly squashed for many by seeing the harsh realities displayed in this film.  Simply put, this film is well paced with an apt balance between intense battle scenes and almost an almost poetic script.<br />For many years now, Russell Crowe has displayed exceptional performances in several movies, showing that he has a wide range of acting abilities and this film is no exception to that as he brings Captain Jack Aubrey to life.  Paul Bettany's performance in this film is quite exceptional as well.  I believe the only other film I've seen him in was another Russell Crowe film in \\"A Beautiful Mind.\\"  Clearly his future performances are to be looked forward to.  Another notable cast member is Billy Boyd, most well known for his role in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" as Peregrin \\"Pippin\\" Took.  Although his role in this film is minor, he does stand out.<br />Director Peter Weir has had a long and storied career directing in Hollywood with such notable films as \\"Dead Poet's Society\\" and \\"Witness.\\"  This film will certainly go down in the history books as one of his best.<br />The Premise:<br />The fate of the British Empire seemingly rests on the shoulders of Captain Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe) as he commands a British Naval warship that is suddenly attacked by a much larger French warship that he's been given the mission to capture or destroy.  After his first fateful encounter with the behemoth he must repairhis ship and embarks on a trip spanning two oceans to capture or destroy the French ship or die in the trying...<br />What follows from there is, as stated above, an extremely well made film that in its dialogue rings to a subtle but poignant tune and its action carries the weight of a big hitter.  I highly recommend this film to any and all who enjoy films in this genre!  {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features:<br />Strangely enough, the Special Features for this film seem to be somewhat of an afterthought and few at that.  Unlisted, the Special Features disc comes loosely packed and placed in the left inset.<br />-Theatrical Trailer<BR>-Behind the Scenes<BR>-Coming Attractions
B00005JM02|5.0|As usual for Pixar, the characters in this CGI film are colorful and interesting for children and adults.  Loyalty, friendship and faith dominate the characteristics of the main characters and there are no real &quot;bad guys&quot; or &quot;scary guys&quot; that would otherwise frighten small children--even the sharks are well-behaved which gave me the best laughs in the film.  I'm smiling right now as I write this remembering their pep talks to each other during their &quot;life-affirming&quot; meetings--hilarious! <br />The developers at Pixar continue to amaze me with their ongoing improvements in the beautiful worlds they create with this newest medium.  The scenes were simply dazzling at times--a real delight to the eye. I found myself replaying the DVD to certain scenes just so I could take it all in once again.<br />The games and other activities for children included on the 2 DVDs, (I have the 2-DVD collector's addition) are clever and fun.<br />I highly recommend this DVD set for people of ALL ages!
B00000K31V|5.0|What a wonderful movie.  All of the mind twisting about just what is reality anyway? and a feeling for what it's like if you are a videogame character living in a videogame world, where you may have to chop off a person's head to proceed with the game.  I love the homage to Philip K. Dick, who beat the reality problem nearly to death in his works (movies made from his stories include Blade Runner, Total Recall, Minority Report, Screamers, Imposter (which I haven't seen), and the embarrassing Paycheck).  When the main characters in eXistenZ get hamburgers to take to the motel, the burgers come from Perky Pat's, and Perky Pat comes from Philip K. Dick.  Residents of Mars, to spice up their boring lives in The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, take a drug and play with their Perky Pat dolls, becoming the dolls and trying to live a Barbie and Ken existence.  They know it's not real, but it becomes more real than real.  You know that you are viewing a great simulation of reality in this movie when the burgers come from Perky Pat's.  This movie would not have been made if Philip K. Dick had not lived, and we are better for both of those events.<br /> It also seems to me that people who love The Matrix as much as I do - and there are millions of us - can't help but love this film.  I can only attribute this movie's small potatoes performance vis a vis The Matrix to not enough people having seen it.  So if one one-hundredth of you Matrix fans out there and all of the Matrix haters one reviewer referred to would rush out and buy this DVD you would make David Cronenberg really rich, as well as one of our finest creators of off-kilter movies.
B00005JY1B|2.0|You see, my son landed a bit part in that movie.  I could watch it over and over as he is now having trouble in his life.  He played the part of the big brother organizer.  He was so thrilled to be able to do this.  He was discovered in a restaurant where he worked as a bartender.  The next thing he knew he was on his way to Hollywood where, like so many others, had his dreams dashed and heart broken.  I think he could have done a better job than Mr. Reeves but that is a mother speaking.<BR>The movie? Well, I live near San Francisco, and love it as if it were a lover.  I never tire of movies with this wonderful city in it.  I did not forget for one moment that I was watching people acting, (my son excluded). End of Story.
B00005JMEW|5.0|I am a Tarantino's fan and let me tell you, he didn't dissapoint me at all with this movie, not at all.  Of course all the blood and fights are exagerated but when you know Tarantino's work you know what to expect and that's the beauty of it.  Uma Thurman made an incredible performance as always, you just gotta love her.  The combination with animation to tell Lucy Liu's story was brilliant.  I thought I was going to hate it but no, even the cartoons show all the necessary emotions!<BR>Thinking about getting the DVD, please do!

B0001BKAEY|5.0|Few things have shocked me more than the incredible amount of bad reviews for &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; and the overwhelming amount of negative voting on positive reviews of this astonishing film.  In my opinion, many a fan of the original &quot;The Matrix&quot; film have taken the same tack that fans of the first three Star Wars did with Episodes I and II, in so much that it wasn't what &quot;they&quot; expected it to be so it wasn't any good in their &quot;opinions.&quot;  Just as Episodes I and II of Star Wars are the results of George Lucas's vision for those films, &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; and this; &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; are the sum of what the Wachowski brothers envisioned them to be.  That being said, I found their vision of where the films should go to be enormously entertaining on all levels, from bringing the story to its ultimate conclusion to its breathtaking action sequences.<br />I've never been a great fan of Keanu Reeves and his acting abilities but with this and the first two movies he clearly found a role that is well suited to his talents and this will most likely be the role he is most remembered for.  Carrie-Ann Moss's performances in all three films is incredible as well and, like Keanu Reeves, this will probably be the role she is most remembered for.  What can one say about Laurence Fishburne's performance in these films other than that it was incredible; of course, in most films I've seen him in he's been nothing less than an outstanding actor.  Although I think Hugo Weaving was erroneously given the role he was given in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; films, here in &quot;The Matrix&quot; movies he has left an indelible mark as one of the ultimate bad guys.<br />With the Matrix series of films, the Wachowski brothers as both writers and directors have clearly made a mark on the industry and any future films by them will definitely fall into the category of &quot;must see.&quot;<br />The Premise:<br />As &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; concluded we learned that Neo's seemingly super powers no longer ended when he left the Matrix but he is now in a coma.  The sentinels are continuing to bore down on Zion and Morpheus and Trinity learn that Neo, while not being plugged into the Matrix, is actually in the Matrix, but not where they might expect him to be...<br />What follows from there is nothing short of one of the most intelligently written and wonderfully acted films where the action sequence with the sentinels getting into Zion in an epic battle and Neo and Trinity's efforts to reach the machine capital will have you, the lucky moviegoer, on the edge of your seat the whole way, hoping and praying that everybody will make it...<br />Overall, I highly recommend &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; and of course the first two films as they can be described as nothing less than an incredible cinematic experience and that these films will most certainly go into the history books as classics in the genre.  To those who have viewed this last film in the series negatively, I would definitely recommend another viewing with a more open mind, letting the movie maker's vision of the films direction through as opposed to your own.  {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features:<br />-Revolutions Recalibrated<BR>-CG Revolution<BR>-Super Burly Brawl<BR>-Future Gamer:  The Matrix Online<BR>-Before the Revolution<BR>-3-D Evolution
B00004T9UF|5.0|This is by far Eminem's greatest album he has ever done.  There's no question that it's one of the best albums of all time.  It sold an amazing 1.76 million in its first week, which is now a new record for a solo artist.  I don't care if you love him or hate him, you can't say that he doesn't have any talent.  The best songs are &quot;The Way I Am&quot; &quot;Criminal&quot; and &quot;Stan.&quot;  Every rap fan will like this album and I suggest that all of you buy it.
B00005NB8K|3.0|Oliver Stone has a creative imagination and uses it well in this biography of the legendary '60's rock band &quot;The Doors&quot;. Unfortunately, Stone forgets that most of the people portrayed in this movie are still very much alive and have a much better memory than he does! The music is fantastic, Val Kilmer is pretty good as the legendary Jim Morrison (a little too pretty maybe as Morrison always looked a little rough around the edges!) but I hope nobody leaves this movie thinking this is how it was. Buy &quot;The Doors: VH1 Storytellers&quot; to get a hint of what this band was about!
B000067IZ3|3.0|Traffic opens with a banner on the screen announcing the filmic location to be Mexico, \\"twenty miles southeast of Tijuana.\\" The film is grainy and has a decidedly yellow (although some have romanticized this color, calling it sepia) tone, and the audience is introduced to two State Police officers, Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro) and Manolo Sanchez (Jacob Vargas), who are speaking Spanish. The dialogue begins with Javier explaining a nightmare to Manolo. Later, Javier and Manolo capture some drug transporters, the audience is introduced to the corrupt General Salazar (Tomas Milian), and the scene shifts to Columbus Ohio, where the graining is removed and the film is saturated with rich blue tones. Two minutes later, San Diego in all its beauty, arrives on screen.<br />The audience is immediately alerted to the difference between the United States and Mexico. Not only through language, but also through Soderbergh's use of the tobacco filter.  But this should not be surprising; establishing differences between the two countries is necessary for Soderbergh to maintain the hierarchical position of the United States over Mexico.  And, this hierarchization is, I argue, why Soderbergh is able to critique America, vis-à-vis U.S. drug policy, while still garnering critical and popular praise: implicating Mexico as the agent of America's woes and advancing stereotypical representations of both Mexico and Hispanics, effectively deposits Mexico and its inhabitants into the ancillary position of the U.S./Mexico binary.<br />Richard Porton's article in Cinéaste discusses the process Soderbergh goes through to create the yellowing of the Mexico scenes in the film. More importantly, in articulates the implications of Soderbergh's yellowing all of Mexico: &quot;[Soderbergh] shot the Mexican sections 'through a tobacco filter' and then overexposed the film to imbue these vignettes with an oversaturated look. Mexico, therefore, becomes a miragelike, evanescent realm where life is cheap and morality is infinitely expendable. As film scholar and Latin American specialist Catherine Benamou observes, the movie 'posits an historical and moral hierarchy between the postmodern United States--which has to retrieve its moral foundations and family values--and premodern Mexico, which has presumably never been able to draw the line between the law and lawlessness'&quot; (42) Significant about the hierarchy advanced by Benamou is that Mexico is implicated on both sides.<br />First, the film certainly portrays Mexico as a place of lawlessness. This is seen in the opening sequence with the drug transporters: not only are they breaking the law by transporting illegal substances, but General Salazar's intervention highlights (if not immediately, then certainly later in the film) the lawlessness of the federal authorities. Lawlessness is witnessed again twenty-one minutes into the film when two American tourists are pleading for Javier's help in finding their stolen car; here, the corruption of the state authorities is illuminated by Javier's having to give the couple the phone number of a man whom they will pay, who, in turn, will pay the police to make their car appear. And, of course, the hit man Frankie Flowers (Clifton Collins, Jr.) being Hispanic and living in Mexico continues to fortify the notion of Mexico as lawless.  Moreover, Soderbergh's representations of Mexicans as savages vis-à-vis the torturing of Frankie Flowers by General Salazar's men also accounts for Benamou's description of Mexico as premodern. The only thing that seems strange is General Salazar yelling to his men that \\"we are not savages,\\" as if the exclamations of a corrupt official enmeshed in drug trafficking could somehow erase the scenes of stereotypic barbarism that Soderbergh captures through his tobacco filter.<br />Second, by yellowing all the Mexico sequences in the film, Mexico is implicated as the agent which has, as Benamou states, led the \\"postmodern United States\\" astray from its \\"moral foundations and family values,\\" which it must now retrieve. Wood explains that by \\"beginning with the yellow camera filters, Soderbergh insinuates that nearly all Mexicans are somehow involved in the drug trade\\" (761). But the yellowing of Mexico implicates both the people and the land; Wood further states that \\"from the highest echelons of power to the street dealers and sidemen, Soderbergh's portrayal of life across the border establishes Mexico (and by extension, all of Latin America) as the fountain of evil that is the drug trade\\" (760). <br />Since, as Porton claims, Soderbergh's film is \\"primarily obsessed with how drugs have befouled the American family nest\\" (42), the argument is thus: (1) Benamou states that the U.S. is in a hierarchical position to Mexico but must still retrieve its moral foundations and family values; (2) these foundations and values are being destroyed by drugs (as seen via the Wakefield family); (3) yellowing the Mexico sequences implicates (nearly) all of Mexico and its inhabitants in the drug trade; (4) therefore, the disintegration of family values and morals in America is a result of lawless Mexico.  <br />In this light, Mexico is doubly culpable: one, Mexico's own lawlessness has averted its progression into a postmodern stage of development; two, Mexico's premodernity and lawlessness has thwarted the United States and threatens to derail their progression to the next stage of cultural development, which allows Soderbergh to make his critique of the United States. Traffic can adduce the United States as a country lacking in morals and family values, but only by simultaneous producing a scapegoat that Americans can point to as the entity responsible for their woes. Wood observes that, by portraying Javier as a \\"noble soldier while nearly all his compatriots fall prey to kidnapping, assassination, torture, and betrayal, Traffic offers a skewed portrait of Mexican society in getting its anti-drug message across to U.S. audiences\\" (760).
B000002HRE|5.0|Re-Load is still a great album, despite some of the reviews at amazon.  The problem is everyone compares this album to greats like &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; and &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, instead of comparing it to the world today. This album will always kick arse over most of the album in your collection.  Songs to listen for are Carpe Diem Baby, Devil's Dance, The Unforgiven II, Better Than You and Fixxxer.
B0000797IO|4.0|Can Jennifer Aniston do anyting better than &quot;Rachel&quot; after the successful TV drama that went on very long (or too long)?  &quot;The Good Girl&quot; is the answer.  Yes, she can, and in a surprising way.<br />Justine (Aniston) is working at a mini-mart in Nowhereville, Texas, completely dissatisfied with the humdrum life with her pot-smoking husband (John C. Reiley), who just doesn't care anything about his life.  Her work is boring, always in a drab uniform which makes eveything in her life quite hopeless.<br />But one day, she notices that a young boy working in the same shop is interested in her.  She is attracted to this boy (Jake Gyllenhaal, &quot;Donnie Darko&quot;) who has, however, a slightly troublesome tendency.  He calls himself &quot;Holden&quot; because, yes, he identified himself with that anti-hero of &quot;Catcher in the Rye,&quot; and like Holden, this boy perhaps thinks too much.<br />Now, Justine thinks: &quot;Could this strange boy is the last and only help offered to her?&quot;  Can she escape from the dull reality of life?  And if escape, how and where?  It's the same case as Madame Bovary, whose name is briefly referred to in the film.<br />&quot;The Good Girl,&quot; written by Mike White (who wrote alarmingly unique &quot;Chuck and Buck&quot;), follows the life of Justine with a wry humor.  Written with skewed perspectives, the film is never predictable, giving us a few surprising moments and one very serious decision Justine has to make.  It is effectively supported by original characters played by Tim Blake Nelson, Zooey Deschanel, Deborah Rush, and Mike White himself as church-going guard.<br />Its dark humor is not for everybody's taste, and the undercurrent statement on life is often disturbing.  But Jennifer Aniston's acting as Justine is strong (though you may  still see something of Rachel in her.)  The film, in its own quiet way, will make you grin, and then think ... think particularly about life as it is, not as it shouldbe.

B00005JM02|5.0|Finding Nemo has got to be one of the better animated films in a long time.  A clown fish named Marlin travels the waters off the east coast of Australia after losing his son Nemo to a human.  Marlin's journey to save his son is filled with memorable characters (including a fish with a bad memory and sharks that have forsworn eating fish) and lots of action.  Meanwhile, Nemo's imprisonment in a dentist's aquarium also has its share of memorable characters and humorously &quot;tense&quot; moments.  The climax coming when the dentist's precocious (to put it nicely) niece shows up for her surprise gift of a pet fish -- Nemo.  The movie's animation is wonderful...with the possible exception of the few human characters...I thought they could have been animated a bit better.  This minor point aside, Finding Nemo should be seen by all...young and young-at-heart alike.

B00005T343|3.0|Actually, I give it 2.5 stars, but Amazon doesn't let us use a ten-point system.<br />I first rented Manhunter in the late '80s.  Years later, when I saw Silence of the Lambs in the theater, I recognized the name of the doctor and realized that these two works were somehow related, and eventually ended up reading all four of Thomas Harris' novels and seeing all five film adaptations, of which Manhunter is my personal favorite.<br />I resisted the urge to buy Hannibal in hardcover, and forced my self to wait for the paperback; once I started reading, I could hardly put it down!  I plowed through the novel in about ten days, anticipating the ending as the various plot elements moved forward at breakneck speed, tensely and gradually weaving themselves together.  Then I got to the last fifty pages or so, and let's just say Ted Tally gave this story a far better ending than Thomas Harris did, much as Red Dragon would have been a better novel if it had ended about fifteen pages earlier.<br />As I awaited the paperback, I heard rumors that Jodi Foster had turned down playing Starling in the film version of Hannibal because she didn't think it was true to the character.  Frankly, I think it's awfully arrogant and presumptuous when an actor thinks he has more insight into a character he's been hired to play than does the author who created the character in the first place!  But once I finished reading the paperback, it seemed to me that Foster had made the right choice, if the rumors about her not liking the ending were true.  On the other hand, though, since Ted Tally scripted a superior ending, it's too bad she didn't show up.  Moore does the best she can with what she's been given, though, so it seems unfair to compare her performance to what Foster's might have been like.<br />Other than the ending, and a one-page explanation of Hannibal the Cannibal's origin, the film also has to change around a number of the novel's plot elements in order to translate from page to screen.  Unfortunately, some of the best parts also got lost in the translation.  The Mason Verger of the novel would have required CGI or an animatronic puppet, plus a voice actor.  Instead, the character is literally fleshed out more for the film, and the role then given to a well-known actor in some serious make-up -- and somehow, something is lost.  It's not Gary Oldman's fault, mind you, the character just loses some menace in translation.  <br />Gone also is Mason's sister, and her subplot, and a much more interesting fate for him as well.  Verger's attorney and nurse are combined into a single character, and again, we lose something.  Liotta, who has been much better in some of his films, fails to come through on playing a character that was already just barely believable enough to be acceptable in the novel -- although to be fair this might be Ridley Scott's or Ted Tally's fault.  And Crawford has been removed completely, although his part in the novel was rather small. <br />Also, the horror, tension and suspense that were so palpably present in the novel -- and that made it such a page-turner -- have been replaced with blood, gore, guts, and graphic violence.  Too bad, but I admit that it would have been pretty hard to recreate the mood and atmosphere of the novel on film in the first place, and while the slashings aren't an adequate replacement, they really aren't any worse than a lot of other mainstream contemporary films, so I'll give Scott a bit of a pass there.  (Then again, he did make the horror, tension and suspense work in Alien, so why not in Hannibal...?)<br />Let's face it, the only reason Manhunter got \\"re-imagined\\" as Red Dragon was because some perverted completists thought it was an abomination to have a version without Hopkins as Lector.  Upon hearing this, the film already had a strike against in it in my book, having seen how awful Tony looked with shoe-polish in his hair during that flashback scene with Gary Oldman in Hannibal -- and we allknow the camera lens used for that sequence was chosen at least as much for taking twenty years off of Hopkins (unsuccessfully, I might add) as it was for making it appear a hazy, drug-dazed memory of Mason Verger. (Tony was getting too old to play Lector in Hannibal, and he WAS too old to play him in Red Dragon, especially given that the story takes place ten years earlier.)  <br />Manhunter's Brian Cox had a different take on the Lector character than Hopkins, but it was ultimately A) closer to the novel's depiction and B) more realistic and believable.  Sorry, Tony, but you have to admit, as great as your performance was in Silence of the Lambs, Lector comes off much better when the actor playing him resists the urge to chew scenery -- no pun intended.... In Hannibal, however, Hopkins manages to deliver a more than adequate performance, even if it isn't Oscar-worthy.<br />Over all, Scott's direction works, as does the score, both especially so in the final scenes of the film -- you know, that part where Tally so greatly improved upon Harris?  Seriously, if you read the book but hated the ending, don't be afraid to give the film a try.  And if you liked the movie, you'll like the book even better -- just do yourself a favor and stop reading when it becomes obvious that it isn't going to end like the movie does -- you'll thank me....<br />PS: Why is it that when most people review books and films on Amazon, A) they seem not to notice that most of what they say has already been said in the hundreds of other reviews previously posted, and B) they seem to feel obligated to recount the entire plot, point by point, spoiler by spoiler, in excruciating detail, instead of just giving the rest of us a simple idea of why we might like or dislike the book or film in question?!

B00006BCAZ|3.0|If you're like most people reading PT reviews, you're here because you loved the brilliant In Absentia and you want to try more.  This is probably not what you're looking for, being entirely made up of spacey instrumental jams, with some annoying and way-too-long \\"radio\\" playing and an annoying and way-too-long \\"interview\\" sort of thing at the end.<br /><br />In Absentia fans should move straight on to the Stars Die compilation, featuring the amazing 20-minute \\"The Sky Moves Sideways\\" (phase 1.)

0393037010|5.0|I read this book for the first time almost two years ago.  Since then Jack and Stephen have been a part of my life.  I have read the series almost three times, and everytime I find more that I understand and appreciate.  Patrick O'Brian is excrutiatingly accurate with his historical facts, and one of the best things about the series is how strong a sense a reader gets of the time period and culture.  Well written and facinating, I heartily reccomend this book to anyone.  Even if you don't know much about naval life and the language, it is still worth reading.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|I don't think anything justifies the awful reviews people gave this movie. I've seen it about 4 times and I don't see what's so wrong with it. Fortunately, I'm not a person who much cares what the public thinks. I admit this movie isn't exactly Citizen Kane but I didn't expect it to be the best movie I'd ever seen. I just think it was a well thought-out, action-packed finale with visual effects that were the best anyone today is capable of. Until I saw the special features I wasn't sure what was real and what wasn't. And considering all the complete pieces of crap that get made every year in hollywood, I hardly think it's fair to give this movie one star. And don't talk to me about bad movies. I have a sister who's into horror movies.
B00006690G|1.0|Eminem is nowhere near being the greatest rapper ever. That title goes to a man named Tupac Shakur. Eminem could never hope to even be on the same PLANET at Tupac, much less actually better than him. Eminem is a fad who will die down in the next couple years, when his teeny bopper fanbase moves on to the next &quot;in&quot; thing. This album, like all his others, is mediocre at best, complete crap at worst. Now, if you want a REAL classic album, but &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot; instead. That album easily destroys any Eminem album.<br />So recognize and realize. The greatest rapper of all time died September 13th 1996.....
1581650701|5.0|I am not much of a reader, but Watchers was a book I could not put down.  The suspense never stops.  This book is impossible not to read because the plot is very exciting and interesting.  The characters are very believable.  Another reason this book is so awesome is that this book gets you so involved that it seems like everything could really happen.  <BR>I love the way that Dean Koontz describes the emotions of both animals and humans.  The whole book is a maze of adventures that leads you to one horrifying discovery. That has to end with the death of someone.  In this book something is trying to kill Travis Cornell (the main character) and a genetically engineered dog that he found.  The creature that is trying to get them has no mercy, so Travis has no mercy for it, but at the end Dean actually makes you pity the mounstrous animal.  Read this book and you will love it.
0385510438|5.0|I don't know if the title of my review makes sense to you; it does to me.<br />Grisham's fast-paced legal thrillers are driven by the story.  In these, the characters are second to the story.  While these books are enjoyable, the characters are sketched, not developed.<br />In The Last Juror, I became acquainted with the people of the town.  I would like to have met some of them in person.  Others, I would have crossed the street to avoid.<br />Miss Callie, Willie Traynor....if you are ever in my town, stop by for a cup of coffee and a piece of pie.

B00003RQNJ|5.0|Released in 1969, Butch Cassidy And The Sun Dance Kid became a popular hit, a kind of classy Western parody. It has remained very popular to this day. On DVD with special features, including commentary from the director and actors, it's a great treat for fans of the film who remember seeing it back in '69. Directed by George Roy Hill (who would later direct The Sting) and written by William Goldman of The Princess Bride and Stepford Wives fame. It stars Paul Newman as Butch Cassidy, an idealistic, impetuous and daring bad boy whose ambition is to rob banks and make it big in a trail of fortune that extends to South America, specifically Bolivia. Robert Redford plays his sidekick, Sun Dance Kid, who is more realistic and level-headed. This is a Western but at the same time it seems to mock the genre. Butch's character is lively and adventuresome in a blatant way that is not present in Western heroes. The immense use of humor in the film and music that seems inappropriate to a Western makes it a humorous film. I especially laughed at the scenes in which Butch and Sun Dance had trouble translating Spanish into English to get the money they wanted from the hapless villagers. This seemed to come up a number of times and it's especially funny because the Spanish speaking villagers don't quite grasp what is going on. <br />The music score is a bit unusual. There is no heroic sounding themes or Western ballads. Instead we get music that was popular in 1969, such as \\"Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head\\" both the vocals and the instrumental versions. The jazzy, upbeat and fugue-style madrigal type of group singing in \\"South American Getaway\\" (which was used in a car commercial recently) as the heroes escape on horseback is also quite unusual. It's a great film that looks beautiful (shot on location in South America) and has great acting, a great script. Everyone loves this film. It's a movie everyone can agree on. Too bad it did'nt win any awards. It certainly deserved some type of recognition. But 1969 was a very big year and in the wake of modern cinema, Midnight Cowboy won the Best Picture Oscar instead.

B00005MCX2|5.0|This is one of the finest documents of Hawkwind as they were in their halcyon years. It transcends the limitations of the labels traditionally attached to this band, and is simply a classic album of great rock music performed by a band near the zenith of its form. Frankly, it's as important that you have this in your record collection as it is to have Led Zeppelin IV, Dark Side of the Moon or Disraeli Gears.
B000002JR8|5.0|anyone who says pantera's second album,&quot;vulgar display of power&quot;is better than &quot;far beyond driven&quot; must be a kid rock fan.period.this album was their absolute apex(before phil got into heroine really bad,and dime and vinne decided to try to go mainsteam),and shows why they were far better than both slayer AND metallica as far as meaningful,true lyrics and BOTH fast and slow music tempo.the heavy,grinding parts are unmatched in the songs &quot;I'm broken&quot;,&quot;5 min alone&quot;,and&quot;shedding skin&quot;.the faster songs are never over-repitituos and have awesome solos-&quot;strength beyond strength&quot;,and&quot;throes of rejection&quot;.and &quot;slaughtered&quot; is the song I play whenever I throw a kegger!&quot;planet caravan&quot;,the last song that bleeds in after &quot;throes&quot; and is an old sabbath cover off of their &quot;paranoid&quot;album.it's a total 180 from the rest of the cd and is a perfect closing song for the album-chilled as hell.also,it's funny cause in the album credits phil states&quot;we thought it was a tripped-out song.if you don't like it,don't f---in' listen to it.&quot;.anyway,just be glad Pantera put out probably the best EXTREME heavy metal album of all time before losing gas and getting bloated.

B0001BKAEY|4.0|The final entry in the Matrix trilogy will disappoint some - probably many of those who weren't hardcore Matrix fans.  Picking up where the last movie left off (and I'm not going to regale you with what the Matrix is about, because if you haven't seen either of the other movies, you really have no business watching \\"Revolutions\\"), the humans' hidden city of Zion faces certain annihilation by the \\"Machine Army\\".  <br />(Okay - in a distant future, a civilization of intelligent machines enslaves almost all humanity, using human bio-energy to power themselves; the unfortunate humans who are born and ultimately die while tapped by the machines remain oblivious to their fate because their consciousness remains trapped in a vast virtual reality known as the matrix; the first flick taught us how existence their was split between the consciousness  of those imprisoned there and AI programs who kept order; \\"Reloaded\\" added an interesting spin - AI programs were depicted as sophisticated, able to mathematically deduce what were seemingly human feelings of love, lust, frustration, dissension and regret; outside the Matrix, a hidden city of humans liberated from the machines battles the vastly superior machine civilization, but the machines take the war to the humans' city).<br />At the end of the last movie, Neo (Reeves) found out that he was not destined by fate to save mankind from the machines - but actually chosen by the machines as part of their order in which Zion is repeatedly created and then destroyed (Neo had encountered the god-like \\"Architect\\", who informed our hero that he was only the latest of several versions of himself - a significant part of a pattern of the creation and destruction of Zion; the machines, being essentially equation-crunching computers, thrive on predictable patterns;  it's our free choice, not just our freedom, that sets us apart from the machines).  Though the machines are assured of their victory over the humans, they've got problems of their own - namely the AI program Agent Smith (Weaving).  Once only a cog keeping order in the Matrix, Smith was apparently destroyed by Neo in \\"The Matrix\\".  In \\"Reloaded\\", we learnt that only his connection to the AI was destroyed, but Smith himself not only remained in existence, but found the power to turn others in the Matrix into clones of himself.  By the end of \\"Reloaded\\", Smith was able to make the biggest jump of all - cloning himself onto one of Zion's agents and leaping into the next world in the body of a human.  In \\"Revolutions\\", the humans face an awesome attack by the machines.  Neo and Trinity fight to reach the main AI at the center of the machines' city while Morpheus and Niobe race time and a fleet of the Machines' sentinels to reach their own.  Meanwhile, within the Matrix itself, Smith consolidates his power by cloning everything into himself.<br />\\"Revolutions\\" is very much a mixed bag - the metaphysics and plotlines developed in the first two movies are not entirely served by the comparatively abrupt ending.  Also, the plot separates characters who should remain together - Trinity joins Neo on his futile journey to the machines because that plays up the romance angle of the flick, but shouldn't it be Morpheus who goes along?  (Before Trinity fell in love with Neo, it was Morpheus who believed in him, and it was Morpheus's faith that was shattered at the end of \\"Reloaded\\" - what better way, in a story about predestination and free-choice, to develop a character than by showing it acting first on perceived fate, then by free-choice?)  That aside, \\"Revolutions\\" is still an adrenaline-soaked feast for the eyes, one that pushes the boundaries of what you can show, even in wide-screen format.  The climactic attack on Zion - in which humans battle clouds of sentinels, and mammoth drill robots, easily outstrips the lame all-CGI battles of the last \\"Star Wars\\" movies (it's sort of a mix between \\"Starship Troopers\\" and Tolkein).  For a CGI fest, \\"Revolutions\\" leans heavily on some very human FX - Morpheus is still loveable for his pseudo-zen koans, while Hugo Weaving's deadpan delivery will keep him as cinema's most chillingly convincing manifestation of artificial intelligence.  Also, special kudos to Ian Bliss, a human who becomes Smith's vessel in the \\"real\\" world, and gives us all a valuable how-to-sound-like-Hugo Weaving lesson.  If you want a nice and tidy story, go watch \\"Star Trek\\".  For a more complicated ride, plug into the Matrix.
B00006FDCD|2.0|This movie was good the first time, but boring after that. The characters are interesting as kids, but are boring as grown-ups. Tim Curry was great as the clown. Definatly the highlight of the movie. It is missing a lot of the most interesting parts of the book, but the book was way too long.

B0001EBXBK|4.0|What a delightful romp through various genres and at sometimes breathtaking speed.  We barely came up for breath before they were off again.  <br />Yes it's violent but in somewhat of a cartoon way (at least for the most part - there are some rather disturbing images).  <br />Now I'm primed for Kill Bill 2 (I have no doubt it will hold me hostage just as much as this one did).<br />This is one that you will want to watch more than once (one of our criteria for buying rather than renting) and share (another criterion).<br />Enjoy!
0767836324|4.0|I was totally enthralled by the dazzling remake of J.M. Barrie's classic story of the boy who did not grow up that came out last year from director P.J. Hogan.  So I decided to go back and reconsider Steven Spielberg's 1991 film &quot;Hook.&quot;  In this version it turns out that Peter Pan did grow up.  He fell in love with Wendy's granddaughter, Moira, decided to stay in our world, and does not remember anything that happened before the age of 12.  With heavy-handed irony, Peter turns out to be a corporate raider (in other words, a pirate), who not only does not remember what it is like to be a child, he also ignores his own children.  However, that all changes when Captain Hook makes his way to Granny Wendy's London home and kidnaps Peter's two children, Jack and Maggie.  Tinkerbell shows up to help Peter remember who he is and take him to Never-Land to save the day.<br />A lot of Spielberg's films deal with the theme of the absent father and clearly a key part of &quot;Hook&quot; is that Peter, the father, remembers not only his true self but his own children.  But the film does not provide the sense of magic we expect from Spielberg and I want to make the argument that the problem is not so much the story as it is the casting.  You simply cannot have Robin Williams in a movie like this and not expect him to be Robin Williams, which means that several key scenes get spun in a way that is not necessarily in the best interest of the story.  Throw into the mix Dustin Hoffman having fun playing Captain Hook, Bob Hoskins having almost as much fun playing Smee, and Julia Roberts as a very talkative Tinkerbell, and you have a lot of star power running around on screen.<br />The problem for me is what happens to Rufio, King of the Lost Boys, because that event changes the whole equation at play here.  Because of what happens Peter cannot let Captain Hook off the hook, yet that is exactly what he does.  I suppose it was too much for either Peter Pan or Robin Williams to do what had to be done in those circumstances, but this forces the film to come up with a way to have the right thing happen, albeit it in a comic way, without Peter having to get his hands dirty.  Still I came back to what happened to Rufio and as the end game plays out in Never-Land I know in my heart that this is just not right.<br />The idea that the casting of the principles is off is confirmed for me when we get back to London town.  The reaction of Caroline Goodall's Moira when her children come back and Maggie Smith's performance from start to finish as Granny Wendy seem to me to be grounded in the film that this one should have been.  If Dame Maggie had been the only recognizable name in this film and the others had been even relative unknowns, then the message in &quot;Hook&quot; might have worked.  In other words, this needed to be a Steven Spielberg film and not a Robin Williams movie.  There is a lot of power to be mined from Barrie's original story, which is exactly what Hogan proved in creating the best &quot;Peter Pan&quot; movie of them all.do what had to be done in those circumstances, but this forces the film to come up with a way to have the right thing happen, albeit it in a comic way, without Peter having to get his hands dirty.

B00005JLSE|2.0|Honestly now... with the exception of ALL THAT JAZZ, I think if you've seen one Bob Fosse movie musical...you've just about seen them all. They're all simply reduced to a form of soft porn. That's it. And its worse now -- there's no more real dancers. Performers yes. Standing in the middle of the screen and shaking their booty and spreading their legs, well...you can see that at your local topless bar. Where are the new Ann Reinkings or Tommy Tunes? It would have been great if this movie was made 10 years ago and a younger Christopher Walken was allowed to play the lawyer part. Now he's a dancer. A dancer that could have lit a fire to that tap dancing number; as opposed to Richard Gere &quot;simulating&quot; a few tap dance steps. (I think the use of a gerbil could have helped him in that number). And can you remember any knock-out tune from this musical? I doubt it. Yeah, I'm rough on this flick. It's a dance musical -- with celebrities &quot;moving around&quot; as if they're a bunch of kids playing make-believe to a recording; though as adults, they're able to spice it up some by showing a bit of T&amp;A. No thanks. They're lowering the bar again. Lets get some real talent back up there, eh? We already lost story-line and drama flicks to FX; now we've lost dance musicals to celebrities. It's sad. Really sad, and I'm very disappointed.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|From the creator of Buffy and Ahgel comes a third series, FIREFLY. What's there to know, well it's set 500 years in the future, where the Earths resources have been used up, so a whole new verse full or planets and moons have been terraformed to support the human race, some are rich with new technologies, some not so much....<br />The series is amazing, it takes charecter-driven stories, with an ensemble cast, fantastic script writing, award winning special effects and then adds that little bit of &quot;Wheadon Wit&quot;, that fan of Buffy and Angel are all too familiar with.<br />Basically it's an intelligent SciFi drama with moments of intense levity.....If your looking for somthing that doesn't treat you like a four-year-old (&quot;STar Trek - The Next Generation&quot;, for example), buy this DVD NOW!!!
B00000420F|4.0|Cecilia Bartoli is nothing short of amazing.  Her voice is very well exercised being able to have a wide range and ton color for each individual piece.  This CD includes over an hour, (approximately 66 minutes) of music with a total of 21 songs.  I found each one breathtaking and inspiring.  Her voice is accompanied only by piano, which is also well done.  It probably would have been better if an orchestra accompanied some of the songs to add distinction.  That way they all would not have seemed as similar as they sometimes did.  <br />She had wonderful control over her voice while holding notes for a long time, or hitting higher notes.  I am just amazed by her experience.  Overall this CD is simply a good listen.  If you like opera, than you much check out Cecilia Bartoli's singing!
B000000OAA|4.0|There are some delightful moments on Sheer Heart Attack, but mostly it's interesting in that it shows what Freddie and the team were aspiring to, rather than what they had achieved to date.<br />I don't think Queen had quite the mastery of the studio or their own technique here, and on some tracks it shows. Most glaringly, on opener Brighton Rock Freddie is obliged to abandon falsetto and drop an octave not just mid-way through a line, but in the middle of a word, which I am pretty sure isn't from the bombastic-operatic lead vocalist textbook that Freddie eventually helped to write. Also, Brian May's early experiments with an echoplex, while game, in truth are a bit of a mess (especially compared with the level of proficiency he showed during the (much later) performance of Brighton Rock on &quot;Live Killers&quot;).<br />Elsewhere the album shows the unevenness we've come to know and love in Queen albums: as well as Killer Queen, the tracks Tenement Funster and Now I'm Here are absolute crackers; She Makes Me and the appropriately titled Misfire are less successful.<br />Af first glance, it is surprising that the one track not included is the ostensible title track - surprising, that is, until you remember that the song wasn't written for a couple of years after this album was released. And anyway, it's a good excuse (were one needed) to buy the exquisite News of the World, which for my money is Queen's finest record, on which Sheer Heart Attack does appear.<br />Olly Buxton
B0000C7PSW|5.0|WANT ONE is an amazing tour de force from Rufus Wainwright.... I fell in love with him after seeing him perform &quot;Across the Universe&quot; on the John Lennon tribute, shortly after 9/11.  His first two albums are masterpieces in their own rights, but Want One is a complete and amazing overview of his life and times.  <BR>The orchestrations, while, yes, so layered and lush and so much more &quot;over-produced&quot; than his last offerings, are beautiful and emotional.  &quot;Oh What A World&quot; can make me laugh at the world we do live in.... &quot;I Don't Know What It Is&quot; could be a full scale Broadway extravaganza.... &quot;Go Or Go Ahead&quot; starts out soft and slow but builds to a stunningly beautiful crescendo that makes me cry whenever I hear it.... &quot;Vibrate&quot; is an amusing take on our society in general and a sad insight into one's longing for love..&quot;my phone's on vibrate for you... so call me...&quot;<BR>I could go on and on but each song is a gem, a small work of art, and definitely worth a listen.  There are so many influences in Rufus' music... Elton John, Harry Nilsson, Leonard Cohen, John Lennon, even (to my ears) Peter Allen. <BR>He is a true musical genius of our time and I just don;t understand why he hasn;t hit the &quot;Big Time&quot; yet!!!
B0000AQVCL|1.0|When I've listened to this CD I wonder why I'm not listening to Oasis or ANY other band instead. There's nothing on it that isn't generic and predictable, like a cartoon of 50's rock. It has energy, yes, but so do many much better bands that also have depth and soul. Try Stellastarr* for instance, if you want music that not only gets you going, but has some staying power and EDGE. This is ridiculous. I just want to know who Jet's publicists are. Whoever they are, they are awesome.
B000068IEU|1.0|On the way to a Bloodlust concert, two teenage girls stop in a rough area to try and buy some weed. They get taken to an apartment where four escaped felons kidnap them. They eventually take them out to the countryside where they humiliate, rape, and kill them. Ironically, the countryside is one of the girls' backyard. The killers take up with the girl's parents, who when finding out about the killing take up revenge.<BR>Wes Craven tries to use light music and comedy angles to make light out of the rape and murder scenes. The ending was predictable and the last 30 minutes of the movie is completely stupid.<BR>Another movie this is compared to is I Spit On Your Grave. Like that movie, this one attempts to make you hate several characters and then then give you the satisfaction to watch them die. The problem with them both is that they attempt humour where there should be none. The victims in both also put themselves through more humiliation in order to get revenge.<BR>There is not even any good gore. This movie is for rape scene freaks only.
B00005JMEW|4.0|Kill Bill may not have exceeded or surpassed in excellence the masterfully executed Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, or even Jackie Brown, but it certainly was an enjoyment to watch, as well as stocked full of artistic innovation. With far more depth than its plot suggests, this movie runs like a hybrid between Austin Powers and Natural Born Killers, replete with action, animation, surrealism, scenes shot in black and white, and plenty of gore, blood, beheadings, and other stomach churning visions of violence. Heavily influenced by speghetti Westerns, 1960s martial art flicks, and 70s imagery, Kill Bill is a refreshing cinematic experience as compared to the slew of mundane &quot;feel good&quot; films that make up the majority of Hollywood movies. The only thing I felt that Kill Bill lacked was the usual highly humorous dialogue that has been the trademark of Tarantino movies. Also, the drawn out bloodletting at the end of the movie in which Uma Thurman takes on a countless number of sword welding samurais and wins, was a 20 or so minute scene that was difficult to suspend my disbelief for, however, when one realizes that Kill Bill was in many ways attempting to emulate cheesy 60s martial art films, its easier to appreciate the artistic value, and the fight scenes were surely more entertaining than the unresolved, ultra-macho, juvenile excrement of the Matrix films.
B00006879E|5.0|This album is fantastic! It has to be the best album I've heard this year. I would have love to be Jane: the muse that inspired these brilliant songs! Buy this album - you won't regret it!
6300215717|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite Audrey Hepburn movies.  In &quot;Roman Holiday,&quot; Audrey plays a reluctant princess who escapes from her repressive royal life to have a one-day adventure in Rome... with Gregory Peck.  This is a classic 1950s fairy tale romantic comedy.<br />It's hard to believe that &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; was Audrey's first major film, because she's fabulous in it!  She has a certain grace and charm that is unequaled.  The Academy clearly agreed... Audrey won the Best Actress Oscar for her role as Princess Ann.<br />What most people don't know is that the script was an original creation by the famous screenwriter, Dalton Trumbo.  Trumbo had already been blacklisted for refusing to answer HUAC's questions regarding his possible Communist affiliations.  Trumbo was sentenced to a year in prison, and he spent his last few months of freedom working diligently on the &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; script.  He was able to sell the script (for much lower than his usual price) by putting a friend's name on it.  The money he earned from &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; took care of his family's needs while he was in jail.<br />&quot;Roman Holiday&quot; is a fun, family-friendly romantic comedy.  I highly recommend it!
B00004ZAV3|2.0|I have been listening to this for a while as one of the only Beatles CDs I have,  and until 'Sgt. Pepper's' and 'Let It Be' came into my posession and I really got into the Beatles, I thought it was pretty good. Then, after I finished comparing them, I realized, for one thing, that those were definitely not the best recordings of the songs, and for anoher, it sounds like Paul McCartney turned up his bass sound so loud you can't hear any of the song. In conclusion, if you're strapped for cash, and must have the most Beatles you can get, buy it, but if you have a few more bucks to spend, go for albums like 'Sgt. Pepper', 'Let it Be', 'Abbey Road', 'Magical Mystery Tour' and 'Please Please Me'.
B0001HAISG|5.0|Peter Pan (2003) is one gorgeously produced film with lots of real heart put into it. One of those rare films where the dazzling special effects actually takes a back seat to just a great classic children's story to be told here. No corny musical interludes (where you've just got to hit the fast forward scan button) are to be found here. Jason Isaacs portrayal of Captain Hook has a excellent Basil Rathbone flavor to it. Mr. Isaacs also portray's Mr. Darling to equally great effect. I really enjoyed this movie. The DVD also features a alternate ending to see what happened to Wendy all grown up.<BR>Tons of &quot;making of&quot; extras. Sadly, no Director's commentary. <BR>I could go on and on about my admiration for this film. Til' Then, ENJOY.
1592400876|4.0|What can I say about this one?  I loved it, I loved it, I loved it.  Perhaps a book about punctuation sounds dry and boring to you.  If so, this is not the book you envision.  It has humor, history, usage, misuage (often hysterically funny), and a prescription for moving forward with punctuation as your friend.  Truss admits to being a grammarian and a stickler for correct punctuation usage but she's not so out of the real world as to suggest that we never change.  True, she laments some of the changes that seem to be occurring, often because they obscure the intended meaning of the sentence, but she is flexible enough to embrace language and its punctuation as a sort of organic being, offering passages properly punctuated by their authors during their times and what those same passages would properly look like today.  I was pleased to note, as I read through this, that I generally do a respectable job punctuating (all bets are off in my e-mails, incidentally) and that I knew most of the rules.  And perhaps that's why I emjoyed the book; the sense of recognition kept me nodding my head and saying, &quot;Of course!&quot; through so much of it.  Validation is always good, especially concerning quirks your family and friends find a bit odd!  I'd highly recommend this although I suspect that the people who would most benefit from reading it won't even register the title on their radar should they happen to walk past it on their way to the days &quot;Special's and Bargain's.&quot;

B00005JMJ4|2.0|There are two things wrong with this movie.  Its content and its execution.<br />First the content.  These characters are not sympathetic at all.  We're supposed to feel the pain and confusion of these two lost souls, one a recent graduate who has yet to define her life outside of a tag-along wife, and the second a famous actor whose mid-life circumstance leaves him richer than God but a shadow of his artistic past.  Neither is content in their career, their life, their marriage, or their future.  In finding each other they enjoy a nice respite in their otherwise noxious lives.  The problem is, these two are losers.  Instead of trying to correct their problems, they wallow in them.  Instead of improving themselves, they blame everything around them.  Tokyo stinks.  Japan stinks.  Wanna go home.  What a pair of sniveling whiners.  Fundamentally, how can anyone be sympathetic to two characters that have the opportunity to explore and immerse themselves in a different culture and face their challenges head on, who instead wallow in cigarettes and alcohol until happenstance brings these two losers together?  So what if it's a commentary on fleeting relationships?  A fleeting relationship between two annoying people is still annoying.<br />Second, execution.  Apparently this was supposed to be a comedy.  I didn't laugh once.  Some of the jokes were tired (Japanese guy talks for 3 minutes at 100 words/min, translation is \\"turn your head\\" - boy, that's original); some were lame (Bill Murray getting interviewed by gay talk show host); most were simply not funny (that ridiculous Britney Spears/LA caricature starlet comes to mind).   And make no mistake, this movie drags (if 10 minutes of lousy Karaoke singing is your thing, this is your movie.  I got tired after the first 3)...<br />And it drags... (at least 8 shot of our two protagonists watching subtitled TV at 4 am.  Riviting.)  <br />And it drags... (there is a completely useless scene of Bill playing golf with Mt Fuji in the background.  Beautiful scene, but it lasts 2 minutes and has NOTHING to do with ANYTHING - couldn't they work the beautiful shots into something?  Like a plot?)<br />This movie in no way deserved its awards or nominations.  It was not good.  There are far better movies, far more intellectual and better made, and without a doubt Daddy's influence alone pushed this movie along.  However, some of the shots are good, Bill does an adequate job acting, and truthfully as a date-movie it works (at least it did for me).<br />Oh, and that mysterious ending?  Since the whole point of the film was explore the nature of deep but fleeting relationships, clearly Bill told Scarlett that he will always remember the impression she made on him and their time in Japan.  Clearly she was upset at the lack of closure before he came up to her, and completely relieved afterwards.  Was it THAT hard to understand?  Was it really that mysterious?  It's another example of a very mediocre movie trying way too hard.<br />Oh yeah, the 7 minutes of trailers and commercials at the beginning of the DVD don't help the recommendation either.
0156027321|5.0|At the beginning of this book, the reader is informed that the main character, Pi Patel, survived a terrible ordeal aboard a life boat many years ago.  During the course of the book, Pi tells the story in great detail of how his zookeeper father attempted to move his family from India to Canada.  Pi, along with his parents and brother, was aboard a ship that sank.  He ended up on a life boat with a small group of animals, which his father was transporting to various zoos.  By his wits and by the grace of God, whom he worships as a Christian, Muslim and a Hindu, Pi does survive an experience which would have killed a person with less hope or fewer survival skills.  At the end, Pi is questioned by two Japanese men who represent the company who owned the ship that sank.  They do not believe his story and so Pi tells the story again, in a condensed form which changes many of the important details.  The reader is left with the dilemma as to which story is true.  This is an extemely creative book which you won't soon forget!
B000002BBY|5.0|Despite Oasis' big claim to be a much better band than The Beatles (lead singer Liam Gallagher even went as far to verbally attack George Harrison in an interview), as well as proclaiming to be the best band in the world, they have made some excellent, tasty music that's hard not to love. If you can ignore most of the embarrassing (and often laugh-out-loud hilarious) behavior attached to the band's mystique, you may just enjoy their music, too.<br />_(What's The Story) Morning Glory?_ is a non-stop train of tasty, ear-pleasing rock candy, with that, add in a little bit of swaggering attitude, and you have Oasis' niche. Songwriter (and sometimes, singer) Noel Gallagher has an excellent ear for melody.. even if most of his musings seem to be, more or less, stolen from The Beatles and their British Invasion contemporaries. If you're a music lover who is lamenting the lack of Britpop/British Invasion spin-offs in the popular music pantheon these days, or if you just want some loud, good-old fashioned rock n' roll, look into this album, and some of Oasis' other offerings. That's basically it for this review.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|This Christmas time romantic comedy has a stellar cast list filled with Britain's finest.  Hugh Grant, Keira Knightly, Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Alan Rickman all have starring roles.  Billy Bob Thornton also appears as the American president.<br />This movie features about 8 different relationships that are loosely inter-connected.  The characters are falling in and out of love and this movie captures many different types of relationships (siblings, friends, the romantically inclined, etc) - most ending happily ever after at Heathrow airport.  The beginning may be a bit confusing as there are disjointed shifts from one relationship to the next and many characters are introduced in a short time span.  Once you figure out who's who the shifts aren't as annoying and you can see linkages popping up amongst the characters.  The acting is brilliantly done, the lines are humerous and all in all it's a movie that makes you feel good.  <br />Viewers should be aware that there is a fair bit of nudity in the film as one of the relationships blosomming is between two people involved in making a porn movie.
B00000K0DQ|4.0|Tim Robbins presents in his movie &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; the subject capital punishment. But compared to many other directors who have also dealed with this matter Tim Robbins does not give the audience a didactic message. By using flashbacks and changes of perspectives he presents every side of the crime Poncelet commited. Showing the cruelty of the crime and the grief of the victim's families on the one hand and the development of Matt Poncelet and the sorrow of his family after the execution on the other hand makes the viewer contemplate. Do you have to atone for a murder by another murder?! These are the major aspects which make the viewer think. Think about his own opinion concerning the death penalty. <BR>The main reason why I gave this movie four stars is that Tim Robbins provides changes of perspective and does not try to push the audience in one direction. Consequently every viewer of the film gets the chance to change his opinion about the death penalty. Besides the great performances by Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon the film is worth seeing because it gives you the opportunity to see the matter capital punishment with other eyes.
B0001YFPL4|3.0|I LOVE ANASTACIA!!!! however her showing on this CD is nowhere near as great as the good from start to finish &quot;Freak Of Nature&quot; Anastacia does have some strong points and the sad part is that the strong points arent that strong. when i first heard Left Outside Alone i was like i hope that is not her first single! its grown on me but not that great of a song. However, Seasons Change and Time are great songs and anyone of those would have been a great first single not Left Outside Alone. Still a good CD though i would love to see I Do with Sonny from POD be a single as well great song. Great political message. CD is not that bad.
B000000P17|4.0|For some reason, a lot of people do not like this album.  Sure it's not as good as Appetite or the Illusion cds, but the Spaghetti Incident is still a really good album.<br />1.Since I Don't Have You-This doesn't seem like a song that GN'R would cover, but it is still pretty good.<br />2.New Rose-This is a punk song that Duff does vocals on.  It is fun to listen to.<br />3.Down on the Farm-One of my favorite tracks on this album.  It is really creative and fun to listen to.<br />4.Human Being-This song is awesome, although you can't tell what Axl is saying.<br />5.Raw Power-This song is pretty good, but not as good as the rest.<br />6.Ain't It Fun-Awesome song.  Axl's voice and the lyrics make it sound really dark.<br />7.Buick McKaine-Sort of a strange song, but the &quot;F*** you&quot; chant is really cool.<br />8. Hair of the Dog-This is my favorite song on the album.  It is a Nazareth cover, and rocks very hard.<br />9.Attitude-This is a punk song that is sung by Duff.  It is good, but too short.<br />10.Black Leather-Some people really like this song, others(like me)don't.  I guess it depends on your taste.<br />11.You Can't Put Your Arms Around A Memory-A ballady type song that Duff McKagen sings on, plus Duff plays the bass,guitar, and drums on this song as well.<br />12.I Don't Care About You-This song is really rebellious, and fun to listen to.<br />13.Look At Your Game Girl-This is a hidden track that you can find if you keep the cd playing after track 12.  It is actually very pretty, even though Charles Manson wrote it.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Damn! Fantastic album this was in the 80's and still is one of the best CD ever.  Set the bar for all metal and thrash after it. If you don't have it buy it you won't be sorry.
B00006690G|1.0|How can someone says that this is one of the best albums they have heard? How can someone even call this a music album? This is not music, is a guy talking and saying stupid stuff. Please, if you appreciate good music, you wont like this. And the sames goes for 50 cent, Snoop Dog, etc...
B0001HAISG|3.0|The acting was good, the special effects were very good, but it just seemed like I've seen this a million times before and there really was no point in making this film. Much of the dialog seemed to be lifted right from the cartoon or the play. Personally, I liked the cartoon Disney version much better. There was more charm and personality in it.
B0001HAHXW|4.0|Me &amp; Mr Johnson by Eric Clapton is a tribute album to singer-guitarist-songwriter Robert Johnson.  I am big fan of the blues and a huge Eric Clapton fan but I must admit to only knowing about Robert Johnson in passing. In the liner notes, Eric Clapton writes that he has been driven and influenced all his life with the work of Robert Johnson.<br />On this album, Eric Clapton covers 14 of the 29 songs Robert Johnson wrote in his career. In reading the reviews on Amazon, it's pretty clear that a lot of the Robert Johnson fans aren't very satisfied with Eric Clapton's tribute. Being a relative newbie to the music of Robert Johnson, I have to say I really liked this CD. I love blues and I love Eric Clapton and I think of this as a good Eric Clapton CD.<br />The one thing that this album did was make me interested in learning more about Robert Johnson. I am going to buy his 'The Complete Recordings' boxset to really appreciate this giant of blues music.
B000001FZK|5.0|This is one of the most absolutely beautiful albums I have ever heard.  Most of the songs contain little structure, and the outbursts of sound seem as though they were instantly inspired.  A slow, sad, and beautiful album that almost makes me ache to hear.  Plus these guys wrote that song that No Doubt covered, &quot;It's My Life.&quot;  Wow, they can do it all.
B0001Z363W|5.0|Another platinum effort from the hardest working rock musician in America; and most probably the world!  Zakk sets examples unattainable by any musical standard, and leads by example every step of the way.  One thing you can be guaranteed of in any BLS release is top shelf musicianship; and anyone who follows Zakk knows his only goal is to constantly improve.  Strength, Determination, Merciless, Forever!!!  How can one man be so blessed with this much talent?  Work, plain and simple....... blue collar elbow grease; there is no whining or complaining in Zakk, he embraces responsibility to his craft.  Personally I prefer the BLS eclectic foray into acoustics, piano and the working class/southern influences that bleed through on the emotional releases of &quot;Book Of Shadows,&quot; and now here; because the true character and color of the musician is exposed.  The mixture of acoustic and electric guitar found in this release simply shows 1) how talented Zakk is in his clean playing, and 2) his love for the complete sound of the guitar.  Sure, I love the head banging found on &quot;Sonic Brew&quot; etc..... as much as the next guy, but Zakk is a complete musician and will always be exploring.  If you are a pure music fan, you will kick yourself for not making this release part of your collection; and if you are at all a student of the guitar, you most likely already own &quot;Hangover....&quot;
B000002H33|5.0|in 86. What a year for thrash. Reign In Blood, Master Of Puppets. The best bands were there, Celtic Frost, Exodus, Metallica, Slayer, Meryful Fate, Testament, Venom, sheesh, there will never be another era like it. MOP is a classic ..all killer, no filler cd. Metallicas first 3 will NEVER be equalled.<BR>Along with Cliffs passing, so did Metallica. MOP is an absolute classic.
B0001HAHXW|2.0|First off, I liked EC's &quot;From The Cradle&quot; cd and would rate that one 4 stars, on the other hand I was debating between 1 or 2 stars for this one, and decided on 2 because it's not terrible. The problem I have with this one is it just sounds way too slick and the songs seem to have no passion in them at all, to me it just sounds like a waste of time. I had to force my self to listen to it several times hoping I was missing something and it would grow on me, but that didn't happen. If your'e gonna do Robert Johnson stuff at least sing it/play it like you mean it. This cd reminds me of the &quot;paint by numbers&quot; art I did as a kid. A VERY disappointing effort by someone that should know better.
B00005R87Q|1.0|First let me say, I never saw this in the theaters, rather rented the DVD and I did so for really only one reason.  You see, I own a black Dodge Charger (mines a '69 whereas the movies a '70) with a 440 and for the past year or so I have been challenged so many times I had to know what was causing this.<BR>So, one day after completely blowing away some idiot in a canary yellow Toyota with bright blue flames on the side and a spoiler I decided to allow him to catch up (that was more of challenge as my car idles at around 20 mph) and asked him what convinced him and the army of others in similar import cars to think he could even come close to beating me. He said he saw it in this movie so on a whim I decided to give it a shot and I found out something very interesting.<BR>This movie is bad; in fact I would gamble to say it's one of the worst things I have ever seen in my life (on par with 'Speed 2').  The acting was sub-par, the stunts were over-blown, the script was absolute nonsense (and no, I for one cannot just over look that as so many claim I should).<BR>You know, I'm 24 and can... kind of... see why some would like this, but I can't disengage my mind long enough.<br />Matt<br />PS - There is no way that '70 Charger in the flick would have a problem beating any car on the road (import or not), let alone what it was racing.
6302763835|5.0|It's been almost 50 years since TARANTULA first hit the big screen.  Having seen the movie when I was a little kid running around to all the monster double-features, I have to say this one remained with me through all these years. Watching it was like spending time with an old childhood friend.  Considering it was 1955, the effects in this movie are pretty frightening, especially when viewing the entire real tarantula that was superimposed.  The closeups are cheesy, but we didn't have CGI then.  John Agar, Leo G. Carroll (who would go on to be the boss for the man from UNCLE), Mara Corday (Black Scorpion), Nestor Paiva, Hank Patterson (Green Acres), and yes, even Clint Eastwood are around to flesh out the characters.  Arnold was smart in doing a lot of the effects at night, giving us a shadow of the spider to boot.  This is much better (I think) than THEM or THE BLACK SCORPION, and it deserves to be on DVD, so let's get with it, Universal!<br />A classic film of the 20th century horror genre!
6304068441|4.0|In my opinion Tim Robbins succeeded in making a realistic film. The fact that it is based on the book by the real Sister Helen avoids that it seems to be pure invention. Futhermore Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn did a very good job because thy did not seem to play a role, but to be the characters. They managed to create an intimacy although they have no physical contact. What I also liked about the film is that it does not influence the watcher in his/her attitude towards capital punishment. It just shows both sides so that the watcher can form an own judgement about the subject.<BR>The only thing that I disliked was the beginnig of the execution scene when Matt is to symbolize Jesus Christ. You cannot compare a cruel rapist and murderer to the most unselfish man there ever was!<BR>But all in all it is a good film that makes you think about your own attitude towards death penalty.
B0001FR3IQ|4.0|Halle Berry dominates the screen when she's on it.  And not just with her obvious beauty.  But her presence is so 'BIG', you can't help but keep your eyes glued to the screen.  Halle elevates GOTHIKA with a performance that is both subtly performed and wildly erratic at times.  I did wonder if perhaps her character had gone insane.  GOTHIKA is a moody, creepy and engrossing ghost story that pulls some weird twists and some real shocks.  Berry is given excellent support by Robert Downey as her psychiatrist friend; John Carroll Lynch as the sheriff who was also her husband's best friend; Penelope Cruz as the tormented patient Chloe; and Charles Dutton as her doomed hubby.  By the time the movie reaches it's climax, you'll slap yourself on the head and say, of course!  But, at the same time, how does Halle get off the hook---the movie never explains and it's &quot;sixth sense&quot; ending is also a little disturbing, hence only the four stars.  GOTHIKA is no where as bad as most critics have said; it's a good ghost story and a wonderful performance from Ms. Berry.
B000002UJQ|1.0|This has got to be the most overrated albums of all time.  The production is bad(you can hear the compression, and it's irritating), and the songs are a weak attempt to turn '70s classic rock into '90s alternative.<BR>What really gets to me is how anyone could compare this album to Dark Side Of The Moon.  DSOTM was a masterpiece, this, is a travesty, a sham, and a Mockery..  It's a Traveshamockery.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|I rented &quot;Love Actually&quot; last week and watched it with my girlfriend. The film, released at the theaters last year, was not even my fourth choice. But when one is in a relationship, one finds themselves having to make compromises. In this case, the compromise turned out to be a pleasant surprise - though my girlfriend did fall asleep halfway through.<br />Anyway, as I watched the fairly complex plot threads slowly weave their way towards a predictably syrupy conclusion, I found myself contemplating this film a bit more than expected. I'll try to cover the bases without boring readers to death.<br />First and foremost, &quot;Love Actually&quot; boasts an extraordinary cast of actors, many of whom are from Britain, the location of this valentine of a movie. Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Alan Rickman, Laura Linney and Colin Firth, among others, lend an air of respectability to the mainly light proceedings. This ensemble piece examines eight varieties of relationships, all of them involving a form of love. <br />Richard Curtis wrote and directed this romance/drama/comedy, and it was his first time behind the lens. His previous work included the charming screenplays to &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; (a favorite of mine), &quot;Notting Hill&quot; and &quot;Bridget Jones' Diary.&quot; After such notable success with the pen, I suppose it was about time for him to sit in the director's chair. He does an adequate job with a fairly daunting screenplay. Not only must this story weave in and out of the lives of 10-20 individuals in modern-day London, but it must walk a fine line between comedy and drama, giving each notable actor enough screen time to flex their professional muscle. <br />The misfires are many, as the budding love between the porn stand-ins strikes the harmonious note of a wooden nickel. This talkative pair, in various forms of undress, pretend to perform lustful acts while cameramen set the lighting meters prior to the actual actors doing their &quot;business.&quot; The odd couple make a date and literally shiver during their first kiss. The symbolism is too obvious - yes Richard, we know lust and love are two entirely different things. <br />The slovenly Colin, played with nose-picking intensity by Kris Marshall, couldn't find love if it punched him in the face. So the 20-something man decides to travel to America in search of drooling babes entranced by his British accent. Colin lands in snow-covered Milwaukee. Within minutes he finds three single models who take him back to their penthouse to have an apparent romp. Granted, British accents are cute, but I'm not sure it's going to give any man the inside track to winning the fantasy lottery. <br />Liam Neeson is terrific as a recently widowed father attempting to raise a young son on his own. By utilizing the power of positive thinking, he is lovingly supportive, and it's just a wonderful turn by an actor who normally plays the &quot;hunk.&quot; I liked this vignette immensely and would enjoy seeing a film dealing simply with this father and son relationship.<br />Hugh Grant does a nice turn as the recently appointed Prime Minister of England who's shot by the Cupid's arrow upon meeting the caterer of his new home. Grant goes to great lengths to deny his love for this lower middle-class woman. This vignette gives us one of the finest scenes in the film when Grant stumbles upon a Bill Clinton-like president of the United States (nicely played in a cameo by Billy Bob Thornton) trying to make a pass at the caterer. Grant's character has already been bullied by this important world leader. Now the prez is making a move on the love of his life! Grant stands up to the powerful man during a press conference, and the enjoyable scene will make one swell with British pride whether they live in Olde England or not.<br />The strongest scenes in the film are delivered by Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman, as a longtime married couple. Rickman is being flirted with by a young woman at work, and Thompson catches wind of it. Her scenes where she deals with the infidelity are the most memorable of &quot;Love Actually.&quot; This very fine actress reveals the true trauma of what such shenanigans can do to the victim. She delivers the best line in the film when she says to her longtime husband, &quot;You haven't just made me look foolish, but you've made us look foolish.&quot; Thompson's work is nothing short of brilliant.<br />What I liked about &quot;Love Actually&quot; was it dealt exclusively with ADULT romance. Amazingly, there's not a teenager in sight. This is also such a sweet, life-affirming film, without a single moment of cynicism. To me, that's rare in today's movie making world.<br />&quot;Love Actually&quot; stumbles happily to the semi-truth of life and love and how we cope with all the mundane crap. Love happens when we least expect it, and this film is aware of this. Love is not always fulfilled, and this film knows this sad fact as well. Thank you Mr. Curtis for at the very least attempting to reveal such important lessons.<br />Thankfully, there's only one wedding scene in Love Actually. It's early in the film. After the bride and the groom have exchanged vows, they begin walking back down the aisle. Suddenly, a choir begins singing, trombone players stand up, someone plays a guitar and a man wails into a microphone. The bride and groom laugh in surprised delight as the impromptu musicians begin performing The Beatles' &quot;All You Need is Love.&quot;<br />Has there ever been a more perfect song for a wedding?
B000002N1E|5.0|Prince is a genius at work...actually he's a natural born genius. All of his music motivates me to become a musician. His work is outstanding and I am happy that he has a new album out. In this album, I believe the good sex/making out songs are Shhh! and I Hate U. Endorphamachine is a really cool song. And by the way, Prince is so damn sexy 2 me...and I wish I was his woman!
6305313687|1.0|Everyone kept telling me to see this movie. They said it would be like nothing I have ever encountered before.<br />Well, I saw it. Was I moved? Hardly. Instead I found myself to be incredibly bored and even slightly annoyed.<br />The movie attempts to lecture white kids kids about racism. It does a terrible job. I am white, and grew up around white racist kids, and let me tell you....they were horrible animals. And you couldn't change them. They were sadistic cowards. The makers of this movie are so naive. They actually think they can change the views of racist kids by exposing them to one of the sappiest, overly sentimental movies of the past decade?<br />They really believe that ridiculously melodramatic scenes will get through to these idiots?<br />We all know that racism exists and how bad it is. And the stereotypes in this movie are so politically correct, that they very well may further racism rather than stop it.<br />This movie also seemed to alienate white kids. It makes it as though you can only be racist if you are white, and that the social problems of other minority communities excuse their prejudices and racist attitudes towards white people.<br />At least thats the feeling I got from the film. I could be wrong. But it feels strangely familiar.<br />American History X drags on and on. The story is poor. The dialogue is poor. I actually pity the actors. Its not really their fault. I mean, they were given such terrible lines, they really had nothing to work with.<br />One of the biggest failures of the movie was the transition of Norton's character from a violent racist to an open minded, loving, saint. The change was brought about so poorly in the movie that it was embarrasing to watch because it looked so artificial.<br />I applaud movies that attack the evils of racism, but this one is an utter failure. It relies far to much on shock value rather than plot and character development. There is nothing here. Its as though high school students wrote thescript.
B0000BXGCN|3.0|&quot;En Toute Intimit&quot; is mostly a compilation of songs from &quot;Nue&quot; and &quot;Pure,&quot; with a few new songs.  These newer songs are mostly Italian, Josh Groban-esque songs that are rather different from her usual work.  The songs from her other CDs are accompanied by a piano or violin and are more mellow than the original versions.  In the song, &quot;S'en Aller,&quot; Lara sings with a nasally, childish voice at the end, which, in my opinion, ruins the entire song.  While I am always impressed with Lara's talent (and it is evident in this album), this CD is not one of her best.
0517122707|5.0|John Kennedy Toole got everything right.  The dialect, the speaking in the back of the throat, the lazy tongue.  He got it right throughout the book. This story is timeless...I moved to NOLA in 1993 and never knew about this book, but found, in retrospect that the mood, character, life-mode is right on.  What he could have produced if he hadn't killed himself.
B00005JKHN|5.0|Following in the hard to fill footsteps of Cinderella and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Sleeping Beauty is totally and completely detached from the way typical Disney fairy tales are told.  The movie has more of a storybook feel to it than it's predecessors.  The art style is completely original, it resembles a medevil/gothic approach.  The characters are wonderful, and the evil fairy Malificent is one of the most creative and evil of all the Disney villains.  The music is very good and addictive and it whisks you away to another world.  It is a once upon a dream.  See it if you love Disney films.
B000009EAD|5.0|Something Wicked This Way Comes(1998). Iced Earth's fifth studio album.<br />Ever since the dawn of the 90s, Iced Earth has been releasing numerous heavy metal masterpiece albums, going along the lines of their infuences (older) Metallica and Iron Maiden. IE are nothing, if not consistently progressing with their sound. The first two albums Iced Earth(1990) and Night Of The Stormrider(1992) followed the traditional heavy metal style of their heroes very closely before finding their own way on the forthcoming Burnt Offerings(1995) and Dark Saga(1996). BO saw the debut performance of veteran metal vocalist Matt Barlow, and delivered menacing emotion that few could compare to. Band founder and rhythm guitarist Jon Schaffer excelled in his songwriting abilities on both the third and fourth albums, especially in the epic 'Dante's Inferno' and many metal/ballad songs found on Dark Saga like 'I Died For You'. So what does an aspiring heavy metal band do when they find their own style to work with?<br />Simple! They take it to the next level in greatness, as demonstrated on the final 90s IE album SWTWC. The band uses the melodic elements of Dark Saga, the grandieur of Stormrider, the ferocity of Burnt Offerings, and combines it all into one of the finest heavy metal platters I've ever heard by any band. For the first ten songs of the album, the band takes the songwriting approach started on Dark Saga and brings it to the full. Many reviewers might disagree with me by stating that the two previous albums are IE's greatest offerings, but I find Wicked to be the band's strongest, best produced, most emotional, and most accessible work to date. This was the very first IE album I bought and upon first listen I was hooked. It may not be as dark or progressive as Burnt Offerings, but one thing that stands out about Wicked is that the songs have INCREDIBLE variety, meaning there's something for every fan. You've got plenty of intense, yet catchy thrash-rockers, several gloom/doom metal ballads, an Iron Maiden-esque instrumental, a song dedicated to the band's own fans, and a huge 20 minute progressive metal epic at the end. In other words, all the ingredients necessary for an outstanding heavy metal album. There's a constant flow throughout the album and the songs never drone on or seem like clones of one another.<br />The beginning of the album explodes with the midpaced thrash opener 'Burning Times'. Excellent rocker with an outstanding scorching vocal performance by Barlow. Also of note is the appearance of newcomer lead guitarist Larry Tarnowski. He's actually pretty good for a guitarist in his early 20s. Next is 'Melancholy(Holy Martyr)', which is a heavy ballad based on the crucifixion of Christ. Then there's 'Disciples Of The Lie' which is undoubtedly the heaviest track on the album. Barlow shouts quite a bit, making this track seem like a combination of older and more modern styles of metal. Plus there's an erie organ solo later in the song. 'Watching Over Me' is a very emotional ballad/rocker written in tribute of Schaffer's lost best friend. 'Stand Alone' and 'My Own Savior' are two more interesting thrash rockers, both with great choruses. 'Consequences' is a track which starts as a ballad and gradually becomes heavier, while 'Reaping Stone' features different time changes. The latter is probably my least favorite song on the album, though not bad at all. Next is the band's galloping instrumental '1776', originally called 'Purgatory', but done in an Iron Maiden style. The last of the shorter tracks is 'Blessed Are You', and as mentioned is dedicated to the fans.<br />And now we arrive at the end (and best part) of the album: A 3-part mega epic detailing the story of a race of beings who are conqueored by man in ancient times, and their only hope for salvation is by retreating and waiting 10,000 years for a special child to be born in order to bring down the fall of mankind. It's actually supposed to be the beginning of the story, and it is rumored to continue on a future album(?). Anyways, 'Prophecy' starts things off melodically, and then changes into a chugging and intense fast rocker in the vein of 'Dante's Inferno'. It ends with a clock ticking, signaling the wait for the wicked child to be born. 'Birth Of The Wicked' starts the second part, which isn't a whole lot different from the first, but is still worth hearing. My favorite song though is the third part. It starts off with a piano intro, and an operatic vocal outro, but inbetween it is ONE OF THE GREATEST THRASH METAL ROCKERS EVER CONCEIVED BY ANY BAND. Clearly this is the album's finest moment, and the chorus will not disappoint. This is how metal albums should end, with a BANG!<br />Overall, I'm extremely impressed with SWTWC and it easily gets my 5 stars. Some may argue with me on this one, but I'd go so far as to place it alongside some of the greatest classic metal albums such as Metallica's Master Of Puppets, Iron Maiden's Powerslave, and Judas Priest's Defenders Of The Faith. Due to the album's apparent hooks and accessible songs, this is probably the perfect place for new fans of IE to start. It contains a sampling of every style the band employs, and serves as a perfect synthesis of modern and old-school heavy metal music. Even though I'm trying not to sound like I'm overpraising this album, I just can't say enough good things about it. Buy it and chances are if you like metal, you won't be disappointed. ALL FANS OF HEAVY METAL MUST OWN THIS MASTERPIECE.<br />Other Recommendations:<BR>-'Burnt Offerings' by Iced Earth<BR>-'The Glorious Burden' by Iced Earth<BR>-'Master Of Puppets' by Metallica<BR>-'The Dark' by Metal Church
B00005JKG5|4.0|Flashdance is one of the most remembered films of the 1980s.  It is full of rythym and fast paced tempo that most people were used to seeing in the popular dance movies like Footloose and Dirty Dancing.  Jennifer Beals plays her best role as the young wannabe ballet dancer who strives to make it in a rough neighborhood.  This film whould be nothing without its music or dancing.  It is one of the best date movies too.  I highly reccomend this film to anyone with a dream or anyone who is a fan of films from the 1980s.
B0002234LS|5.0|Super film. Must see again for third time.<BR>Johnny is the ultimate hobo and will always remain that way. The film is crap up til the end where is rocks. The last ten minutes make up for the hour and half of crap previously. I have one thing to say : \\"D-I-V-O-R-C-E. Dee-vorce!\\"<BR>I give it 5 stars automatically jsut because Johnny is in it, but then I add another 3 because the ending is good (this is out of 5 BTW) Then I add another 6 because there is violence which is always good in our modern world. (...)
B00003CX9W|5.0|In order to like Fantasia, you must have to have a high appreciation of film.  You also must be able to embrace art and music.  This movie is very different.  It sometimes lacks heart that most Disney movies have, but it is definately a must see film.  The movie has about nine or ten different animation segments at about ten minutes each.  They are all different, and they are all beautiful to watch.  The Sorcerer's Apprentice, The Night on Bald Mountain, and The Nutcracker Suite are some of the more visual highlights.  In between the film are introductions by the anonymous narrator.  If you love Disney it is a definate must see.  It is a feast for both the eyes and the ears.
0792164903|5.0|This film rocked my socks.<BR>Johnny is a terrific actor. Christina Ricci was bloody terrible though and she looks about 6 in the film and I was astonished to see how a woman with black hair can dye both her hair and eyebrows to be blonde successfully.<BR>However, returning back to the Johnny-themed side of this review, he totally rocked.<BR>the end.
B00005KARK|5.0|Dumbo is one of the more endearing classics that Disney has made.  It is very simple and not as complex as some of the other films.  It is very sweet and a nice movie that the 8 and under crowd will cherish.  The movie really appeals to anyone who loves Disney.  It teaches important values and it has a few tearjerker moments.  It is a definate classic in the lineup of Disney films.  Be sure to see it if you are a fan of Walt Disney Animation.
020530902X|5.0|A pithy little handbook that gives rules and examples to help you avoid the most common mistakes in writing, plus some smart advice on the finer points by a renowned essayist and children's writer. It is by far the single most useful book on writing. But it is not the last word. For those who wish to go further, I recommend these books in addition to Strunk &amp; White: The Prentice Hall Handbook for Writers, for a review of basic grammar and syntax; Style: Ten Lessons in Clarity and Grace, by Joseph M. Williams, for more detailed advice on constructing paragraphs; The Oxford Essential Guide to Writing, by Thomas Kane, for more general advice; and Garner's Modern American Usage, for intelligent, detailed, and up-to-date guidance on diction. All these books belong on the shelf of every serious writer.<br />(By the way, I agree with the previous reviewer that the third edition is slightly preferable to the current one.)
B0000TG9E2|5.0|After the success of Cinderella, Walt Disney decided to try something different.  He took Lewis Carrol's novel and turned it into a spectrum of silly madness that really is unlike Disney.  Alice is unlike your typical Disney hero, because unlike Cinderella and Snow White she is only twelve.  Disney's version of Wonderland is very neat to watch.  The characters are all wonderful and the voice talents are really superb.  The Cheshire Cat, The Queen of Hearts, and The Mad Hatter, are some of the hilights of the film.  It is one of the more whimsical of the Disney films.  I highly reccomend it.
1594200106|5.0|If you are a fan of John Fowles (The Magus), of Gabriel Garcia Marquez (One Hundred Years of Solitude), Mark Helprin (A Soldier of the Great War) or Umberto Eco (The Name of the Rose), you should do yourself a favor and read this.  There are books that come along that do make a difference and I think this is one.  Try it!
B0000CGV00|5.0|Exciting, emotional, beautiful and interesting, that's what sets this apart from the rest of the classical pack. helene is an amazing piano player and manages to include amazing depths of emotion through her instrument. She is also of course amazingly great technically and should be deeply respected by all musicians.

B000089RVX|5.0|Okay, just because I like Evanescence doesn't mean I'm a teenie-bopper who listens to Good Charlotte and thinks they're punk. I don't watch MTV and listen to the pop and rap they have on there. I listen to different types of rock, including System of a Down, Green Day, Metallica, P.O.D, Drowning Pool, and Hoobastank. This CD is excellent, and while some tracks might stand out (Bring Me To Life, My Immortal), there are some underrated tracks (Going Under, Tourniquet). Their songs are sometimes beautiful, sometimes hard. It is really hard to describe (I once described Going Under to a friend as hauntingly awesome) the kind of music that Evanescence plays, but this album is a very promising start for this group from Arkansas.

0399143793|4.0|Lee Child's \\"Jack Reacher\\" novels have a refreshing purity about them: simply action, mayhem, and brutality wrapped around straight, unadorned plots.  Testosterone runs high, larger-than-life bad guys take evil to new depths, cliffhangers that would embarrass Indiana Jones.  And if there is such a thing as a literary equivalent of film's slow-motion action scenes, then Lee Child is the master.  Guns don't simply shoot a bullet; Child talks muzzle velocities, projectile weights, gun barrel chemistry, and the physics of 0.5-inch diameter bullet fired from a Barrett sniper rifle passing through skull and brain.  All very violent, and all very entertaining.<br />\\"Die Trying\\" is Lee Child's second Jack Reacher novel, and there is no sophomore jinx.  Reacher, ex-military cop and veritable walking encyclopedia of all armament, happens on the wrong place at the wrong time in downtown Chicago, finding himself unwittingly in the middle of a kidnapping.  The victim: Holly Johnson, a beautiful and brainy FBI agent, but, as it turns out, much, much more.  The perps: a band of neo-fascist wacko's - think Waco or Ruby Ridge - about to hatch a plot to declare independence and secede from the United States.  Meanwhile, everybody from the FBI to the US Marines tries to find and free Holly, while Reacher works on the inside - as a co-hostage - fights to protect Holly's honor, chastity, and life.  Child paints a wonderfully diabolically twisted Beau Borkin as the leader of the cult, and a rather fascinating picture of life inside an extreme right-wing conspiracy.  Bottom line: not a novel you'll be retelling to the grandkids, and no literary milestone, but few can verbalize raw power better than Lee Child.  A great page-turner, a great diversion, pure entertainment.
B00005JMX4|5.0|This movie looked good from the start with all the trailers they played on tv. When I actually got around to see it I was shocked to see that this was a well written teen comedy. It is a modern day version of Risky Buisness, and I dont mean that it is a cheap rip off either! It is a good movie that is def. DVD worthy when it comes out. Go see it and have a good time!
1573229725|4.0|I read and enjoyed &quot;Tipping the Velvet,&quot; and appreciate the time frame in which Sarah Waters writes.  Yet in both &quot;Fingersmith&quot; and &quot;Tipping the Velvet,&quot; she does not seem to know how to end her stories.  She weaves a tapestry of intrigue in both books, then suddenly seems to realize, &quot;uh-oh, I'm on page 500-something, better tie up some lose knots here.&quot;  The blinding speed with which we discover what happens to each character in Fingersmith felt, to me, like sitting down to a gourmet meal and consuming it without chewing.  Overall, I enjoy her writing, and we are never left wondering.  But I do look forward to reading an ending that is written at the level of the rest of her skills.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This is one of the best CD's I have ever bought.  Kanye's flavor of hip-hop is very nice to hear, especially in times where artists like Nelly and Ja Rule rule the radio.  Way to Kanye for being original!  My favorite song. on this CD are Two Words and Slow Jamz. I also like Through The Wire a lot.  The only complaint I have is that Through The Wire and School Spirit are censored.  Whats up with that?
006054094X|1.0|Menzies makes several foolish claims, like that Europe was so technologically far behind China in 1421. For your info Menzies, the Byzantines of Europe had Greek Fire, a weapon that could enable flames to travel on water. It was this instrument that kept Muslims from invading Europe for centuries and it was far superior to anything the Chinese ever invented. Menzies also claims that the European armies of 1421 had no guns. Couldn't be further from the truth on this one. By 1390 Europeans from one end of Europe to the other were getting outfitted not only with guns but canons too. And Europe was already flatout in the Renaissance in 1421, they weren't on the eve of it as Menzies ridiculously claims.
B00009L1UP|5.0|To this day, a staggering number of people insist that to entertain is to sell out and surrender growth and innovation. Granted, the frequncy of the stars aligning just right is about as often as a snowball forming in that dark place down below, but it HAS happened, it STILL happens, but never more noticably than in the all-around musical masterpiece &quot;Empire,&quot; from the &quot;progressive&quot; &quot;metal&quot; band, Queensryche.<br />Those quotations are there because Queensryche deserves more than routine catagorization. Their music is at times heavy, and often intelligent, and that's about all the description you should need. If you realize that the past 10 years of mainstream music has been a case of record companies shooting themselves in the foot, this review shall serve to educate you that this album was one of the last appearances of greatness to strike mainstream popularity - it's a good thing Queensryche got this album in before it all went down hill!<br />The album; dashes of Pink Floyd/Rush/Bon Jovi/Def Leppard/Wagner!<BR>One of my favorite songs ever is the closing track &quot;Anybody Listening?&quot; Epic emotion, powerful vocals, sustained guitar landscapes `a la David Gilmour, operatic theatrics `a la Les Miserables. The song is an adventure, a journey, with changing keys, moods and sections. Everything that a best-song-ever should be is in this unique composition.<br />Then there's the song that &quot;broke them&quot;, despite a very successful prior album (&quot;Operation: MindCrime&quot;). If you only know Queensryche for one song, it's &quot;Silent Lucidity.&quot; Granted, it's a bit simpler than much of their work, but just as with &quot;Anybody Listening?&quot;, it is a wonderful journey of the mind, &quot;trying to explain to someone the unexplainable,&quot; in the words of vocalist Geoff Tate. It is a highly emotional ballad that fits in just fine with the rest of the band's repertoire.<br />Most of the album is very strong with no filler, but the other big highlights are the songs &quot;Empire,&quot; and &quot;Another Rainy Night.&quot; These songs deserve some of the highest praise ever, because they adhere to this intelligent-meets-popularity formula better than almost any other song. They deserve even MORE praise, because they are not ballads. They are hard rocking songs, and the former (the title track) was actually quite the popular 'hit.' Can you believe, thinking of a 'hit' as actual good music? It IS possible. These songs are in the normal verse-chorus format, with amazing solos and guitar harmonies, intelligent lyrics, creative chords, and pure heart and soul. They rock like nobody's business, but also allow many people to relate to the music, who normally would be satisfied with bands that only make 10% the amount of effort. It just doesn't get much better than this.<br />The hardcore fans want their &quot;...MindCrime&quot;, but I am going to cave in here - &quot;Empire&quot; is my [just barely]favorite Queensryche album, and the fact that it was very popular doesn't change the fact that it deserved what it got and more. MindCrime is also great - but for once in music history, selling less records doesn't mean it must be better music! &quot;Empire&quot; is the epitome of &quot;exception to the rule.&quot; Commercial music hasn't allowed for this much creativity since.
076790592X|5.0|Mitch Albom's book is a tremendous tool for those who want to think about loss and grief.  The book can be quite depressing because of the emotions being experienced vicariously through the story.  One can benefit greatly from the story and from learning the life lessons that are presented.  Those who are already depressed may want to avoid this one!  Those who really want to ponder life and death, loss and grief, and the meaning of life will be moved by this book.<br />Paul Heier, author of Leading Out of Love
B00006IU73|5.0|As of now, I can't say Porcupine Tree is QUITE the best band ever- but even the idea of such a serious consideration warrants the awarding of a gold medal to them, from every record company looking for a way to keep the industry from imploding altogether... too bad all the big wigs seem to think that the music of the future can be found by putting their heads up their fill in the blanksses.<br />As a musician myself, I have to say that I can probably relate to the vision of this band more than any other; they know that rock needs to be saved, and they know that a certain degree of &quot;commercialness&quot; isn't bad. Combine substance with songwriting and you've got about the best recipe for good music that can be concocted. What's so great is that, not only is the concept there, but the band actually EXECUTES the vision to reality with their most successful album thus far, &quot;In Absentia&quot;.<br />And what better place to start than track 4, &quot;The Sound of Muzak.&quot; It's an outright slam on the dismal outlook of the music situation in this era, similar to Tom Petty's &quot;The Last DJ&quot; - but unlike Petty, the song is layered with intelligent harmonies, unpredictable structure twists, and DYNAMIC RANGE!!!! AHA! So you don't have to be a concert pianist on RCA Victor in order to put dynamic depth to your music! And you don't have to be AC/DC in order to appeal to rock fans. This album contains one of the most balanced blends of &quot;prog&quot; and emotional songwriting I have ever heard. The fact of the matter is, all of these songs on this album are structured very carefully, built from the ground up, composed in a way that is as detail oriented as Rachmaninov - and that's how I like to write rock songs. You can still have a good chorus, but you can have other things too, and you don't have to call it chicken fat. This concept has long been lost to the music world, not since Queen has there been such amazing craftsmanship to what some might call a&quot;pop&quot; tune.<br />And as with Queen, you'll find diversity here! There's Radiohead-like tenderness (&quot;Heartattack In A Layby&quot;) on this album, with one exception - it's what Radiohead SHOULD have been. You can expose your soul and still play a guitar solo too. &quot;Guitar Solo&quot;, or any solo, or musical chops, should not be such black-listed terms these days. I get more from this song than ANY Radiohead song, because it is the definitive proof that musicianship CAN help ANYONE'S music.<br />Similar to the previously mentioned song, though not quite as gut-wrenching, is the closing number, &quot;Collapse The Light Into Earth.&quot; This song is VERY much in the style of Coldplay, with moments of Pink Floyd - it's a bit simplistic, but has its moments when everything seems to come together in an epiphany.<br />The single &quot;Blackest Eyes&quot; is a good all-around demonstration of what the band tries to do - and pretty much succeeds- lush harmonies and creative accompaniments along with hard rocking riffs.<br />The diversity really kicks in when you hear something like &quot;The Creator Has A Masterpiece&quot; or &quot;Wedding Nails,&quot; songs that possess demonic edginess while never losing the point. It never kicks in to real metal noodling `a la Dream Theater, which I still love, but this band's focus on the songs themselves really catches my attention, because again, very few people actually try to write SONGS that are &quot;progressive&quot;.<br />Another standout track is &quot;Prodigal&quot; - it's a great &quot;zone out&quot; track complete with Floydian spaciness and lush arrangements, and the lyrics are highly helpful and poignant.<br />If this album doesn't set the world on fire for you at first, give it time. Sorry to state the obvious, but music with complexities and intricacies need time to grow on you. You may not come to like all the music, but you CAN NOT put the headphones down before you atleast develop a rare and fresh type of respect for a band that is working very hard to do something very relevant.
0060516402|4.0|Collins and Porras have provided a foundational study of the nuts and bolts of &quot;visionary&quot; organizations.  Built to Last is a great book.  I was occasionally concerned that they sometimes used materials from other disciplines (i.e., evolutionary science, symbols from Eastern religions, etc.) that had significant implications.  Overall, the book is an excellent read and would be helpful for business owners, managers, non-profit leaders, and a whole range of educators and civil servants. I would highly recommend it.  One will be amazed to see the impact that a few consistent priorities have had on some of the major companies.  It's a worthwhile book that is backed by real data.<br />Paul Heier, pastor, Lifespring Church, Palm Harbor, FL
B000069HKH|3.0|It's very difficult to write a commentary on tangible reflections of human tragedy without ruffling a few feathers. I live in PA, so while I wasn't directly hit by the 9/11 chaos, I wasn't too far removed from it and all of the ramifications. Soon comes Bruce with his legitimate offering to the American people of the best thing he has to offer: music.<br />Knowing that Bruce has close ties (to say the least) with the areas hit hard by the tragedy, combined with the experiences of seeing him perform these songs live on his subsequent tour, the first task is easy - that is to state definitively that &quot;The Rising&quot; was not merely a financial cash in, as some critics inevitably propose. The whole purpose of what Bruce Springsteen is all about can be simply summed up by one raspy snarl of his voice, or one look at his stretched and twisted face as he draws in a breath of passion at the mic. That purpose is one of the best, most honorable purposes there is: to reach out and connect and relate on an emotional level with other flesh and blood.<br />Look at some of these lyrics. &quot;Into the Fire,&quot; &quot;Nowhere Man,&quot; and &quot;You're Missing&quot; are all very sensitive, poignant, touching bits of poetry that function very well as writing alone. The problem comes in with Bruce The Musician. I suppose many who find this review disagreeable are those who have so much respect for the message, the simple chug-chug-chug-along chords The Boss employs on his guitar to accompany his anthems are only bonus feathers in the cap, and they find it satisfying enough. Don't get me wrong, I find the CONCEPT of what he has done worthy of the highest respect, but it can't hit a homerun in the execution department unless all elements are at a high level - and musically, The Rising is lacking.<br />So I guess I'd better start explaining myself - well, look no further than album opener &quot;Lonesome Day.&quot; The message of hope is stirring, but it falls somewhat flat against the bland melodies and chord progressions. The music is directionless, and while all of the songs on this album have moments to shine, the main meat-and-potatoes of the songwriting is definitely lacking in creativity. This opening song plods along at a boring 4/4 tempo that sounds like minutes of monotony. If it weren't for the lyrics, I would think it completely not worth my time. Again, there are some interesting guitar climaxes and whatnot, but far from enough.<br />Later songs like &quot;Waitin' on a Sunny Day&quot; and &quot;Let's Be Friends&quot; continue the theme of Bruce strumming benign and repetitive guitar chords under heartfelt words. It's just off balance. This is further evidenced by the near absence of the E-Street Band. Where's the Big Man? Where's Roy Bittan? They're there, but horrendously underplayed and undermixed. There's nothing wrong with a violin, (which gets much more time than Clarence's Sax) but if the heart and soul of all of those talented players were more in the forefront, this album might project much more spirit.<br />That leads me perfectly to the next issue; the RECORDING. Produced by Brendan O'Brien, more from &quot;alternative&quot; fame than straight up rock and roll, the album tries unnecessarily to have the &quot;sound&quot; of a boyband record. Keep in mind - I'm not talking about the music here, but the actual mixing techniques. Don't believe me again? For a real obvious example of the butchering, go directly to the tacit parts in &quot;The Fuse&quot; (where it's only Bruce). Hear that? That's the result of Mr. Springsteen's mighty vocal cords being squashed through compressors and sounding dead and lifeless. Reverb was the trend of the 80's and now it's all about smacking the levels up as high as modern technology will take them without blowing up the console. A BIG no-no for an album that SHOULD be produced to stand the test of time.<br />Alright, you've been patient, so here's the exceptions to the dominant musical mediocrity of the album: &quot;Worlds Apart&quot; and &quot;Further Up the Road.&quot; There's nothing to say other than that it's worth buying the album for these two songs alone. The groove, the drive, the heaviness - the latter which gives much more help to lyrics that are heavy themselves - it's all there. They rock as good rock should, and just make you explode with profound energy. I give some points to Bruce just for being as diverse as he is, or else we wouldn't have some of the truly remarkable moments he's given us over the years.<br />If a simple beat and simple melody is all you need to accompany your songs, you'll appreciate this album much more. In fact, I really wish I was like that as well, as I don't like having to criticize good intentions. But in a time where you're guaranteed to get millions sold and all the press attention you could want, why not put some more thought into that other half of songwriting - the music?
B000089RVX|5.0|I bought this CD for the songs &quot;My Immortal&quot; and &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; but I was really suprised by how good the whole CD is.  It is one of the only CD's I have that is good from top to bottom.  If you like rock this is a must have.
B00000ADG2|5.0|Lauryn Hill is truly a genius. She is equally talented in singing, rapping, writing and acting. I love this album and everytime I lose it or someone steals it from me, I go out and cop it again. I like all of the songs on the album but the true standouts to me are &quot;Nothing Even Matters&quot; ft. D'Angelo, &quot;I Used To Love Him&quot; ft. Mary J. Blige, Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You,&quot; &quot;When It Hurts So Bad,&quot; &quot;The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill,&quot; and the hidden track &quot;Tell Him.&quot; This album is a masterpiece. I am equally inspired by her vocals when she sings and the way she flows when she's rapping. She can go on and on when she is flowing, where it sounds like its a freestyle. I like the style of the old Lauryn on this album and when she was with the Fugees. She needs to come out with another album as well as do more acting b/c she does it all so well.
B000056NX5|5.0|The first time I saw this musical was a few years ago at an outdoor theater on Montery, CA.  It was a traditional interpretation of the show, and I absolutely loved it!!! I was so touched by story.  I rented the 70s movie and was utterly disappointed in how hoaky it was. It was hard to get into it when they were setting it up at the beginning. It was just a bunch of hippies singing in the dessert I admit they had great voices, but boy did Judas overact.<BR>   This version was amazing!!! Almost all of the actors (Pilot kind of sucked)portrayed the characters perfectly.  The Judas in this was my favorite.  I don't know why so many people don't like his voice.  It is a ROCK OPERA!!! He fit the bill to perfection.  <BR>Yes he could have sung the song all pretty like, but it would not have conveyed the emotion necessary for the role.  If you pay attention, you can tell he has the ability to sing it like that, but he totally made the right decision to rock out!!!! <BR>   There was also incredible chemistry between Jesus and Judas (not the sexual kind) which is required for any JCS.  I really felt the love, pain, and conflict.  I highly reccommend this version!!!!

B000002L3P|5.0|Kenny Wayne Shepherd came on the blues scence with his first debut album Ledbetter Heights proving us all he's the next best young blues guitarist. Ledbetter Heights is filled with blues on songs like Deja Voodoo, and Shame, Shame, Shame. Their is also some slide guitar on Aberdeen. He does Stevie Ray Vaughan's cover on here also titled Im Leaving You (Commit A Crime). Ledbetter Heights is better than Trouble Is...the guitar playing is better I personally think. Kenny Wayne also does a slow song live titled While We Cry its alot like Lenny or Little Wing still has power. Ledbetter Heights is one of the best blues albums for any guitarist Highly Recomened!
B00005JLPK|5.0|I have read two biographies of Frida and studied her paintings closely, and totally disagree with a certain Washington Post reviewer who wrote that the film failed to capture the delicate texture of Frida's life.  To the contrary, the film was teeming with wonderful visual references to Frida's multifaceted and colorful life, from the family members, pets and belongings she held dear, to the unique clothing and jewelry for which she was known, and the neighborhoods and houses where she lived.  Perhaps the Post reviewer was not sufficiently familiar with the context to appreciate these details, which were recreated with such passion and fidelity that for me the film needed little else.  I also felt the film effectively portrayed the torment Frida suffered over her lifelong love for Diego Rivera, (...), yet emotionally and professionally supportive, husband.  That Diego's art overshadowed hers for most of their lives was of far less consequence to her than his marital infidelities.  I personally would have enjoyed seeing the film do more with Frida's series of magical, and often tragic, self-portraits; this is a woman who suffered such crushing chronic back pain (due to a horrific bus accident) that she often painted while bedridden in the hospital for months on end, and at other times had to tie herself into a chair to paint.  Painting was her therapy and she literally painted her love and her pain in images of herself, Diego, her broken body parts, and the plants, objects and creatures that brought her comfort.  But I happily forgave those shortcomings for the pleasure of seeing this spectacular artist and human being  brought to life in Ms. Hayek's vivid production.
0385512104|5.0|For sceptics who think this is a child's book, read it and then think again. &quot;The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night-Time&quot; is everything the media hype says it is....and more. It is an inspirational and original book about an incident - the murder of a neighbour's dog - that has taken hold of an autistic child's mind and in the process unsettled some dark family secrets which have remained deeply buried within the hearts of the adult community. <br />The story is narrated by and told through the eyes of the child, so his perception and understanding of events as they unfold become our own. Mark Haddon's simulation of the autistic child's reality and sensibility is so touching, truthful and poignant I was completely blown away by its emotional resonance. The heartbreak one feels stems from the fact that the autistic child is incapable of interpreting simple messages in conversation. He responds to reality as he sees them, in the only way he knows how, and so misreads cues that should be straightforward to the non-autistic person. <br />Don't let the dog incident distract you. It may be the triggering event that sends everything unrevelling but hardly the story's centre which is firmly rooted in the more complex world of adults. I wonder if Christopher would have been better off wired like the rest of us. I doubt so. There is also surprising depth to Haddon's characterisation. Christopher's father is a saint, his mother much less sympathetic and more difficult to judge, like the Meryl Streep character in Kramer vs Kramer. <br />It's interesting that the book is marketed as both an adult's as well as a children's book. The adult and child reader will have different reactions to the book. Haddon has made an important contribution to contemporary literature. All we can do is read and be enriched by it.
B00005B6N7|1.0|U571 is perhaps the most absurd war film I have ever seen. Nothing about this film is believable. IT starts out with the absurd proposition that a German sub captain and crew stood by while approached by the crew of an American sub posing as another German crew. The Germans would have made radio or semaphore contact- not to mention the fact that the Germans could see the American sub and did not notice that it was American, not German. OK, it was raining, but then another German sub comes along, sees the two subs, recognizes which one is American, and torpedoes it. Apparently the other Germans were better at sub recognition.<br />Then a few Americans on the captured German sub take a 4 second lesson in German sub operation and proceed to destroy the other German sub- amazing! They encounter a German plane over the Atlantic. One of the American seamen orders another to shoot it down AGIANST THE ORDERS OF AN OFFICER WHO IS STANDING RIGHT THERE. The officer does nothing to this seaman. On Das Boot, the Captain almost shoots a crewman who panics. Who could believe US officers to be so easy going?<br />The American controlled sub approaches a German surface vessel, where the plane comes from. Once again, the Germans don't bother with radio or semaphore contact. The American man their deck gun while the Germans sit idly by, and get their radio shot out. Apparently German warships only had 1 radio during WW2, because now they cannot tell that one of their subs has been captured. If that is not all idiotic enough, remember that this has to be some time in 1943- what is a German cruiser doing out in the Atlantic in broad daylight that late in the war?<br />A German prisoner overpowers one of the Americans on 571 and gets his 45. Another superhuman American charges him, gets shot, but keeps on going and gets the German. Isn't it funny how Germans drop when shot but Americans keep right on going? Earlier in the film, when the Americans board U571, most of the Germans hide in the engine room and cower when the Americans enter. Fact is that the German U Boat crews were chosen for their nerve. Theirs was the most elite service in German military of WW2, but in this movie they are mostly spineless cowards.<br />I did not see the rest of this film, because it was just getting too stupid to be entertaining. One might point out that this in not a historical documentary, its supposed to be entertaining, but how can something so blatantly idiotic be entertaining? This film is worse than Holywood propaganda films during the war. Not only does it portray the enemy as incompetent idiots or cowards and the Americans as superheroes, it has numerous historical inaccuracies. War films do not have to be 100% accurate, but they cannot be completely unbelievable and still be entertaining. This film should have been made as a spoof or not at all. As a serious film it is pathetic and a waste of time. I want the producers to pay me for the time I wasted watching their idiotic garbage.the engine room and cower when the Americans enter.

B00005JMCT|3.0|There's one thing you have to say for \\"American Wedding\\": like the two \\"American Pie\\" films that came before it, it is unapologetically unashamed of its shamelessness.  Here's a film that doesn't try to hide its gleeful perverseness under a bushel of coy double entendres; instead the film revels in its frank and openhearted treatment of sexuality and lust.  \\"American Wedding\\" is clearly a comedy about sex and it doesn't pretend to be anything but.  Whether this is a good thing or a bad will, I suppose, depend on your own affinity and tolerance for jokes and images that routinely push the boundaries of common decency and good taste.  In fact, the film wears its tastelessness almost as a badge of honor.  And just in case you're unfamiliar with this series and its brand of humor, subtlety and wit are not considered virtues in an \\"American Pie\\" world.<br />In \\"American Wedding,\\" Jim and Michelle - he a self-described pervert and she a self-described nympho - have finally agreed to tie the knot.  The film centers around Jim's attempts to convince Michelle's square, uptight, sexually repressed parents that he is indeed husband material for their less-than-innocent daughter.  The problem is that his efforts are consistently being undermined by the inane, out-of-control antics of Steve Stifler, the foulest-mouthed, dirtiest-minded professional adolescent this side of Bluto Blutarsky.  Seann William Scott, in fact, steals the show as Stifler, providing an over-the-top manic energy that is both endearing and infectious.<br />Indeed, without Stifler, there would be precious little to recommend this particular \\"American\\" outing.  The jokes and setups, for the most part, are crude and graphic without being very imaginative, and writer Adam Herz and director Jesse Dylan, even when they hit on an inspired piece of silliness (as when Stiffler winds up dancing mano a mano with a guy in a gay bar), end up diluting the humor by letting the scenes drag on well past the point where they're truly funny anymore.  This is not to say that there aren't a few good laughs in \\"American Wedding,\\" just that they don't come often enough to really lift the film much above the ordinary.  Luckily, the funny moments increase a bit in the final stretches of the movie.  In the film's defense, I would also add that, like its two predecessors and unlike many sexually charged teen comedies, \\"American Wedding\\" conveys a certain affection for its characters.  In addition to Stifler, Jason Biggs as Jim and Eugene Levy as Jim's befuddled but strangely tolerant and supportive father come across as decent, well-meaning and likable individuals.<br />The film itself may be uneven, but as a character actor who makes an indelible impression on the material at hand, Scott is the genuine article.  He transforms what is essentially cinematic rotgut into sweet-tasting vintage wine.  All hail the Stifman!ey're truly funny anymore.

B00000K0DQ|4.0|The death penalty - Dealing with this topic in their movies seems to be very challenging for many directors and actors in Hollywood. During the last years you could watch Gene Hackman in &quot;The Chamber&quot;, Clint Eastwood in &quot;True Crime&quot; or Tom Hanks in &quot;The Green Mile&quot; - all these ones are great movies but you can't overcome the feeling that they are not completely honest; they often seem to be tailored to Hollywood-industry.<BR>Dead Man Walking does not spend so much effort on making the story exciting and unpredictable but therefor it does not fail on presenting all the characters and circumstances concerning the execution in a realistic, human and in an emotional way.<BR>This movie is made plain, there isn't much to distract the audience from the question whether they plead for capital punishment or whether they not. And this is what I like most about this movie: It is not interested in forcing one right opinion about the death penalty upon the audience, but wants you to contemplate about this topic and further about death, forgivness, faith and unlimited love.
B0001GOH6Q|3.0|This movie could have been as good as Forrest Gump, but it lacked a great screenplay.  There are some great moments, but those moments don't come around often enough.  The movie seems to drag quite a bit.  Ewan McGregor stars as the young Albert Finney, and he would have been great had the script not led him astray.<br />This movie had a LOT of potential, and I think that is why I was so disappointed.<br />Tim Burton fans might still like it because of the quirkiness of the storyline and filming, but I'm not a superfan of Burton.<br />Save your cash, rent it, don't buy it.<br />See ya next review.<br />[...]
B0001ADAVK|3.0|I went in to this with a desire to like it and a belief that I wouldn't, and I was pleasantly surprised.  Though the concept seems a little outdated (shouldn't this have come out 30 years ago?), the strong cast kept up my belief that it was dealing with timely issues.  Indeed, I think the movie had less to do with the idea that women need to be able to pay for a room of their own and more to do with the need for greater sisterhood and the ways that women keep each other from succeeding, which was definitely put across more subtly.  <br /> <br />The fact that it had a really good cast certainly helped it out.  Kirsten Dunst played the perfect b****, Julia Stiles the overachiever, and Maggie Gyllenhaal the s*** with a heart of gold, and though their plot lines were, for the most part, predictable, they carried their characters well and convincingly.  I liked Julia Roberts a lot more in this movie than I usually do, though her desire for support from Dominic West seemed both anachronistic with the ideas of the movie and something of a head scratcher.  Marcia Gay Harden played the saddest role in the movie very well if a little broadly, and even Tori Amos made a surprise appearance.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, it was just a little bit unsatisfactory, perhaps because it reckoned back to such Goliaths as To Sir, With Love and, of course, Dead Poets Society, and failed to provide anything particularly new besides an all female cast.  Still, it was better than it was made out to be, and its message was perhaps more timely now than it would have been 10 years ago.  7 out of 10.
B00003CXE7|5.0|The epic may have passed from popularity decades ago, but every so often the genre crops its head up and shows us just why these types of movies are so compelling.  \\"Gladiator\\" is a solidly acted movie and well directed.  I'm not going to hide the fact that Ridley Scott is my favorite director, and this movie is a good example of his directorial talent.  \\"Gladiator\\" certainly has its drawbacks, the most obvious existing in its historical inaccuracies.  Although the rewriting of history is irksome, I have to admit that this is only a movie.  As such, it's primary concerns are maintaining quality acting and artistic vision.  <br />None of the emperors - Marcus Aurelius and his son, Commodus - are true to their historical personas.  In actuality, both were very strong individuals.  I tend to think that \\"Gladiator's\\" Commodus is more like Caligula or Nero - obviously insane with dysfunctional sexual tendencies.  However, since this movie is not a biopic, this is not a major concern.  It's intention was to create a compelling story centering around a fictional general.  Both Richard Harris and Joaquin Phoenix (especially Phoenix) create multi-dimensional characters.  The ending, which I won't spoil here, is completely inaccurate, but, again, I don't consider this a detractor from the film.  <br />The only real thing that bothered me in this film was, firstly, the \\"iffy\\" dialogue the studio squeezed out for Oliver Reed's Proximo after his death.  I suppose recasting his character would have been impossible and disrespectful to Reed, but I don't think that they did an adequate job continuing on his character.  My second criticism is that the movie didn't show enough of the Roman Senate.  I would have liked to have seen how Commodus's rising power affected that elite class as a whole, but then again, that probably wouldn't have been in keeping with the nature of the film, which centers around Maximus.<br />Again, a solidly acted movie with the spectacular Ridley Scott at the directorial helm.  Give up your reservations against its historical inaccuracies and embrace its artistic vision.
B000068PQ0|4.0|Prior to this CD, I have heard of Flaming Lips but never bothered to listen to any of their works.  Getting into new bands, especially if they already have almost 25 years worth of songs behind them, just isnt my thing, so I was really reluctant to give this baby a spin.  i had the same problem getting into old Yes CD's but that;s another story.<br />And i was pleasantly surprised.<br />This CD is perfect if you don't listen to the Lips and want to venture into their works.  All songs are very catchy and the prog-rock stuff here and there really go well with overall theme of fighting giant robots.  There is not a single song I dont like on the CD.  They arent just 3 minute singles either: the entire CD is very epic with each songs carefully composed and put together.<br />I'm not sure about the rest of Flaming Lips's discography, but if you even remotely liked Radiohead's newer recordings like &quot;Kid A&quot; or &quot;Thief&quot; then this CD is for you.
B00005JLRT|2.0|I think this movie was the worst of all the Star Trek movies. I have been a ST fan for as long as I remember but this one was a real let down.  The story line was stupid and the ending was contrived.  It tried to duplicate the feeling everyone got when Spock died.  Well it failed miserably!!!
B000002UJQ|5.0|OK Computer is the best album that has graced the music world. That is my opinion, I am a massive Radiohead fan though so I can't speak for others. All I can imagine is that criticism of OK Computer is from people who don't listen to this kind of music. My thoughts are that OK Computer is a powerful album and so people will tend to either love it or hate it. As you can tell, people have either given this 5 stars or 1 star. I'll admit however that the band have taken a dip in form and this album hit the peak. I suppose it raised peoples expectations and Kid A and Amnesiac may have seemed like a major downfall to many people. Lets not forget though that these albums never produced any singles so I see them as experimental and still produced some terrific stuff. Listen to: Everything in its Right Place, How to Disappear Completely, Optimistic, Idioteque, Morning Bell; Pyramid Song, You and Whose Army &amp; I Might be Wrong. But Radiohead isn't for everyone.
B0001CCXGG|4.0|When you Listen to Joe Satriani &amp; Steve Vai Jam u must be shocked because every time they jam together they play guitar solos that blows your head off the past g3s were amazing with Eric Johnson &amp; John Petrucci but this year comes along someone That a rocket can't keep up with his fingers but unfortunately every yngwie malmsteen fans is going to hate me for what I'm going to say next.<BR>Disc 1 has 13 tracks which is everyone's set of the 3 musketeers of guitar is 20/21 minutes maximum Joe Satriani has 5 tracks, Steve Vai Has 3 Tracks!!!! &amp; Yngwie Malmsteen.<br />Satriani's set was gr8 as any usual Satriani show and I'm not just saying because I'm one satriani's hugest fans, I love what he did with The Extremist some things were new to me but I like variation I like things played differently live on stage than the exact solo from the studio album, Crystal Planet was gr8 also I have to say nice choice because it is after all one of the best Satriani songs speaking about best songs also on the list was Always With Me, Always With You from Surfing With Alien Album &amp; Midnight which was a little different than the original song but gr8 gr8 gr8 job and last it was a little weird to put Mystical potato head groove thing on the list but it's a very cool song.<br />Vai's Set Was only three songs on the album which was a song that I have no idea if it's a song from his studio albums or was it just an original played live on stage any way it was an amazing spectacular song its called You're Here I love the keyboard work than guitar (Strange huh!!!) and the 2nd  song was Reaping which was 7 minutes of amazing soloing I like it and the 3rd which was a disappointment it is whispering a prayer and it was 10 minute long song and to say the truth I get bored on the 4th minute.<br />Malmsteen's Set...... I'm speechless I don't know what to say but it has no definition but awful, horrible &amp; dreadful 5 songs which are Blitzkrieg, Trilogy Suite Op. 5 The 1st movement, Fugue, Finale &amp; A cover for Jimi Hendrix's Red House which was a joke and disgrace to rock history he sang the song like he was making fun of it like a Red House Parody Version.<br />Disc 2 The G3 JAM - now that's what's the Albums whole point is about 3 covers well played well jammed and it satisfies every single satriani, vai &amp; malmsteen fan the songs were Voodoo Child (Slight Return) Jimi Hendrix Cover vocals by malmsteen to be honest not bad on vocal jobs and soloing too he pulled it off with his unlimited speeding, no need to say how amazing vai &amp; satriani were, the 2nd song was Little Wing another cover by Jimi Hendrix Vocals By Vai Nice Job on vocals he and satriani played gr8 solos on this one malmsteen went off beat a little bit with his speeding and agility, and last the best jam ever played on g3 history a 10 minute non-boring song which is Rockin' In The Free World a Neil Young Cover Vocals By Satriani Which he sang with a very nice edgy attitude the 3 of them were more than fantastic my god I couldn't take my breath from the killer solos so generally I rate this Live Album 4 stars.
B0000D96NW|4.0|The first time I listened to this album I remember thinking this is the only nu-metal (i.e. Korn, Disturbed) album I own. But remembering a short attention span requires multiple listens to truly appreciate an album...I forged on. And roundabout the fourth listen it all began to click. Great riffs over at times insistent bass lines and impressive drumming not necessarily in that order. A definate buy for any heavy music fan!
0385510438|1.0|Is it one story or a bunch of mini-stories totally un-related. Huge disappointment
B00005NRO3|4.0|Scream 2 is a good horror/slasher film and is the Sequel to the box office hit Scream. It offers even more chaacter development then the original and in my oppinion is a great film. However I still believe its a step down from the original Scream. The movie is just not as fresh as the original and doesn't do as good of a job of entertaining you as the first film did. The freshness of the first film, was a huge reason why I liked it.<br />But dont let any of the negative of this movie fool you. Scream 2 is definitly worth watching. It's all about a few movie goers coming in to see Stab, a movie based on the book by Gale Weathers and on the first Scream movie. Of course the theatre gives out the costumes used by the killer in the first one to compliment the movie Stab and everyone is going nuts wearing these costumes. Actress Jada Pinkett is killed along with her boyfriend by the new killer, while she is watching the movie. Unfortunatley for her nobody takes note of it, thinking it's all fake and a publicity stunt during the movie. But once the deaths gets back to Sidney (Neve Campbell) she realizes that maybe her life won't be being so normal after all. Sidney, is now in college when she hears about the news and once reuniting with others from the original scream like Randy(Jamie Kennedy) Dewey (David Arquette) and Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox) she begins to run for her life and search for the killer.<br />The movie takes place when both Randy and Sidney are both in college. The movie attempts to use the original formula that made the first Scream movie a hit. Unfortunatley the formula just isn't as fresh in Scream 2, especially with bascially the same characters. Another thing Scream 2 attempts to do is build on character relationships which is done to perfection. Dewey and Gale become closer. Sidney seems to be stronger in this movie and alot more independent, thanks mostly to the great acting by Neve Campbell - who in my oppinion did a great job in this movie. Galeshows a nicer side to herself and shows that she might genuinely care about Sidney and her well being, which was not present in the first movie. Randy is the only character who seems to not have changed since his high school days, but then again he's a very likeable character - and whod ever want him to change? The movie also attempts to throw in a few new characters and keeps you on your feet about who really is the killer. You'll never point to just one person, but 2 or 3 people at all times. At one point you might think Gale so that she could get high box office publicity, Randy because him and Sidney never went out and her new boyfriend just because her boyfriend did it in the last Scream. But you'll never know who it actually was until the final 10 minutes or so. <br />Overall Scream 2 is a great movie with more highs then lows, but just isnt as fresh as the original, which is a hugeletdown in my oppinion.
0385510438|1.0|The author is losing his touch.  The book has more to do with Buying a News Paper and running stories, like about writing about a family's story (Ruffins), Vietnam War or Elections.<br />Very disappointing
6304711875|4.0|Wes Craven's Scream is an amazingly good film. It has just enough laughs and scream to make you want to see the movie over and over. The movie is about a girl named Sidney (Neve Campbell) who believes she is being stalked (not to mention believeing that she will be murdered) by a masked killer. This is where the moie begins. Scream is not the kind of movie that will actually scare you, but the acting is unbelieveable. It seems like all the actors were made for each part and they actually make you believe that these kids care about each other and think whatever comes out of there mouths. <br />Another great thing about the movie is tha it doesn't follow the regular slasher movie formula. Wes Craven makes the movie and in a way innovates the Horror genre. Actually it makes the movie really watchable - the kind of movie you want to see again and again. I think that's really the great thing about the movie - the fact that I can watch it over and over and actually want to see it.<br />So overall Scream is a classic in it's on right, and in my oppinion a great movie. Easily a must-buy.
B000002MT0|5.0|I am a mega Prince fan. His music is the ultimate in music to me and if I had to say what album had the most songs that I loved it would be this. Come, Space, Letitgo, Dark are just to name a few. He is simply the best.
B0000DD7LB|2.0|Britney britney britney...what is the music world to do with her? She can hold a tune, but her voice lacks the power others have. Which is probably why Christina Aguilera can get away with more.<BR>Her latest effort is a sort of rebellious attempt to get the attention that slipping away from her. Rebellious against the squeaky clean image she was supposed to portray...mind you she's a fine one to grumble, she started the i'm a virgin thing herself. Attention because of the provocative lyrics in her album. doesn't anyone tell her stripping yourself on your video and bumping and grinding around with moans and breathy lyrics does NOT help you get noticed for your talent? <BR>This album gets annoying after the first few songs. Leave it on the shelves where it belongs unless you're a rabid Britney fan.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I saw the best show in my entire life last Thursday: Muse at Popscene on their Absolution tour.  This album introduces a sort of Smashing Pumpkins sound on a couple of tracks, a little harder and more abrasive and it totally works.   Highly recommended.  Buy it now!!

B000000P11|5.0|If there was a should have been year in the Chameleons UK history, 1986 would clearly be it when this album was first released. Strange Times demonstrates that on every track, practically in every note!<br />I would like to state that if you purchase this on CD Now, then it is a bargain indeed. I had purchased this a few years ago &amp; paid a lot more. I had to place this on special order, years before the internet. I can't even tell you how many times I have played this outstanding, superb album. It is sad that Chameleons UK does not get the credit that they clearly deserve.<br />Every release that they came out with is first class. However,<br />if  I had to make a choice on the Chameleons UK best release to date, then it would be Strange Times.<br />Strange Times is not for your average listener. If you are looking for fluff, then you come to the wrong place.<br />This is for the consumer who appreciates music with class &amp; substance. From start to finish, there is not one bad song.<br />The tracks flows through one right after the other. Even the bonus tracks are worth listening to.<br />I rate this album one of my personal favorites of all time.<br />Please buy this now &amp; you will see for yourself.

B00003CXE7|5.0|You know, I adore this movie. But I'm not sure I can really say why. I don't do it often, but when I do, I can slip the disc into player and sit through it like I had never seen it before.  <br /> <br />Granted, the story is not all that original. And there are logic flaws (ie Maximus was raised with the emperor's family, but had never been to Rome...unlikely!) But still, there's just something about this movie. Maybe it's that I can sit and watch it, and for the whole 2+ hours I can lose myself in the story. A story that just moves. From point A to B to C... The pace just keeps pulling you along with it.  <br /> <br />I never saw it in the theater, but the film on the DVD is awesomely beautiful.  Or, maybe I adore this movie because Maximus is a character you can't help but root for. And from scene one you get pulled into his story and it won't let you go until the very end.  <br /> <br />On the surface, in this day and age, and given the subject matter, I can understand how some people are surprised  to learn of the awards it's won. But once you've seen it, you'll know it deserved every one that it has received.  <br /> <br />GLADIATOR is why I watch movies.  <br /> <br />GLADIATOR is entertainment.
B0001HAISG|1.0|First, you should not buy this DVD for the fact that you will be forced to watch trailers for Cat in the Hat, and Two Brothers. This is a very aggressive sales technique, and I believe it to be unacceptable. <BR>     Most of the lines from this movie were taken directly from the book. Unfortunately, this was not done well, and caused a chunkiness to the movie. The acting was sub par. The special effects were colorful, yet poorly done. The bluescreen effects were obvious.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Why does George Lucas insist on not listening to his fans??? First it's Jarjar, and now this....... Would it be so hard to make a box set with the original movies in it? Why does Lucas keep making stupid mistakes? The trilogy should be watched with the original footage. Who wants to see those stupid extra scenes...they don't even look good. Jabba becomes a sissy. The computer animation they added looks terrible - it looks so out of place. The dancers in Jabba's place look STUPID!!!! What a let down. Probably won't even buy the trilogy now. Boo hoo! Smarten up Lucas!!!

He was the one who made D12 so you cant say hes racist all his friends are like all black so dont say that racist bulls*%$. if it wasnt for him this Cd wouldnt existand neither would D12! this cd is off the hook anyone who gets a chance to buy it get it! from the first song to the last this cd will have you laughing your ass off not to mention some tight beats. if possible buy the one with the DVD because it has a few special things to it such as the my band music video and the 40 oz video(which is off the chain). very great cd better than their first one. By the way im white so dont go talkign about white people are haters cuz i aint a hater! dont hate the game hate the playa! peace out and support D12 by buyin' D12 world with the bonus DVD! The Cd shows that D12 is  strong group and has a crazy side. The best song off teh Cd is \\"How Come\\" the beat is awesome and it has  agreat poin to the song. My band i ok but it gets old after while but the point of that song is to show the contraversy that eminem gets and how the other guys of D12 dont receive that much credit which is true. Eminem came up with the band he isnt the band though!

B00014TJUC|5.0|Try downloading Stick &amp; Stones for instance. Listen to it, and keep in mind it's nothing but an OK track by Absent Friends' standards... It may be too early to say it, but I do believe Absent Friends will be seen in twenty years as one of the greatest albums of all time.Think about it, just how many other albums have come this close to the beauty of Pet Sounds , Forever Changes or The Queen Is Dead? It's only been released a month ago and I've already seen some people ranking it in their 25 favorites albums ever. <BR>I was at first reluctant to buy Absent Friends because as a 20 years old Punk fan, I thought it could only appeal to older Rock fans like Air's Talkie Walkie did. But when I saw The Divine Comedy had sold out theig gig in Paris in only a couple of days, I thought I should definitly give them a try. No need to say I'm glad I did.<BR>Let's start with the weakest track of this LP: Leaving Today. It's not very tuneful, lyrics are a bit cryptic and musically speaking there's nothing special about it.<BR>That said, everything else is perfect. What is truly amazing is that there isn't any filler here even though the CD clocks at more than 45 minutes. <BR>My favorite songs are &quot;Absent Friends&quot; , a wonderful way to start this journey, &quot;Come Home Billy Bird&quot; and its enchanting chorus, &quot;The Beautiful And The Wreck&quot;, wich a french critic described as &quot;a rocket into my heart&quot;, the excellent closer &quot;Charmed Life&quot;, and... &quot;The Happy Goth&quot;! <BR>How I smiled and joyfully laughed when I first heard this song! It is one of the very few rock songs that has lyrically really spoken to me with The Smiths' &quot;There Is A Light That Never Goes Out&quot;, Hole's &quot;Miss World&quot;, Liz Phair's &quot;F**k and Run&quot; and The Psychedelic Furs' &quot;Pretty In Pink&quot;. I forced all my friends and my whole family to listen to this song, and they all liked it, even my 30 years old techno-fan brother!<br />Whenyou hear the last notes of Charmed Life, there is only one thing you can think about: Thank You , Neil.  I'd like to be like you when I grow up. <BR>Absent Friends is one of these albums you're going to spend your whole life with. It might not move many people, but it will move them deeply (that's it, I'm crying now!). Offer this one to all your friends! And don't expect to see any better album in 2004!<br />THANK YOU SO MUCH NEIL HANNON! THANK YOU FOR MAKING SUCH BEAUTIFUL THINGS!
B000021Y77|4.0|The beginning of Run Lola Run has a narrator stating how countless questions result in answers which in turn gives rise to other questions, and so on, in a chain of answers followed by questions.  &quot;But in the end, isn't it always the same question, and always the same answer?&quot;  The main question might be, will anything I do differently have any consequences?  Or why did this happen?<br />Lola's boyfriend Manni has just botched a drug deal, losing 100,000 marks.  He has to turn over the money to his connection, a nasty and forbidding bald guy, who will kill him in twenty minutes if he doesn't deliver the goods.  Lola, calm, usually on time, and loyal as ever, does what she can to help out her man, who increasingly desperate as time runs out, considers holding up the local supermarket to get the money.  She's running a race against time, encountering all sorts of people, including a bicycle courier, a Mr. Meyer who's a colleague of her father, and her father, a humorless, ice-in-his-veins banker who's carrying on with one of his female colleagues, who is pregnant.<br />This portrays three different scenarios of Lola running to save Manni, and demonstrates how one small action or variation can have enormous consequences on other people.  An example is the blonde woman walking with the baby carriage.  Each time she responds differently to Lola dashing by her.  We then see in a series of quick still photo montages what would later happen to her.  In one version, she ends up injured from an attack; in another, she ends up winning the lottery.  Another is how long the conversation between Lola's father and his lover has progressed before Lola bursts in on them, asking her father for money.  Each time, the outcome is different, affecting her father's attitude to her and what Lola does.<br />Another interesting aspect is Lola's piercing glass-shattering scream, which becomes the emanation of her desperation, whether it to be telling her boyfriend to shut up so he can calm down, or her anger at her father refusing to help her.<br />Franka Potente's Lola really lifts the film up, her bright vermilion hair, cyan tank top, and blue jeans nearly mirroring the primary colours of light.  She gives credibility in a character who is so much more with it than her boyfriend, whose over-reliance on her makes him incompetent, pathetic, and lacking direction.<br />Director Tom Tykwer must have been influenced by music videos as the swift jump cuts in scenes, nothing that requires a bottle of Dramamine by the TV set, mind you, as the pulsing techno score, matching Lola's frantic running, attest to.  An interesting piece of cinema from Germany, great in style and structure.an calm down, or her anger at her father refusing to help her.<br />Franka Potente's Lola really lifts the film up, her bright vermilion hair, cyan tank top, and blue jeans nearly mirroring the primary colours of light.

B0001Z53AQ|4.0|The first cd was better I would have to say. But this is not that bad of a follow up. You can listen through this cd and not get bored. I would have to say that Eminem is not a &quot;JERK&quot; the song My Band is just a joke. Jeez get a sense of humor.
0345457684|5.0|Richard Morgan's Altered Carbon is a book about self and identity. Furthermore, the book is an exciting hybrid of cyberpunk and detective noir genres. The plot and themes basically revolve around the idea that in the 25th century humans are issued a cortical stack, implanted into their spines, into which consciousness is digitized and can be downloaded with its memory intact, into a new body or \\"sleeve\\". <br />Here I was thinking we'd heard the death rattle of cyberpunk. Even William Gibson, the godfather of the sub-genre, abandoned his sci-fi stomping grounds for the present day in his Zeitgeist-capturing Pattern Recognition of last year. But Morgan has not only proved that there's some mileage yet in the flailing sub-genre, but has also gone a long way to revitalising it.<br />Morgan's writing is also informed by a Socialist concern for the de-humanising effect of technology and the domination of technology by the capitalist class. One nice idea is that of the Methuselahs, or \\"Meths\\", who are wealthy enough to back up their minds on a regular basis and have multiple cloned sleeves of themselves, providing a type of immortality, and who rule Earth as puppet-masters behind UN governmental organs. Morgan writes about the underclass that is chewed-up and spat out by society.<br />It's easy to see why this book was optioned by a film studio for a squillion dollars, because Morgan's writing is very cinematic, though I'm sure that if Altered Carbon makes it on to celluloid, some of the violence and sex from the book will be toned down. But what impressed me most was the detail Morgan injects into his writing. He does more than paint on a thin veneer of been-there-done-that generic cyberpunk, but instead evokes a grim and gritty milieu, obviously more inspired by Ridley Scott's Blade Runner than Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, in which the reader can totally immerse themselves. But Morgan never overwrites, and his prose always remains hard and lean.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Lucus could just as easily release both versions on DVD to please everyone, but do you think he cares one bit about his fans other then their money? Of course not. I urge everyone to sign the petition for the original trilogy on DVD. There are about 60,000 signatures there right now. Maybe if the number grows to 500,000 signatures he might change his tune.. not wanting to miss out on the extra money.
B000002MY3|4.0|Alanis Morissette's debut is probably considered one of the highlights of the '90s. Her angry and edgy lyrics would definately appeal to rock lovers but the songs (which are surprisingly radio friendly) would appeal to pop lovers. Her lyrics are quite pessimistic- sometimes I feel like I wrote them. I was a little surprised at first, I thought this CD would be a bit more 'rock' but I quickly grew used to it. It's a great pop/rock CD. Some of my favorite songs are:<br />1.) All I Really Want- wow, as soon as I heard this song I felt like I had wrote down some of the lyrics myself. \\"And there I go jumping before the gunshot has gone off/slap me with a splintered ruler\\".<br />2.) You Oughta Know- probably the first released single (not sure though). Great, you can really feel her anger, loss, and frustration. \\"And everytime I scratch my nails down someone else's back, I hope you feel it\\".<br />4.) Hand In My Pocket- in this song she is very sarcastic (\\"Everything's gonna be fine, fine, fine\\"). The part where she says \\"No one's really got it figured out just yet\\" is so true.<br />5.) Right Through You- this is another song where I feel like I could have wrote the lyrics, they are so true. She isn't bashing men (people who say she is sexist never even listened to her songs) she is just bashing a certain 'type' of man. \\"You took me for a joke/you took me for a child/you took a long hard look at my ass and then you played golf for a while\\".<br />8.) Head Over Feet- I've heard this song before on the radio, I'm familiar with it. It's actually the only love song on the entire CD but at the same time she is almost pessimistic about falling love.<br />10.) Ironic- again I've heard this song a lot before. It's a great song, you can see her pessimistic outlook on life. \\"He waited his whole damn life to take that flight/and as the plane crashed down he thought, well isn't this nice.\\"<br />Overall this is a great CD that definately deserves a place in your collection. Ignore all those people who say she has a terrible voice, it works great with the music. They can go listen to their Celine Dion crap instead.hose people who say she has a terrible voice, it works great with the music. They can go listen to their Celine Dion crap instead.
B000089RVX|5.0|I bought this album for it's songs My Immortal, Bring Me To Life, and Going Under, when I decided to listen to the whole album it was all very good.  Evanescence is one of the best rock bands in a long time.  Every song on the album I liked, especially the hits I already noted, I also very much enjoyed Hello. Hello and My Immortal both were so sad that they brought me to tears.  So if you like their hits, BUY THE WHOLE CD!, cuz it's all good from beginning to end. I love you Amy!
B00004TH7Z|4.0|At the time of this album's release, it was the first album Iron Maiden had recorded with Bruce Dickinson in 7 years. They show they can still rock as hard as anything. I rated this 4 stars instead of 5, because Thin Line Between Love And Hate is very weak. But other than that, this is one of Maiden's best. I love the progressive, yet straightfoward sound. Many other reviewers say this is an alternative album. I just don't understand how they got that idea. It doesn't sound one bit like alternative. Apparently they didn't really listen to this album. This recording is essential to any headbanger who wants to hear their favorite bands still rocking strong.
0316666343|1.0|I am being ruthless here because Sebold graduated from the prestigious MFA program at UCI (my alma matter!)that is harder to get into than Harvard medical school and I think this could been a lot better. Were are this centuries great authors because baby, she aint it!<br />Alice Sebold's novel lovely bones starts out as an intriguing read, but as you move on becomes more and more unrealistic.  Why I gave this 1 star:<br />-charachter construction is unrealistic<BR>-she sentimatalizes greif <br />-inconsistant descriptions<BR>-you always want to skip to the end, but you aren't sure why<BR>-she spews out hollow and annoying literary allusions (I wonder if she is trying to sound smarter than she is)<br />Firstly, it is easy for authors to manipulate readers, it is another thing entirely to write a great novel.  In other words- just because it makes you cry, doesn't mean that it is good.  Sebolds novel is manipulative without reason. I think Sebold needs to take a breather and read some of the great books that she is trying to emulate. <BR>Charachter construction is oddly done- Susie, for example, a girl who is not as smart as her sister- is constantly brining up literary allusions that a ungifted 14 year old would not use in everyday language.... for example at one point she mentions that she read &quot;Are you there god, its me, margret&quot; and at others points she is spewing out information about great masterpices.  I didn't know that in heaven you get a BA in english without trying! Anyway, sebold makes fundamental inconsistancies in her charachters that make this book half wonderful/half joke.  AND I think (if I am not mistaken) she mentions her house was one level (just like Mr. HArvey her killer's) but in the section where her sister goes into Mr. Harvey's house she jumps out a second floor window! I would expect more from an author who graduated from UCI's prestigious MFA program. This book is a good idea that flops.
B000002GMT|5.0|I loved this follow up to &quot;ABBA Gold,&quot; yet this album delivers a very different set of ABBA hits. If you are a casual ABBA fan and want to listen to the songs that were most prominent on the radio like &quot;SOS&quot; and &quot;Dancing Queen,&quot; you may want to opt for the original ABBA Gold.<br />What makes &quot;More Gold&quot; stand apart from the original is revealed best in the lyrics. The first &quot;Gold&quot; has songs of love, sensual desire, and inspiration, all that express the core passions in a nutshell. The songs in &quot;More Gold&quot; tend to tell more detailed stories behind these emotions, be it a slice-of-life narrative like &quot;The Day Before You Came&quot; (a woman recounting the last time her weekday routine felt comfortable but mundane, which was the day before she meets her lover for the first time)or a classic myth in &quot;Cassandra.&quot;<br />The story telling nature of the tunes on &quot;More Gold&quot; sound more like something we would hear in a stage musical rather than on the radio or a rock concert. Perhaps Benny &amp; Bjorn were getting the &quot;theater bug&quot; while penning these songs, as both went on to collaberate on musicals like &quot;Chess&quot; and &quot;Kristina Fran Duvemala.&quot;<br />The most recognizable hit on this CD is &quot;I Do, I Do, I do,&quot; but virtually every song is a pleasure. The only tracks that left me flat were &quot;I Wonder&quot; (I love whimsical songs, but this was a little too over-the-top melodramatic for me) and &quot;When I Kissed the Teacher.&quot; Neither of these tunes take anything away from &quot;More Gold&quot; being a great buy.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|Arguably the greatest western ever made, Sergio Leone's \\"Once Upon A Time In The West\\" is also one of the great movies regardless of genre, long overlooked but now getting the full respect it is due.<br />The story is typical western fare - some outlaws want land on the frontier, and some mysterious strangers step in to even the score - but the film itself is anything but typical. Artfully directed, beautifully scored, wonderfully acted, if given reams of text there would not be enough accolades for this film. Leone took everything he learned with the Eastwood trilogy and applied it here to startling effect.<br />While there is some really great action, this isn't \\"Young Guns.\\" While this film has plenty of artful style, this isn't \\"The Thin Red Line.\\" While there is plenty of epic storytelling, this isn't \\"Lawrence of Arabia.\\" It is, however, a mix of all three, with a dash of \\"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\\" thrown in for good measure.<br />The cast is superb. This is a classic Charles Bronson role; mysterious, moody, and conveying so much with so few words. Claudia Cardinale is simply ravishing; sad and beautiful and lonely. Jason Robards plays a great character; funny and tough, mean and charming. But the real standout here - a real feat, considering Bronson's effort - is Henry Fonda in a rare villainous role. No need to mince words: Fonda kicks tail. Simply awesome.<br />But the real star of this show is the gorgeous cinematography, looking jaw-dropping in this restored widescreen DVD. It is a feast for the eyes. No Leone film ever looked this good. The picture is so crisp it could have been filmed yesterday. Couple that with an incredible remastered score and we're talking about some fabulous DVD production. Far and away better than what gets run on TV these days.<br />The package gets even better. This DVD features a strong commentary track with a number of commentators, a one-hour documentary on the film that is very well done, and a few other minor treats.Fantastic stuff, especially for the low price.<br />Precious few movies get as good as this. Run, don't walk, and pick this up. This is a MUST OWN for all film fans, western lovers or not.
B00008BRDX|4.0|The sound of The Police evolved from pretentious punk rock to sharp new wave for REGGATTA DE BLANC, the group's second album and commercial breakthrough.  There's still some high-velocity songs here (\\"It's Alright For You\\", \\"No Time This Time\\"), but the majority of the tracks are a little more laid-back.  Half of REGGATTA DE BLANC features some of the band's best work, namely the classics \\"Message in a Bottle\\" and \\"Walking on the Moon\\", while the other half lacks the power and originality of some of the group's other compositions.  The result is the group's most unfocused and weak effort; the band has admitted that many of the songs were written simply as filler.  The album has many highlights, however (beside the aforementioned classics), including \\"The Bed's Too Big Without You\\", the Grammy Award-winning title track, \\"Bring on the Night\\", and Stewart Copeland's quirky, amusing \\"On Any Other Day\\".  It's not a bad album, but it is the least impressive album from The Police's portfolio.
B00002Z88D|5.0|S&amp;M is by far one of the best CD's I own and have ever heard. You take Metallica, throw is an orchestra, and you have S&amp;M. If you only get one Metallica CD, this is the one to get. it includes all of the Metallica classics (Master of Puppets, Enter Sandman, Nothing Else Matters) and includes 2 new Metallica songs, No Leaf Clover and Human. The concert is on 2 CDs and is about 2 and a half hours long. If you buy this CD and you like it, buy the DVD. The DVD is even better!
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|I don't know what kind of music all you haters listen to, but this cd was off the hook. all 21 tracks on this cd were good. i bet all the people that are writing bad reviews about this cd  are probably all white people. ya'll sure don't know what hip hop is. don't buy cd's that you know you're not gonna like just because you want to be and act cool. this cd was the s*** and everyone that is not a hater (white) knows it too. peace.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|This is both a response to the naysayers and a review. I have noticed that many people did not like this movie. While I have not taken the time to read 700+ reviews, I am noticing a trend. Most of the people that did not like the movie did not really understand it. I have seen this movie several times and I think it is brilliant. <br />The Indian family and the Oracle's new skin seems to irritate a few people. To really understand what is going on here and in other parts of the movie, it helps to play Enter the Matrix. The video game shows you what Ghost and Niobe are doing during what is roughly the second film. In the video game, they meet with the Oracle. During this meeting, the Oracle explains the Indian girl is very important to the future of the Matrix (this will be played out on the Matrix Online). For that reason, the Oracle allowed the Indian family to save their child by giving the Merovingian the code to her shell. I noticed a relatively recent naysayer was annoyed by the Indian family at the beginning and end of the movie. Yes, they are important.<br />Spoiler alert! Next I address the final fight between Neo and Smith which also seems to confuse and annoy many people. The only reason I discuss this is because many people have already seen this movie and have decided they do not like it. Hopefully the following will make you think twice. I think the DVD is a good buy because the trilogy needs to be seen more than once to truly appreciate how it all comes together.<br />Other naysayers seem to think this is just an action flick. Yes there is a lot of shooting involved in the defense of Zion but the real conflict is the one between Smith and Neo. Smith mocked the Oracle about how she must have been waiting there for him purposely. She was. Why did Smith laugh when he absorbed her? He laughed because he saw her vision of him triumphing over Neo. THAT is why he did not attack Neo with everything he had. He knew the outcome and figured one was enough. One naysayer seemed annoyed how Smith did not act like a computer virus. Well, I credit the Wachowski brothers for not having the machines act like stereotype machines. With the coming of AI, they begin to develop human emotions. Persephone says in the video game when one of the characters asks her &quot;What do you want?&quot; that long ago she did not even know what that meant but that now it is all she ever thinks about. Yes Persephone persists with the Merovingian (and why not, he is powerful) but she lusts after emotion, particularly love. Does it not then stand to reason that Smith has developed a bit of an ego? He has seen the future and figures he can beat Neo with just one form of himself... how very human. The only problem for Smith was that the Oracle was using him. At the key moment, Smith says the Oracle's line of &quot;Everything that has a beginning has an end, Neo.&quot; Smith ALWAYS calls Neo &quot;Mr. Anderson.&quot; Now, if that was not enough to give away the Oracle's involvement, she is lying there after all of the Smiths are destroyed. The Smith fighting Neo was the Oracle-Smith. Brilliant.<br />Others hate this movie because it does not wrap things up nicely. Well, that is because the story is far from over. It will continue with the Matrix Online.<br />To sum up and keep this from being a thesis on the Matrix, this trilogy is not meant for the majority of the public. To truly understand what the Wachowski brothers have created, you need to see the Trilogy, play the Enter the Matrix video game, and watch some key parts of the Animatrix. Once you have done all of that you can begin to piece it all together and smile. If you want to see how the story continues, you need to play Matrix Online, a MMORPG (massive multiplayer online roleplaying game). The Wachowski brothers are gamers. I am one of thousands upon thousands of gamers and we are their real audience. If you want to understand, join us and see how deep the rabbit hole goes.
B00004Y6NV|3.0|The tracks on this, Dire Straits' farewell album, are pleasant enough... but the group just seems exhausted and drained of energy, in spite of a six year break after 'Brothers In Arms'. It marks a return to the style of the first two albums with a laid-back style and shorter songs and the new expanded lineup is impressive, however Mark Knopfler's talent for excellent lyrics appears less sharp.  The result is an album that didn't produce any hit singles and did not really meet expectations.  <br />By no means a bad LP but not the band's best work, and the subsequent tour was somewhat disappointing as well.  At that time Mark Knopfler just seems like a musician at the end of his life, and Dire Straits disbanded in 1995.  However you should get this one in order to complete the set of studio albums from a group that were undoubtedly quiet achievers, but put out some brilliant music during their peak.

B00008WT5M|5.0|at first i didn't know what to think of this cd.  it dosen't sound a lot like the other ac/dc albums, but after a year of listening to it i have to say that works to it's advantage.<br />songs like 'are you ready' and 'rock your little heart out' rock just as hard as anything they did in the early 80's.<br />also the production values on it are excellent, every instrument sqeak sounds crisp and clean.
630512065X|4.0|hey musical-lovers,<br />  Im actually yet to see the musical in all its wonders but am currently using one of the songs for a school project and am loving the music! Not to sure how I'd like the real thing but if the mystical tunes are anything to go by, you've got yourself a good source of entertainment. An amateur production of it was put on at my dance school a while ago and it was very impressive without the expenses so if you consider this a reliable source, I'd recommend you and even myself to get out there and see what 'Cats' is all about. Just venting my views. . . but feel free to protest!
B0000AXE8I|2.0|The SCI-FI genre continues to suffer over the CGI inspired style over substance theme.  I thought after the fist Matrix film in '99  that it was a good chane that the Wachowski Brothers could breathe new life in the SCI-FI genre.  Then Matrix Unloaded came out and I was wrong.  The First film witch actually made sense.  Had a good storyline Keanu Reeves didn't speak much. Hence he had very little dialogue SFX that was not overdone.  The violence a little overdone but still tastefull.  Carrie-Anne Moss had very little dialogue also.  Laurence Fishburne's character was totally on point.  Then comes UNLOADED.  Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss are given way to much monologue (Note to Wachowski Bros. the difference between monologue and dialogue) they are not really good actors but you could look past that fact in the first one because the storyline was actually thought provoking.  (...).  And Morpehus has this stupid out of character speech.  And why the heck dose Zion look like crap you spend 100's of millions to produce this sequal and Zion looks like it was filmed in a sewer a la Teenage Muntant Ninja Turtles.  I'm also so sick of the Matrix Unloaded apologist saying you haven't seen it enough or you just don't understand Anime, or New Age Mysticism.  I say your full of bull.  First lets get one thing striaght which is 99.5% of Anime is GARBAGE!  (...)  Also Anime is a animation syle much like the Steamboat Willie and Felix the cat and Oswald the Rabbit look of the 1920's and early 30's in the US.  (...)  Second I don't care what you say about the religous influence the philosophy of Unloaded just dose not make sense whatsover.  What was the point of the new characters?  Jada had only eight or nine lines.  And what's up with that sex scene its got to be one of the most disgusting sex scenes of all time holes and all.  Also way to much CGI.  Which is ironic sense that the computers use the humans as energy. So know the Wachowski Bros. are relying on CGI to do all thework instead of writing an interesting storyline.  And Joel Silver had the nerve to talk about George Lucas.  At least Lucas had enough sense to wait in between years to fix storyline problems i.e. toning down Jar Jar, and recover in Episode 2.  Unlike the Wachowski Bros. who wrote to awful monologue read monologue filled scripst whith to many characters popping in without knowing anything about them.
B00000634J|5.0|Normally I disregard ignorant people who waste their time bashing artists in music review forums,  as opposed to giving an actual concrete estimation of the album in question. I make an exception here.<br /> To the person below who decided to use this space to rant about their hatred of John Lennon: grow up. Lennon never claimed to be  a saint or a perfect person, and constantly made others aware that he had indeed made many mistakes. But who are we to judge someone and cast stones because of things that happened in their life that they may or may not have had control over?<br /> Would it be right for me, for example, to call Kurt Cobain a useless heroin-addicted, self-centered idiot who took his life and gave no credence to that of his daughter's? No. And I wouldn't, because I don't know what the man was going through.<br /> John Lennon was a very complex, brilliant man. His solo music, contrary to the claims of many, does not suck by any means. He wrote from his heart and from his soul, and many times he sounded angry or troubled or happy or lovey-dovey...but it was all him! He didn't mask himself, he didn't invent little stories, he said it like it was and he didn't deny his own mistakes.<br /> I would also like to remind people that the man was only 40 years old when his life was taken from him. 40!!! When his first child was born he was 22. Sure, he could have been the devoted, doting father, but where would the Beatles have been? Hmm? Would we have had Hard Day's Night, Help or Rubber Soul or &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot;, &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;, &quot;Norweigen Wood&quot; or any of the other gorgeous music he created if he had stayed at home and become John the Loving and Devoted Father.<br /> No. He was messed up in a lot of ways, and yes he left his first wife for Yoko, but he didn't hide it! He walked around with her and said, &quot;yes I left my wife for Yoko, I love Yoko, my first marriage wasn't working, and c'est la vie!&quot; If you ask me, in order for John Lennon to grow as an artist and a person, he needed to make all the mistakes he made. At 40 he seemed to have his life pretty much sorted and his son Julian and him were building up what would have been a pretty great relationship, according to Julian, but we all know what happened.<br /> So go to your Nirvana board and preach about Cobain there. John Lennon was a genius and my favorite musician, yes, and I know he had flaws, strengths, angry days, happy days and lots of love. He was the personification of what it means to be a human being and accept that you have limitations, and admit them.<br /> This is a beautiful album. I own it, don't listen to it much though...I have his other albums and I love to listen to all of them all the way through because, for me, his music is glorious. But for starts, get it! You'll learn a lot about a person who opened his life up, to be scorned or mocked, or praised...he had convictions and he lived his up until his death. So just back off and let him R.I.P.
B0000640VO|5.0|This is a film of exquisite beauty, for eye, ear, mind and heart. The plot is simple, but some of the insights are mind-blowing! Quite profound! The use of color has rarely been so magnificent, and it all is SO important to understanding where sweet Amelie is coming from. Lovely fantasy stuff, mixed with the real world. I avoided seeing this film, but I borrowed the 2-disc version from the library, and was thoroughly entertained. Audrey Tautou reminds me of a young Audrey Hepburn, as well as Julia Roberts...without trying to imitate them. She's endearing. All of the supporting roles were done with conviction and strength, especially Mathieu Kassowitz, as the object of her obsession. Jean-Pierre Jeunet, like some of our other GREAT directors (Scott, Cameron, Fincher) got his big break directing an &quot;Alien&quot; film. The second disc tells that he was so upset with the Hollywood process and lack of artistic control, that he's gone somewhat independent since then. He's given us wonderful stuff like &quot;Delcatessen&quot;. It's a sweet story, but if you're into visual art, be sure to see this film. Also, the music of Vann Tiersen will draw you more and more into this fantasy. It's wonderful!The 2.35:1 Letterbox shows off gorgeous sets and cinematography. &quot;Amelie&quot; is definitely worth a look.
0790725657|5.0|I don't really know why, but I love this movie. I have loved it since I was in third grade. I'm not usually one to enjoy \\"magical\\" or \\"Hollywood-ending\\" movies, but this is an exception. I love Liesel Matthews as Sara - she is not too sweet, not too perky, not too anything that child actresses usually are. Perhaps the plotline of the movie isn't like the book, but that doesn't bother me. The film and the book are in different leagues. I recommend this movie.
B000001FA4|3.0|After a succesion of rather aggressive, bombastic albums opened their career, the sound and textures of 'The Unforgettabe Fire' were most certainly a shock to many critics and fans of U2 during this time.  It is a large stylistic leap from the raw emotion of 'War', released, amazingly, only one year earlier.  However in terms of style and lyrical focus, the two albums are quite dissimilar.<br />The production team of Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, who would guide U2 through some of their most successful albums (Joshua Tree, Achtung Baby, All That You Can't...), take the reins for the first time on this album.  Warmer sounds and textures, such as electronic keyboards, muffled, reverb-laden drums, and assorted studio trickery, bring an added depth heretofore unheard on a U2 album.<br />Musically, many songs on the album find U2 in top form.  The gourgeous, layered opener &quot;A Sort of Homecoming&quot;, the blissful title track, the triumphant (if overplayed) &quot;Pride&quot;, and the energetic &quot;Wire&quot;, show U2 at their creative peak to that point int heir career.  Unfortunately, those were also the first four songs on a ten track album, and things get a bit bogged down in the second half.<br />&quot;4th of July&quot; acts as a prelude to &quot;Bad&quot;, yet is truly only a meandering filler track.  &quot;Elvis Presley And America&quot; is a plodding, 6 minute number which goes nowhere and features undecipherable, improvised lyrics from Bono.  Even the epic &quot;Bad&quot;, which many U2 fans (rightfully so) cite as one of the band's all-time great numbers, did not hit its true stride until performed live on the subsequent tour.  Here, it is a good idea of a song that *tries* to build up yet never reaches a full head of steam.  Check the live version released on the absurdly-overpriced &quot;Wide Awake in America&quot; to see what this track was capable of becoming.<br />Lyrically, Bono tackles much more personal and intimate subject matters than the political rantings evident on &quot;War&quot;.  For the first time, he deals with personal relationships and the trials and nuances that go with them.  A vague spirituality overshadows the album as well, a theme which would be played out much more thoroughly on the ensuing &quot;Joshua Tree&quot;.  Though some bits are overt and obvious (&quot;MLK&quot;), and others simply bad (&quot;Elvis Presley...&quot;), overall the album shows a maturing Bono and a more thoughtful, intimate side than was evident before.<br />All in all, &quot;Unforgettable Fire&quot; is a solid effort from the band, and is stylistically a sizeable step forward.  As with any such effort, there are bound to be growing pains, and they are certainly evident here.  But in this case, the power of the good songs outweigh the deficiencies left from the bad ones, creating an enjoyable, if uneven, album overall.  3.5 stars.
B00005JMEW|4.0|Kill Bill rocks. QT's dark sense of humor kept me rolling on the floor and the cinematic displays are awe-inspiring. It works this way: if you like Quentin Terrantino, you'll like Kill Bill. If you don't, you won't.<br />I would recommend, regardless of my high opinion of this movie, that if you can hold out for the purchase, then do so. Since Kill Bill volumes one and two are actually one movie (not a movie and a sequel), I've a strong feeling that after volume 2 is released, you'll be able to purchase the whole movie as a set. So hang in there if you can - volume two ought to be out on DVD right quick.
1400034779|5.0|I have really enjoyed this book very much and am looking forward to reading the author's other ones as well.<br />Mma Ramotske, a very intelligent African woman always had her ambitions of starting a detective agency, rare for a woman in Africa. So with a little money left by her deceased father, she opened up the agency in a small storefront. Business begins slowly, but as she becomes more well-known, she has some interesting cases to solve. <br />One of her main cases is about a boy who had vanished from his home for no reason; and Mma Ramotske works on solving the case piece by piece.<br />She also uncovers a con-man in the story, as well as the discovery of a missing husband.<br />I highly recommend the book-it's very difficult to lay it down.
0140157247|4.0|This book is depressing more than any book I have ever read, due to the fact that this, more or less, really happened. Even more depressing is that this was allowed to happen in America. Steinbeck captures the reality and tragedy of the era perfectly; he even adds a direct quote from a newspaper (chapter 19) to create this sense of reality. He develops the characters perfectly, and the reader feels a great compassion for them, even in the beginning of the book. It breaks my heart watching the family fall apart one by one. The story is interesting as well, and is easy to read. Only about half of the chapters are plot; the rest are free-writes, or, to some extent, prose poetry. These chapters help define the book, and set it aside from other literature. Most of these chapters are interesting; some are Steinbeck's way of theorizing about life through his writing; some help tell the setting; some advance the plot in a less focused way (tell about the nation as a whole). There is a lot of symbolism in the many anecdotes scattered throughout, and each one can take on whatever the reader sees. This book is a classic that everyone should read at least once.
0385336810|4.0|I read fast because it was very funny and entertaning.  Indeed, it was a girlie book ... what can you expect of a book with a bright pink cover? However, I found it very entertaining and hilarious.  I read it as I walked on the treadmill, and I found myself laughing out loud.
B00004ZD69|5.0|I was first intrigued about GSY!BE (is that how you're supposed to abbreviate it now?)after hearing their name bandied about in the same circles as Mogwai and Sigur Ros. While I have yet to get around to purchasing any Mogwai, I took the plunge and bought this tasty little cd on the basis of a few audio clips, good word of mouth, and various Amazon reviews. Man oh man am I happy I picked this one up!!!!<br />The group definitely has a kinship with Sigur (and what little Mogwai I've heard)...and if this is so-called 'post rock', let it be. I was under the assumption that that tag referred to all those boring Chicago groups like Tortoise and Slint and that math-rock type stuff (though there is some Don Caballero I like-but I digress). <br />Post rock in this case apparently means 'Floyd-like' without the annoying histrionics of Roger Waters. So imagine the best parts of The Wall or Animals without Roger's anguished vocals and the slow pomposity inherent in most mid-seventies dinosaur rock. <br />No-that really doesn't do it justice. Maybe it's more like 'OK Computer' without the heavy-handed politics. Ah-forget it. These guys are in a league of their own. They satiate my Floyd jones with all their cool found-sound field recordings (I'm listening to the glockenspiel duet on disc two right now), fulfill my need for loud anthemic guitar-based rock (probably instilled in me from a youth spent listening to older siblings' Floyd, Zeppelin, and Yes records), and quell/excite that cool millennial vibe expressed in the best Sigur and Radiohead. <br />I read somewhere recently that since the dot.com bubble burst, we no longer need 'chill out' music or the aural wallpaper of the Chemical Bros. While I do miss those days, I also believe that bands such as GSY!BE, Sigur Ros, and the less-whiny moments of Radiohead are filling that void with music that matters: soulful, live, experimental, and emotional (not 'emo').<br />Simply put, this album has become my favorite repeated-listening experience since my college discovery of Sonic Youth's Daydream Nation. Ignore it at your peril.

B00009V8Z9|5.0|what can i say about gavin degraw that hasn't already been said? i've read a lot of the other reviews on this site and i have to agree wholeheartedly with every single one of them. i listen to my gavin cd at least once a week because his soulful sound and inspiring lyrics give me such a great escape from my hectic life. i first heard and saw gavin perform on last call w/ carson daly and it was love at first sight( for his music, i mean. though, he's not bad to look at either, lol). i knew from that moment that i had to go out and buy his cd, and i wasn't the least bit disappointed. from &quot;follow through&quot; to &quot;i don't wanna be&quot; (which happens to be one of my favorites on the cd), every single song is flawless and you'll have them stuck in your head all day long, which isn't a bad thing in my opinion. so go out and buy it and i promise, you won't be disappointed.

B0000AFQS0|5.0|Today two old rockers ride the gravytrain pretending to be the men that they used to be 30 years ago. They can still make a lot of noise and remind people of how marvellous their band used to be, to the point that they've become their own tribute band. For those who have only discovered The Who in recent years, buy this DVD and see what the fuss was really all about and how they gained their reputation as a fantastic live act and an innovative bunch of musicians. Sadly the wheels came off The Who's wagon in 1978 but from 1970 until 1976 it was an unstoppable juggernaut and something wonderful to behold.<br />The film restoration is superb and the bonus features will stand a few viewings. This DVD set surely sets the 'gold standard' for classic rock restorations.
