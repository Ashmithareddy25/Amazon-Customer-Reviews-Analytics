B00005JKNC|4.0|Most of us aren't used to seeing Jim Carrey in a serious role, but he did an admirable job as a man accused by the government of being a communist. He becomes involved in a car wreck and upon waking (far away from the crash site) has no idea of who he is. He is then mistaken for a popular town-boy lost in WWII. Confusion, mayhem, tragidy, and love are all presented in his new life. Great supporting cast, especially Martin Landau who is great in just about every movie he does.
B0000004V2|5.0|This album is absolutely beautiful to say the least!  One of the best albums ever made period!  You want Brit pop, this is the cornerstone...this is the standard.  Music rarely reaches this level but when it does it is wonderful!  <BR>Easily 5 stars!
B0000640VN|2.0|If you get the opportunity to view this film, do yourself a favor and jump off a cliff instead .... you'll get more out of it. How an up and coming actor like Hugh Jackman could associate himself with this garbage is beyond me, but I'm betting his manager got fired.<br />Meg Ryan in yet another attempt to rekindle the magic from her previous film You've Got Mail in Seattle while You were Sleepless. Yes I know those were two films, but I prefer to call them one becuase they were the same bunch of ...<br />Garbage, garbage, garbage.
B00005QIPH|4.0|The first time I heard of the Strokes was when I saw the video for &quot;Last Nite&quot; on MTV2.  I wasn't aware of the hype, or that they were supposed to &quot;save rock music.&quot;  I bought the CD because I liked the music.  Is it derivative?  Yes.  Is it on a major label? Yes.  But it's good music.  Disliking a band just because it's critically acclaimed or mainstream is as narrowminded as refusing to listen to indie music.  I like Led Zeppelin; I also like Gorky's Zygotic Mynci.  So, forget all the hype, listen to the CD, and enjoy it for what it is.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|Russell Crowe has hit another homerun with this film of the genius John Nash's life. Seems anything Ron Howard touches these days turns to gold and this film is no exception.<br />John Nash, although a genius, is a tortured soul who is forced to learn to live with his demons or lose the very life he has come to love.<br />This film drags a bit in the middle, but do not be discouraged. It will pick back up, perhaps when you least expect it to. Jennifer Connelly and Ed Harris do a fantastic job as supporting actors. And the story, based on the true life of John Nash, is a great film but is not reccommended for those with the attention span of the average MTV viewer. Its an intricate story that needs your full attention to fully appreciate it.
B00005JKNC|5.0|Ok, I never thought I'd say this, as Jimmy Stewart is my favorite actor from my favorite movie (It's a Wonderful Life), but I truly believe Jim Carrey is becoming a modern-day Jimmy Stewart, that is, if he keeps doing movies like this one and The Truman Show.  I thought this movie looked interesting when I first picked it up, but I was absolutely blown away by it.  It truly deserves an Academy Award, together with his acting and Martin Landau's.  It's about a Hollywood film writer (Carrey) who, after falsely being accused of being a &quot;communist&quot; during the famous &quot;Hollywood Blacklist&quot; scandal time, he gets into an accident where he bumps his head.  He awakens on a beach with amnesia.  A good samaritan takes him into town to help him and he becomes mistakenly identified as one of the town's long-lost, believed dead, war heroes.  Again, it was moving, riveting, interesting and just all-around great.  There is no violence or obscenities.  Makes you wish that times were still like that, where being a good person still mattered.  I hope they keep making movies like this and that Jim Carrey keeps making movies like this.  I never liked him when he did those silly &quot;Pet Detective&quot; movies, but as a dramatic actor, (with some comedy), he is superb.
B000066JLO|5.0|I thought the latest re-master of this album and the companion set, Sunday at the Village Vanguard, was good. This one really tops them both, and I hope they re-release Sunday soon. This is my 4th copy of this album, including the lp version. One note I'd like to make, though, is that the group the Bill Evans Trio opened up for that day was not a &quot;choral group&quot; or whatever the reviewer said below, but indeed the Trio opened for Lambert, Hendricks &amp; Ross, one of the most unique and talented vocal groups in all of music. In 1961, they were a hot ticket in the jazz world, and it was very good for the Trio to place on the bill opposite L,H, &amp; R because it was a great way to expose a wider audience to their music. Whatever may have been the case, this is an essential buy for Evanophiles and anyone who likes to revel in beautiful sounds.

B000002UB3|5.0|I first heard \\"Abbey Road\\" when I was 5, and in that instant, I was caught.Since then I heard all of their albums, and many rare bootlegs, and yet, \\"Abbey Road\\" is still their best album. A \\"must have\\" in any music library.
B000065U1N|5.0|When the film ends, you should not feel that you were entertained.  You should feel a sense of patriotism.  You should feel compassion for our armed forces.  I was in the Navy flying out of Peurto Rico patrolling the Carribean sea when this all happened.  I wonder what I was doing on the day that our service men went through hell that you see in the film.  I know whatever I did, I still went home that night and probably watched TV in our air conditioned room and woke up the next day and rode the bus into work.  This film is a good history lesson for anybody that did not know what happened over there or had never heard of the operation.  If you want to feel &quot;entertained&quot;, go watch Star Wars or Lord of the Rings.
B00004ZAV3|2.0|You can't really dislike the Beatles' music, in any combination. This album, however, is not a great &quot;must have&quot; masterpeice, and it's hardly a good introduction to the Beatles as well. If you want to see if you like their music, or if you want a taste of their undoubted geniusee, save your money and buy &quot;Abbey Road&quot; instead, the actual albums are a lot better than any collection.
B000021YQV|4.0|After hearing Toxicity on the radio a dozen or so times, and hearing praise from my friends, I just had to pick this one up.  I wasn't actually expecting a whole lot, because usually what's big amongst teens is just a fad and generally not of very high quality.  System of a Down really surprised me by showing that they're different from other bands I've heard, and can produce some truly enjoyable music.  It took about five listens, but I ended up really enjoying this album.<br />The standouts are:<br />Prison Song - A Rage-Against-The-Machine/Punk-Rock sounding opening tune which really gets you pumped up for the album.  Sounds a bit corny at first, but you'll get into it in no time.<br />Needles - This is another one which, if you're expecting all the songs to have the same sound as Toxicity, will most likely disappoint at first.  However, with a few listens, you're bound to get stuck on the catchy vocals and very nice middle-section.<br />Deer Dance - This, along with Toxicity is one of my favorite tracks on the album.  The vocals are incredibly powerful, as are the guitar riffs.  I particularly like the calm, chilled middle section where the lead singer shows off his melodic voice.  <br />Chop Suey! - As the first single for the album, played on radios everywhere, you'll probably have heard this.  It's not all that great of a song, and it gets old after a while, but it's very unique and catchy, with some really nice tricks that System of a Down use to make their music more enjoyable.  The stop-start scheme, the heavy-then-soft feel, and the powered, melodic chorus will have you singing along in no time.<br />Toxicity - A truly original and amazing track.  The whole song-pattern here is incredibly unconventional, and takes some getting used to.  The vocals will get harsh, loud and blunt at unexpected times, causing untrained listeners to feel annoyed.  Honestly, when I first heard this one, I hated it.  I thought that the singing was really terrible sounding, andthe whole song was too hard to listen to.  After a while, I came to love the song for its uniqueness.  I have never heard anything like it, and if you give it a chance, you'll love it too.<br />Aerials - This is the most different to any other song on the album.  The harsh, metal sound of the other songs is gone, along with the loud, at times obnoxious vocals.  As the closing song, it really fades away nicely and lets you calm down a bit.  However, it's still very powerful, and sounds a tad like something from the Deftones or Tool.  <br />There are a number of other good songs on the album; S.C.I.E.N.C.E., ATWA, Forest and Jet Pilot, and then there are a few which lack the overall appeal of the rest of the album; X, Psycho, Shimmy and Bounce--but still aren't bad.<br />All in all, this is better than I expected.  I bought the cd with an open mind, expecting something new, but not necessarily great.  What I got is a cd that is in rotation along with Radiohead: Kid A, Tool: Lateralus and a few others.  Pick it up if you like metal or are willing to try something new.
B00005QZWI|5.0|This is an excellent listen, a must find in the music world. From the chilling hopelessness and fear in \\"a knife in the dark\\", to the high clear singing of the trumpet in song eleven, it kept me riveted the entire time. The elven singers added much, sick fear of the nazgul in 7, desperation and the knowladge of the evil chasing in 13, and the childlike fear in number 4.<BR>         The compliation of enya here was very well placed, telling us that at the seemingly hopeless end that it's not over. i cannot wait for the next movie, and to snag the next cd.
B00000J8EK|4.0|Honestly, I was reluctant to buy this album.  I started out buying Exit Planet Dust, which was my first techno cd.  It really opened the door to the genre for me, and got me all excited about the Chemical Brothers.  I then went on to pick up Dig Your Own Hole, which impressed me even more.  I had grown to love the Chemical Brothers' loud, \\"big-beat\\" sound.  I liked the guest vocals and the variety in the first two albums I had heard, and I wanted more.  When I found out that pop-like song I'd been hearing on the radio, by an artist who I thought was Noel Gallagher turned out to be the Chemical Brothers, I told myself \\"Wow, they sure have gone [bad].  I'm never getting their new album.\\"  As always, I had judged a bit too quickly.  I should have known that, as usual, the Chemical Brothers' formula was variety, some in the form of unique and unexpected guest vocals.  After reading reviews and hearing samples, I decided to finally pick this up.<br />Naturally, right off the bat, I was unimpressed.  Where the hell was the bass, the beat and the power which I'd come to expect from my favorite british electronica duo?  Where were those \\"block rockin' beats\\"?  Little did I know, the Chemical Brothers were going for a fresher, more \\"poppy\\" sound, which wasn't a bad thing at all.  They had matured, and they were venturing into new territory.  I accepted this, and listened to the whole album.  After one listen, I wasn't terribly impressed, but made a mental note of songs which I was interested in from the get-go.  \\"Hey Boy, Hey Girl,\\" \\"Got Glint?,\\" and \\"Music: Response\\" were the reasons I wasn't completely disappointed.  After a few more listens, I started to like other songs.  The edgy vocals of \\"Out of Control,\\" the energetic feel of \\"Under the Influence,\\" and even the catchiness of \\"Let Forever Be\\" really got me hooked.<br />After I started to listen to the cd regularly, I began to enjoy it very much.  I listened to it while I was walking, on the computer, at school, whatever.  And while I never really came to enjoy songs like \\"Dream On\\" and \\"Orange Wedge\\" very much, I eventually started to consider \\"The Sunshine Underground\\" one of the Chemical Brothers' best songs thus far.  To sum it up, this album is a taste of something new.  Tim Rowlands and Ed Simons are taking a little break from the block rockin' beats, going for a bit more of a dancey, listenable feel.  But don't fret, \\"Got Glint?\\" and \\"Hey Boy, Hey Girl\\" should satisfy your big-beat craving, while \\"The Sunshine Underground\\" and \\"Out of Control\\" will show you that the Chemical Brothers also have a unique, unexpected sound to them which can be very rewarding.  It's not perfect, but there are a good number of great songs on here which are worth the purchase of the album.
1559277254|5.0|This is another great entry in an outstanding series, and it had me laughing to the point of tears more than once. Scenes of Stephanie and Lula at the racetrack and Stephanie venting her frustration at a nonfunctioning security lock are worth the price of admission. My one quarrel is with the audio book. Lorelei King does a superb job with a large cast of characters, especially Lula and Grandma Mazur. But she gives Stephanie *no* accent whatsoever -- a tremendous letdown after the great &quot;Burg&quot; accent Tanya Eby provided in her narration of 7-Up. Other than that, the audio is very enjoyable. Just tell your neighbors not to worry if they see you laughing hysterically during your morning walk. :-)

0802130208|5.0|_Ignatius Reilly was the original slacker back when this novel was written in the early sixties- before there was a name for it. It isn't that he just avoids work for it's own sake, it is just that he just doesn't have the time or patience for what the modern commercial world considers to be work. He has better things to do with his time. You see, Ignatius is a thoroughly medieval man. His is primarily an internal life grounded and centerered in \\"theology and geometry.\\" According to these consistent standards, Ignatius' life, behavior, and appearance are perfectly rational and understandable. Unfortunately, Ignatius lives in mid-twentieth century America, a time and place of mind-numbing conformity, intolerance, and efficiency. He is doomed to perpetual misunderstanding and conflict.<br /><br />_That is the tragedy to this most excellent of commedies- being an intelligent misfit in a world of mind-numbing conformity. The author chose to leave it rather than conform, while Ignatius found the inner strength to fight and/or disreguard it. Neither let it possess and change them into modern mass-produced robots in the consumer society.....<br /><br />_I wish that I could give it 500 stars.
B000066NW0|4.0|starting off, i guess i should clear up the fact that pretty much all i listen to is punk music and the such and i am noted  for my blatant disdane for female singers(i've been quoted as saying &quot;a woman's mouth was not made for singing, it was made for...&quot;) while i was chatting with a friend, she mentioned avril lavigne as a new act to check out and i did, figuring it was the name of a band, because, honestly, how many people have you heard of with the name &quot;avril&quot;? so i downloaded &quot;sk8rboi&quot; and was really taken aback by the energy and emotion, and after doing some investigating, i learned that she had a video featured on &quot;trl&quot;. well, it turns out, i'd already seen the video numerous times without hearing it because i have a habit of watching trl on mute just cuz of the britney spears factor or whatever you call it. but to make a long story not quite as long, i purchased her c.d. and found it to be more real than just about anything on the commercial circuit today.in short, i urge everybody from punk rockers to blink kids to teenypop fans to buy this. there's no way anyone but my jesus-loving mother could not like this disc.
0380820846|5.0|This was well worth the wait.  This is another can't-put-down book by Julia Quinn. It was great to see Penelope get her man after all those lonely years.  I can't wait to find out what Eloise is up to.  Hopefully, it won't be too long of a wait.
0380820846|5.0|The talented Ms. Quinn has produced another winner in her Bridgerton series. This book, as the others in the series, is lively and witty and written in a charming, frothy style that is convincingly period without being inaccesible. This was the perfect summer read -- the plot was entertaining and light, the characters likeable, interesting, and real.<br />And let me take a moment to congratulate Ms. Quinn on her choice of heroine -- the unpopular wallflower, Penelope Featherington. It was heartening to read a romance in which the heroine is not a great beauty, but rather a shy girl who tends to be either ignored or laughed at by her peers. The author gave Penelope real depth of character in this book, and made her someone the reader honestly cares about. I was cheering her on as I read.<br />And finally, the mystery of Lady Whistledown's identity is revealed! I thought I had figured out who it was, but I was completely mistaken -- and delighted to be so.<br />A lovely story, and a lovely book. If you're new to this series, I would probably start with the first book, \\"The Duke and I.\\" You can understand this story without going back, but you'll probably enjoy Penelope and Colin's romance more if you do. (And you'll *definitely* enjoy Lady Whistledown's unmasking more if you've been pondering the question for three books!) If you've already read the rest of the series, then I urge you to snatch this book up without delay!
B00005JKQZ|2.0|A very silly film.  Russell Crowe appears to be channeling Dustin Hoffman in Rainman.<br /> Jennifer Connelly is possibly the most beautiful actress on the face of the earth.<br />The real star of this overblown biopic-by-numbers is the stunning cinematography of Roger Deakins.  I also quite liked James Horner's score.<br />The film spends 2 hours telling us that Nash is a nut and then in it's final 20 minutes shifts gears and asks us to believe he is a genius.<br /> Connelly deserves better.  This critically lauded script made me blush.  How long does it take to write lines this cringe-inducing?<br /> Why doesn't it say \\"loosely based on a true story\\" before the opening scene?<br />This quite handsome 2 disc DVD is stuffed with additional items.  Alas I expected deleted scenes showing us Nash the anti-Semitic closet case.  No such luck as this is Hollywood.<br />How sad that some believe this to be the best film of 2001.<br />And if I didn't say this before,  Jennifer Connelly derserves better.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I had never heard of this artist before hearing a cut from this album on a progressive music channel on digital cable. My first thought was how much she sounded like Billie Holiday. I bought the CD the next day, and I have to say in earnest that this is one of the best CDs I have bought in a really long time. Not only does she got a great voice, but the CD has an incredible listenability...no need to forward past the bad songs...there aren't any! Ms Jones' jazz piano riffs are excellent, and the whole album tone is one that just makes you want to curl up on the couch on a rainy day. There's an underlying musky quality (like Holiday) to the songs...this would make a great CD to listen to during a romantic dinner or a date...but great to listen to alone too. Buy this CD. You'll be glad you did. This will definitely stay in my top 10 for a long time.
B00005JHCP|4.0|This Dickens tale is about a young orphan who suffers many hardships and tragedies before finally finding happiness. It is enjoyable mainly because young David is played by the future star of Harry Potter. The many characters are, of course, exceptionally well-written, including the optimistic Mr. Micawber, slimy Uriah Heep, take-charge Aunt Betsy (played by Maggie Smith in a standout performance), and the odious Mr. Murdstone. The young adult David becomes a bland, minor character amid so many colorful folks. This isn't the best version I've seen, but it will still send you searching for your copy of Dickens to reread the master. I recommend it to fans of classic English literature.
B00005QG9J|5.0|First off.... Incubus is an amazing band with a great talent for making intelligent, and good music. <BR>The lyrics are really heart felt and sung that way. The guitar and turn table-esque sound is great. They have really matured and broadened their horizons on this album. My favourite songs are &quot;Just a Phase&quot; and &quot;Under my Umbrella&quot;.<BR>so- in short...... BUY IT!!
B00005JL9B|2.0|For all the cinematic virtuosity displayed in Battle Royale -- the flawless compositions, the dazzling array of colours -- the film is a hollow, sadistic orgy of violence with paper-thin characters, bad acting from most of the cast, and hardly any semblance of story.<br />It's easy to see why this film got banned -- I'm not one to support censorship, but Battle Royale's claim towards satirical intent is foiled by director Kinji Fukasaku's unending bloodlust and complete lack of subtlety. Ostensibly, the setup wants to show the tensions between establishment fear and youthful rebellion, to show human beings forced to abandon their humanity -- a powerful concept. But the film projects none of it, because its characters mostly behave like caricatures; screaming, hysterical flesh dolls one minute, dead-eyed psychos the next. Most of the young actors deserve a kick in the behind for their shallow performances, especially leads Tatsuya Fujiwara and Aki Maeda, whose supposed \\"relationship\\" is completely unsympathetic by virtue of fake overemoting and a few lines of expository dialogue. In fact, the only two truly interesting characters in this mix are renegade Kawada (played with lazy charm by Taro Yamamoto) and ostracized lonewolf Mitsuko (Kou Shibasaki manages to convey pain through her violent vengefulness). Takeshi Kitano sleepwalks through his thin role, a shadow of the character he usually plays in his own films, with the iron-faced cruelty but none of the charm, humanity, and humour. He deserves better. All the other characters (and actors) are pawns, human puppets for director Fukasaku to slice, dice, shoot, mutliate, explode and humiliate as he sees fit. He delights in the garish reds spraying into the air and characters screaming at top volume in agony, but most of it is gratuitous -- the film doesn't go five minutes without some kind of graphically violent death, and the overall effect is just numbing. You may experience an initial shock at \\"Did I really see that?\\", but afterwards, it's easy to dismiss the images as just cheap shock tactics, because there isn't sufficient intellectual or emotional complexity to generate identification with the characters and therefore satirical revelations.<br />I had hoped that Battle Royale would have something new to say about youth behaviour in extreme conditions. But alas, Lord of the Flies (the book and the first film) has already made all of the statements here, and for the exploration of the effects of violence on the human psyche, films such as RoboCop, The Deer Hunter and Kitano's directorial works are far richer, more resonant, and more enjoyable. Battle Royale is unbridled cinematic bloodlust with intent towards pure exploitation -- something the movies could do without.

0380789035|4.0|And it was. A really good read. Yes it lacked characterization of the \\"new\\" gods, but the gist of the plot really didn't have anything to do with their personalities. Or even the personalities of the \\"old\\" gods for that matter. This wasn't a novel written for characters. It was written, like so many of Gaimans books, for the moral idea.<br />It was a novel about how people's beliefs take form if they're strong enough, how society and life causes those beliefs to change and die, and how people casted off where they came from for where they went to. The war wasn't about a clash of gods, but a clash of ideals. And how one man gets to walk the path between the two.<br />I understand several people didn't like the book. They felt it was contrived, lacked character development, that the plot was rushed, and the ending unfulfilling. (But don't you find the final chapter interesting to say the least?)<br />For the what the book was meant to be about (ala Gullivers Travels), a reflection of the loss of native spirituality for the modern convinieces, I thought Gaiman did an admirable job. I would recommend this book to anyone who isn't into just reading for a fun story, but wants something to make them think as well.

0316666343|4.0|I was watching a Today show segment on new books being released when the reviewer commented, &quot;If you only read one book this summer, this is the one.&quot;  I don't know that I would go quite that far, but this is, nonetheless, a good time.  If your tastes lean more toward literature than useless drible like Danielle Steele, and you are on the hunt for a good, quick read while on vacation, then this is the book for you.
B000068QY7|4.0|I'm sure every loyal Oasis fan was anxiously awaiting this album, their fifth studio album, after the disappointments that were BHN and SOTSOG.  Well, the Gallagher brothers are back at it, and they're taking a step in the right direction.  Though nowhere near as utterly transfixing as WTS(MG), or energetic like DM, it's still a fine album on its own.  However, one can ask himself if Noel hasn't lost the inspiration since 1995.  Gone are his raucous, raw rock anthems he used to so regularly write - Roll With It, Acquiesce, and Rock'N'Roll Star come to mind - the elder Gallagher now writes slower, moodier songs, but it's not all for the better.<br />Heathen Chemistry starts off well with the Hindu Times, a fine rock song, although I don't find it nearly as enganging as openings singles such as DYKWIM or Let It Out.  The rest of the album is uneven, Force Of Nature just sounds like uncontrolled, irritating noise, but Stop Crying Your Heart Out is a showstopper, with orchestration that rivals Whatever.  Liam actually writes some pretty good songs, Songbird, Born on a Different Cloud, and Better Man are, IMO, the better songs of the album.  Little By Little is also a good song, written and sung by Noel.  The difference between Liam and Noel's voice is jarring, because Liam sings better, and you can imagine how some songs would be if the turbulent younger brother would've sung them.<br />All in all, not a bad effort, but as an Oasis fan, I fell as though their thunder is not fully back yet.  Sure, they're showing a more mature sound, but we can only hope they find that energy they had in the early 90s.
0553208845|4.0|It's wonderful when people contextualize two completely different things and end up loving both. That's the case with this book and the Nick Drake's song \\"River Man\\", which I was very attached to before reading Hesse's Siddhartha.<br />The book it's very precise in its objective, never surrendering to secondary characters, while being very economical both in its prose and in its subject, but, at the end, the reader may feel there's little to discover in Siddhartha as a man: even the description of his first sexual experience is painfully passionless. The novel borrow its form from short stories, and Hesse reveals his true talent throughtout the metaphorical context he surrounds his characters.<br />Even though the reader doesn't agree with Siddhartha's conception of life as a whole, the novel is interesting because it portrays a man's itinerary throughout life, and this may explain the wide enthusiasm it still evokes in young people.
1559277238|3.0|The story is great, as usual.  But, LISTENING to books as I travel is the only way I have to know them.  You made a HUGE mistake by so drastically changing the \\"voice\\" of Stephanie.  The low sexy voice of the HARD EIGHT reader is not the Stephanie Plum I came to know and to expect in her number adventures.  With Debi Mazar and Tanya Eby, I could hear and envision Stephanie.  The new voice is a total distraction and totally out of character.  Shame on you for messing with a good thing!
B0000636UN|5.0|Hey ppl, 17 yo here. I heard the song Soak Up The Sun and I thought it was ok, but when I realized Liz Phair was backing it I loved it, I love Liz Phair. Anyways, I finnaly got my convertable, it was a hot summer day in June, and my friend and I were going out for the day. We went to Kmart cause I wanted to get some driving music, and I started lookin, and I though, Scheryl Crow would be a obvious choice, Soak Up The Sun, Convertable on a sunny day, U get the pictire. Anyways, we listeed SUTS on repeat about 5 times, and I started lookin for another. Suprisingly when I listened to the whole cd when I got home, I found that I liked every song. They are all good, especially Safe and Sound, whice has a totally different sound than Ive heard from Sheryl, hard to explain, and Weather Channel which is raspy, bluesy, a good soung to listen to when youre a lil down and u wanna stay down. Ive always enjoyed Sheryl's CD, but this is the first by her that I havent had to flip through a few songs. If u like Sheryl, you should definetely get this one! I like the fact that she can balance Rock and Counrty, not many ppl can do that sucessfully.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Not only did the movie stay true for the most part to the books...it was so sweet to see the book come to life and feel that it's somewhat I imagined.  Yeah!!  People can think alike.

0380820846|1.0|This is a story of a 33 year old man who has traveled the world, and a 28 year old woman who has been in love with him since she was 17.  That is about all the importance given us as the reader to the hero? and heroine?  From there on we could get out the crayons and coloring paper.  This would be good reading for my 5 year old and she would be bored I am sure.  What tripe!!!!!! And I hate that I paid good money for it.  No love, no romance, no humor and no time to waste on garbage.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Prior to seeing the movie on DVD, I had never seen this movie in the theater, nor read any of J.K. Rowling's books in the series. The movie was great. It follows the book as religiously as possible, particularly for the genre.  The special effects were nearly perfect and story line held my interest, enough to go back and buy and read all four of the Harry Potter books.  I am not only looking forward to the characters' next term at Hogwarts', but I am looking forward to the next movie in the series as well.
B000068QY7|4.0|This album falls short of expectations certainly because people expect Oasis to record another (definitely Maybe) DM or WTSMG (what's the story..).  This is never going to happen as the band as moved on.  What is left are memories of rock twisted with interpretation.<br />There are some classic songa on here, but the lyrics are not as abstract or clever as in DM or WTSMG.<br />It's as if Oasis are trying to hard to becover their sould to the music.  Irrespective, the album is good, and some of teh tracks are great, Little by little is superb, but could have been better lyrically.  The second Track, force of nature is good too, though I can;t help forgive but to notice some of the less meaningful word matching, that at least does not do it for me, personally.  Maybe for Noel, Liam and the rest, but not me.<br />It would be nice however, to see more emphasis on the drums, and bass guitar that existed in DM, and some more abstract lyrics that occured in WTS.<br />This is an album that some will definitely hate, maybe, and for some, will love.  It's a must listen.
0553213105|5.0|This is my favorite book of all time. I have read it so many times that the cover is falling off and the spine is incredibly damaged. Basically, Pride and Prejudice focuses on Elizabeth Bennet, a young and independent woman whose mother is trying to marry off her and her sisters to the highest bidder. They have several suitors, including Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingley and Mr. Wickham. At first glance, Pride and Prejudice seems just like a regular Regency romance (making you wonder why it is such a widely acclaimed book); however, it is much more than that.<br />In Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen offers social commentary on a wide range of subjects, including corruption of the Church, marriage, and women's rights. In addition, each time I read it, I realize more and more that not only is Jane Austen a genius, but she also has a great sense of humor (this can been seen through Mr. Collins, the wordy church leader, Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth's social-climbing mother, and many of the other characters). Several of the minor characters are used as stereotypes in order to get Austen's point across (for example, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, one of the snobbiest rich women in all of literature, and Lydia, Elizabeth's flighty youngest sister).<br />Even if you don't care about Jane Austen's views on the society of her time, Pride and Prejudice still offers a lot. Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy have perfect chemistry, as do Jane and Mr. Bingley. Elizabeth is way ahead of her time--no women of her stature were expected to be picky about who they married, but Elizabeth is not willing to settle for anything but the best. Then of course, there's the idea that you shouldn't judge people before you get to know them and that you shouldn't let your pride get in the way of your opinions about others (hence the name Pride and Prejudice).<br />This book is great for everyone-it contains romance, comedy, and even politics of Austen's time. Although the language might be hard to understand at first, it's definitely worth reading.
B00003CXDD|5.0|Val Kilmer and the delightful Warwick Davis take us on a fantasy adventure that noone should ever forget. When Willow (Davis) happens to come upon a mystically sacred child, he finds out he must defend the child to help save her and all that is good from an evil sorceress bent on taking over the world by using the power of the child. Along his way, Willow encounters some interesting counterparts, including Madmartigan (Kilmer) who had been imprisoned for wrongdoing. What happens on Willow's adventure is something every fantasy film fan should enjoy. <br /> Much like Legend, Labryinth, and The Goonies, I grew up with Willow being one of my favorite films. Willow has the special ability to make me return to my childhood and thoroughly enjoy it, no matter how many times I've watched it. My excitement when I found out Willow would be transferred to DVD was great! And I'm a satisfied customer after purchasing it. The video and audio transfers are wonderful. The picture makes the film even more colorful than I've ever seen. The Making Of . . . featurette is quiet entertaining, and it was awesome to see both Ron Howard and George Lucas working behind the scenes with the cast. The commentary with Warwick Davis is a good little listen, and the theatrical trailers and tv spots are neat to watch.<br /> I was very very ecstatic about this Willow's DVD release. And even more ecstatic that all of my favorite 80 films are getting good DVD releases. I hope there's more to come.

B00005R87Q|4.0|The Fast and the Furious looks like any car lover's dream movie. Granted, it is. But it's more than just a car movie. It has plot. In fact, it has a good and detailed plot. It tells the story of a guy (Paul Walker) who mistakenly is taken up by a group of streetcar racers, and deals with the world of streetcar racing. Yet, there is something much more behind the new guy. I would give that away, but it surprised me when I watched the movie, so I won't spoil it. <br /> The first thing, even before the plot, anyone will noticed about The Fast and the Furious are its intense action sequences. There's plenty of them, and all are enjoyable to watch. And they're not all just placed there so there will be an action sequence. They deal with the story. The next is its stars. They are a few known faces in this film. Vin Deisel and Paul Walker lead the cast. Actually, this film is Vin Deisel's film. He portrayed his character very well, and made him very believable. I can't say the same for Paul Walker. Even though he faired well, the way he handled some of his dialogue just seemed out of place to me. Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster level the film out with estrogen, and do it well. Both ladies played their characters well. Even though Rodriguez got stuck with her usual typecasting. There are also few subplots going throughout the movie, but are never really confusing nor downplay the entertainment value of the movie. <br /> The Fast and the Furious DVD is a must have for it's full of entertaining supplements to keep you busy for a while. And the film itself, well of course, it's quiet worth the purchase also.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|What else can I say, but this movie ROCKS! There isn't a dull moment in this film and I can never get enough of the song Fever Dog. This special edition is so worth the money because you not only get fab commentary by Mr.Crowe himself, but get some commentary from his mom Ann. You also get a Fever Dog CD, which I thought was pretty cool, and I really loved watching Untitled, this was the uncut version of the movie. I liked it better than the original version. I just love this movie! Thanks Mr. Crowe!
0316666343|5.0|What a wonderful read.  Took me 2 days.  Highly recommended.
0790729725|5.0|I can watch this movie over and over and never get tired of watching it.  The fab four, &quot;Joe Pesci, Robert De Niro, Paul Sorvino, and Ray Liotta&quot; are spectacular in this drama.  This is ONE movie you have to own if you love mafia movies.  This movie is a classic and it is in my top 10 movies of all time.
B00004YRQA|5.0|If you buy a PlayStation 2 this memory card is a must-have. Now it's ...a fair price for Sony's memory card. Also, the 8MB storage capacity is enough to last you the whole way through. I highly reccomend this memory card to anyone buying a PS2.
0345448898|1.0|I did  enjoy the first book of the trilogy but as I read the other books I bacame more and more upset that this series should be found in the children's section of a bookstore.  Most fantasy books for children do not directly denounce, or promote a god found in modern religions.  This series did and did so blatantly.<br />For children from religions where there is a belief in a good and loving god, this series can be very troubling and frightening.  I would not recommend this series to anyone under high-school age and even then I would be hesitant.<br />I have seen this series compared to C.S. Lewis.  As far a children's literature goes, His Dark Materials trilogy does not hold a candle to the Lion, Witch and The Wardrobe series.<br />If you are looking for good children's fantasy literature, look elsewhere.  This series is sure to trouble and disappoint young readers.
B000002G7E|5.0|This is, sans Andy and Nico, the definitive Velvet Underground album, but not just merely that. It's a record that honours the roots of rock and roll, while at the same time, giving it a swift kick...forward, catapulting the art form headlong into the future. <br />The opening track is great foreshadowing. Lou Reed croons lovingly about amphetamines, and there is none of the angst...on the previous album, just warm gooey love for uppers, emphasized by the motown \\"ooooooo\\" backing vocals. The song culminates in a notably jarring display of chugging guitar, underlining the fact that not all is wine and roses at this point.<br />\\"The Gift\\" really shouldn't be anything more than an interesting little curio. It's a disturbing little short story penned by Reed and read with utter cool by John Cale while the band chugs out a jam. As obsessed as the protagonist is, losing sleep worrying about his unfaithful long-distance girlfriend, you end up empathizing with him, ultimately, making his fate that much more tragic (but in a VU kind of way, merciful). I still listen to it the entire way through each time I listen to the album, and it's a credit to all involved. <br />\\"Lady Godiva's Operation\\" is just insane. John Cale sings about a young woman sleeping with \\"every poor daughter's son\\", and then switches into lyrics about a lobotomy, switching off to Lou Reed's voice, which was recorded in a different speed. Someone whispers, Sterling Morrison pretends he's a respirator, and Maureen Tucker pounds. The buzzsaw whirls. Was the rest of the song before the operation a hallucination of the patient, or the events that led up to the lobotomy? When John Cale describes how the \\"screams echo up the hall,\\" you'll forget to care. Mo Tucker somehow keeps it bolted squarely down to earth and her primal pounding actually sounds manages to sound breezy here. <br />Onto \\"Here She Comes Now,\\" a sweet, gentle song that *has* to be about sex, right? ...Actually, I have no clue about the subjectmatter, or if that's Mo Tucker making that nice ticky sound in the background, but it's a nice bit of relief.<br />\\"I Heard Her Call My Name,\\" is where Reed gets to show off what happens when a jazz snob gets hold of a guitar in a dimly-lit room and scratches it to death. His mind splits open, and you can just about see the white light pouring out. The momentum slingshots you forth from the beginning, and the feedback punches you in the stomach from there. And you love it. Don't pretend you don't.<br />And, of course, what everyone paid to hear: \\"Sister Ray\\". <br />What to say about it? It's a religious experience. It's the platonic ideal of rock and roll, for me anyway, because it is exactly what every record company executive never wanted rock music to be: scary, dark, long, personal and intellectual. I think the secrets of the world might be buried in the riffs, the noises, the pounding buried in this dark mess, and if not, it will still be well worth the search. The guitars attack each other like wild animals, and Mo Tucker's unrelenting drumbeat is the cage out of which they cannot break free. Reed speaks like he is possessed by his preoccupations...narrates with appropriate detachment. But of course, 'searching for my mainline' has another connotation. He is looking for something else, something that he clearly is not going to find in this room with these sad, sick people, and must move on. Witness the next move by the Velvets, I guess.<br />Images and themes, as well as that bold spirit of rushing headlong into the future, dominate this album. Heads splitting open and being cut into, bright and unwelcome lights, the safety of the dark, insecurity and personal violation. For a bunch of experiments, WLWH almost holds together as concept album.<br />It is something to get lost in, stumbling around in the dark. Frightening, fun and cool. The pure hit.

0316666343|5.0|I started reading this book on a rainy Saturday and couldn't put it down. The characters were so real and at so many points I just wanted to step into the book and lend a shoulder for this family. Written from the murdered character's persective it truly is a riveting book.
0743420373|4.0|A well-balanced, helpful and informative book. After reading about half the book, I began to develop a new feeling towards money and saving.<br />Another great (and more lighthearted) book on this issue is Debt Free by 30 by Anthony and Cluck. Millionaire Next Door is still a helpful book though. For me, it served to change my view of money and saving, which is an important first step to changing habits.
B000065U1N|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, the action sequences (which are basically the entire movie) were very tense and entertaining. But as most other reviewers have mentioned, the gore is quite abundant. I mean, I can handle watching a guy pick up his hand and put it in a pocket in his pants (barely), or even watching half of a man die a sickeningly painful death, but the scene in which two men reach inside a soldier's leg to do surgery without even wearing gloves and the camera zoomed in utterly disgusted me. It's just a movie, but I feel they crossed the line with that one scene. I guess that's the way it is sometimes, but damn man, not everyone likes that stuff. But this is still an excellent war movie, and that's all it is, a war movie. Don't expect great plot or character development, but don't expect not to be entertained. For mature audiences only, and not all mature audiences.
B00005B4GU|5.0|My first exposure to Radihead was *The*Bends*. It was a gift from my friend. It wasn't bad, but honestly, I wasn't impressed. But my roommate seemed to be intrigued by it, and bought this CD, *Amnesiac*, first, and then *Kid*A*.<br />I couldn't believe they were from the same band, and I liked their more recent stuff much more. We enjoyed the two albums a lot.<br />There is a caveat: the musical details of *Kid*A* and *Amnesiac* are so dense, subtle, delicate and deep that usual home audio systems can't really reveal. (Boombox is completely out of question!!!!) So, I would like to suggest a try with a more serious audio system if you don't feeling good with the stuff in this album. You'll be astonished to realize what complicated things were going on. <br />The roommate moved out now and I sometimes miss the very impressive opening of \\"Pakt like oiled sardins ...\\" I'm a fan of many kinds of music for more than 20 years, but I would say this song is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard.<br />My roommate, who was an amateur guitarist, suggested that Kid A and Amnesiac show a strong sign of drug use... I'm not sure, but the somewhat chaotic atmosphere of the two albums, which I like very much, of course, could be explained by it ...<br />He also pointed out the similarity of *Kid*A* and *Amnesiac* to Kraftwerk's music, but on this, I can't really agree with him. Well, their use of electronic instruments have something in common, especially in terms of sound quality; yet there is a big difference: Radiohead may sound neurotic and get you feel sick, but Kraftwerk wouldn't, though I love both.
0553260111|5.0|This book had my attention from beginning to end. There was a man found in the sea, almost dead, and without a memory. He tries all he can to find out who he is, fending off assassins everywhere he goes. That is all I can say, scared of giving the whole book away. I loved the book and I finished it withing a matter of days. I highly recommend this book to anyone.
B00006690G|5.0|The Eminem Show is a jamming album.  Dr. Dre as usual throws down on what he does best: creative work, mixing, and producing.  <br />If you don't like Eminem too much, you should still check out his hyped, nutty, yet creative lyrics.  He is one of the few rappers that never recycles lyrics (ie. Jay-Z) but gets deep and freestyles how he feels.  Some of the tracks on here show Emimem's emotional side, other tracks will have your head bobbin', especially on all the songs the great Dr. Dre mixed.<br />This is a good CD to party to, bob your head, listen while driving, and jamming out.  It's what rap is all about.
6303614493|5.0|This is one of those uncommon movies -- like Toy Story -- that adults can really enjoy as well as their kids.  There are enough subtexts and adult moments to make it more than &quot;just a kid's movie.&quot;  Kat's father, dealing with the loss of a spouse and also trying to raise a daughter on his own is a good example.  I thought the special effects were pretty seamless, although I've never seen it on anything larger than a 27&quot; TV. :)  Definitely a highly-recommended movie.
B000000JO3|5.0|ok i picked this up today based on the reviews.  I'm 14 and I listen to a lot of punk, all the old stuff and the new stuff. so i was looking and found this cd, came home checked it out and went and bought it.  this is good stuff. i don't really have a fave song cuz they all are good. Straight Edge, the song and lifestyle are great.  Guilty of being white is a great song. they are all good, pick up this cd
B000002G87|4.0|This album shows why Duane Allman is one of the greatest blues-rock guitar players of all time; he is excellent throughout, even sometimes more so than E.C.  This album ranks next to some of the best Allman Brothers albums of the 70's.  A classic.

0786867973|5.0|Move over Martha - Nigella has arrived! I have never been one to cook, only baking occasionally. After picking up this book, I gave it to my sister as a Xmas gift. Turns out that everyone at her Xmas get together had perused the book and loved it. They all in turn bought one. I became hooked on her show on Style and love that she's fun, cute and personable. She's not afraid to acknowledge that food is comforting! She doesn't have the pretention of Martha Stewart and seems very real. She has inspired me to learn that being in the kitchen can be fun and rewarding. I will definitely be looking forward to her new books!
B0000640SA|4.0|This movie is outstanding! Its really a great bit of writing, directing, and acting. Though it requires the audience to focus more than some clean cut action movie, it is much more rewarding with the interesting production tools that go into it.  Now, with the content of the film approved, I have to admit that this DVD does have some ups and downs. For starters, the up is that the case is very cool and unique.  The menu, however, is rather confusing and can be a bit frustrating.  There is nothing that says &quot;to play movie--click here&quot; or &quot;special features here!&quot; They make you go through some memory games, but, if you know how to find the easter eggs, you'll access some really cool features. The only problem is sorting out the maze-like menue in order to call on those features.  Despite this somewhat annoying setback, the DVD is well worth the price and gives you a lot to look at and think about.
B000006OAM|5.0|I TOTALLY agree with &quot;A music fan from Portland, Oregon&quot; whose review was written 6-24-02....This CD has helped me through some very emotionally trying times, as well, and I find it to be emotionally real and heartfelt.
B00004Z1GH|5.0|sci-fi is a good vehicle to make a movie about something most people 'haven't' experienced.  in the context of a simple story that has nothing to do with the reader, an author can hide a lot of clues, words and metaphors that trick the user into remembering something he forgot when he was born.  everything, EVERYTHING, about eXistenZ, from the way the actors talk to the lines to the fleshy living portals to the fast cuts, it's all reminder text.  if you can trace back half of it, you remember more than i do.  this movie is destined to go WAY over most people's radar, like naked lunch, because they've never played with anyone in this life and they don't know how to trace back a metaphor until it becomes relevant.  this movie is a serious trip for serious explorers, it has a lot of -info- packed into it, it's medicinal.  do you know what i mean?  this reality is only a practice round!  love each other and shine your eyes!<br />here's a riddle: what lasts for 'twenty minutes' and causes you to completely leave this body?

0792838068|5.0|You will either hate this movie or be blown away by it.  I was fortunate to see it in the theatre and it was one of the first DVD's I purchased.  I was blown away by it...my wife didn't understand it and thought it was depressing.<br />I have always admired Nicholis Cage as an actor.  He has a way of commanding the screen and drawing you into his deeper self.  The people he portrays always seem to be touchable and real.  Elizabeth Shue did an excelent job as her role as a street walker.  Besides the acting, the cinematography and music also lend to the film's character.  Yes, it is a depressing movie about a drunk who has managed to loose everything and a street walker who's life is spiraling out of control.  But it is also a movie about 2 people finding happiness, even though it is short lived, in this crazy world.  They come to depend on each other till the end.  I have always said that a minute of happiness is worth more than a day of dispair.  <br />All in all I liked this movie and would recomend it to anyone who likes movies with a \\"deeper meaning.\\"  I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.

B000002LGQ|5.0|This album was quite shocking for Madonna because she used to be all girlie and sweet and \\"like a virgin\\" type of chick. Well when everyone expects the same Madonna they all knew she comes back with something sooooooooooooo far off from her previous albums. Now you ask if that's good or bad. Well its neither cause it's NEW. This ladies and gentlemen is the SPIRITUAL MADONNA. <br />This is the FIRST appearence of the spiritual Madonna. Her SECOND appearence was in Ray Of Light. This is the Madonna most Madonna fans perfer but alas she never stays that way. This is MUCH better than RAY OF LIGHT in my eyes. This album appealed to me ever since I had it at Christmas. Every track is important so you HAVE to listen to EVERY track WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT. IM FORCING YOU!<br />The three hits on this album were the title track LIKE A PRAYER, EXPRESS YOURSELF AND CHERISH. However i believe more tracks would have become hits but the critics couldnt swallow the brand new Madonna whole.<br />However as history moves on Maonnas next step was Dick Tracy with VOGUE and after to the dark world of SEX!(Oh Madonna) This phase for Madonna is still remembered among her, the critics and her fans and will never be forgotten! God Bless Madonna!
B000002AP1|2.0|Without question one of the most overated albums ever. The first two Stooges albums are everything this one is reputed to be.  I have seldom been been more disappointed with a record than this one. I had the first two albums for years before I finally got to hear this album and I could believe how lousy it was, especially in light of so many people telling me how great it was. Years went by and I picked up a used copy thinking maybe I had been wrong before, but time only reinforces my initial impressions; \\"Raw Power\\" is a big stinker. <br />\\"Search and Destroy\\" is one of the few high points on this cd, largely  because guitarist James Williamson manages to keep his masturbatory guitar tendencies in check, and because of the undeniably great riff. \\"Gimme Danger\\". Gimme \\"TV Eye\\".  Gimme Ron freakin Ashton. \\"Penetration\\" has a nice snaky riff, and again Williamson doesn't overdo things. \\"I Need Somebody\\" may be the worst song in the entire Stooges canon, with stupid lyrics, a lame riff, and incredibly bad singing. Iggy's singing is generally not up to par on this album.  It sounds a lot more restrained and forced on this album compared to the chaotic, spontaneous, and brutal frenzy he displayed on \\"Fun House\\". \\"Raw Power\\" is neither raw nor powerful, discuss amongst yourselves. The piano really detracts from that song in my opinion. \\"Shake Appeal\\" gets the job done right, with a nice catchy and jagged riff, and once again, Williamsom is kept on his leash. \\"Death Trip\\". Thank God this album is over. It really makes no difference to me whether it is the Iggy or Bowie mix, and I've listened to both; the material and execution are simply weak on this cd.<br />You can't deny the influence of this album, and I suppose for 1973 it was something else (Though not even in the same league as Fun House), but the New York Dolls released their first album the same year, and it has 10 times the humor, chops, attitude, songwriting, singing, and is as influential as Raw \\"Power\\". Buy Fun House or \\"The Stooges\\" instead and get your mind blown by the ultimate cathartic music.

B000060P79|5.0|Just last night I bought the Simple Plan CD, and I haven't stopped playing it since.  It is such an awesome CD, that I can't stop listening to it.  &quot;Addicted&quot;, &quot;Worst Day Ever&quot;, &quot;When I'm with you&quot;, &quot;I'm Just a kid&quot;, and &quot;God must hate me&quot; are just some of the best songs on there, but I love them all.  Their sound is so heavenly and these punk rockers from Montreal can definitely rock.  I recommend this CD to anyone.

0380002930|5.0|Watership Down is my favorite book of all time. That's all there is to it. I've read it at least once a year since I was nine... it's almost a New Year ritual. The thing is... it follows all the natural rules of rabbithood, but at the same time each character has a distinct personality, each one is easy to identify with. It's a bit like Brian Jaques' Redwall... but with a more realistic(and often more adult)approach. The myths told by the rabbits are as entertaining as the story itself, and you find the characters resemble humans you know. Allegorical? You can see it that way if you want. It's also a wonderful story in its own right.
006019250X|2.0|The book is simply written and easy to read in about 4 hours.  It's heavily Christian in orientation and if you've read the Bible, there's really no surprises because most of it's cobbled together from that. That's not to say it's not well executed. The  writing is engaging.<br />The theme is: follow your dream and you'll end up smart, wealthy and loved by wonderful girl, etc, etc.  Yes, girl.  Make no mistake, this book only wants men/boys to follow their dreams. If your female, forget it.<br />In the entire book there are 2 women.  One is an old gypsy fortune teller, the other is Fatima the lead character's &quot;love&quot; interest. Fatima's &quot;dream&quot; by the way is for a man to come and love her! And that's her only dream!  <br />Fatima stays by the well at the oasis - waiting dutifully because that's her &quot;destiny&quot; - while he trots off into the desert to find his &quot;dream&quot;.  Apparently women are only supposed to want to be loved by a man and hang around working where he last saw them while he is busy in the desert fulfilling his dream.  <br />And I might add, in a month of courting, he meets her every day at the well, and never once does the author depict the boy offering to draw the water for her -- I guess drawing water is her &quot;destiny&quot; and him sitting and looking on admiringly is his. What a surprise.<br />This story made me really sad. The king is male, the alchemist is male, the warriors are male, the caravan leader is male, the thief is male, the bartender is male, the crystal shop owner is male, the chieftan is male, the textile merchant is male . . . I'll bet if we looked at the hawks, camels, and horses, they'd all be male too.  <br />In this book, if you aren't a daughter who can't read and is facinated by shiny objects, a brainless ewe, an feared and hated gypsy, or an anjou dotting on the lead, there's no dream for you  and if you are one of these categories, God help you, because you're only there to make some maledreamer's dream come true. <br />I don't fault the concept of following your dream, in deed I applaude it, but this book will crush the thought of it out of you if you're a girl or woman.   <br />Recommended only for reading by people that don't really think too highly of women, and/or want their daughters to have no chance in life and their sons to grow up to think of women as appendages and ornaments.<br />Money would be better spent on reading the 17th century play of the same name.
B00004RYZT|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Rammstein (And Megaherz, they deserve mentioning, if you like Rammstein check them out) since the album Sehnsucht came out.  Ever since i first heard their music i was blown away by the sheer power of it.  I bought the VHS of Live Aus Berlin when it came out and their visual performance is appropriate for the music which contains such a roller-coaster ride of mixed emotions.  The DVD is even better than the VHS of course because everyone knows the quality is higher but the added bonus features are very nice too.<BR>  I dont however see why they had to censor Buck Dich, it was a comical gag and was not meant to be taken seriously.  I mean they preformed it that way live in Europe and never had and problems as far as people complaining about it being \\"dirty and homosexual\\"  but when they preform it in USA they get arrested for it,  and the song gets edited from the DVD but its still on the vhs?  .  How pointless is that, i mean if you dont want to see it you can just push a button and then - WOW - you are on the next song.<BR>  But aside from that it is still a worth while purchase if you like Rammstein even the slightest.  However, the \\"Official amazon review\\" that is at the beginning of this page is, in a word - pathetic.  I mean of the 2 song titles the guy tried to translate he got neither of them right.  \\"Du Hast\\" means \\"You Have\\" NOT \\"You Hate\\", and \\"Heirate Mich\\" means \\"Marry Me\\" How could anyone mistake that for \\"Worship Me\\"? (obviously no research was done for this article).  So since the reviewer didnt know exactly what they are saying he just assumed for the worst, and made their lyrics sound even more fitting to his relating of Rammstein to the little angry kids at Columbine and Nazis.  Get better reviewers Amazon.com, geesh.
B00000J7J4|5.0|&quot;Supernatural&quot; cannot be simply viewed as Carlos Santana's &quot;comeback album,&quot; it is too well-executed and performed for that kind of poor labeling. It is the album that brought Santana back firmly into the spotlight, yes, but is nonetheless a masterpiece, vibrating with musical brilliance and creativity seldom seen in music today. It rightfully won 9 Grammys and scored numerous radio hits including &quot;Smooth&quot; and &quot;Maria Maria.&quot; What makes this such a special album is how Santana and his incredible band come together with artists from such diverse musical styles and create beautiful, hypnotic, masterful songs, providing an exploration of every popular music style of the past few decades. The opener is wonderful Latin flavored dance music with a nice jazzy feel in some areas. But the album really picks up steam with the second track, &quot;Love Of My Life,&quot; collaborating with Dave Matthews and Dave Matthews Band drummer Carter Beuford, they create one of the album's classic, timeless tracks. It is samba mixed with jazz and classical style and really manages to create atmosphere and mood. Matthews' vocals are milky rich and very cool and jazzy. The next track, &quot;Put Your Lights On&quot; is Santana showing off a darker, heavier side with threatening, deep lyrics and a solo of pure metal virtuosity. &quot;Samba Pa Ti&quot; is a cool taste of Brazilian-styled music and some of Santana's best soloing in the album. And of course, next comes &quot;Smooth,&quot; THE song from this CD. It conquered the airwaves in that active summer of 1999 and is still very much played today. It is exhilarating salsa-flavored hard rock featuring the Santana band playing like never before. Rob Thomas of Matchbox 20 does a great job here and wrote the song which sounds like hip street poetry with an edge (&quot;my muequita, my Spanish Harlem mona lisa&quot;). Santana though, steals the show here with rhythmic, brilliant guitar work. The only weak number here is &quot;Do You Like The Way,&quot; which was made with Lauryn Hill. Granted, Hill is a very good artist, but here we get a song where we are always waiting for it to get SOMEWHERE but never does. It is the only boring number in the entire CD. &quot;Maria Maria&quot; is artistic in an interesting way, inventive and also sounds like cool street poetic rhymes. The final track, &quot;The Calling,&quot; is an energetic solo with Eric Clapton but takes on more the form of simple jamming than a complete song. It works, but I expected more would be done with an artist of Clapton's calibur. Still, it is a great jam nonetheless. &quot;Supernatural&quot; is a milestone in Santana's career, his lightning-finger work is stainless and he manages to create unique sounds and makes his guitar sing like no other guitarist can. It is always required that when one lists the great electric guitar rockers of all time, Hendrix, Clapton, Vauhguan, one must put Santana on that list. Here is one of his greatest accomplishments.
0553381709|5.0|Having read the first two, I think Storm of Swords was the best yet.  I devoured this book in about 3 days, barely able to set it down.  He has a style of writing so when you finish a chapter your left on the edge of your seat, excited to get back to that particular substory.  The story itself bounces back and forth amongst 5 or 6 substories but you can see them all set for an exciting collision course.  If you like Jordan but are tired of all the boredom, come here.  Theres really not a boring chapter in this entire book.  Great read
B00005A46T|4.0|I'll be honest; I didn't like Slipknot's first album, and I really thought they were pure idiot sell-outs who tried to make money with their creepy masks. The lyrics sounded like fake angst, and the music just had nothing impressive (I remember these jocks at my school telling me that Slipknot was an awesome band with incredible drumming....I simply answered that they paid like 5 idiots to do the job a single man can do even better in a band). But then I heard about their second album coming out.  I had absolutely no expectations. But, when I saw the cover (of the CD case) I was actually very impressed, it gave me enough curiosity to fully listen to it. I'll talk about this cover that I think is really nice, simply showing a goat that looks sick...is that a reference to the expression of being a scapegoat? I don't know, but that's my own interpretation. Then, I put the CD in my CD player, and I put it to track one...then I heard a weird noise, that sounded like an helicopter or something like that.  Then there was just a guy screaming, who seemed to have difficulty finishing his screams...that was brilliant...Slipknot took one minute to show us that you don't need to say two thousand F-words to demonstrate how filthy, mad, deranged, insane they are. (515) is a masterpiece, really, it's the angriest thing I've ever heard. For me, this one minute intro is a visit into an insane man's brain. This intro has a link with the last and probably best track on this album: IOWA, the last track on the CD, with brilliant lyrics, a very apocalyptic atmosphere, and again, no need to put ridiculous ferocious riffs or F-words...Now, the rest of the album...People=... did not impress me at all...I thought it was messy, and was simply an amalgam of screaming with heavy riffs that were not even melodic.  Then comes Disasterpiece, a better song, with nice yet violent lyrics, especially the first line (I wanna slash your throat and ... the wound). Then comes My Plague, which is also a good song, with a melodic aspect to it, and also it has something more than just meaningless screaming and fast riffing and drumming...There's also Everything Ends, which is one of the best songs on this CD. The lyrics are good, and the music is cool, it shows the two ways Corey Taylor can sing.  Heretic Anthem is also good, such as Left Behind (a really great track), Skin Ticket, and New Abortion.  Slipknot, in this album, shows that they can be more than just a metal band that is recognized for having 9 masked musicians in it...with IOWA, they prove many things: They can make songs that don't always sound the same, I know this sounds pretty weird to say as an advantage because it should be normal, but considering the metal scene these days, it really is a plus. They also prove that they can write good lyrics, even some poetic apocalyptic material, which is very nice, adn they also prove that they are a good band. <br />IOWA shows a very important and good evolution in Slipknot's path. IOWA is a great album. Period.
B000068FXR|4.0|You either hate Supertramp or love them. There really hasn't been an inbetween for folks. From their solid, keyboard based hooks to their falsetto Viv Stanshall like backing vocals, Supertramp managed to craft an amazing series of singles and albums during their brief rein at the top of the charts. Crisis is really the second album by the band. At this stage, the only remaining members after the break up of the earlier more prog based version were songwriters Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson (who moved from bass to guitar to augment the new band's sound).<br />The newcomers recruited to the band fleshed out the sound and managed to do a great job of embelishing  the prog pop sound that Davies &amp; Hodgson had developed. Hodgson's interest in spiritual themes comes to the fore with this album (although it was hinted at previously). Sister Moonbeam is the great sequel to Here Comes The Sun that George Harrison never wrote (although he tried). All the material has punch, strong melodies and shorter running times. All three of these elements made the album a success with both AM &amp; FM radio in parts of America. After the success of Crime, SUpertramp had finally broken the largest market in the world. In the UK Crisis also found success as well with the album breaking the top twenty.<br />Davies crafted one of his strongest, most witty compositions to date Ain't Nobody But Me became the first in a long string of Davies sung songs that played with the traditional pop love song in new and surprising ways. The playing on this particular track emphasized the strengths of the band's new approach; while the song is quirky (and has an instrumental arrangement that matches the quirky, anti-love song sentiments)but doesn't try to coast on just that single merit.<br />Crisis sounds stunning. Ken Scott's production expands the band's sound considerably. The remastering ranks as one of the best I've heard recently. Although there aren't any liner notes, critical assessments or bonus tracks, the album still sounds richer than before making it essential for fans. Still,these bare bones reissues are getting tiresome. Considering that fans are having to pony up for something they already have, it couldn't have been too difficult for A&amp;M or the band to add some extras to make it worthwhile.<br />Although viewed as &quot;prog lite&quot; or AOR during their rein at the top, Supetramp managed to create a series of thoughtful, tuneful albums packed with wit and hooks. At the dawn of new wave and the decline of punk, the band held the high ground for the best qualities of the 60's and early 70's.s tracks, the album still sounds richer than before making it essential for fans.

B000065TQR|5.0|Why is it that most have never heard of the Pink Fairies or let alone this record? It could be that the thing is never released domestically---including the original Vinyl release---At any rate it is a must have for anyone remotely interested in 60's psychedelic--garage--proto punk--or all of the above....Standout tracks are \\"DO It\\" recognized by most old school punks as true punk ancestor--\\"Uncle Harrys Last Freakout\\" exactly what it says--kind of Englands answer to \\"Sister Ray\\"....Just get this CD and fast while it's momentarily in print....then get the 3rd Record \\"Kings of Oblivion\\" and if your still craving the Fairies pink up the second record \\"What a Buncha of Sweeties\\" and incidently they've all just been reissued and remastered with a couple bonus tracks.......amen
0385491026|4.0|Cat's Eye gives a clear, if maybe exaggerated, picture of childhood cruelties and the marks they leave.  The most interesting part Atwood conveys is the residue in the adult artist Elaine Risely.  The scars we cover up that then have the power to affect us, years later.  It will resonate with anyone who has tried to go home again.  I read this book the same week I saw a childhood friend from years ago and didn't see the friend who had been the third of our trio.  It was the best imaginable timing.  It's a very complex study of emotional life, and in some ways very brilliant, although the scenes from childhood are excessive and long-winded.  Skim a bit, but read it.
B000000WA4|4.0|Once and for all, lead Pumpkin Billy Corgan proves that when it comes to rock and roll bombast and pomposity, he has no contemporary equal.  \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\\" is his answer to his spiritual Godfather Roger Waters and Waters' equally pretentious 1979 classic \\"Pink Floyd the Wall.\\"  Corgan may not quite have Waters's sense of melody or socio-political outrage, but he gives it his best shot anyway.<br />That said, \\"Mellon Collie\\" is an up and down album featuring soaring high points amid quite a lot of filler material.  The two discs are improbably called \\"dawn to dusk\\" and \\"twilight to starlight.\\"  The highlights include the midtempo rocker \\"Tonight, Tonight,\\" the catchy nostalgia single \\"1979\\" the nine minute opus \\"Porcelina of the Vast Ocean\\" and the angry, grungy \\"Bullet With Butterfly Wings,\\" that features the memorable line \\"despite all my rage I am still just a rat in a cage.\\"<br />Overall, at two-and-a-half hours, \\"Mello Collie\\" is an endurance test of a listening experience, one ready made to have a mix tape made from it.
B00004W52U|5.0|So I know that anyone who has listened to any amount of punk or ska music knows of operation ivy. It is hard to find bands that have not at one point covered an operation ivy song or even just mentioned them as an influence. That said, this cd is simply amazing. People always talk about their desert island cds, and I think I would be content being on an island with only this cd. No matter which song, op ivy finds a way to combine hardcore three chord punk stuff with some truly amazing two tone ska and the most thoughtful and intelligent lyrics out of any band, punk-ska or not, to create something truly special. Each song has something important to say. Normally here I would reccomend some key songs, but the thing is that every single song on here is essentially amazing. Please buy this cd, I swear to God that you will not be disappointed. If you listen to punk rock, ska, or anything, this should be in your position. Unfortunately Op Ivy is no longer a band, but this marks Tim Armstrong and Matt Freeman's begining of the legendary musical careers they have had bringing us to the present with the amazing Rancid. Do yourself a favor, by this cd, learn how to skank, and dance dance dance! By the way, Jesse has a new band now, check them out too...
B0000639IJ|4.0|This is not a perfect movie by any means. But Will Smith is brilliant as Ali, particularly during the early part of the film, where he superbly portrays the boxer in his young Cassius Clay days. I remember those years when Cassius Clay came to prominence, and Smith captures his spirit, his cheekiness, his strength, and his sheer, confident youth to a tee. As Clay grows as a boxer and as a man, embraces the Muslim faith, and becomes Muhammad Ali, he changes more than his religion and name. The cockiness is still there, but so is the cynicism and disappointment brought on by too much fame, too much money, too many women, too many hangers-on. Smith handles the change from brash youth to more thoughtful man with subtlety and aplomb.<br />The disappointing part of the film, which begins to drag on and on, is the lack of depth in Ali's relationships. His marriages are glossed over quickly...we get no sense of what he is really thinking, or what his private life is really like. The same holds true of his relationships with his entourage, from his manager on down. If this was meant to come across as aloofness, it didn't work; this viewer found it very frustrating.<br />Nevertheless, the movie is worth seeing, for the sheer exuberance of Smith's acting, and the absolutely dead-on portrayal of the late sportscaster Howard Cosell, rendered fabulously by Jon Voight. It is not a brilliant movie, but in my view, it deserves more than 3 stars. I think it is inexplicably under-rated.
0385335482|5.0|I borrowed this book from a friend not sure if i would like it (i prefer children's/middle school books) and i loved it.  Very funny. It did a great job at getting inside the mind of the character.  Personally, i didn't like her much...very materialistic and stupid.  It kind of reminded me of Legally Blond and how the character just sort of fell into a great thing (job).  I read the book in 2 days.  Reads very well.  And there were a few British references that confused me at first (like being pissed.  It apperared that meant buzzed and not mad).
B00004YX39|5.0|So it appears that a lot of critics trashed this album when it came out.  It is certainly different in some major ways.  There isn't as much interplay between instruments as previous albums.  There doesn't seem to be much spontaneity in that regard.  A little bit here and there.<br />The drums are very basic throughout.  Sounds like a drum machine but a different drummer is credited on each song.<br />Even with these aspects to it, this has become one of my favorite Steely Dan albums.  It really grows on you.  Gaucho is my favorite track.  Very majestic.  Time Out Of Mind sounds like it could of been on Aja.  Hey Nineteen is a good song but too bubblegummish to be a favorite.  Funny that was the hit.  I can see why, it's a great pop song, but it is probably my least favorite track.  Maybe not, but close to it.<br />Like Aja, this album is very consistent from start to finish.  Aja was incredible and this album had a tough act to follow.  It may not be better than Aja, but I am very pleased they made it.  You have to give it a little time though.  None of these songs really hit me strongly right away.  After repeated listenings it gets more and more interesting.<br />There has been a lot of talk about the album being overly polished.  I don't believe in the argument that something can sound over-produced.  What's wrong sounding polished?  Polished is great.  I admire the hard work that engineers put in to make an album sound polished.  Especially albums from the mid to late 70s.  Those albums had a great feel to them.  Then of course the 80s moved in and poured thick, gushing reverb and delay over everthing.  It all went downhill from there.  The huge corporate owned radio stations with their forumlated playlists.  Somebody really ought to do something.  Oh-I guess I'm talking about something completely different now.  Buy the CD. End review.
0783226063|3.0|the problem with this version is that it is too short...you need to watch the longer version to truely enjoy and understand the movie. i have been watching Dune since i was a little girl and when i watched the short version I was confused!! you lose alot of the story and charcters in the shorter version...but for some reason they don't release the longer version...damn you! so i recomend you go and rent or find someone who has the longer version and not worry about this DVD...but hey thats just me.
1558908846|4.0|This is just a movie adapted from a comic book. Fans of Judge Dredd or comic books can enjoy this action flick or not. There are worst comic book movies out their and Judge Dredd is not one of them, so remember this is just a fun ADAPTION, sit back and enjoy the action or shut up until you can do a better movie, if you can even make a movie since you critics make it sound so easy! Hey \\"True\\" the movie could have been better, but so can every other comic movie, with more money, better actors, technology, and so on. For us fans it's all we have till somthing better comes.
B000022TSY|5.0|Having seen the movie early 70's and then buying the tape the<BR>none of the above do justice to the DVD. All I can say is <BR>awesome, the surround sound, the widescreen effects, I sat<BR>there shattered to see a whole new perspective of this movie.<BR>In 1991 I was in the USA for two months. During that period I rode a Haley-Davidson through the States for five weeks and as I said at the Virginia State HOG Rally, 'When I saw the movie Easy Rider for the first time &quot;One day I'm going to go to the States and ride a Harley&quot; and I am doing it now'I will keep watching this movie and also listen to the great music which is part of the history of my generation.

B000068QY7|1.0|I wish this band would snap out of the Beatle obsession and do one thing that may sound original.   We ALL love the Beatles but for crying out loud &quot;move on man&quot; get over it.<BR>Obviously this bands popularity grew because of the younger generation that missed the british invasion of the 60's (including the members of Oasis) and want to somehow make up.  (monkey see, monkey do) lets write some NEW music here!!

B0000507R0|5.0|I've owned BSS from the first day it was available to the public, and I've listened to it maybe 5000 times over the last thirty years.  Those who know this album, know what a great work it is, a wholly cohesive sonic vision of technological apocalypse written in complex counterpoint.  Peformed on cutting-edge early 1970's technology, BSS contradicts its premise with exhuberance.  But that's besides the point.<br />We're here to talk about the DVD audio version.  What a great sound this newest technology produces; I heard things on this album I had never heard before, and those sounds I was familiar with took on a new depth.  And that was on my computer's DVD player.<br />A treat for any ELP fan.<br />Warning:  To access the video material you must play the disc on a DVD Audio player.

B000002G7E|5.0|Don't listen to the negative reviews of this great album..they are written by your parents. It doesn't get much better than this. It amazes me how anyone can think this is non-musical, especially by self confessed Velvets fans. There is not a weak track here. White Light is one of the best openers of all time, genius. The Gift is unique, listen to the fabulous rythmn guitar of Lou Reed on the left channel. Lady Godiva is a great driving track. What a pretty song Here She Comes is. Again fantastic Reed rythmn on the chorus. Nothing though, can prepare you for the most outasite guitar playing ever put to record, which is  Heard Her Call my Name, seriously, if you are a guitar player, listen and weep, cos you ain't ever gonna match this. Sister Ray, oh my, this is the icing on the cake. Quite simply, top ten material.
6304913176|5.0|Although it lacks the magical aura of the Star Wars movies, I regard Starship Troopers as one of the finest science fiction films ever made.  The graphics are incredible and the storyline pulses with a strong dash of a sociopolitical critique.  In the future, you are either a citizen or a civilian; only citizens can vote, and the only guaranteed manner in which to earn citizenship is voluntary service in the Federation's armed forces.  The movie begins with a series of propagandistic news teasers about the state of the threat posed to mankind by the giant alien bugs of the Klendathu system on the other side of the galaxy, a civilization that has been launching deadly meteors at Earth for some time.  In the middle of the carnage of the ill-fated invasion of Klendathu, the scene shifts back to the year before.  Johnny Rico (Caspar Van Dien) signs up for military service because his girlfriend Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards) has joined up with the hope of becoming a pilot; their mutual friend Carl Jenkins (Neil Patrick Harris) also joins up.  While Carmen is accepted to flight school and Jenkins is assigned to military intelligence, Rico is made a grunt in the Mobile Infantry.  He is joined there by another former classmate, Dizzy Flores (played wonderfully by Dina Meyer), who has long had her eye on Rico.  Boot camp is incredibly harsh and difficult because the MI only wants the best soldiers.  Before long, a Klendathu meteor strikes the earth, wiping Buenos Aires off the map, and the armed forces quick launch an invasion of Klendathu.  The rest of the movie revolves around the continuing war effort, featuring some incredible battle scenes with loads of gory realism.<br />This is Rico's story.  He joined up for the wrong reasons (but I can certainly understand how a Denise Richards could influence such a decision), soon receives a \\"Dear John\\" video letter from Carmen (although their paths will cross again), and indirectly causes the death of one of his squad members, but when the war begins he quickly becomes not only a real soldier but a real leader, as well.  This is no easy task, as his climb in the ranks is made possible by the death of those he serves under.  I love Denise Richards, but her role in the movie never quite seemed to fit her.  All she cares about is flying, and she is quick to ingratiate herself upon those she thinks can help her make it to the fleet academy; in space, she quickly forgets all about Rico and teams up with her direct supervisor.  There is very little human about her--contrast this with Dizzy, who is very down to earth and serves as the true heroine of the action.  Possibly in line with the rather obvious fascist satire of the one-world earth federation, the military intelligence guys dress like the Gestapo, and believe me when I say that seeing Doogie Howser in a Gestapo-like getup is a rather surreal experience.<br />The effects are top of the line.  The CGI animation of the giant bugs is incredible and very realistic; they rely on their pointed appendages rather than actual weapons to skewer and slash the enemy, and they really know how to tear into a human body.  It takes a lot of bullets to kill them, and they die rather messily.  The deaths of earth's soldiers is also ultra-realistic and realistically gory.  As morbid as this sounds, I must say that nowhere else have I seen beheadings done so perfectly and believably.  Most impressive of all are the visual effects of earth's spaceships; the explosions in space are of epic proportions, and we see greatly detailed features of ships splitting in two, crashing, and burning.<br />While this movie may not be true to the original Heinlein spirit, it nevertheless does succeed as thought-provoking moviemaking at its best.  The social and political implications of the type of future society presented here are quite relevant to the world as we know it today, as are the insights into fighting a world-wide war against enemies we may not truly understand.The warfare is intense and the heroic actions of many of the movie's characters are awe-inspiring, but the movie pulls no punches in bringing home the fact that war is a terrible, ugly business and warns us that we must really know our enemies before launching a war against them.  I won't go into the various subplots, but they hold the movie together and really force its points home on the viewer.  At 130 minutes long, you really get your money's worth--this is science fiction movie-making at its best.d.

0385495323|5.0|This is one of the best examples of popular applied science I have ever read. An excellent, brilliantly written, fast-paced page-turner. From the basics of frequency analysis it leads the reader to the complexities of quantum cryptography - never letting us down, always trying to explain the most difficult scientific and technical concepts in the most accessible way. The detours to natural languages (alive, as in the case with the Navajo code talkers, or dead, as with Middle Egyptian and Linear B) provide excellent background for the main theme of the book.<br />With my background in history and linguistics, I found the book very sound from the academic standpoint - given my limited knowledge, of course. However, the author has an uneasy relationship with all things Russian - whenever he touches the subject, it's a blunder. The Russian alphabet has 32 or 33 letters (depending on whether you count an optional one), but definitely not 36; Gorbachov came to power in 1985, not '89; if Yeltsin would have shelled the Latvian parliament in 1993, that would have been a full-blown international conflict; instead, he shelled his very own Russian parliament (whether with justification or not, I am not going to discuss here).<br />Otherwise - a tour de force.
6304211740|2.0|Well, i had first read the book as a requirement for summer reading. I instantly fell in love with it, as Bronte's character Jane was so much like myself. Then, as in most cases, i went out and rented the movie, expecting it to as beautiful and intricate as the book. BOY, was I ever wrong.<BR>It was so horrible, I have to admit that the begining was very well portrayed, until we came to the part where Jane had to leave Gateshead. After that, it was all down hill. What really irked me was that Rochester was blone, and didn't seem to  have the complexity of the original character of the book. Also, Blanche was BLONDE! She was supposed to be dark haired, almost raven like, but was she nooooo. The ending was the worst, as it rushed along the introduction of Jane's cousines, and left out the entire point that St.John needed Jane. Uhhh. I highly un-recomend this movie, as in a great admirirer of the book I actually weept at the end of this film. Hopefully the other films have yet to prove me wrong.
0452282152|3.0|The book, as one could easily imagine, was displayed in the window of every bookshop in Holland. I fell victim to this blatant propaganda.<br />Not that I regretted. It was a nice peaceful read, and the author evidently did her recearch. The storyline seemed a little too obvious; there was no feeling of mystery, of strange tingling light, which one can really feel in any of Vermeer's paintings. And the approach to the \\"woman's view\\" seemed a little simplistic to me.<br />On the other hand, when I went to see the picture in Mauritshuis in The Hague (and it looks nothing like the reproductions, nothing at all - same is true for the view of Delft, also on the cover, also in Mauritshuis), I greeted Griet as an old acquaintance.
0385503954|1.0|It took me over a week to slog (and I DO mean &quot;slog&quot;!) through this book.  It was with great anticipation that I bought it, after having read so many rave reviews, but what a disappointment.  The first part was so tedious, I could barely get through it ...... .  On I slogged, nonetheless, searching for something to care about in any of the characters, waiting for something - anything - of interest to happen.  While some of the prose was beautifully written, the actual story had no flow or coherence.  I didn't feel the characters were fleshed out in any way ....<br />  Within 10 or so pages of the end, I could have happily put the book down and not even bothered to finish it. I am a voracious reader and I don't recall having felt that way about another book I've read.  You get the point.  I DID finish it, finally, but it was pure torture.
B00005OAIE|1.0|The Dave Matthews comparison is quite relevant.  Here is a guy that is playing and singing music directly targeted to the post-hippie Matthews contingent.  He brings nothing new to the table, only his apparent Berklee education.  Guess they didn't teach him how to write decent songs, did they?  <br />I for one think that up until the recent Glen Ballard-produced &quot;Everyday,&quot; Matthews and Co. were marking their own trail.  If Mayer has his way (and he's been a hit with the frat boys so far), he'll get a chance to tread the same ground.  I don't care if you're Jimi Hendrix - if you don't at least attempt to create something that is uniquely yours, you've invalidated your art.  Mayer not only doesn't try that here, he shamelessly drinks from the same well as every other college-age singer-songwriter.  I don't mind if people like his music, I just don't wanna hear them tell me he's up to something &quot;hip&quot; or &quot;cool&quot; or &quot;edgy.&quot;  This is the same old song.
B00004RF98|5.0|I'm now giving this DVD 5 stars because I discovered that it wasn't a bad quality DVD; it was my my DVD to V.C.R. hook-up that caused the problems. So kids, if you've had the same problems with the quality of your DVD viewing as I've described below, try hooking your DVD player either to a newer V.C.R. or directly to the T.V. So now allow me to apologize for my original review, and do purchase this DVD.<BR>  <BR>I'm giving this dvd 3 stars not because of the content of the movie but because of the quality of the dvd. Singin' in the Rain is a wonderful movie: very fun, very light-hearted, very good acting, singing, dancing, etc. But everybody knows that. What they don't know is that the quality of the dvd is very bad. In small print on the back of the box it says: \\"Standard version- presented in a format preserving the aspect ratio of its original theatrical exhibition.\\" Which must mean that the DVD is supposed to run blurry and dark. Every 10 seconds or so the color lightens up and straightens out enough to see what's going on, but that only lasts for a second or two and then it goes back to blurry and dark. For me, watching this dvd was a practice in frustration. I LOVE this movie. It's too bad that the quality of the dvd is so bad. If you're going to buy this movie, (and you should because it's fabulous) buy it on VHS and save yourself the disappointment.
0385503954|5.0|Read this book if you enjoy literature. Mr. McEwan manages to pack maximum emotional and spiritual power into his understated narrative.    The first 50 pages or so go slowly as we are introduced to the various key characters, but then as we become vested in the characters, we cannot put the book down.
B00005T343|1.0|This movie is a classic example of something that is wrong with America. Is there no humanity left?  I can't believe someone would fund or support a script like this, we are in a sorry state of affairs. Nobody in their right mind would dream up garbage like this, do yourself a favor and don't waste your time.  Bravo to Jodie Foster that she wouldn't touch this...<BR>My copy of this flick is going into the garbage can!
B00000K3CR|5.0|I love the movie Big starring Tom Hanks who just received and honorary award from AFI.  This movie is about a boy who wants to grow up and then realizes that adulthood isn't as great as he thinks it is.  My favorite scene is when he goes back to the New Jersey town and sees kids having fun and having their class picture done.  It made me really want to be that age again of 13. This movie was released the 3rd of June 1988 and it grossed 114 million dollars.  This movie is funny and has good jokes and how all of us want to be thirteen again and how being a kid isn't so bad as you think it is.
B00000K31V|5.0|Alright so this movie isn't the greatest thing to come around but it definetly doesn't blow. If you read the summary you'd see that this movie is weird.Not so much the actual storyline but the odd things that happen without any real expalnation. There the gaming pods, weird slimey egg sack things that cry like babies when you touch them. The mutant repitles they talk about and show swimming in the pond casually. Which are fished out and eaten.The gun made out of body parts, the erie characters at the chinese food restuarant, the sudden impulses the characters get to jump up yell \\"existenz!\\" and pass out. Probably whoever thought up these weird parts was probably blazed,and thats how its probably ment to be watched.With so much weird stuff tho, the storyline is pretty basic,and easy to follow.With the exception of unexplained happenings.
B000065U1N|5.0|This review is primarily in response to the review submitted by Mr. Richard Barszcz.  The director of this movie was not trying to get a point across by including excessive blood and gore in his movie.  The point of this film, like the book, was to relate what happened in Somalia in '93.  The bloodshed, the horror, every terrible gut wrenching moment that we see in Black Hawk Down happened.  The film does not intend to inflict pain; however, to tone down the violence and the sadness would not do justice to the event upon which the film is based.  <BR>  For those who want to know whether to see this movie, I would recommend it only to those who can bear the bloodshed and sadness inherent in a movie about this particular historical event.  If you are interested in the US military, or in modern military conflicts I highly recommend the movie.
B000065V1V|3.0|I bought this eagerly because I was sure Bowie would go &quot;Upbeat&quot; again after the downbeat Hours. Not so. <br />I think that Outside and Earthling had much more &quot;sound&quot; to enjoy, and better melodies. <br />There is a kind of girl singer I call &quot;weepy girls&quot;. Like Sade. (Sadly most of them are not as good as her.) Well, this is weepy Bowie. <br />Bowie said in an interview after Hours that he is very happy, but Hours was made about the typical person of his geneation, who isn't happy. Well, I wish he would get back  to his own viewpoint. <br />I don't wish to sound bitter, but I had such high hopes for this album.
B00005QIPH|5.0|...Obviously The Strokes and their stunning success in the U.K. threaten some punk-rock purists. But there's no need to worry: The Strokes aren't out to duplicate the original punk explosion. And they're certainly not trying to restart the cross-Atlantic war over who owns punk. No, The Strokes are just out to create something unique, energetic and honest--while being completely up front about their musical influences. That's the beauty in it. When you first hear a Strokes song, you think \\"wow, this is incredible, who is it,\\" even though it touches something inside of you that makes it seem already familiar. That's the mark of an instant classic. I felt this way when I first heard \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" in the early '90s.<br />... what is the truth? It's this: The Strokes' music is the most refreshing we've heard for a long while, and \\"Is This It\\" is a watershed moment in music. If my copy of this album were vinyl, I would have already worn it out, just like \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" or \\"Nevermind the Bullocks.\\"
B00005JKG9|5.0|It's hard to find a comment that has not been written here.<BR>I just want to add how great it is to find an american movie that can go so in depth into showing human emotions in the best traditions of european films.<BR>My special recognition to Jack Lemmon, one of the best all time actors (I'm gonna miss him).<BR>How long do we have to wait for the DVD edition?
0780631684|5.0|First of all, I would like to say that I dont care what other people think about this movie. I was reading some negative reviews about this film and I was shocked. I think this movie is a tense, heart-pounding, scary movie. This movie starts off as a high school class is going to France. And Alex Browning(Devon Sawa) starts to have weird dreams about the plain exploding and everyone dies. But then he wakes up from nightmare and starts screaming that the plain is going to explode and everyone has to get off. Of course everyone thinks hes nuts and the flight attendents through him off the plain. Then he and his friends are talking in the lobby when they here this explosing and you guessed it. The plain exploded. <br />After that very moment, him and everyone else get a eerie feeling that he can predict who will die. Then death hunts them down one by one and it is creepy. I dont want to give the story away. So I'll let you see it and you can see how good this movie is. It is rated \\"R\\" for Violence, Gore, Strong Language, and some sexuality. The gore is not bad, but it may turn some heads away. I give this movie 5 stars and more. Have fun and watch out!
B000002UAI|5.0|This was the first Beatles album I heard, and my view of it is coloured by that. I was knocked out by it about 35 years ago, and still love it. It sure beat my parents' Broadway musical records! My friend Paul and I used to sing along, trying to imitate the vocal inflections.<br />I don't understand those who knock this album: I think it has a lot going for it. There are heaps of strong songs on the album, some of which are among the first songs people think of when they think of The Beatles.<br />The cover of Buddy Holly's Words Of Love has some great sounds, including the very low vocal harmony and the unique electric guitar sound. George Harrison does a terrific job with Carl Perkins' Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby. The echo is so over the top, and the lead solo is stirring!<br />Eight Days A Weeks is not as exciting in the middle of a CD, but as the first track on Side 2 of an LP, the opening crescendo was arresting. Like one of those ubiquitous fade-outs, but in reverse. One of The Beatles catchiest tunes.<br />There is a definite Rockabilly/Country influence here, which continued on through Help and Rubber Soul. Ringo's version of Honey Don't and Lennon's I'm A Loser and No Reply, combined with George's version of Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby show that The Beatles had absorbed the Country style and then added their own unique touches.<br />Rock and Roll Music rivals Chuck Berry's own version. The pounding piano, combined with Lennon's raucous vocal make this one of the best songs on the album.<br />Don't laugh, but I love Mr Moonlight! It is a bit over the top, but Lennon is in fine form and the organ has a great timbre.<br />Highly recommended.
B00005ARDC|5.0|There's a coupla of points others have made that I don't quite agree with-enough so that I thought I'd contribute some thoughts.<br />BRMC is as good as rock gets. I think expecting perfection or something so radically new is futile. We just don't live in a time of super-originality, we live in an era of hybridization and collage and ambiguity. Content and context are slippery and transitory.<br />BRMC for sure reference earlier models- I hear a big sound that reminds me of psychedelic era bands and the nihilism of the Factory label groups. But what I like most is how well the rhymes align themselves with the songs sonic structure. Nice mirroring going on. Maybe they should play up some differences in the future but maybe that tactic is pretty obvious in terms of what-next think. And BRMC has a groove-not the architecture of funk but a body rhythm that is indexical, coming out of the song itself. I'm not looking for a &quot;who's the A+ band in rock&quot; situation..I'd much rather have a lot of good bands that turn out B-music.<br />Caveats? The &quot;love songs&quot; go against the jaded persona and sound out of character. I like the production but more drum please.
0312265859|3.0|This is the first Evanovich book that didn't have me laughing from beginning to end. Very disappointed when compared to her previous 7 books. It was still an enjoyable read, just not the usual fun.
B00003CXI0|5.0|Finally! A film that portrays pagans in the proper prospective. Just goes to prove that people can handle the fact that pagans are not the devil worshipers that they were always believed to be.<BR>Just like the book, Harry Potter will bewitch your heart with delight!
B0000025R3|5.0|This is one of those albums that no matter what era it is it still sounds fresh.<BR>In a time when most artist were experimenting with the electronical side of things these guys keep to the basics.<BR>Each of the five original members having a very unquie signature sound makes this Album as one of the all time greatest Australian Albums. Even todays standards most artists don't have that true originality that only comes every so often.<BR>With hit songs like 'Who Can It Be Now' &amp; Down Under there's no wonder why this album did so well!
B00004SYWZ|5.0|For once you can judge an album by its cover. The production is clean, contemporary, simple and impressive.<BR>There is a slick high-tech feel to it which is countered nicely by Paul's restrained accoustic guitar work throughout.<BR>As a supposed 'comeback' album it blows away the cobwebs and contains work of under-rated genius, as all of their albums have, but as a return to form this must surely rank amongst the best in popular music.<BR>There is one inevitable duffer, 'The Company Man', which is not quite saved by its nonetheless perfect arrangement. I also think 'I won't forget her' sounds rather '80s euro-pop', which for obvious reasons this band should steer well clear of.<BR>Harket's voice has thankfully regained its purity, after the courseness found in 'memorial beach' and 'wild seed' and again he effortlessly displays his mastery of falsetto in magne's laid back trip-hopish masterpiece 'I wish I cared' and Morten's own sublime 'thought that it was you'.<BR>I urge you to buy this - within its 13 tracks there is something for everyone who gives a damn about decent pop music.
B00000J631|4.0|I picked this up for the reason that it only cost [a little bit] at a local record store. I didn't expect much from it considering it is 101 bands doing 30second songs. When I popped this in, from start to finish it was awesome! It's not like all of the songs are revolutionary, but they are all fun, SHORT songs.<br />I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good time.
B00004Z459|3.0|This is actually pretty good. I belive the next album will be the keeper,though. Mike Shinoda is the best &quot;rapper&quot; of all the nu-metal bands, and Chester Bennington is delightful is his whiny ways.
B000001Y79|3.0|I bought this when I was really little, around like 8 or 9, and I hardly knew any better.  I bought cds because of their hits, and I think that everyone I knew bought this cd because of Spiderwebs and Don't Speak.  To this day, I have never been able to listen to ska, I don't know why, maybe some day I'll like it.  So, I tried listening to this cd again, and I couldn't.  I just kept on going on to the next song, and then the next, until I got to a song that was played on the radios.  I don't know what it is.  So if your someone that doesn't get turned on by ska, I don't really recommend it.  Keep your money and buy a better cd.
B00003CXA2|5.0|I know that some people may say that a movie based on the life of an \\"idiot\\" is of little interest to people and does not deserve someone's time.  Well, Forrest Gump has done nothing but shut those people up.  Tom Hanks stars as a slow-witted Southerner named Forrest Gump.  The film shows about 30 years of his life and our nation's life.  Forrest always manages to be around when something big is going on in America whether it be Vietnam or the Watergate Scandal.<br />Forrest starts out as child living with his single mother(Sally Field) in the South.  Forrest's only friend besides his mother is a young girl named Jenny who turns out to be the love of Forrest's life.  Early in life Forrest needs leg braces for his crooked legs which starts up the comedy in the film.  He then grows up to play football and turns out to be an All-American.  He then joins the army and meets his best friend and shrimp fanatic Bubba.  They go to Vietnam together where Forrest is struck with his first of many hard blows.  He also meets his future friend Lt. Dan(Gary Sinsie) in Vietnam.  While in the war Forrest is shot in the \\"buttox\\" and is hospitalized.  It is in the hospital that Forrest realizes he is exceptionally skilled in the sport if ping-pong.  After the war Forrest joins the national Ping-Pong team.  Forrest then buys a shrimping boat and begins working alone.  He is later joined by war vet/friend Lt. Dan.  The two end up getting rich off of the business.  Forrest then returns home where his mother is sick and decides to mow lawns.  Jenny later revisits Forrest  and the two live together for a while.  She later leaves him and this is when Forrest begins his 3-year long jogging spree back and fourth across the country.  After his run Forrest gets a letter from Jenny and decides to visit her.  He then learns that Jenny has had his son.  I won't tell you the rest, you'll just have to buy it and watch it for yourself.<br />Forrest Gump is a heart-moving, and humourous movie that thewhole family can watch.  I would highly recommend buying the DVD version instead of the VHS version since with the DVD version you get two disks, one containing the movie and the other containing a handful of great extras.  Which ever you decide, you will still be buying one of the best films of the 19th century!
B000003TA2|5.0|I bought this cd after reading a book about Nirvana, and how Kurt Cobain adored Sonic Youth.  I saw a video for Kool Thing and I decided I'd buy myself an album they made and see if they were any good or not.  Wow... I was so impressed.  Tunic is my favorite song off of it.  I just think it's beautiful, from the way it's written to the way it's performed.  After lisetning to this album, I understood why Kurt Cobain loved Sonic Youth so much.  I still continue to listen to the cd on a regular basis, and I hope to buy more of their albums in the future.
B00003CXI1|3.0|I have never read the novel and don't know what to expect when I first watched it. When the show ended, the first thing came to my mind is:&quot;that is it?&quot;. I am quite disappointed with the whole story especially the ending. But a friend of my said this movie followed exactly after the story of the novel. No wonder. This show has what the novel readers want, but loses the cinematic effect.
B0000636UN|5.0|This CD is incredible, absolutely incredible.  I have listened to it over and over again and have yet to grow tired of it.  Every single song on the CD is amazing; Sheryl Crow is truly an amazing artist.  I fully recommend that you buy this CD... it is well worth any amount of money you spend on it.  My favorite song?  &quot;Diamond Road,&quot; by far, and &quot;It's So Easy,&quot; (which she sings with Don Henley) is a VERY close 2nd.  Buy this CD.  It'll be the best purchase you ever make.
0316666343|5.0|\\"The Lovely Bones\\" is one of those rare books that stays with you.  It's hard to move on to the next book on your reading list once you close the book on Susie Salmon.  I don't think anyone can review this book with words that can describe how beautiful, affecting, and thought-provoking it was for me.  The murder of a child is horrific, but the sensitivity with which Ms. Sebold crafts the aftermath of the event from the eyes of the child in her heaven takes some of the sting out.  She shows us that hope lives on, on earth, as well as in heaven.  You will not regret reading this book--kudos, Ms. Sebold.

On the run and out in the cold with his friend's seven year old<BR>                                daughter in tow, Stone uses his training, intelligence and toughness to best<BR>                                advantage. And just when he's past one challenge, an even greater one confronts<BR>                                him.

B0000028UK|4.0|What an appropriate name for this album.  Lyrically, the themes are full of conflict.  Black dude vs. white cops.  Ed vs. the media.  Children vs. their own parents.  Five against one, and so on.<BR>Musically, it's both angrier and more tender than Ten.  While it doesn't have the consistency and overall depth of that album, it brings a new element into PJ's sound that continues to this day....experimentation and diversity. It's too hard to describe this album in general.  One track at a time, please.<br />1. Go - In my opinion, probably the best PJ album opener ever. Written by the new drummer, it suceeds thanks to sounding like a harder version of a Ten song, and takes off on a blistering McCready solo.<BR>2. Animal - For the first 8 seconds, this one sounds like Even Flow part 2. But then Ed starts counting \\"1, 2, 3, 4, 5 against 1...\\" and it becomes clear that the two songs have nothing in common.  Continues the flow begun by \\"Go\\" perfectly.<BR>3. Daughter - The only hit song from this album(and the only one blatantly ripped off by Sheryl Crow), I love the bipolar mood swings of this tune; at times it goes from uplifting to depressing and back without missing a beat.  Plus you have to love the way it ends, with an ominous-sounding refrain about the shades going down.  <BR>4. Glorified G - I really hate this song; I admire the fact that they're already trying to ditch their established \\"sound\\" this early into their careers, but this one just annoys me.  That's ok, cause look what follows...<BR>5. Dissident - Amazing.  I'd rank this up with \\"Release\\" and \\"Red Mosquito\\" as one of Pearl Jam's most beautiful songs ever. Reminiscent of Ten if only for of it's haunting chorus. <BR>6. W.M.A. - When I first heard this, I hated it ...  But after allowing the song to grow on me(along with picking up the rest of their albums and understanding what direction they had gone in), it's one of my favorites. I love the live version of \\"Daughter\\" that flows right into this one.<BR>7. Blood - This song gets a bad rap.  Why??? Personally I think the way Eddie lashes out at the backlash of fame and success is very cathartic and beautiful. And like W.M.A., this song was also very prophetic of what direction later albums followed.<BR>8. Rearviewmirror - Holy (excrement), this has got to be one of this band's highest ranked songs ever.  Starting as a simple riff until the entire band gradually EXPLODES, the whole of it is brilliant, much like Alive. There isn't a certain moment or highlight of the song you listen for, since the ENTIRE running time of the song is majestic from start to finish.<BR>9. Rats - When Kurt Cobain accused PJ of not challenging their fanbase, and being a \\"safe rock\\" band, he obviously had gone temporarily deaf while this track was playing. Sounding like nothing off of Ten, this one kicks off with a funkyass bassline that erupts in a frenzied chorus that almost makes you want to bust a groove instead of mosh. Lyrics are somewhat corny, but I think they suit the music well.<BR>10. blah blah blah....Small Town - Starts with a single acoustic guitar and Ed singing a very simple melody. Eventually builds into an epic ballad resembling 70's bands like Kansas or CSNY. Chorus is sort of lacking, but other than that it's all lovely.<BR>11. Leash - I love songs that Eddie just screams his way through. I also love when they deviate from the normal verse-chorus-verse structure. And I love it when they put lyrics that aren't even sung in the liner notes, that give away the meaning of the song(is it the first one about abortion?  Someone help me out). Heck, there's nothing I don't love about this song.<BR>12. Indifference - Probably the best closing song for any of PJ's albums.  Quietest song on the album, with a swing-time feel thing going on.  It's just gorgeous, even though the ending kind of drags.<br />This album broke sales records when it first came out, and I'll bet caught all 950,000 people who bought one in the first week off-guard at least twice.  If you like your music diverse, unpredictable, and soulful, you can't go wrong with this one.  And if you're a PJ fan(to any degree), you don't deserve to LIVE if you don't own this.
B00003CX5P|5.0|I watched the movie 3 times in cinema. I just keep thinking about it. Although the story is a bit confusing, it is a fantastic show. Many great moments and special effects are so good!! Creative setting and majastic fighting scenes. If you did not own this title, it is a waste.
B00005RHGL|5.0|Though this isn't the most technically perfect movie ever made, it's damn enjoyable, and that's what matters most in a movie.<br /><br />There are so many other good things about this movie that I won't be able to cover in this short review, so watch!  Great, and I mean GREAT character development for both the good guys and the bad guys.  Good portrayals of bad guys are missing in most movies, but in this one you get a true sense of why the bad guys choose chaos and disorder - because it's easier and more quickly gratifying than law and order.  At the same time, you get a great sense of why you want the good guys to win - because in the wild west they represent some justice and peace!<br /><br />The dialouge in this flick is non-pariel for westerns.  The old phrases and slang were great.  &quot;Skin that smoke wagon,&quot; what a cool way to say &quot;pull that pistol out of its leather holster.&quot;  Billy Bob Thornton is great as the big cowardly bully in that scene.<br /><br />Well, I can talk at length about this movie.  It's a guilty pleasure, because I usually admire movies that are technically 'tight.'  There are some scenes that could have been redone and a couple editing mistakes you can catch, but with a movie this fun, who cares?<br /><br />-- JJ
B0000025C0|4.0|This disc contains Boston's best song, A Man I'll Never Be. It is one of the original arena rock ballads. Love to sing along with it. My advice if you don't have this is to buy it, burn it onto one CD along with Boston's debut album (they both fit on a single disc) and give the originals to a 13 year old who's never heard them. Let him or her experience the same bliss we did so many years ago.
B00003CXAA|5.0|To the people that were waiting on the Godfather to come out on DVD,get this set.You won't be disappointed.Why? It's far better than the VHS set.The extras disc (disc 5) is worth half the price I paid for the whole set.Not only do you get Godfathers 1,2 &amp; 3,but on disc 5 you get interviews with Robert Deniro,Al Pacino,James Caan,Talia Shire and pretty much the whole cast.For the people that remember the Godfather Saga when it came on NBC during the late 70's,all the extra scenes they inserted are on Disc 5.
B00005JKBC|4.0|This movie has not only plenty of action, but also tells a story of the relationship between CIA agent Nathan Muir and his recruit, Tom Bishop. Muir teaches Bishop all about the tricks of the trade (including how to spot and use assets). Muir seems to be intrigued, at the least, by Bishop's quiet demonstration of strength and devotion when they first meet. As the two spend more time together and Bishop is real enough to not brown-nose but to ask questions when things don't seem right to him, Muir seems to be thinking over Bishop's many questions while playing back his memories during his questioning by other CIA agents (on Muir's last day on the job, no less) - who seem bent on leaving Bishop in a Chinese jail to die. Muir has a few good tricks up his sleeve, including Operation \\"Dinner Out,\\" and the details of Muir's careful planning are satisfying and make the operation seem less simple. What bothered me was never really finding out WHY Muir had to single-handedly mastermind Bishop's rescue operation (he had some back-up, but why not more openly willing agents?) and WHY the panel of questioning agents was so bent on NOT helping Bishop.

B00005Y1Y3|5.0|Live in America is a must for hard-core Doors people, and also highly recommended for everyone.  It contains a nice selection, many of the group's greatest songs, and the sound quality is fabulous.  What the mixers can achieve in these 21st Century CDs of 20th Century Foxy concerts (OK, concert snippets) is remarkable.  If you turn up the sound a bit, it is as if you are sitting next to a speaker on stage, with volume and balance personally calibrated to you, a magically funneled sound.<br />Check out \\"The Crystal Ship\\" and Ray Manzarek's trademark lovely organ solo, which radiates ooh so beautifully. \\"Touch Me\\" is also superb, as Robbie Krieger's guitar flows through so neatly in stereo, in place of the absent brass and strings!  \\"Been Down So Long\\" is excellent, slick worksmanship to that cool heavy blues, with harmonica here too.  The good sonics make the always-electrifying \\"Break on Through\\" even better, and \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" cooks.  \\"The End\\" fills the long cut slot.  The only negative is some muffled sound in an extended \\"Love Me Two Times,\\" too great a song to let it bother me.  Overall, Jim Morrison's poise and delivery are good and professional to boot, even as he allows himself some spoken-jive spontaneity, in contrast to his alcohol-infused theater in \\"Absolutely Live.\\"<br />Though the Bright Midnight story is just beginning, by now at least one other version of each song on this CD has appeared on that label or Elektra.  It will be interesting to see how the many Doors tunes with no previous commercial live version roll out with the passage of time, for the group performed virtually everything at least once in concert, including \\"L.A. Woman\\" and \\"Riders on the Storm.\\"  For now, we have this gem of a CD, opening with none other than \\"Light My Fire,\\" highlighted by Ray's dynamic keyboard tension preceding the bridge between the two instrumentals.
B00005OAIE|5.0|No Such Thing is a quailty album start to finish.  Each time I listen to the album I find a new &quot;favorite&quot; song, from Why Georgia Why?, to Neon, to Not Myself.  This album is always a good listen.  John Mayer is a rising star and will be heard from for many years.
B00005JKES|5.0|This is the best Twin Peaks has ever looked!  Unfortunately, the pilot could not be included because of a rights dispute in the US. It is possible to get the pilot on DVD however, because the owner of the series was able to release the pilot in Taiwan. ...<br />All in all, this is a great boxed set of one of the greatest television shows ever. Picking up a copy of the pilot just rounds out the set and makes it complete!
B00005B6NC|3.0|I say 'blah' in a way that is like shaking your hand and saying, 'so so'. This is becuase although the actors are spirited and strong,we get to know some bits about them, the ending is just...ugh! blah! I personally did not like the ending. I think it was a bad way to end the movie. Besides the ending it was a fantastic movie. I find it ...interesting...
B000002UAR|4.0|You know what? I'm sick and tired of people saying that Beatles are \\"immature,\\" or that they are horrible. What kind of crap do THEY listen to? Insane Clown Posse? Limp Bizkit? Or is there other \\"music\\" that they absolutely love that I have been fortunate enough not to hear? This is not the Beatles best album, and not even close, but it's still good. People are saying that the Rolling Stones are way better than the Beatles. Personally, I love the Rolling Stones, and they just might be better, but the Beatles DO NOT suck! Did you ever notice that the majority of people giving this, or any other Beatles album are all ANONYMOUS? That's because they know, that if they dare insult the Beatles publicly, they're gonna get there pansy little ... whooped. They'd rather listen to anything that has something related to killing, killing, killing, drugs, sex, or killing. The Beatles are not my favorite band, but they are easily the most important, the second being the Rat Pack. I'm not saying that all those people with marginal IQs (occasionally reaching double-digits) shouldn't state they're opinion, I'm just saying that the Beatles rock, today's \\"music\\" (pop, rock, rap, and country ALL INCLUDED)doesn't, and they're opinions are wrong. Aerosmith, AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, and Metallica all rock too.<br />Now, I'll just say, that Eleanor Rigby is an awesome song, Taxman, almost meets it, Tommorow Never Knows is good, but Yellow Submarine, while not \\"retarded\\" or \\"stupid,\\" but it does get boring (it is intended to be a childeren's song.) Newcomers should instead buy \\"1\\" (the album) however.

B00005MAM2|1.0|If you watched the original chances are you will hate this remake. The change in dialogue has ruined the whole flow of the movie by adding exposition and losing the feel for the original, not to mention the monotone reading by the voice over actors.<br />I have seen both the subtitled and original dubbed versions and found that the &quot;special Edition&quot; falls short of the original. You will find yourself not laughing at scenes you remember laughing at and confused during key dramatic moments. This is a great example of &quot;if it an't broke, don't fix it&quot;.<br />I can't recomend this to anyone. If you can get the original dubbed or subtitled on tape go for it. You will even notice a superior performance by the voice over actors. <br />If they release the original dubbed on DVD I will be the first

B000001DU5|4.0|In the 1980's, there were so many guilty pleasures that really meant something to each of us in our communities, and nobody showcased that theory better than Tears For Fears. With their blend of Rock, Pop, and a dash of psychology, they climbed all the way to the top.<br />The 1992 Greatest Hits Album, Tears Roll Down, was the very first reflection of Tears For Fears classic songs. The songs are strong and enduring as you could ever expect from them. Each song tells a &quot;Freudian&quot; kind of story that still keeps acting like several therapy sessions. From Shout, to Head Over Heels, and their biggest hit, Everybody Wants To Rule The World, each song still as authentic as it was originally released back in the late 80's.<br />Although Tears For Fears never regained their exposure, every song is truly worth the listen to, and that is still no reason to shout.
B00005Y228|3.0|This CD has several catchy and energetic songs than can be played over and over again, such as Love at First Sight. Still, most of the other songs are pretty annoying and not very original. It is not a bad CD, and it depends on your personal taste, but in my opinion most of the songs give you a headache.
B000066NW0|5.0|This is one of the best CD's. It's full of passion (for music), fun, and just songs you have to listen to again. This is definetly on my top 5 cd's of all time!!!! My fav songs are Losing Grip, Complicated, Skater boi, I'm with you, Things I'll never say, and in my world. Even though all the songs are great!
B00005RDVW|2.0|When I bought the Peter Pan Special Edition I had forgotten the racist portrayal of the Indians in the movie.  They do live in Neverland but will kids make the distinction that if they live in Neverland it is make believe? Will they understand that not all Indians say Ugg and How like the ones in this movie?  I didn't remember the &quot;what Makes the Red Man Red&quot; number from when I was  kid but that was before video.  Now kids can watch it over and over again.<BR>Also, my copy does not have the &quot;making of&quot; short even though it says it does on the case.  This was very disappointing because I was hoping it would address the racism issue.

This book is perfect for the average person who just wants a scientific explanation of which muscles do what and the proper strength training technique to use for each. I found almost all common exercises included, and they are easily organized by body part.

B00005JKED|3.0|***1/2  Denzel Washington earned his Best Actor Oscar in \\"Training Day\\" portraying a veteran LAPD narcotics officer who has become every bit as hard, amoral and corrupt as the mean city streets he patrols.  We've seen plenty of \\"bad apple\\" cops in movies before, but rarely one as chillingly complex as Alonzo Harris, a man who long ago abandoned any of the crime-fighting idealism that led him to the job in the first place.  Harris has learned that to deal with bad people one has to become bad oneself, and he has no compunction against going outside the law if that is the only way to get what he wants.  For while he may piously declare that he is only beating the criminals at their own game, the truth is that Harris has simply sold his soul to the same self-centered greed that motivates the criminals he is supposedly after.<br />Writer David Ayer provides Harris with the perfect foil for him to go up against in the form of Jake Hoyt, a rookie cop who has been assigned to be the veteran's partner.  Feeling that he is finally going to be able to fulfill his lifelong dream of helping to make the world a better place, Jake is in for a very rude awakening once he comes up against the hardboiled cynicism of this more-than-he-bargained-for partner.  Filled with the understandable jitters and self-doubt that come with the first day on the job, Jake quickly comes to see that there is something not quite right with Harris, who spends much of the day breaking laws, flaunting procedures and even threatening Jake's life if he doesn't go along with the many nefarious plans and schemes he has up his sleeves.  Of course, Harris attempts to seduce Jake over to his way of thinking by arguing that such \\"unconventional\\" actions are required to circumvent a legal system that hamstrings officers with its bureaucratic rules and obsession with civil rights violations.  Or is this just a convenient excuse for Harris to justify his lawbreaking?  The film is, in many ways, more interesting as a study of Jake's character than of Harris', as we wonder if Jake will come to accept Harris' seasoned viewpoint or somehow see through it and remain true to his ideals.<br />\\"Training Day\\" is filled with scenes of great dramatic intensity, often times based on some legitimate moral dilemma that Jake finds himself confronting.  The mercurial nature of Harris' behavior keeps us as bewildered and off guard as it does Jake, for like him, we really don't know what exactly Harris wants or where he is coming from.  Such moral ambiguity is a sign of powerful storytelling and Ayer deserves a great deal of credit for bringing some depth to an overworked genre.  However, at times the film feels a bit forced and strains credibility just when we most need to believe in its truthfulness.  This is particularly the case in a scene in which Jake is about to be blown away in a bathtub and receives a last minute reprieve in the form of a coincidence too preposterous to be even slightly believable.  Moreover, some of Harris' actions - though valid for the point that the film is trying to make perhaps - seem highly unlikely in the real world.  The overall effect of them is to throw the audience out of the movie just when we are most eager to go where we feel it is taking us.  However, these are minor quibbles about a film that works so well for so much of the time.<br />As this is the film that won Washington his Academy Award, we must not fail to mention the superb performances delivered by both him and Ethan Hawke as Jake.  Washington, generally relegated to \\"good guy\\" roles, proves himself a deft villain in this case, displaying the many intricate coils of his seething, cobra-like character.  In many ways, though, Hawke does the more impressive job, partly because he has been given the less flamboyant role of passive observer.  Washington gets to hit all the dramatic heights, yet, it is through Jake's eyes that the audience gets to observe this lethal individual and Hawke provides the understated richness that brings this everyman character to life.  As Jake gets more and more intricately ensnared and embroiled in Harris' immoral actions, we can't help but identify with the ethical plight being thrust on this man who just wants to do what he knows - or thinks he knows - is right.  These two fine actors provide the explosive, symbiotic partnership that brings the screenplay to vivid life.<br />Director Antoine Fuqua makes each moment count dramatically, whether it be a tense confrontation between Harris and Jake over an issue of great moral consequence or a subtle moment of quiet reflection as Jake contemplates his next move.<br />Despite the fact that the film seems to strain a bit at the edges (one wonders what Jake's SECOND day on the job will be like), \\"Training Day\\" provides more food for thought than your average cop buddy movie - and much, much finer acting.he understated richness that brings this everyman character to life.

0792833236|5.0|In 1980 a film was released that made cinematic history.  Directed by Martin Scorsese and starring the great Robert De Niro, Raging Bull was released and caused jaws to drop throughout the film world.  It recieved rave reviews and was also nominated for plenty of Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor.  As always, the Academy picked the wrong winners for most of the awards including Robert Redford for Best Director instead of Martin Scorsese.  They did though give Robert De Niro his well deserved Best Actor award.<br />What really set Raging Bull apart from the rest of the 80's films was the fact that it was filmed in black and white.  This may seem like a mistake to some, but after watching it you'll understand the reason for this.  It makes you feel like you are actually watching old boxing mathces from the 1940's.  Robert De Niro plays Jake La Motta, an Italian Bronx fighter that is constantly battling not only his opponents, but also himself.  He is constantly accusing his wife or adultry which eventually drives her away from him.  La Motta also has to battle the pressures given to him by the mob, like in many Martin Scorsese films. <br />Joe Pesci stars as Jake's brother Joey.  Jake also pushes Joey further and further away from him with his anger-driven accusations.  There are some of the best boxing scenes ever caught on film in this movie, especially during La Motta's fights with Sugar Ray Robinson.<br />At the end of the 80's a poll that was given to tons of film critics revealed that the majority of them felt that Raging Bull was the best picture of the 80's. <br />If you are planning on buying Raging Bull I would highly recommend that you buy the DVD instead of VHS.  The DVD does not contain tons of extras or anything but it does have a lot better picture and sound compared to the VHS version.  Overall, Raging Bull has all of the key elements that not only make up a good movie but also one of the best of films of our time.
B00000IQC8|5.0|This film is a great example of how clever writing is more valuable than a huge budget. Kevin Smith made this movie on maxed-out credit cards, but it's still a classic because it is well written and the characters are memorable.<BR>The DVD has plenty of features, including an alternate ending that might have changed the perception of the film and a good commentary track.<BR>This is a must-have title for any fan of any Kevin Smith film.
B00005JKNB|4.0|Not many period movies can successfully capture the spirit and flavor of an age. Director Frank Darabont has done so in THE MAJESTIC. What Darabont has done was to capture the spirit of an age that never truly existed on the American scene. His slice of life is a odd mixing of the innocence of small town life from LEAVE IT TO BEAVER with the more gritty politicizing of a country torn by the unfounded accusations of the House UnAmerican Activities Committee. This mixing is not a bad thing either. It takes guts and skill for any director to make two movies in one, and there will always be critics who repudiate any such attempt. But there is no inherent flaw within the attempt. Judging such a movie is no more difficult than judging any movie. Did it combine the disparate parts in such a way as to make the attempt pleasing? This movie stands as a model for future directors to emulate should they decide something similar.<BR> Jim Carrey plays Peter Appleton, a successful movie lover and script writer who, in his college days, had the misfortune to join a club to impress a girl, only to find out years later that some communists joined as well. When his membership becomes known, he is blacklisted from working again. At this point, the movie is on target to address the issues that other and similar films as Woody Allen's THE FRONT did. These issues dealt with whether it was morally and legally justifiable to condemn people based only on their alleged membership in organizations that may or may not have included communists. In the real world, the reputations and lives of hundreds of innocent Americans were ripped apart based only the the rabid accusations of the then politically correct witch hunters who saw communists at all levels of American society. THE MAJESTIC could have focused tightly on that but director Darabont placed Carrey in a car accident which robbed him of his memory so that he had to seek a new life in a small town. Darabont's vision of small town Americanlife was taken not from real life but from other movies about small towns. Carrey's adopted town, called Lawson, was full of kind people only too willing to help a stranger. Of course, there is the inevitable romantic complication between a girl and the man that she and the rest of the town assume is the same man who went off to war ten years ago only to die. Carrey returns as that man. I had only a little trouble accepting that the resemblance between Peter Appleton and the dead war hero Luke Trimble was so close as to fool nearly everyone. When Appleton enters town as an amnesiac, the movie changes focus, not the abrupt about turn of suddenly reversing direction on a one way street, but rather that of merely changing lanes on a three lane highway. It is interesting that Carrey plays Appleton-Luke as one who really might be the revived hero. As Luke, Carrey restores not only the dilapidated Majestic theater to its former glory, but also the shattered collective soul of the town that now can welcome back the return of one of its lost sons to the war. Of course, his former identity is revealed by the slimy representatives of the film industry who want to send Appleton's pinko rear end to jail. As Appleton goes on national television while being forced to read a prepared statement implicating himself as a communist, director Darabont borrows from Frank Capra to allow Appleton to clear his good name by quoting from the Bill of Rights. Other critics of this movie find a great deal of fault with such obvious use of other directors' works, but the problem does not lie in the genesis of Appleton's impassioned speech defending the constitution, but rather in assessing its impact on the film, and by implication, on the audience. Do all the various parts to an admittedly many sided movie work? Frankly not all, but most do. I had a more difficult time accepting the abrupt about face of the town in cheering en masse their hero at the end when just before they abandoned him. Butperhaps this collective about face is the point of the movie. If Jimmy Stewart or Jim Carrey can argue passionately about the rights of all Americans to speak their minds, then maybe those who did not think so at the beginning of the film, will change their mind at the end.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|There is no words to express what I thought when I saw this film.  It was filled with talented actors and actresses, a beautifully written script, and excellent visuals.<br />Russell Crowe is not usually an actor that I can stand but this movie really showcases his talent.  Playing such an interesting person as John Nash was a very hard task but he pulls it off beautifully.  His acting seems believable while his body language shows that he researched the life of John Nash.<br />A Beautiful Mind IS Oscar calibur and beats Monsters Ball in the race for best picture.  Monsters Ball did have some stellar performances but A Beautiful Mind had everything a good movie needs.<br />Next time you are at your local rental store pick up A Beautiful Mind and give it a chance, you will not be sorry.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|E.T. is  a great movie, never mind that it's 20 years old now. You'll still laugh, and wonder, and feel sad during the movie. John Williams has the the perfect score for this movie, and it flows with the great acting and directing. I plan on buying this DVD when it's released, and I think most people who have seen this wonderful movie will too.
B00006690G|5.0|This Cd is a great buy if you are a true eminem fan... Each song features new beats and new lyrics that aren't as hard as his last album but he still gets his message across. If you don't like Eminem's hard lyrics don't... don't buy the album.
B000059XUP|5.0|I continue to read reviews for this film calling it everything but the actual antichrist itself.  I personally found no problem with it other than one line, that's right only one problem with this movie and it's one line.  When Ashe pursues Spider Monkey he calls himself \\"all your worst nightmares rolled into one\\".  Whatever inspired writer David Goyer to sink to 80's horror dialogue I don't know, but anyways on with the review.<br />This film had incredible production design, great costumes, a superior instrumental score (by Graeme Revell) and an overall gothic feel.  I'm not saying it's better than the first film, I am merely saying that if this film had not received so much hype before it's release and people had not panned it for not being Brandon so much than maybe it would have been better received.  I for one enjoy this movie very much and hence give it 5 stars
B000001DQI|5.0|To relisten to this classic is to mourn for a day when the physical appearance of an artist was not more important than talent.  I keep thinking how would they market a young Elton John if he had popped on the scene today.  Oh well some of my favoite songs on this album are some of the lesser known ones.  Sweet Painted Lady for example is evocative of an old melancholy ballad suitable for a bawdy barbershop quartet perhaps.  All The Girls Love Alice is another song that is distinctive from the other songs on the album in a subtle yet notable way.  I've always liked Saturday Night's Alright (For Fighting)it is an anthem that always reminds me of the infamous Brit soccer hooligans.  Where is the next Bernie and Elton?...not cute enough for eMpTyV I guess.
B000063DHK|5.0|There might be metal albums that equal this one's greatness, but there are none better. This is the most infamous live '80s metal album I can think of, and for good reason. It's Maiden live in their prime backing some of the best albums in history, period. The production is flawless, and with the newer re-releases of this CD, you can even get the five tracks that were not included in the original CD release. All killer, no filler, that's the best way I can think of to describe this masterpiece.<br />Being born in 1982, this band is special to me. When I listen to '80s Maiden, I remember how we used to go over to my cousins house and they would listen to Maiden, AC/DC, Sabbath, etc. and my Mom wouldn't let me listen to it with them. I thought it was cool back then, and I think it's even cooler now. Iron Maiden will ALWAYS be a classic metal band, and no release by any band could ever think of topping the stuff they put out in the '80s. <br />Now if I were you, I would start collecting as much of this stuff as I could, especially with all this bland, faceless, uninspired, not to mention poser, \\"nu-metal\\" corrupting the airwaves today.
6304711875|5.0|I wrote a review for this movie about a year or so ago. I figure it's time to do an update. \\"Scream\\" came along in the winter of 1996 amidst little fanfare. What could a little slasher film, albeit with a name director and few name stars, really have going for it?. Obviously, everything. The movie shocked everyone by receiving thru the roof acclaim. Better than that, the film hit box office gold. It had climbed 4 places higher by it's third week, when these films are generally off the radar by the 3rd week. Good reviews and a great word of mouth is what made this exceptionable film. Director Wes Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson delivered a film that revitalized the genre and made it fun, exciting, clever, witty, suspenseful, and very intelligent. Something most horror films lack. The movie is about Sidney Prescott(Played by the solid and believeable Neve Campbell),who lives in a nice, quaint, peaceful town. She has her 'bad boy' boyfriend Billy Loomis(Skeet Ulrich), who looks like a young Johnny Depp, and her group of friends. Sidney also has a dark secret in her past. Something painful. Then she finds herself in the middle of a deadly game with a serial killer targeting the town and her friends. What does this killer want from her?. Why her in the first place?. The idea of a killer in a scary mask preying on teens in a small town with a knife isn't exactly new, but it doesn't need to be. It can be scary and interesting as long as you do it right. The whole thing can seem like new again. Just like what this movie did with the whole horror genre. This film is obviously a love letter to the original \\"Halloween\\". It will definitley go down as a benchmark for horror the same way that \\"Halloween\\" was when it was released in 1978. The script is exceptionally clever and very funny. Although, it is NOT a comedy. Craven photographs each scene with sharp photography. He is a master and he knows what to do and how to do it. The movie makes us look at ourselves. The violence that goes in our everyday world. Violence that surrounds us at home and in our schools. The movie is much deeper than what most ignorant naysayers think. The cast is very good. Campbell is a good 'Scream Queen'. She comes across as a person you would know. She makes Sidney a two dimensional character that you care about. A character that you will root for throughout the movie. Not since Jamie Lee Curtis has someone given the title 'Scream Queen' a good name like Neve. Matthew Lillard is an over the top joy. His portrayal of Stu is manic, but is very watchable. Rose McGowan is pleasing, but she doesn't stand out. Jamie Kennedy as Randy is great. He could be your nutty friend. Or even you. That's what the movie is about. It could be you. This is what is real. I always find it more interesting when a horror film is grounded in reality. It is believeable. This could happen to you. \\"Scream\\" is an intelligent movie that is for people who crave a good 'scary' movie. Not a 'gore' movie with no redeeming value. That's why this movie was critically acclaimed. That's why it was a huge box office breaker for a horror film with over $100 million at the box office. \\"Scream\\" is the kind of movie that tries to scare you by being real. Anybody can splash CGI effects and gross monster make-up on the screen, but it takes something special to scare. Effects and make-up are fun, but they don't scare me. Normal, everyday, simple things is what is the scariest. That chill you get up your spine when you hear a creak in your house. How your heart skips a beat when you have that all too familiar fear that someone is in your house. This is what's scary. I don't get scared with some gross zombie coming at me because it's total fantasy. Nothing is better, or scarier, than real life. \\"Scream\\" was a blessing from up above, but it was also a curse. A curse because it made studios jump on the bandwagon and churn out half rate crud. I can understand why some people might have a grudge towardsthis movie. But you know what people?, it is not the movie's fault. If you want to blame someone, blame the studios for making junk off of a great movie like this. It's real pathetic when people blame this movie for everything. Any piece of crud teen movie is said, by some people, to be a decendant of \\"Scream\\". Whatever. These are people who are just not fans and are trying anything they can to blame it for something. Let it go people. It doesn't work. How some people insult others by saying it's just a 'goofy movie for teenagers'. Obviously, anyone who says something as ignorant as that would have to be young themself. It's laughable how others say it isn't horror because it doesn't have buckets of gore or disgusting murders. \\"Scream\\" went above that tripe. It tried to be suspenseful. Make a movie that is actually scary. If you are a person who prefers to put your brain on hold and see endless images of some idiot ripping people in half with chainsaws, stay away from this. It will be lost on you. It's also something when you have a mega star like Drew Barrymore in your movie. Not only that, but to have a mega star like Drew Barrymore get butchered in the first 12 minutes or so of your movie. There will always be a time when a phone rings in the darkness of your house, and you get that slight chill. There's nothing creepier. Get hip to the movie all you detractors. It is great. Deal with it.
B00005NTN5|5.0|This movie is a simple, yet a subtle feast for the eyes. I've been watching it since it first came out and have worn out one tape and now have the DVD. Only one warning for you viewers...GET THE UNRATED VERSION!!! The daring and tantalizing bedroom scene is not to be missed. I don't think I've ever viewed a more breathtaking end to a sensual lesbian love scene than in this movie.
B000002L7V|4.0|Let me start things off by saying that this review is not by some music expert. I am an 80's metal fan, so maybe my opinion is biased by that fact. But take it from me, a 15 year old dude who hates so called \\"nu metal\\" and the other [stuff] they pass of for music these days...this albums rocks. If you are into real metal like me (Dokken, Ratt, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Dio, Yngwie Malmsteen, WASP, Stryper, Accept, Twisted Sister, Queensryche, Dio, AC/DC, Black Sabbath, ect...) then you will love this record. And of course, if you are Dio fan you SHOULD already own this CD. If not, go buy it immedietely if you like the Holy Diver/Last in Line style because this CD is just a continuation of that sound. It rocks!<br />Many metal fans (besides Dio's hardcore fans) don't seem to know what happened to Dio after 'Last in Line' was released. Many Dio albums after the exceptional Holy Diver and Last in Line were quickly forgotten. You don't hear too much about Dio after his first 2 albums, which is unfortunate because he had some really great albums after those 2. This is one of them.<br />Sacred Heart picks up right where Last in Line left off...a crushing rhythm section to back up Vivian Campbells monsterous riff and leads and Ronnie James Dio's emotional and intense vocals. On top of all this, lush keyboards add a sense of depth to the sound of the band. Speaking of the keyboards, the reason alot of people don't like this album is because there are more keyboards on this album than on the 2 previous albums. There's nothing wrong with this. I guess it's a matter of opinion. But this albums still rocks...and rocks hard. <br />Things kick off with 'King of Rock and Roll', which is the \\"anthemic\\" track. The 1st track on Holy Diver and Last in Line were those kind of tracks (stand up and shout....we rock). Great track. Next, following the pattern of HD and LIL, comes the title track, \\"Sacred Heart\\". This is a slower, crunchy metal tune that sounds similar to 'Holy Diver' buthas a unique \\"mystical\\" sound to it. After this, Dio and crew rock through 7 more melodic heavy metal tunes. All complete with memorable melodies, pounding drums, solid bass, crushing guitar riffs and shreddin' solos. Sound good? Well, this description should be no suprise if you have listened to Dio before.<br />Alot of people think \\"Holy Diver\\" was the band's greatest album and it all went downhill from there. I only half agree with that. \\"Holy Diver\\" was and is their greatest album, but the albums that's followed weren't worse than...they continued making great albums that were of the same quality as \\"Holy Diver\\". The only difference was the sound  of the band changed a bit. They added more keyboards, more songs were faster, more melodies, ect...I really don't understand the bad reviews this album has recieved from reviewers on this site. They claim \\"Holy Diver\\" is the best and this album [disappoints]. Well, despite adding more keyboards the style of the band has remained the same. Strong songwriting, awesome riffs, good solos, memorable melodies, ect...those things were very evident on Holy Diver, Last in Line, and they are still very evident on Sacred Heart. <br />If you into REAL (aka: 80's) metal, then I can't recommend this CD enough. It's just a good, solid piece of mid 80's heavy metal. If you are a Dio fan and you don't own this record I'd highly recommend you buy it. If you are not into 80's metal or Dio, I'd recommend a psychiatrist because there is something seriously wrong with you.<br />Bottom line: it rocks...buy it
0316666343|5.0|I got this book on Tuesday afternoon and couldn't put it down.  I read until around 3 a.m., when I fell asleep with it on my chest.  The next morning I got up, made some coffee, and sat down and read until I finished it.  I don't think I've ever been so captivated by a book.  Alice Sebold is an astounding writer.  I can't recommend The Lovely Bones highly enough.
B000063V8R|5.0|As the other reviewers have pointed out this is an awesome DVD set. The other two seasons were very good but this is the one all the fans have been waiting for. I won't mention all the episodes, since other reviewers gave excellent summaries. Mine will be just my favorites and opinions.<br />The Booby Trap (Picard saving the ship at the end is priceless and that music matches perfectly), The Defector (the suspense if the Romulan will attack or not and the surprise Picard has for them), The Hunted (nice to see someone give our heroes a run for their money and the message on war), Deja Q (Q being human and having new experiences very good), Yesterday Enterprise (man that is one of the best all time!! This is one of the best what if, time-warp episodes), Sins of the Father (the beginning of what I call the Klingon saga, this is the springboard), Hollow Pursuit (Barclay's fantasy world), and the Best of Both Worlds (every Trek fans know about that one!).<br />The interviews that they have on the DVD are very cool especially how this was a season where they had lots of new writers and basically writing on the fly. It also features heavily Michael Piller. He gives his insight on a lot of the episodes and why the Best of Both Worlds was so good. When he talks about it, makes a lot of sense!!<br />The interface of the DVD has changed and the last episode there is a surprise I won't say but is very cool. I strongly recommend any fan to get this set and if you can only pick one this is the one to pick.
B00005UEAR|5.0|What can I say but WHOA! I saw these guys live, and they blew me away. I already had Live Scenes From NY, but I hadn't heard this cd. They played their music, and ...speechless. Glass Prison, lol, what a song. What an intro. LaBrie's vocals take a little getting used to, but MAN!! Get this.
0441009425|2.0|Reynolds has packed a lot of &quot;hard science&quot; stuff into the novel, and he has a lot of imagination along those lines. But his writing skills need to be more mature. The characters aren't engaging, and do not seem to have distinct personalities or internal motivations.<br />   The story also develops too slowly, and the reader is kind of strung along until the end as if it were a mystery novel, however there isn't any real sense of suspense, mystery or wonder that might motivate you to keep reading.<br />   Hard to believe this is the same novel that is hyped on the cover. While my review is rather negative, this book isn't awful, but it suffers in comparison to the hype.
B00005NW02|4.0|SOD is definately one of the weirdest bands I have a CD to. If I may, I would like to do a breif summary of the songs.<BR>1. Prison song 8/10 Not my favorite, but a good song. I don't like the intro that much.<BR>2. Needles 9/10 One of my favorites. Love the melody (especially during chorus)<BR>3. Deer Dance 8/10 What a weird song. LOL. Provides a good listen with unique singing.<BR>4. 5/10 One of my least favorite songs I have ever heard. I think terrible.<BR>5. X 10/10 LOL! One of my favorite songs. What does it mean?? Who cares?? Just awsome.<BR>6. Chop Suey 9/10 I don't know why everyone loves this song. It's ok, but not great.<BR>7. Bounce 7/10 What the HECK is this song about. A pogo stick? o.....k.<BR>8. Forest 9/10 I like this song. The chorus is shuddering.<BR>9. ATWA 10/10 At first I didn't like this song, but it grew on me. A nice slow break.<BR>10. Science 8/10 I love this song, but dislike the message. Science has *NOT* failed this world is what it should be.<BR>11. Shimmy 10/10 LOL. Short, funny, insane.<BR>12. Toxicity 9/10 Another slow one, stupid lyrics.<BR>13. Psycho 8/10 Psycho, groupie, cocaine, crazy. Pretty much sums up this song.<BR>14. Aerials 11/10 Definately the best song. Slow, harrowing, awsome!!<br />Overall, this cd is a good buy. I hate the lyrics which is why i give them 4/5 stars. Still, it's definately not a waste of money :-)
B00005JKQZ|2.0|After looking at several other reviews, I'll be the counter- point.  First of all, no question that Crowe did an excellent job.  However, maybe because my education is all in mathematics, I was looking for something more ... including a better, more accurate, characterization of the mathematical setting Nash found himself in.  Didn't happen.<br />I don't believe the film was intended to be a documentary - Howard could have done much better at that.  It evidently wasn't a biography either.  What then was it?  A story about mathematics and/or a mathematician?  A study in mental disorders?  If it was intended to be either, it fell short.  On the one hand the &quot;person in the street&quot; could not get much of a feel for Nash and his contribution to mathematics from this film ... an important and significant omission.  On the other, nothing really was said regarding the events leading up to THE high point of his career - achieving the Nobel Prize.  Ya just can't leave this kind of stuff out in a flick like this!!  Moreover, there is no Nobel in mathematics and that is a significant point in this case.<br />If this was a study in mental disorder all I can say is it was way too shallow.<br />Glad I saw it, wouldn't see it again.
0345409671|2.0|The concept of 'diminishing returns' sure seems an apt description for Anne Rice's vampire series.  Readers who first enjoyed \\"Interview With The Vampire\\" may have made the jump to \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" without much loss of interest, but by the time of \\"Queen Of The Damned,\\" it should have been apparent to readers that Rice has a fondness for sensual prose without heart.  Steeped in animus and fragmented by the disjointed narrative, QOTD was my first clue that I might NOT want to read Rice's entire catalog.  I perservered and got through \\"The Body Thief,\\" but was quite disappointed by the book's predictable course.<br />With \\"Memnoch, The Devil,\\" Rice abandons just about any trace of linear construction and/or regard for the characters who have been her bread and butter.  The story has a decent beginning, comparable in tone to \\"Body Thief,\\" but soon takes off into the spiritual ether.  The conclusion, in which Rice tries to atone for two hundred pages of addle-pated musings on Christianity and the resulting mental masturbation, is heavy-handed and careless.  At least one major supporting character from the Vampire Chronicles is used as a sacrificial lamb...a transparent ploy to give the story a lasting impact.<br />Lestat's involvement in this tale is by no means effective.  As the most prominent vamp left in Rice's camp, one expects the usual self-loving/hating exposition, but in \\"Memnoch\\" Lestat is a pawn for god, the devil, a dead crook & his holy-roller daughter, and Rice herself.  One can forgive portraying Lestat as a patsy to god and the devil, and excuse the crook/daughter combo on the grounds of creative license.  But for Rice to use Lestat as a surrogate for herself in this meandering theological treatise is practically unforgiveable.  Even given Rice's abundant (and redundant) spiritual knoweledge, Lestat does little more than observe in his jaunts to heaven, hell, and the spirit-packed netherplace she calls \\"Sheol\\".  The minor changes he inspires or creates in historical context are negligible, though the final result of his odyssey is grossly overplayed.<br />My biggest gripe with this book is NOT how Lestat is portrayed, though I think that issue will resonate with a lot of Rice's readers.  Rather, I'm apalled that Rice didn't have the good sense to present this fever-dream of a story OUTSIDE the Vampire Chronicles continuity.  True, Lestat is portrayed as having strengths comparable to that of the devil (!), and his 'connections' in the realms of money and power make it easier to facilitate some of the subplots in \\"Memnoch.\\"  But in the end, Lestat has been ill-used by just about everyone in the story, and his vamp peers fare similarly.  This reader wishes that Rice had been less opportunistic in her use of established characters...particularly since it wouldn't have taken much imagination to turn this into a self-standing novel.<br />Whether or not individual Rice fans will like this book is a mystery to me.  After all, I don't read her books looking for mystic symbolism or theological meaning.  Those who DO enjoy Rice's trips into the ether may well enjoy this book, or find significant meaning and/or messages within.  If you're an admitted fan, chances are you'll wade through this disappointing book regardless of any comments posted here.  But if you're a Rice newbie, for heaven's sake don't start with THIS book.  And if, like me, you enjoy the series but not Rice's penchant for occasional snooze-fests, steer clear of \\"Memnoch.\\"ates in historical context are negligible, though the final result of his odyssey is grossly overplayed.<br />My biggest gripe with this book is NOT how Lestat is portrayed, though I think that issue will resonate with a lot of Rice's readers.

B00005YW4H|4.0|I purchased this CD because every CD I viewed had a link to this one and I have no regrets about my purchase. Norah Jones has quite a good voice and her rendition of &quot;Cold, Cold Heart&quot; is worth the price of the CD. I found every song on this CD to be enjoyable. Norah Jones is good now at 22 and I believe she will get much better. This is one singer to watch.
B00003CXE7|4.0|This movie was really touching and hard to stop watching, even with blood flying and heads falling. I understand that the gore is what made the movie real, and what it is, but still! Yuck! Anyway, I was impressed, as usual, with Russell Crowe, and Director Ridley Scott really knew what he was doing. The whole film gets a very recommended review from me, just make sure you have a tough stomach. I watched this movie for the first time in Latin class, ... . ... The second time I saw it, it didn't seem nearly as bad and I really enjoyed the true message and meaning.
B00000IGGA|5.0|I think this CD is the ideal introduction to Tom Waits music. My first introduction to Tom Waits was one of his less accessible CDs and it took me quite some time to appreciate his brilliance. Tom Waits is one of the best songwriters of our time and this CD is one of his most accessible. The song &quot;House Where Nobody Lives&quot; is one of the most moving and beautiful ballads I have ever heard. <br />If you haven't listened to Tom Waits before, buy this CD today.
B00005R2M3|4.0|Until &quot;Underneath Your Clothes&quot; I had no interest in Shakira. Now I'm one of her biggest fans! This album is excellent. I was very impressed. I hope Shakira continues to write music in English.
B00003CXI1|4.0|I was relieved that the movie was almost completely true to the book-- or at least much moreso than other books-made-movies.  <BR>For at least a year after the movie was released, I adamantly refused to watch it; far too many good books had been spoiled in my imagination by their movies.  With this one, I was very attached to my imagined-version, and wasn't about to take any chances of getting it permanantly changed to who-knows-what.  Well, finally about two weeks ago, I gave in, and I suppose I'm glad I did.  It was interesting to get an idea of how other people invisioned Harry Potter. Most of the characters were very true and tastefully-chose, in my opinion.  The movie was about as wonderful as I think they could have made it, taking into account considerable limitations and the obstacle of transforming imagination to film-- voila!  (Bummer Peeves was too hard to include!!)  <br />I'm sure it is rather rude in saying so, but however wonderful the movie was, I did enjoy my imagination more.  It was scarred a bit after having the movie characters molded in, too, but is beginning to come back.  I don't know; everyone will have different opinions as far as that goes!  <br />All in all, it is definitely worth seeing to view another full-blown and exciting interpretation, but one word of warning: PLEASE, READ THE BOOK FIRST!  It is amazing; and as with all good movies, they must have a solid foundation.
B00005QDW1|2.0|I usually like the half hardcore image and music of No DOubt, which I expected after, &quot;Hella Good,&quot; but this album spun off in totally new directions. I don't like it...the whole vibe was really strange, especially the chorus of, &quot;Rock Steady,&quot; which gave me the creeps. I could hardly make it through a single song on it. And after hearing, &quot;Hey Baby,&quot; forty-five times a day off the radio two months ago, it just got annoying.
B000002OZY|5.0|The Who are about risk and this is by their definition a challenge to musical apathy in pop: replace the names for each generation of pop pap.  <br />Buy Tommy, live with Tommy, love Tommy, and try to imagine you were around when Tommy was introduced to Rock 'n Roll...
B00005JKQZ|5.0|I definitely classify this movie as the best of all time. It is original and amazing. The cast was superb, especially Ed Harris and Jennifer Connelly. Of course, Russell Crowe was undeniably perfect, but that is expected. This film captured my attention and imagination immediately. Although the beginning starts out a little slow, it catches up and is perfectly planned. As soon as the middle gets a bit confusing, the whole concept comes together and entrances you. This movie is simply the best I've ever seen. Since seeing it (four times) no movie thrills me. It spoils you into thinking no other film is even satisfactory. That's okay with me. I'll just go home and watch &quot;A Beautiful Mind,&quot; again.
B000002ADT|5.0|Miles Davis managed, inspired, and tutored the greatest jazz musicians and the direction of jazz music.  His vision and inspiration will be felt for generations.  As a poor analogy:  what the Beatles did for Rock 'n Roll, Miles Davis did for music, not just jazz.  Each album defined a direction for music, by the time his contempories caught up, he redefined music again.  <br />He was a true leader for music and for musicians - this is one of the greatest recorded series of songs in the history of music, for so many reasons that can not be explained.<br />Mozart<BR>Miles Davis<BR>The Beatles... there is little debatable<br />Kind of Blue is the apex
B000066NW0|5.0|I think that Avril and the whole band are a pretty good band.  You don't find many bands that have chics rock on with a guitar and mike in their hands.  I thought it was about time something [good] had came a long like that.  She's got the look (style) and personality. This doesn't look like one of those fake bands that just come and go. So I'm wishing the best to the band...keep rockin' on and keep up the good work.
B00005R23Z|5.0|Some people compare this film to Orwell's 1984, but in all honesty, this film is far closer to Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, where an infant's occupation is determined at birth. <br /> My roommate was surprised that I had never seen the movie Gattaca. I was even more surprised when he told me that it was entirely plot driven, had virtually no special effects at all, no aliens, etc. <br /> I had to see this movie! <br /> And sure enough, this movie lived up to my high expectations. The story was thought-provoking and went at a nice pace. The characters are likeable and do a good job of acting. The VALIDS in the film all look like movie stars at an awards ceremony, whereas the IN-VALIDS look flawed--like a movie-star that didn't bother to put makeup on. I normally don't notice the music when I first see a movie, but Gattaca has some noteworthy background music. <br /> &quot;Brave New World&quot;, &quot;1984&quot;, and &quot;We&quot; had one thing in common--a powerful ending. I was pleased to see that Gattaca continued this tradition--in fact, it was the ending that prompted me to give this movie 5 stars--prior to it, I was thinking either 4 or 4 and a half.<br /> If you love science fiction, it's almost guaranteed you'll love this movie.

B00003CX5P|3.0|This movie doesnt deserve the title of star wars. In my opinion they didnt even need to make this movie. They could of started out with clone wars and been fine.  This movie is fine for a kids movie, with their jar jar action figures and the fake plastic looks.  (whats with those bright glowing balls that look like toys?). This movie is not going in my star wars section.  It is not dark enough and i am not accepting the change.

6300213803|5.0|This is Star Trek's finest hour.  Realizing the missed opportunities of the plodding Star Trek:  The Motion Picture, the superior sequel is non-stop excitement from the get-go.  Digging Khan Singh out of the classic Trek catacombs was a masterstroke, and Ricardo Montalban's performance as the revenge-crazed renegade is splendid.  Many fans also remember this film as Kirstie Alley's debut feature, and with good reason--her Saavik is an enchanting combination of elfin beauty and barely restrained Romulan fire.  Naturally, the cast of Trek familiars all perform admirably, and the special effects bring the myriad fantasy sequences (including alien brain eels and brilliant starship duels) to pyrotechnic reality, all the more effective because they highlight so many dramatic characterizations.  And James Horner's score is the best of any Trek film so far.  Parallel to the main revenge plot are two well-handled subtexts:  age and mortality.  On top of it all, Captain Kirk is reunited with an old flame and meets the son he has never known, only to suffer the heart-wrenching loss of his closest friend.  Well-conceived, written, and directed, Star Trek II is a relentlessly suspenseful and engaging sci-fi extravaganza, and clearly the standard against which all other Star Trek features must be measured.
0848801571|5.0|Childhood's End should never be allowed to go out of print.  <br />And certain of his short stories: &quot;Expedition To Earth,&quot; &quot;Rescue Party,&quot; &quot;Superiority.&quot; <br />I have a few disconnected statements to say about this book. I assume you have read it. If you have not  yet read it, go find a copy and sit down and  don't get up until you have finished  the last page.<br />The whole idea of spaceships hovering in gigantic stillness over the cities was a gift of the imagination triggered by Clarke's descriptions in this novel. That vision has now besome a visual cliche in the movies.<BR> <BR>The very title, Childhood's End,  carries so much importance in communicating Clarke's  vision of the next leap in human evolution. Man will  become a mental/spiritual being without a body. He will become like God.<br />When Karellen allows Stormgren to see him as he exits  the room behind the one way mirror, Stormgren sees an image that echoes through the past and the future. <br />To suggest that a future event  is so staggering in importance that it becomes an ancient myth of the human race;  that that future event is able to travel backward in time to become a common memory - is a philosophical thought of the highest order.<br />When the dreams begin, it is also the beginning of the end of childhood. Dreaming is actually a form of traveling. You go to different worlds that are unlike the world you see everyday. Dreams are real travel.<br />Whenever I hear Neil Young singing about being in a burnt-out basement, seeing the silver ships coming out of the sky, and lamenting that the loading had begun - this sends shivers through me. The imagery is from Childhood's End.<br />Childhood's End is a must read philosophical novel. It is more that science fiction.
B0000640RX|5.0|No matter how many times i watch these movies, it just seems that i would never get bored of them. Rambo is going to always be a meomorable character. The good work came from the People who made this astonishing action hero especially David Morrel, for he is the one who had written the first story &quot;First Blodd&quot;.
0805062971|4.0|I liked this book for a lot of reasons and on a lot of levels.  It has a quick and loose flow to the story, much like the current array of slasher novels that are so popular (and which I also like).  It also makes you think both while you're reading the book and long after you've finished it, much like most of the classics.  It's not one of the all-time greats, but it does make you think on a lot of levels you probably have thought on before.  It tests your perspective on the retail intensive world and culture we live in and more than once, it makes you reassess your values and priorities.  If you have a narrow-minded view of the world around you and are afraid to challenge your current perspective and personal philosophies, you will not like this book.
B00006690G|5.0|This is Eminems best work. His outragious style and lyrics display a side of us we all have. This Album is a must.
B00005Q3TZ|4.0|It's hard to imagine anyone chocking more material about the making of a major motion picture onto a series of discs (this has 3 separate commentary tracks for review, and they're all worthy of the time).<br />It's also hard to imagine how this cut -- the director's version -- was hacked down to what was shown theatrically.  Granted, not everything brought back to life was absolutely necessary to advance the story, and there are still some great ... um ... er ... interpretations of what happened throughout the Doolittle Raid.  Alec Baldwin, despite a handful of additional screen time, is still unconvincing as the legendary Jimmy Doolittle, but (thankfully) Dan Ackroyd's and Jon Voigt's additional screen time are welcome additions.  There's certainly more tension in the build-up toward the attack, and there's a wealth of additional battle scenes (one of them nearly entirely reconstructed to bring out a different focus) that make the discs worth the investment.<br />While PEARL was dealt a fairly critical lashing for its self-indulgence, Director Michael Bay takes a baby step toward redemption in this Vista Series addition, but what still misses the mark is the love triangle.  Like a bad 60's love story, it just didn't compute.  Perhaps if the script had provided more substance to Kate Beckingsale's character or a stronger motivation for her falling so easily into Danny (Josh Hartnett) for comfort, the situation might not have seemed so forced, so engineered.<br />But, despite its flaws, a restored PEARL is a wonderfully crafted World War II epic whose newly envisioned battle sequences (much of the footage reinserted into this cut) compete artistically with those from SAVING PRIVATE RYAN in at least the &quot;emotional aftershock department.&quot;<br />... and the extras.<br />Wow.<br />Hours and hours and hours to go.
B00005QG9J|5.0|The new INCUBUS album is awsome.Has rock-on melodies and a killer DJ(DJ Killmore;)If u want hard rock with some slower songs, BUY THIS ALBUM, IT ROCKS!!!!!!
B00005R2M3|3.0|read the title anyway nothing too exciting here just another pop diva in the britney-christina tradition trying to cash in.
6305313687|5.0|After watching Fight Club I noticed Edward Norton is such a great actor. So I picked up American History X because he's in it and that kid from Terminator II is in there too. Edward Norton's acting is very cool, and the only problem is edward furlong, he's too  whiny looking and should be replaced by a more hardass looking kid. <BR>     Some parts of the movie can be disturbing and sometimes emotional. Overall it's a great movie.
B00005RFAI|3.0|the best way to describe this is to look at it from an evolutionizingh point of view pink just wanna try other things besides the cute pop sound ya'll should be glad cause lots of musiclovers are getting tired of the pop diva formula that rules trl, pink deserves more props for experimenting new sounds.
B000000W6F|4.0|If you like how the Pumpkins sound now or during some of their other releases, it is vital that you see where they came from. It's less polished than their other albums but it still reminds me a tad of Siamese Dream. The songs in Siamese Dream seem a little more calculated and the songs in Gish seems more free flowing and wild. Jimmy Chamberlin is given free reign on the drums and uses it to its full potential. I have to say that Snail is my favorite. There are other great songs but I think the main thing to get out of this album is to enjoy Smashing Pumpkins raw and free beginnings. <BR>One of these days I'm going to listen to all of their albums in a row because I think that they all kind of transition into the next one.
B000003C4K|5.0|Let me just say that this album rocks!  This is pure no-frills thrash with incredibly funny lyrics.  Since this album came out in the mid-80s, there are numerous references to Satan, looting and pillaging, and, of course, legions and other medieval references.  That is definitely the charm of this album and basically 80s metal.  No suits or lawyers were involved in the metal scene at the time and the result is no holds barred thrash that kicks ...!
B00004TRD8|5.0|Well, Arnold's film Terminator 2 still manages to amaze! 10 years after its theatrical release, the film's ultimate edition DVD is more amazing than the movie. It is hands down, the best DVD a person can own.  For starters, the case comes in a metalic shield, which is a cool bit decoation.  But the real beauty lies in the content of the disc.  For starters, a movie like this really capitalizes the full potential of DVDs. Its crisp sound and sharp image give the film more depth and you appreciate it on a different level. Films that are great because of their great writing and acting aren't really enhanced by DVD...seeing Humphrey say \\"All the bars in this world\\" is not more interesting on DVD...but Terminator 2...WOW!<BR>   <BR>The real meat and potatoes of this DVD, however, lie in the extra material you get. For starters, the menus are absolutely amazing! They are almost mini-scenes that are completely new, but are so sharp, they could have been used in the movie.  All the documentaries are great and let you appreciate the amount of work, time, and energy that went into the film.  Its always fun to hear about the film from Cameron and Arnold themselves.  These featurettes aren't 2 to 6 minutes either.  They have a lot of content and are very interesting.<br />You are also given the choice of seeing the movie WITH ITS DELETED SCENES placed in! Theres even an alternate ending.  Its a great DVD and has, so far, been unsurpassed for its content and presentation.  This is the paramount of my or anyone's DVD collection.  A must have!
B00000DHZJ|5.0|I experienced Hendrix and Holy s%#t; I purchased the guitar tabliture book not long after I bought this album.  As a guitar player, I have a new found respect for Hendrix.  I've always know he was a great guitar player, but I didn't really come to my senses until I tryed to play along with some of the songs and I just couldn't.  And not only did the guy play a mean guitar, he wrote some amazing songs too.  This is a must-have for every single human on the face of the earth.
B0000024LN|5.0|After listening to Redman's first two album you will be amazed at how consistent and good Reggie Noble is. Could he bring that same effort into his third album. Yes, he creates another album that is so good that it sparks a difficult debate about which of his first three albums is the best. Really there is no correct answer as Redman establishes himself as one of the most consistent and best emcees ever in the history of hip-hop. His crazy, no nonsense, and hysterically funny lyrics continue to flow endlessly throughout his third album. Redman has the ability to do and say whatever he wants without sacrificing any credibility. The production on this album is outstanding as the majority of it is produced by Erick Sermon. Redman has become a really good producer as he produces eight songs on this album (many of the skits). This would not be a Redman album without surprises along the way. The skits again continue to be hilarious and the track listing lists 23 songs, while the CD contains 20 songs, so the listener gets to sort out which song is which as some skits appear after the song, rather than taking up a whole song as suggested on the back cover.<BR>The album starts off with \\"Iz He 4 Real\\" and \\"Rock Da Spot\\" both great P-Funk songs. The latter contains a nice Notorious B.I.G. sample. This is a reoccurring theme on the album as Erick Sermon uses outstanding samples. \\"Pick It Up\\" is a really funky song where Redman really shows off his lyrical ability:<BR>(\\"Your whole vocabulary's played out, admit it<BR>Still wack if it came out my mouth and I spit it<BR>You remind me of school on a Sunday<BR>No class\\"). <BR>\\"Whateva Man\\" is a solid song, featuring the outstanding Erick Sermon. \\"Do What You Feel\\" produced by Pras has a Wu-Tang vibe to it. The song features Method Man and this is the best song these two have made together next to \\"How High\\". \\"Creepin'\\" has a funky bass beat by Redman. \\"It's Like That\\" features K-Solo and his deep voice perfectly matches with the beat that has a bass line that hits hard. Like all Redman albums the third part in the \\"Soopaman Luva\\" series is on here. It is extremely funny as usual and shows Redman's superior creativity over other artists. \\"Rollin'\\" samples \\"Microphone Fiend\\" by Erik B. and Rakim and Redman uses it well as this song is crazy. \\"Da Ill Out\\" features the always entertaining Keith Murray and is a good way to end the album.<BR>Like all Redman albums no review can say enough about his albums. His lyrics are extremely underrated as he is very clever. He always has outstanding production with Erick Sermon behind the boards. This album will definitely satisfy all Redman fans and if you have not heard Redman before than this album is definitely worth getting as there is no one like him out there.
B00005QDW5|5.0|This album gets 5 stars simply because of &quot;The Fletcher Memorial Home.&quot;  I heard it for the first time on this album and it freaked me out.  What a song!  I also like Bike: I wish I had a mouse who didn't have a house and I called him Gerald.  The lesser know stuff adds a whole different dimention to the album.  Although it doesn't flow like a typical Pink Floyd album, it still has great music: it's as simple as that.
B000002B1M|4.0|When Nas released \\"It Was Written\\" it was in a difficult place as it was the follow up to \\"Illmatic\\". Does this album follow the magic in \\"Illmatic\\"? No. Is it a good album? Yes! Therein lies the problem, as this is a good album, but it is not a classic like the latter. So by most Nas was to be considered as falling off, when rather he should be considered as still making a good album (just not as good as his last). <BR>Where \\"Illmatic\\" started off with a great intro, \\"It Was Written\\" has a horrible intro that should have been left off. \\"The Message\\" has a nice beat, followed by Nas' masterful lyrical ability. \\"Street Dreams\\" seems like a very odd song to be hearing from Nas after his last album. However, once one realizes and accepts that Nas is growing and changing as an artist then this song can be appreciated. \\"I Gave You Power\\" produced by DJ Premier is the best song on the album. Nas creates an amazing story as he tells the life story of a gun. This song is incredibly impressive. \\"Watch Dem N-----\\" has a funky beat and Nas once again shows his lyrical superiority. On \\"Nas Is Coming\\" you can see that Nas sounds great over Dr. Dre's beats, however it also shows that he sounds much better with Premier. \\"Affirmative Action\\" is the lead into The Firm album as it features AZ, Cormega, and Foxy Brown. \\"Black Girl Lost\\" shows Nas' ability to speak on important topics. \\"Shootouts\\" has a simply amazing beat and this is one of the albums highlights. \\"If I Ruled The World\\" is a clever song from Nas, but again shows the transformation from Nasty Nas to Nas Escobar. <BR>The production on this album is very consistent and all flows together very well as no beats seem out of place. However the production is technically very different and nowhere near as good as on \\"Illmatic\\". Nas also raps in a much more relaxed style, rather than the vicious, fast-paced flow he brought on \\"Illmatic\\". If you have not bought any previous Nas albums before, you should try listening to his albums, but I would not buy this one first. This is his fourth best album, as \\"Illmatic\\", \\"Stillmatic\\", and \\"I Am...\\" are all better than this one. However if you are a Nas fan and want more Nas music to listen to you definitely should get this album.
0312265859|4.0|a great song title but alas so true. i laughed as much this time out as the other 7 but sometime it was a sad laugh. waiting in line for 9. maybe that will be the next title.lol
B00005NWM3|1.0|Nickleback is without one of the worst bands in current history. All of there is music is very repetitive, it all sounds the same. In addition to this the songs are very poorly written. The guitar rifts are just the same three powercords. The lead singer(whatever his name is) cant sing... They should release this album five times, but with a different cover, and Nickelback fans could not tell the difference.  And to top it all of Nickelback is mainstream, so you hear this junk non-stop. It all points down the same ally, they want money, so dont bie this, because if you do your helping them out.<BR>They should change there name to MoneyBack, because if you ever bie this thats what you will want.
B00005QHSN|4.0|no matter what Name He is calling Himself these Days one thing is for certain the Guy Can Sing/Sang&Write a Song like nobody's Business.when I see all the Neo-Soul Acts& a Lenny Kravitz,Seal&others I can't help but wonder where TTD fits in overall?? this Guy was Huge for a while back in the day.for a Minute it Looked like He might Challenge Michael Jackson&Prince as The Man that could Blend R&B&Pop really well.this Album is a Combination of His Last Few Albums.the downsides are His up-dated Beats on some of the tracks.\\"Shalom\\" is my Cut it combines Elements of 70's Steive Wonder Meets Steely Dan&it works.TTD paid the Price for expressing how He thought of Himself&that is truly a Shame because He has been Slept on.The Man Is one of the Most Important Artists that The World it seems has forgotten.and like the ALbum title He truly lives up to that.
B000062TU1|5.0|Unless you've been living under a rock for the past 3 years or so, you know that Harry Potter has taken the world by storm, and the movie, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, continues on with the array of what-not adding to the craze.  <br />In case you don't know the story of Harry Potter, here is the plot in short--Harry Potter was sent to live with his aunt, uncle, and cousin (The Dursleys) after his parents were killed by the dark Lord Voldemort.  Harry has no idea that he is a wizard or even the details surrounding his mother and fathers' death until Hagrid, the keeper of keys at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, shows up to bring Harry to the school and tell him of his past.  I won't ruin the end of the movie or the conclusion for you, so see the movie to find out what happens to Harry and what he encounters along the way ; )<br />This movie was truly brilliant--it stayed very true to the book, only leaving a few parts out that weren't vital to the plot of the story.  Plus, with all of the events and detail in the book, the movie did a wonderful job of making sure that even people who didn't read the book would understand the story and not get confused.  Buy this movie, see it, rent it, read the book--whatever you have to do to get a taste of Harry Potter, do it.  This movie will not leave you disappointed.  A great film for the young, old, and the young at heart.
B00005B36H|5.0|The CD lateralus has had a lot of good and bad press. It seems that most of the tool fans that like tool because of there hard core guitar riffs and building tension in there music felt betraid and rightfully so, I guess but I think most tool fans listen to tool for there artistic vision (at least I do). I think there is a high percentage of thinkers that listen to tool and those people will not be dissapointed!!
B00005OAIE|4.0|If you are looking for Sgt Peppers or Dark Side of the Moon, look elsewhere.  If you like popish light rock with fanciful lyrics and immensely hummable tunes John Mayer should be right up your alley.<BR>Some of the songs on this album do have a habit of sticking in my brain. I have found myself humming No Such Thing and Your Body is a Wonderland while walking down hallways hours after pressing the eject button in the car that morning.  <BR>The musicianship is passable and I find Mayer's voice interesting and appropriate to the material.  I do wonder why he chose the slightly irritating falsetto while &quot;screaming at the top of his lungs&quot; on the roof of that high school, but it does work as a way for people to ask for the song in record shops.  (I wonder how annoying the refrain is from less talented crooners in the aisles of Sam Goody?  :-)  )<BR>It's worth checking out and if he can get through the fatal sophomore album unscathed I think we may have a future star in John Mayer.
B000000WHX|3.0|I guess if you have to choose some modern music that doesn't completely ... then Massive Attack is a good choice. Some very cool sounds(aside from the hip hop influence). The more soulful songs are the real gems here. Pretty soon someone is going to be brave enough to make music similar to this without the scratching and rapping and we'll finally have a truly new alternative music form. Until that time Massive Attack does a nice job mixing styles without sounding too run of the mill.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Can you identify with that wonderful and personal feeling you have when you connect to a piece of art?  Something that just makes sense to you and there's no point in trying to explain it?  This is art for your ears. This is Amnesiac to me.  Put your headphones on... relax in your own way... and just listen.  Then listen again.
B00005NWM3|1.0|Nevermind Nickelback, I want my [money] back that I shelled out for this. More of the same sound that is dominating modern music today. It's boring, forgettable and extemely uncreative. I guess it's pretty cool if your 12 years old but nobody with any music sense is taking this stuff seriously.
B00004SZWD|5.0|A masterpiece. But I like the previous lp a little more. Need I say more. Anyone that doesn't have this cd is not interested in music.
B00005Y228|4.0|Kylie Minogue has created an amazing dance album. In my book that earns her 4 stars. Though the songs sometimes lack quality lyrics, the beats and music create an atmosphere the makes this album truely one of a kind. I'm not a huge fan of dance pop so i subtracted one star for personal taste. Some of the standout tracks are &quot;Fever&quot;, &quot;Love at First Sight&quot; and &quot;Dancefloor&quot;. For those of you who haven't heard these songs I now offer you a breakdown of each song:<br />1) More, More, More- I was watching some show on VH1 about disco music and heard this song. It's a remake of a huge hit from the 1970's. Kylie's version sounds better than the original. It has a super disco beat and is a very enjoyable song.<br />2) Love At First Sight- Kylie's current single. I originally bought this CD and only listened to her first single but this song got me to explore the whole album. This is a super song. It makes a person feel happy and hope that you will find love at first sight.<br />3) Can't Get You Out of My Head- no matter how hard I try I can't get this song out of my head. At first I thought it was stupid and annoying but it just grew on me. I had to have this album. The song is an infectious mix of synthesized pop and kylie's unique vocals.<br />4) Fever- sounds like a slow song but gradually becomes something that is totally danceable. One of the stronger lyrical songs on this album. I recommend this to anyone that is crushing on someone. It makes you realize that everyone experiences the same feelings.<br />5) Give It To Me- This song is a bit to much Britney for me, but just like Britney you begin to really like this song. It's like a faster tempo &quot;I'm A Slave 4 U&quot;. It's generally an enjoyable song.<br />6) Fragile- It is like a ballad that is placed on top of some fast beats. It is a pretty song but would have been better if it was just a ballad. This is the weakest of the songs but it is still better than most dance pop i've heard lately.<br />7) Come Into My World- Another addictive song. The beginning sounds like Madonna's &quot;Ray of Light&quot; but the song changes after that. The chorus sounds a little haunting. I think it's a great mix of everything that they decided to put into this song. My only recommendation is that you listen to this song.<br />8) In Your Eyes- This song has a beat that will stick with you forever. I bet this will be a huge hit on dancefloors. It follows in the tradition of the rest of this album, a danceable song that sounds different from the rest of the songs out right now.<br />9) Dancefloor- I have this song on repeat. It's a short song that leaves you wanting more everytime it ends. This is the standout song of the album. I hope that this is released as a single because it is excellent.<br />10) Love Affair- another great dance song. Has a disco feel to it as well. It has very pretty lyrics and Kylie's voice turns this into what could be a huge hit. The chorus is a description of a love affair and it well written. Very danceable.<br />11) Your Love- Very similar to the previous song but with a slightly different feel. Is prettier sounding than lots of dance songs which rely on beats while this song relies more on vocals and there is even some use of guitars in this song.<br />12) Burning Up- starts a slow song for about thirty seconds and then she says &quot;I'm burning up&quot; a zillion times and then it goes slow again and fast again. This is the trend for the song. It sounds terrible when I describe it but it actually sounds really good.<br />Basically this is a dance pop CD. If you like dance pop you'll love this CD, if not you might enjoy it anyways. A lot of people I know like this CD that you would think would hate it but it's really popular.d lately.<br />7) Come Into My World- Another addictive song.

B000063V8R|5.0|&quot;The Best of Both Worlds Pt. 1&quot; &amp; &quot;Yesterday's Enterprise&quot;...'Nuff said!
0790736918|5.0|There are moments in this film that are just about as perfect as anything as you will find in cinema, moments that display John Ford functioning at his highest level as a filmmaker.  For instance, there is a precious moment in which a woman is affectionately stroking the coat of her brother-in-law, who has just turned up after a long absence.  She is unaware that someone else, played by Ward Bond, can and at first does see her.  But the moment is far too personal, and Bond resolutely averts his eyes and refuses to see what ought not to be seen by anyone.  Another such instance is the final shot of the film (which I can't describe in detail without giving away the plot).  As the family retreats into the house, another character is framed outside the house (as if to exclude him), isolated from the family.  It is a heartbreaking shot.  The shot was also a homage to the late Harry Carey, in that the character in the frame holds his arm across his chest to hold the top of his opposite arm above the elbow, a gesture that anyone from that time period would associate with Carey.<br />This great John Ford film comes very close to being the greatest Western ever made.  In fact, with two slight alterations, it almost certainly would have been.  For some reason, Ford in some of his films suffered from unaccountable lapses in casting.  In this one, in the crucial role of Martin Pawley, he cast Jeffrey Hunter.  In many ways, Hunter mars the film with his often-grating performance.  One can only lament what the film could have been with someone like Montgomery Cliff in the same role.  The other odd decision was the elevation of Ken Curtis's role as Vera Miles other suitor.  Curtis, a former big band crooner who was later best known as \\"Festus\\" on GUNSMOKE, has several scenes that tend to bring down the overall quality of the film, especially a fight scene at a wedding with Jeffrey Hunter.<br />But these are aberrations in what is otherwise a masterpiece of the highest order.  I am not a big John Wayne fan, but Wayne was not just never better than he was in this film:  it is impossible to imagine anyone playing the central role of Ethan Edwards better than Wayne does.  He brings a grimness and tenacity and monomania that gives the movie much of its force and tension.  And although Hunter and Curtis both mar the film, most of the cast is spectacular.  Sometimes it seems as if Ward Bond were in every other film made in the thirties, forties, and fifties, but he was never better than he was in the role of Reverend Captain Samuel Johnson Clayton, both minister and police depending upon the need at the time.  And Hank Worden is memorable as \\"Old Mose,\\" the more than a little crazed old fool who provides some of the films more memorable moments.  For instance, with the Rangers entrenched on one side of a river, bracing to meet an onrushing group of Indians, Mose suddenly shouts out, \\"Oh Lord, for what we are about to receive, we thank thee.\\"<br />They key to the film, however, apart from Ford, lies in the performance of John Wayne.  This is not the simplistic Indian killer or fighter you see in most of Wayne's films.  In this one, he is a man who has seen and suffered too much.  Ironically, he is chasing a rogue Indian chief named Scar, so-called because of a scar running down the side of his face.  But Ethan is far more scarred than the Indian is.  And as his hunt for Debbie, who has been abducted by Indians, turns from weeks into months into years, he correspondingly becomes more and more obsessed, to the point of near insanity.  Indeed, much of the tension of the last part of the film comes from the distrust of Ethan's sanity on the part of Martin (Jeffrey Hunter).  The scene where Ethan finally determines the fate of Debbie is one of the great moments in cinema.<br />This is just a great film by one of the great masters of the American cinema with the greatest performance by one of our most famous stars.  If that isn't enough to make someone unfamiliar with this film to see it, I don't know what would be.unfamiliar with this film to see it, I don't know what would be.
6301966015|5.0|this edition of BLOW UP . . .    1. . . .while certain to offend some viewers, fails to include the missing eight minutes of footage Antonioni finally relented and removed back in '66. This was necessary to release the film in the US (you think we have censorship now, well, we had it back then, too.) The VHS doesnt include this footage, either.     2. If we are lucky, Criterion will release their own, director-approved and signed edition ( as they did with Sjoman's CURIOUS (yellow.)    3. BLOWUP has never been perfect, but it has always been excellent. Any imperfect pacing issues are really irrelevant. The director ventured to make this film unforgettable to viewers, as this film is in part about perception. Remember Antonioni's adage: \\" I like to look at an image with the camera, until another message comes through. . .\\"    4. Lack of familiarity with Antonioni's other films may hinder your appreciation of BLOWUP. Unlike his other films, BLOWUP was a commercial success. It was termed the first art film viewed in America by more than 400 people. It made alot of money, and people were known to wait an hour in the rain just to see it back in '66. However, his less well-known efforts bear the masters'touch, and are emblematic of mature and intelligence, not just 'existentialism' or what not. Watch them. They reinforce any grasp of BLOWUP.    5. If you think this film wasn't important or influential, guess again. Many films wear the impact of BLOWUP in their atmospheres.    6. For those who hunt deeply for interpretation, remember that Antonioni explains BLOWUP in part by saying, he intentionally made the film so loose-ended and ambiguous, that anyone could read anything they wanted into it. Perhaps this explains some dimension of the endurance, popularity, and influence of BLOWUP.    7. BLOWUP, like Antonioni's other films, need to be seen more than once to get alot out of them. A half-dozen viewings is recommended. Then opinionate.    8. Finally: in the middle of my researches, I was fortunate enough to find this quote :    \\"I have just seen Antonioni's BLOW UP. These Italian directors are about a century ahead of me in terms of technique. What have I been doing all this time?\\"                             -- Alfred Hitchcock, 1966    .... any questions?    (If THIS doesn't get you to finally watch Antonioni's classic, I don't know what will.)
B00005JKJA|5.0|God I loved this movie!  David Lynch isn't for everyone.  If you want your movies to \\"make sense,\\" move on.  His films feel both natural and heavily stylized at the same time, and if someone doesn't care for a mildly artificial treatment of things, they will not like this movie.  Myself, I like heavy stylization if it is done well.  And in my book, Lynch does it very, very well indeed.<br />David Lynch is, in many ways, the last great master of surrealism.  Many of his moments seem to be tied to everyday reality, but instead reveal a different, stranger reality under girding our perceptions.  As behooves a true surrealist, this comes out in many odd and strange moments.  For instance, the two main female characters go to a club, and a woman there comes out and sings Roy Orbison's \\"Crying\\" . . . only, in Spanish.  Yet, we discover that she isn't singing at all, despite all the tears she engenders in our two heroines.  It is all a recording.  And at the end of the song, one of the two pulls a bizarre, square cube out of her purse, which we hadn't seen before, and which she evidently hadn't seen before, either.  That is on the micro level.  On the macro level, the film is even more surreal, but I couldn't explain that without given away a great deal of the plot.  One of the themes of the original surrealists was that truth is revealed in dreams.  And MUHOLLAND DRIVE functions not like nothing so much as a dream.<br />One of the things that stands out about this film is Lynch's very, very strange sense of humor.  The humor is sharp, but almost always in what would normally be considered highly inappropriate moments.  For instance, there is a very strange scene in which a character murders a person, and then tries to fake it as a suicide, but manages to botch it so badly that he ends up killing others as well.  But what is paramount in the scene is not the killing of additional individuals, but the hysterically funny way in which things keep going wrong.  Mass murders shouldn't (and, in real life, aren't), but I found myself shrieking with laughter in the entire scene, all the way up to the moment when the killer \\"murders\\" a vacuum cleaner.  Or when a character, suffering from amnesia, goes through her own purse in hopes of discovering who she is, encounters one thick stack of one hundred dollar bills after another.  Or, Billy Ray Cyrus, in a small part, after having had sex with another man's wife, explaining morality to the man after he has caught him with his wife.  Or (how's this for product placement), when Naomi Watts is departing for a movie audition, she calls out to \\"Rita\\", \\"Don't drink all the Coke.\\"<br />Some have commented on how good the acting is, but I find that hard to understand.  On one level, the acting is utterly dreadful.  One example is Naomi Watts when she first comes into her aunt's apartment.  She walks about it, with this absurdly open-eyed wonderment and delight at everything that she sees.  I suspect the badness of the acting in the scene isn't her fault.  Instead, I think it is an intentional effect requested by David Lynch.  Indeed, I suspect that most of the really bad acting in the movie is more a result of the particular style demanded by Lynch than by innate inability on the part of the actors and actresses.<br />As the opening credits were playing, one name I noticed was \\"Ann Miller,\\" and I thought to myself, \\"Just like the great tap dancer from the thirties and forties.\\"  Well, it WAS the great tap dancer from the thirties and forties!  Ann Miller was easily one of the two or three great female dancers from Hollywood's Golden Age, and it was really exciting to see her in a small role here as \\"Coco,\\" the manager of the apartment complex.  How marvelous that she is in this movie!  Tragically, musicals went out of style and Ann Miller's career was cut tragically short (her last major role previous to this was 1953's KISS ME KATE), when she was only 30 years old.  That was far too young to have a talent of her caliber to be cut short.alent of her caliber to be cut short.
B00005QDW1|2.0|I gave this rating a 2-star because there are still some good tracks in this song such as \\"Hey Baby\\", \\"Hella Good\\" and \\"Underneath it All\\", but other than that all the other songs are really not that good to listen to.<br />Some of the songs are really annoying such as \\"Detective\\" and \\"Platinum Blonde Life\\". After listening to their previous albums such as \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" and \\"Return To Saturn\\", this cd seemed like a get down for the fans. Songs like \\"Just a Girl\\", \\"Don't Speak\\", \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" were classics compared to the songs in this album! This album is more of pop than rock, which doesnt suit them very well.<br />So, listen to this album only of you are a die'hard No Doubt fan, otherwise your not missing much!
B000063S6Z|5.0|Got to say...this isn't the most innovative CD on the block.  So What?  It's got melody to kill for..and decent sound quality to boot.  Come on, crank it up, and you will love it!  Lordy don't leave me, all by myself!!!<BR>(Moby, where do you find this stuff????)
B00005Y228|5.0|Although I have listened to a lot of songs of Kylie before this album released, such as Confide in Me, Some Kind Of Bliss, Locomotion, and Spinning Around and even liked them, I never considered buying any of her albums then. Then, one day, I finally bought her new album &quot;Fever&quot; and I LOVED listening to all the tracks in the album!!<br />The album starts off with the groovy disco track &quot;More More More&quot;, and continues with inspiring dico tracks such as &quot;Can't Get You Out Of My Head&quot; ( which was the only single to hit #1 in the U.S charts! ), &quot;Fever&quot; ( kinda slow but very catchy ), &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;, &quot;Dancefloor&quot;, &quot;Fragile&quot;, and &quot;Come Into My World&quot;.<br />All in all, whether you are a Kylie fan or not, if you like listening to pop or   disco songs, then listen to this album and you will be singing the songs for months!
B00005NP04|5.0|What can I say, I just love Martina! Ever since I heard 'Independence Day' on the radio for the first time years ago, I was immediately captivated by the passion, beauty, and power of this little lady (she's just over 5 feet tall) with a big voice! And since then, she has only gotten better. Even for those who are not crazy about country music, you really don't have to be to appreciate Martina! Martina's music goes far beyond traditional country (the word 'twang' does not apply here, at all!). Over the last few years, Martina has actually been dipping her toes into Faith Hill territory, as far as the evolution of her music is concerned. Both Faith and Shania Twain have opened many doors, and Martina seems to be walking through them. This album is excellent because it not only collects all of her best songs (accept 'Be that way' from \\"Evolution,\\" which is missing here) and shows how much Martina has grown from the early 90's to just a year ago. The songs come from 5 of her 6 studio albums (there are no songs on this disc from her 1992 debut album) starting with her 2nd album \\"The Way that I Am\\" all the way to brand new songs which close this 19-track compliation. Personally, I think Martina is one of the best vocalists on the planet, and the powerful, emotional 'Whatever you say' proves this more than any other song. 'Blessed' 'Where would you be' 'Concrete Angel' and 'When God Fearin' Women Get the Blues' are really just teases until Martina's next all-new studio album. I'm left wanting more than just 4 new songs! Martina's blends contemporary country with blues, pop, and rock with class and ease. Long time and new fans will love this album from start to finish.
B000065V1V|5.0|&quot;Heathen&quot; is an all-around amazing album. But I will say that if you only like one or two of David Bowie's albums, and aren't really a Bowie fan, then you probably won't like it, since this album is sort of quintessential Bowie.  (One consequence of Bowie's huge range of musical styles is that certain albums which are different from everything else he's done--such as &quot;Outside&quot;--have picked up some fans who are only fans of that album and disparage all his other work.)  <BR>  Most actual Bowie fans will adore this album, since it's a mixture of many of his older sounds (for example, &quot;Slip Away&quot; sounds almost like a sequel to&quot;Life on Mars&quot;), so it feels very familiar, while having a completely new sound as well. The cover songs are fantastic (one little note about the covers: I think people might appreciate the rather goofy song &quot;Gemini Spacecraft&quot; better if they heard the even goofier original version by Legendary Stardust Cowboy... this song is NOT meant to be taken seriously!!).  However, I think Bowie's own songs are the best on the album. &quot;I Would Be Your Slave&quot; and &quot;5:15 the Angels Have Gone&quot; are stunningly beautiful-- they are two of my favorite Bowie songs ever, which is saying a lot. My other favorite songs on the album are &quot;Afraid&quot;, &quot;Everyone Says Hi&quot; and &quot;Heathen (the Rays)&quot;. &quot;Sunday&quot; has been the the most challenging song for me; it's slow and meanders in an almost classical-music kind of way, and bored me a little at first, but I love it now. There is no bad song on the album, and every song is completely different, so there is something for everyone (everyone who is a Bowie fan anyway), or for any mood you find yourself in. <BR>  The edition with the bonus CD is definitely worth getting. Moby's mix of &quot;Sunday&quot; is even better than the original, Air does a great remix of &quot;Better Future&quot;, there is a rocking version of &quot;Panicin Detroit&quot;, and I've always loved &quot;Conversation Piece&quot; (a B-side from Space Oddity) so I was happy to hear him do the new rendition of it, which I think is really lovely.
B00004XONN|5.0|There are few albums that have touched me as deeply as this album.  I do realize that this review was written years after the album was released, and that a true review is supposed to be ones first impression of the album.  Nevertheless, i had no first impression of this album, I was at a complete loss of words, which if you know me does not happen that often.  So i will give my impressions now.  <br />This album is a thing of beauty, a work of genius, something that could only be made through experience and heartache.  First of all, the very first note of the very first song, countinues to win me over every single time I hear it.  As i continue to listen to this work of art, i feel Thome York as he sings, which seems to be effortless, take me on a jouney through his eyes.  The thing about his voice is that to me, it sounds like he opens his mouth and pours out his soul.  I have always believed that music is an expression of ones self, and today too many people take the easy way out to sell a couple CD's.  Radiohead does not, they have something to say and a message to tell and they express it the best way they know how to.  Id you are thinking about buying this CD, listen to it that listen to it again, and sooner or later it will Click and you will understand it.  But for those who want the instant gratification, buy a Creed album.
B0000640VO|5.0|I don't know, but after seeing \\"Amelie\\", I just suddenly had this overwhelming craving for strawberries with cream.  The stylized imagery of \\"Amelie\\" is simply delicious and lush, from the opening credits to the end.  It is nothing like real life; it is reality that could only happen in film. And only in film as only the French could do it.  <br />Wide-eyed Audrey Tautou is wonderful as Amelie in this storybook-like story.  Amelie is a 23-year-old waitress working in a Paris cafe, but she might as well be Madeline, that popular little denizen of Paris, for all her mischief and her child-like eagerness to make things right for other people.  A very unlikely story for a very jaded world. But director Jean-Pierre Jeunet is a genius for pulling it off , and the score by Yanni Tiersen is a gem ( a must-buy--just listening to it conjures images of Paris sidewalks and cafes).  <br />See \\"Amelie\\", and helplessly fall in love.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne - Vocals- Evan Taubenfeld -Guitars-Matthew Brann -Drums-Marck Spicoluk - Bass.<BR>Avril Lavigne is Gifted with a mature voice at the young age of 17, she tough herself to play guitar. Her music is a mix of pop rock and soft punk rock some might compare to Alanis Morisette. She write the lyric to her songs about her feelings. She is very Original and I would recommend this CD to those sick of Britney Spears.
0767817664|5.0|It staggers me now that when I first saw this movie in the cinema upon initial release back in 1985 I was actually disappointed!  I was 15 then and guess I expected gore and deaths every 5 minutes in place of say a plot, acting, character development, etc...  Since then I have seen the film over 20 times, purchased the poster, soundtrack and the film both on VHS and DVD (not many extras on the DVD version, unfortunately)  This film has great acting by all leads, but Stephen Geoffreys as \\"Evil Ed\\" steals the show - my favourite quote is when William Ragsdale and Amanda Bearse are resigned to defeat by vampires and \\"Evil Ed\\" remarks \\"Then we'd have vampires taking over the whole town (looks out window) - not that it'd be much of a loss...\\"  Great score by Brad Fiedel (\\"The Terminator\\") and attention to detail - smash cut camerawork and great flying effects.  This is an ideal horror movie to show anyone uninitiated in the genre - couple it with \\"The Lost Boys\\".  The sequel is also worth watching (once).

B0000062Y2|5.0|my parents took me to see that movie in the theatre when i was young. i loved it then i love it now.
B00003CXI0|5.0|Very good movie!  Better than I'd expected, considering that it's impossible to cram a long book into a two-hour movie.  They did a very good job following the book as closely as they could.  Oh, dear little Harry is soooo cute!  I love how nice and thick his eyebrows are and I liked how his snub-nosed, wide-eyed, bespectacled face was so changeable and showed his loveable character clearly.  Wow, I was sooo glad he got away from those awful Dursleys; he needed that break.  I love how fantasy was blended in with reality, esp. the way it included issues of today's preteens.  Harry's unassuming humility is endearing; the scene where Hagrid brings him into a Dickenson-like dim cafe to get into Diagon Alley and everyone turns to look at him is sooo funny!  Once Harry starts to realize how famous he is, he can't stop blushing and his thick brows go up several notches, then he asks Hagrid in a bewildered voice, \\"Why am I famous?\\"  Harry's so funny!  The scene where Hagrid is telling him about Voldemort and his folks' death is interesting; when Hagrid mentions Voldemort, Harry looks over his shoulder nervously as if he expects the evil wizard to materialize behind him and I got the feeling he was getting goose bumps just hearing about Voldemort.  I think it's neat that Harry befriends outgoing, gregarious Ron and talkative, logical Hermione.  Harry's the quiet one of the group and around him, Hermione and Ron chatter on, bicker sometimes and socialize. Good thing Harry has them because along comes snobby Draco Malfoy to give him a hard time.  I like how Harry, even though rather shy and sensitive, had the courage to stand up to Malfoy and was not about to butter him up just to be popular.  The X-mas scene where Harry gets the gift from his parents, it's touching how surprised he is; Harry's eyes widen and he says, \\"I've got presents...?\\" when Ron points at his gift.  A really moving scene was when Harry discovers the Mirror Of Eisle and sees his parents.  Boy, does he almost cry!  For a long minute, I really thought he was going to dissolve into tears right there in the chamber in front of the mirror; I could just see the tears beginning to form in his eyes and his thick brows twitch.  I liked the Quidditch game; it was funny the way Harry watched the other players from his broom and his giveaway face reveals his disgust at the Slytherin players' dirty little tricks.  I laughed when he nearly swallows the snitch and the announcer thinks he's about to throw up!  It was so funny!<br />Another really beautiful aspect of the film which made me cheer inside was that there are roughly and equal number of boys AND girls represented as both students and Quidditch players and women fairly represented as some of the teachers as well; the film and book didn't fall into the old tired trap of tokenism masquerading as \\"progress\\" like the Star Wars films did.  I was also pleased to hear the Ginny Weasley is going to become more significant in future films and books.  It's about high time we recognize that females make up a little over half of our world and they play just as important parts as males do.  Best of all, Harry himself doesn't have the attitude of girls as the \\"other species\\" or any sexist attitudes the way too many boy characters in too many other stories do.<br />Another thing to commend is that the movie is not violent; Harry gets bruised some and his hand is burned during his confrontation with Voldemort, but otherwise, there's no violence here.  Way to go, J.K. Rowlings!!!ost cry!

B000066NW0|5.0|Some might immediately dismiss Avril Lavigne's debut album as pop-princess fluff, but that's not quite the case. Lavigne's hard-driving guitar, in-your-face lyrics, and unique voice are a recipe for a great album. The radio-friendly \\"Complicated\\" is an obvious highlight, but additional gems are the slow building, frustrated \\"Losing Grip\\", and the sassy \\"Sk8er Boi.\\" My personal favorite is \\"I'm With You,\\" a ghostly ode to loneliness and longing. If Lavigne can keep it up and maintain her unique, shameless sense of self and active role as songwriter I think she'll have a good career ahead of her.
B00005LMBK|5.0|Probably the most definitive part about the album is the mood itself - very chill, relaxing. Even the hip-hop elements which can sometimes tend to be agressive here are very laid back. Such is exhibited in Del's or Russell's delivery - and does any male vocalist have a more relaxing voice than Damon Albarn now adays. (little side note - check out some of Blur's stuff, very good). However, while these above elements are nice, this is Dan The Automator's finest hour. The beats are crafty and shifting, unlike redundant monotonous ones found on most rap and r&amp;b records. Very bassline dominated, yet very multidimensional. Dr. Octagon, Handsome Boy Modeling School, Deltron 3030, and now this. Not only do you get CD, but you also get special access on the Gorillaz website - pretty damn cool. A highly underrated collaboration that I would not mind hearing more from. Buy this album for it's well-roundness, attention to detail, and most importantly - mood.
6300214370|4.0|This movie is about a boy who moves into a small town which has been on the silence of dance and parties since the time a boy was killed in an accident which shook the town, and blamed it on the drinking and drugs at the parties, dances that young people caused. Once ayoung man (Kevin) arrives in the god for saken dump (as he calls it) he notices the problems that the place has and decides to bring the dance he has long waited for to city hall. It is a problem due to that the hall has banned it, and so it takes off from there. I liked it and would recommend it to you people.
0380789019|5.0|Neverwhere\\" by Neil Gaiman is a strangr and dark fantasy that departs from today's typical sword and sorcery novel. What I enjoyed in Gaiman's novel is the alternate universe that he creates. Travelling his world of tunnels and passageways you pass through areas that are full of strange creatures and even stranger people. The story revolves around Richard Mayhew, a corporate slave from Scotland living in London, and who's life is little more than mundane routine. On one fateful night, he stops to help an injured girl who would soon plunge Richard into a world of mystery, magic, and evil. It's rare to find a book full of wit and originality, so Neverwhere comes as a very welcome surprise. Indeed, the world of Neverwhere sits below London frozen in time...and covered in filth. Gaiman paints a very rich world and keeps his story telling basic and simple. If fantasy is your thing and you are looking for something a little bit different I recommend \\"Neverwhere\\".<BR> <BR>Also a rarity that took me by surprise is the price of Immortality. The complex plot and descriptive detail kept me turning page after page until it was finished. I highly recommend that you read it.
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie is the first foreign movie among those I have watched which I think is great. A funny, dramatic and romantic plot. The storyline is not complicated but still very gripping. Excellent photography and film shots. The colors used throughout the whole movie are incredible, making it just like an art film. It is the kind of movie that you want to sit down, relax and watch with your lover. If you haven't watched this movie in the theater, be sure you don't miss it on video.
B000003NA4|3.0|This will be third cd for me to purchase of D.K. So far I have liked each cd. There have been no major disappointments yet.<br />There seems to be mixed emotions about Di's voice. Some seem to<BR>really like it and while others say it is booring. My opinion is that it fits the jazz mold. Usually jazz doesn't require an operatic voice. One that is real crystal clear and always on key. Most jazz singers are people that sing about their hard knocks of life. Most have lived through rough times and tell us about these times through their songs. That's why they have a lot of sorrow and hurt in their voices.<br />As far as this cd goes, it offers a pretty good repertiore. It could have been possibly better, but it will do. I will say if the repertoire would have been a little better, I would have had no choice but to give a better rating for this cd. The repertoire was the only reservation I had about this cd.<br />I would like to recommend this cd. It is worth your purchse price.
B000003TAW|5.0|Simply put: Weezer's self-titled debut LP, affectionately referred to by fans as &quot;The Blue Album,&quot; is one of the greatest rock albums of the past decade. Although I am far more infatuated with Weezer's follow-up release, &quot;Pinkerton,&quot; it's hard to ignore the sheer wonder of &quot;Weezer.&quot; Blending surf-rock riffs reminiscient of the Beach Boy instrumentation with undeniably catchy melodies and often times quirky lyrics (see, &quot;Undone - The Sweater Song&quot;), Weezer managed to produce a CD that could appeal to everyone. I've heard children barely out of first grade talking about it; my parents have stated, &quot;This is pretty good. Who is it?&quot;; and even the Deftones, known for their heavy metal anthems like, &quot;My Own Summer (Shove It), praise Weezer at every opportunity and cover many of the songs from this CD at their live concerts. And you know what, the tatooed and pierced fans at the Deftones concerts go absolutewly crazy (in a good way) when the Deftones cover a Weezer song at a concert. Now that's what I call mass appeal!  <br />1. My Name Is Jonas: Although the general theme behind the CD can be interpreted as hard rock meets the Beach Boys, the opening track does not actually fit into this category. Instead, it's a thoughtful, punk rock anthem about starting over (from what I can tell at least). <br />2. No One Else: You know how radio-friendly songs are created with hooks, which are designed to draw people into the songs, or make people hum the songs in the shower? Well, to be perfectly honest, I have yet to find that sort of device in &quot;No One Else.&quot; Ironically, I'm beginning to wonder if the lack of hook is the hook .... Anyway, &quot;No One Else&quot; is about how Rivers Cuomo, the lead singer and lead guitarist, wants &quot;A girl who will laugh for no one else.&quot; Pop punkish with a faint taste of surf.<br />3. The World Has Turned and Left Me Here: Almost a perfect song. It's basically about how a girlfriend leaving you can feel like the world has turned its back on you. Beatiful.<br />4. Buddy Holly: Everybody's heard this song! If you haven't, sheesh! Unbelievably catchy pop punk.<br />5. Undone (The Sweater Song): Hands down the most creative and ingenious hit rock single in years. The song uses a sweater as a relationship for God's sakes! So much fun to sing along to.<br />6. Surf Wax America: Appeals to the head-banger and surfer dude (or dudett) in all of us. Nowadays I don't think teens will rebel against authority by going surfing, but if it comes to that, &quot;Surf Wax America&quot; will be the rebel anthem.<br />7. Say It Ain't So: After hearing &quot;Buddy Holly&quot; and &quot;Undone (The Sweater Song&quot; one too many times, some music critics claimed that Weezer's lyrics were childish and irrelevant. &quot;Say It Ain't So,&quot; a song about a boy's dealings with alcohol, and the third single off &quot;Weezer,&quot; proved them wrong.<br />8. In the Garage: THE #1 geek anthem of all time. Another great song to sing along to.<br />9. Holiday: A throwback to that carefree Beach Boy state of mind. Surf rock, baby!<br />10. Only In Dreams: When most teens think of dramatic and/or climactic endings to CD's, this is the one they think of first. It's an album closer of epic preportions, or maybe it just seems that way to us geeks ;)
0380820846|5.0|Another great book from J. Quinn. I was almost afraid to get my hopes up, as this is #4 in a series (and many series do not age well). However, I think this is the best one yet!<br />This is the fourth book in the Bridgerton series, starring Colin Bridgerton. Julia Quinn does a very good job of making each of the hero/heroine pairs have their own personalities, and doesn't just make them cookie cutter copies of the heros/heroines of previous books. In this episode, Colin is searching for some meaning to his life, rather than just stay rich and idle. Penelope (who has loved him since she was 16) has a very good handle on what is meaningful in life, which draws Colin to this woman he has known, and ignored, for much of his life. <br />This book is a great read, fun, and really lets the characters fall in love and grow, without the cliche &quot;big misunderstanding&quot;.
B00000JGHM|5.0|This is an excellent movie.  Al Pacino and Robert De Niro are excellent counterparts.  The bank robbing scene is one of the most intense scenes I have ever seen.<br />As usual, Michael Mann's cimetography sets the mood of the movie. The acting is excellent.  Dialog between De Niro and Pacino is classic.  This is a must have DVD.  Should be one of the first ones you purchase if buying your first DVD player.<br />The only negative of the DVD is there is no bonus material, but don't let that keep you from purchasing this movie.
0804102988|5.0|This overview of English history, full of characters to love and hate, begins with the earliest settling of the Salisbury Plain by primitive hunters and farmers. As civilization develops and flourishes, so the story, evolving into a saga of five families who shape and are shaped by the events of this bit of the British historical story.<br />The creation of Stonehenge will invade your imagination. Christianity comes and the Salisbury Cathedral is a result. Lives and loves of men and women with their triumphs and disappointments evolve against the parade of ages -- kings and their wars and kingdoms, plagues, revolutions, until we get to Queen Victoria and an age that developed faster than ever. The reader gets the impression of a snowball rolling downhill -- time begins with few people and slower development but one bit of progress inspires 30 more and on it goes, bigger and faster ad infinitum.<br />Rutherford's research is thorough but it doesn't impede his story. With narrative under strict control, his style is clear, descriptive and tight. Relationships wax and wane through the generations as families grow and change with the times.<br />Rutherford has said about this book that he admires James Michener and deliberately set out to accomplish for England what Michener did for Hawaii, Texas and others. I think he did it better.
B00005JKQX|5.0|Ron Howard does an excellent job of \\"telling\\" a story about a brilliant man who suffers mental illness.  Ron Howard delivers a story.  I really enjoyed the film.  I believe Russell deserved the Academy Award.  Sorry Denzel, I think Russell truly did a fine acting job (can't disagree with the selection of Halle Berry).  <br />I felt for John Nash and at times wanted to believe that his delusions were real rather than in his mind.<br />One of the best films of the year.
0140186409|5.0|The Grapes of Wrath is in my mind the best american novel ever written. I began by liking the movie and then read the book. Important deatales are left out of the movie and they should be featured. This book shows the struggle of a family unaceppted everywhere they go. It shows the prejudices felt by people just because they are different and don't know the way of life in California. It is a wonderful book and everyone should read it.
6302779278|5.0|Kevin Costner stars as a stoic ex-FBI agent who becomes the bodyguard for rock diva/good Mom Whitney Houston. He finds her lifestyle a bit much at first, but thanks to her cute son, he starts to like her (a definite no-no in the bodyguarding business). Someone is trying to kill her and there are very some intense moments as the stalker gets very close. But who hired the killer? That's the real question.<br /><br />Whitney has a perfect voice and she sings many memorable songs. You'll rock to \\"Queen of the Night,\\" and could there be a more bittersweet lovesong than \\"I Will Always Love You\\"? Their one romantic encounter is much too brief, but the chemistry is palpable. He's icy, she's hot; what a combination. Costner and Whitney are very sexy and also quite vulnerable. Credit goes to the excellent script as well as the stars' talent. This is a real chick flick: it's got romance, action, suspense, music, and a two gorgeous stars.
0060090367|5.0|Having already read LAST CHANCE SALOON and LUCY SULLIVAN IS GETTING MARRIED, I continue to be thrilled at the biting edge of dark humor Marian Keyes brings to chick lit.  She lifts these books up from a banal girl-looking-for-guy novel and gives then something more, namely unforgettable characters the reader truly comes to care about.<br />Who could be more vulnerable than Claire whose husband James tells her on the day she gives birth to their first-born that he is leaving her for another woman in their apartment building?  Thus begins Claire's often sad, often comical, but always interesting saga.  She grabs her newborn and flies from London to the safe harbor of her parents home in Dublin.  There we meet her hilarious mother and father as well as two of her four sisters:  the self-involved Helen and the lovably flakey Anna.  (Guess Rachel was busy starring in RACHEL'S HOLDIAY and MAGGIE was caught up in her story as told in ANGELS.)  The Walsh family is not a model family, but it is one that you'll love being a part of --- the fights, the squabbles, the sisterly ritual of stealing clothes from one another, the tension amidst the camaraderie, the freezer with frozen food and the mother's aversion to home-cooked meals---all make Claire's stay less than peaceful.<br />Will she ever come to terms with what has happened to her?  Can she pull herself up from her quagmire of despair over losing James?  Can she be a fit and loving mother to Kate?  Will she stop toying with the idea of stealing her sister's boyfriend and just go ahead and do it?  Will Claire come to her senses and tell James off for good or will she go back to him?<br />Claire will steal your heart as her easy, conversational tone speaks to you just as she would to her best friend, in a breezy, self-deprecating style that keeps you eagerly turning the pages.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne - Vocals- Evan Taubenfeld -Guitars-Matthew Brann -Drums-Marck Spicoluk - Bass.<BR>Avril Lavigne is Gifted with a mature voice at the young age of 17, she tough herself to play guitar. Her music is a mix of pop rock and soft punk rock some might compare to Alanis Morisette. She write the lyric to her songs about her feelings. She is very Original and I would recommend this CD to those sick of Britney Spears.
B0000640VN|4.0|This is a very cute feel good kind of movie. Meg Ryan shine's in her prefomance of Kate and Hugh Jackman is just beautiful as Leopold. Although you shouldnt expect a story line that's compeletly new and different, as with most romantic comedies there will be a sence of deja vu, this film is still worth seeing. Even men are enjoying Kate And Leopold because of it's brilliant comedy! Watch this one for sure, it's not to be missed!
B00005B23A|5.0|True Lies is a really good movie. I'm not a big Arnold Schwarzenegger fan, but I loved the movie. Some parts are really fun. I also never really thought of Grant Heslov killing people. This movie is better than the other one I like. I like the movie called Dante's Peak, but I like True Lies is better. The actors can be funny and sometimes really serious.
B00005O5CM|5.0|Not that I am comparing the two films in anyway, both are entirely different stories but from the same genera. I could watch this film every day if I had to, that's how enjoyable it was. It's funny, witty, and smart!<BR>Reese Witherspoon delivers probably her best preformance ever as Elle Woods, so good infact if you've never seen her act before, you wouldn't know where Reese Begins and Elle Ends!<BR>This movie is one of the best of the year, and totally worth seeing, everyone I've met has thoroughly enjoyed this one and watched it at the least twice! Get it! The DVD has so many extra's as well, that it's almost worth buying JUST for the extra's!
B000065U1N|4.0|If you've ever wonder what someone looks like when they are blown apart by a rocket, this is a good dipiction. The movie itself is excellent, they kept very true to the actual events upon which the movie was based, however it is quite gory. Josh Hartnett was excellent in Pearl Harbor but he really tops himself in Black Hawk Down! Aside from the blood and guts, which to all men, the majority of your girlfriends and wives will not appreciate~some however don't mind~this movie is really worth seeing, to those who are not weak stomached of corse! Buy it, watch it, enjoy it!
B00005JKNC|4.0|I have never been a huge Jim Carey fan, in fact the only reason I watched this movie is because it was the only one out I hadn't seen. Turn's out I might just have been wrong about Jim Carey, his preformance in this film was outstanding! It turns out the man can actually act he's just had junk roles before now! The movie itself is beautifully done, from the set's to the acting to the cinematography I can't say enough good things about this one! <BR>I must say this film was completely underrated, it's 110 percent better then most of the Oscar movies this year! The plot is compelling and unpredictable and totally moving. You'll be missing out if you don't check this one out!
B000062TU1|1.0|This film was brilliant and surprisingly good, but make sure you get the widescreen edition, otherwise you are missing a lot, and I mean a lot of visuals. I've seen both versions and the full screen and widescreen editions, and the full screen is so very not worth it.<BR>The film itself, although it's target audience is kids 8-12 was a shock to me, I didn't believe for one minute I would enjoy it and I really did. Check out the movie, but be SURE TO GET THE WIDESCREEN version, otherwise you are just ripping your self off 30 percent of the picture!
B000066AXE|2.0|Although this was a fairly decent film, and Russell Crowe's preformance surpasses all before, it's certianly not the best movie ever made, let alone the best of the year. It's quite long and slow, and it moves along at the pace of a very large turtle. Again it was decent although I got bored after the first couple hours and shut it off, it really wasn't Oscar worthy.<BR>On a side note, if you do want this movie, I would suggest going with the widescreen version, who want's full screen? You lose thirty percent on the sides this way.
B00003CXI1|4.0|Usually when a film get's all the publicity and hype this one did it turns out dissappointing, especially when it's a children's movie. I can honestly say I didn't expect much out of it, I know the books are meant for kids which didn't help my opinion. Now I am secretly anticipating the second film.<BR>Although the target audience is 8years plus, I strongly feel that people of all ages will, and have been enjoying this film immensly. Be sure to get the widescreen version however, in the full screen, you are really missing a lot of visuals!
B00005QG9J|5.0|I first caught on to Incubus a few years ago when I saw the video for &quot;Stellar&quot; on MTV. The track was off &quot;Make Yourself&quot;, which I had not heard at that point. I downloaded the song off the internet and began to love their sound. Then &quot;Drive&quot; hit the airways and I knew this band was for real. I bought &quot;Make Yourself&quot; and enjoyed most of the songs on the CD. While I'm more into the acoustic sounds of Dave Matthews, Counting Crows, and such, I really began to relate Incubus to such harder sounds as Smashing Pumpkins and Red Hot Chili Peppers, who I also like.<br />The more I listened to &quot;Make Yourself&quot; I found more and more songs that I liked, such as &quot;The Warmth&quot;, &quot;I Miss You&quot;, and &quot;Pardon Me&quot;. Then I heard their new single &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; from their new CD &quot;Morning View&quot;. While I wasn't all that impressed with the chorus of their first single...&quot;and in this moment I am happy, happy...&quot;, I bought the CD with high hopes. <br />&quot;Morning View&quot; has become one of my top ten favorite CDs in my personal collection (250 + CDs). Their newer single &quot;Warning&quot; continues to grow on me the more I listen to it. This is one of those rare CDs that you can actually listen to from track one through track thirteen. There's so much variety in this CD, from slower tunes as &quot;Just A Phase&quot;, &quot;Mexico&quot;, and &quot;Aqueous Transmission&quot; (the most unique and relaxing song), to the harder tunes of &quot;Circles&quot;, &quot;Blood On The Ground&quot;, and &quot;Nice To Know You&quot;. Several other favorites are &quot;11 am&quot; and &quot;Are You In&quot;.<br />I've heard others say that they cannot listen to this CD repeatedly, but I disagree. I even since saw Incubus in concert within the past 3 weeks, but I still listen to the CD all the time. What's so good about Incubus is that they combine the acoustic-soft sounds and hard-metal sounds with awesome background sounds (the guy on the turn-tables is awesome) and background vocals. The Smashing Pumpkins were once my favorite band of all time. But Incubus relaxes the high-pitched, screeching vocals of Billy Corgan with more melodic sounds and basically better sounding music. This is a great CD--spend some cash; you won't regret it.
0944379044|5.0|One must have a strong stomach, as well as a lot of time to pay attention to Hitler's musings, to be able to sit and read this book cover to cover. This book is obviously an important book that should be in every bookshelf of a student of history, but that doesn't make it readable. Hitler's statements about the Jews and other things such as Lebensraum are well known in other secondary sources, the value of Mein Kampf is to be able to read them in their own convoluted badly written context.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I saw this new Hayao Miyazaki film in Tokyo December 2001.  It comes out on DVD in Japan (area 2) July 2002.  US will have to wait until 20 September 2002 for our (Area 1) DVD release.<BR>    For fans of Hayao Miyazaki \\"the Walt Disney of Japan\\", They will love the film, and I am sure the transfer from film to DVD will be of the highest quality as  Princess <BR>Mononoke, Grave of The Fireflies, and Lupin 3: Castle of Calistro were mastered.
B000063S6Z|1.0|I've been a fan of Moby. As everyone knows, his best album is Play, which I was able to get with the Play B-Sides.<br />However this latest release I would expect he would be creative enough to introduce new music into this techno/midi instrument world of ours. What do I find, like I'm listening to another bonus disc of Play - call it the C-side if you will. Nothing has changed. Tweak a few tempo, change the vocalist and title and a new song is born. Very disappointing. Don't get me wrong. This disc could have been appreciated along with the release of Play. But has Moby's creative juices finally ran out?  I'm afraid so.<br />Just listen to the song they chose to initially peg for airplay, \\"We are all made of<br />Stars\\".  The vocals are bland.  There is no effort in singing the lyrics.  The music video's attraction are the cameo appearances of Hollywood stars, not the song.  I don't mean to put Moby down, but this artist needs a wake-up call on his music.  There are fans, and there are fanatics.  Fanatics accept whatever their idols produce.  What I'm after is quality music and the growth of the artist, not their stagnation.<br />Moby, for inspiration, look at artists like Dirty Vegas, DJ Tiesto and Weekend Players. They are relatively newer artists that have slow and fast tracks to keep you interested all throughout the album.
B000002UAX|5.0|This album is the greatest album the Beatles ever released. Many are quick to extinguish that claim due to the apparent tension in the group during that particular time, with Ringo even quitting the band for two weeks. They say that it is not a group effort, but solo works from each member all placed on the same record. I'd like to think of it as an incredible study of each beatle's individual talent. More is revealed about the beatles in the white album than any other album they created. The sense of individuality in the songs adds to the incredible feeling of darkness this album has. In my search for an album that evokes even a quarter of as much depressed emotion as this album can evoke i have come up empty, because this album is the crowning achievment. Songs on this album that are prime examples of great darkness include: happiness is a warm gun, helter skelter, yer blues, cry baby cry, don't pass me by, sexy sadie, long long long, and while my guitar gently weeps. Revolution 9 is stunning. Bungalow Bill and Piggies are massive statements. Blackbird, Dear Prudence, and Julia are just plain beautiful pieces of music. Birthday, Everybodys got something to hide, and back in the USSR are rock classics. Savoy Truffle, Rocky Raccoon, Martha My Dear, Honey Pie, Obla di obla da, and why don't we do it in the road? are catchy, fun masterpieces of melody. Songs released in this time period but not included on the album such as Hey Jude, Old Brown Shoe, the single version of Revolution, Lady Madonna, and The Inner Light are all incredible works either in a melodic hit song sense or a deep statement sense. Everything on this album is shocking, stunning, awesome, pioneering and pure genius that could never ever be duplicated.
B000002N3N|5.0|This is one of my absolute favorite Enya CD's. Watermark is also great. I also like in a similar way the CD's by Enya's sister and Genie Nilsson's Whisper.
0440219078|5.0|I read this book in 8 grade, now I am going to go to the high-school! Anyway, I think that everyone should read this book, it actually makes you think. If you like reading books that suprise you, then you won't be dissapointed in this one. It's very suprising!<br />The only thing that I didn't like was about this book was the ending, it's very confusing and sad (I think). All in all, this is a GREAT book, and you should read it!<br />That's all, I hope this review helped you.
B000066NW0|5.0|This CD is the best ever. Every girl who has broken up with a boyfriend or have been broken up with should get this CD. Every song is good!
6302968143|5.0|This movie is such a nice fantasy. To me it seemed more like a comedy, especially funny was Bette Midler! I also liked the song the blond \\"Witch\\" sang. They are so funny. I think this is a movie worth watching because it's funny and it has a great story line that it follows. The beggining of the movie was kind of sad but the rest of it is so funny. (Why did the \\"Witches\\" have to die?)
6305144176|4.0|Like his roles in \\"Dead Poet's Society\\" and \\"Patch Adams,\\" Robin Williams plays the role of a man trying persistenly to enlighten and help others in spite of a stubborn and wrong status quo and authority figures.  He is undoubtedly funnier here than in either of those two movies.  <br />Adrian Croener's lively, upbeat, and hilarious radio show contrasts with the monotone, boring, and mundane show of the other DJ.  Right from the start, his superiors at the radio station treat him like dirt for no good reason at all.  One of them replaces him on the radio for a short time and while he thought he was funny, the only funny thing about his show was that he thought he was funny.      Among the humor on his show are things like voice impersonations, saying Nixon sounds like Mr. Ed the horse, creating guest voices in the studio, and my favorite- playing a tape he was forced to play of a conversation with Nixon.  He played it allright, but he interrupted segments of it with questions directed at Nixon, followed by his taped response to another question.  For example, one of the parts went somethign like this: Nixon was saying, \\"I'm very unsatisfied with it, there's a lack of feeling there,\\" and before it he interrupted the tape and asked, \\"How is your sex life?\\"  <br />In the studio, Adrian sees the news coming in and that it must be \\"approved\\" before it is read on the air to the soldiers in Vietnam.  The things that are struck out are bits of news that point to a long, hard, and losing war ahead.  He wants the soldiers to be aware of these things, reasoning that freedom of speech is what America is all about.  He finally has \\"had it\\" with the resistance when a restaurant is blown up which he was in just a minute before.  So he gives up on the radio, but the masses make plain his extraordinary popularity and he gets back on.  <br />In the ending, Adrian is forced to relocate because he was friends with a boy who turned out to be the enemy.  This highlights a point he made earlier-- how do you know where or who the enemy is?  Angry, he chased down the boy and asked him what the hell.  The boy explained that it is not the communists but the Americans who are the enemy of Vietnam.  He tearfully yells about his family members who have been killed by American troops.  This incident highlights the point of the movie that American involvement in Vietnam was wrong.<br />The conclusion of the movie is that although Adrian was stuck in a troubled, bad situation, he made the most of it, managing to do good and remain uncorrupted.
0767903862|5.0|In looking for something to read during a rather stressful finals week, I took the recommendation of a friend and picked up Bryson's &quot;In A Sunburned Country&quot;.  Not only did it turn out to be a wonderfully light read, but it filled me so full of legitimately interesting Australia trivia that I'm torn between wanting to go there and trying to find my way onto an all-Australia version of Jeopardy.<br />Bryson does an impressive job of detailing the entire country through a series of four trips between 1997 and 2000 that cover all the Australian states and provinces except Tasmania.  In the process he visits everything from the famous (including events like the 200 Sydney Olympics) to the incredibly obscure and gives more than equal weight to the biological curiosities of the island (which go much further than simply marsupials and the Great Barrier Reef).  Through this he has done extensive historical research and takes us through such bizarre events as Harold Holt, the Prime Minister in 1967 who dived into the surf one day on vacation and was never seen again.  In his honor, the people of Canberra (the capital) named the municipal swimming pool after him.  He discusses how Aum Shinrikyo (the cult behind the Sarin Tokyo gas attack) may or may not have set off the world's first nongovernmental nuclear explosion in a desolate corner of the Outback - for some reason, it's never been investigated.  He takes an in-depth look at Australian cricket matches and the general bizarreness of Australian politics.  Even with all of this wonderfully witty Australian history and the numerous biology lessons, he still finds time to visit every major city on the continent.<br />If there are any flaws to be found in his book, it is perhaps in the way he leaves his discussions of the Aborigines hanging as he ends it.  He spends a fair amount of time discussing the intense difficulties in Caucasian-Aboriginal relations over the last two hundred years and finds much to be unhappyabout.  He takes a serious (if brief) look at the cultural prejudice inherent even today in the Australian culture, but he ultimately ends with shaking his head and noting that he doesn't see an answer either.  While glad to see the subject addressed, I found the scope of his discussion disappointing.  Admittedly, a travelogue may not necessarily be the best place for this discussion, but to get so far into the discussion and then abandon it seemed unfortunate.<br />Nonetheless, this doesn't interfere with my enthusiasm for the book as a whole and I am at least glad to see the topic tackled somewhat substantively.  This book is simply wonderful from cover to cover.  It makes great summer reading, great waiting-room reading, great reading for when you're stressed out or just plain great reading period.  Having read this one, I'm now going to have to take a look at his other works.  I may have to take a look at visiting Australia sometime, too...
0670888656|3.0|This book provides a great read considering how few pages it is. The plot itself is entertaining, at least the first time you read it.  It's a compelling mystery that is finally solved as the clues are put together.  Subsequent readings proved to be more bland, as I already knew the solution of the mystery, which is a big part of the book.  Reading about the ending may spoil it for you, but I think it will still be worth your time to read about it unfolding for yourself.<br />Dr. Jekyll is a rich, respected doctor who nonetheless has needs within himself that are socially unacceptable.  He indulges in this part of him, Mr. Hyde, by taking a drug he devised.  This way, he can attempt to satisfy these desires while still being able to come back to being the respected Dr. Jekyll.  Eventually, the sickness of Mr. Hyde grows to be too much for Jekyll to take, so he decides to do away with Hyde.  However, we see that those desires and his enjoyment of Hyde aren't totally gone, because he keeps a place and everything for Hyde.  Eventually, Jekyll mutates into Hyde against his will, without even taking the drug, and this marks the beginning of the end of Dr. Jekyll.    <br />Hyde is a symbol of anti-social desires within us, the \\"Id\\" as Freud called it.  Hyde can also symbolize an addiction, avarice, hatred, or any other vice.  Hyde is a thing that people may discover and try to play with behind closed doors (Mr. \\"Hide\\").  The lesson is that we can't play with the animal nature of ourselves without becoming that animal, as the difference between Hyde and Jekyll grew blurrier throughout the book until there almost was no difference.  It eventually can take control over us and no longer stay hidden.  Similar themes are found in \\"Frankenstein.\\"
B000002UAO|5.0|This is the most satisfying album The Beatles created, I think. There is not a dud track. The album features killer melodic bass lines, amazing vocal harmony, great tunes, and interesting lyrics.<br />The songs have great hooks, and interesting introductions. Drive My Car still rocks, as does the final track Run For Your Life.<br />This is the third album in a row with a Rockabilly/Country influence discernible on some tracks, but here only on What Goes On, so perfectly suited to Ringo.<br />Most songs have great vocal harmony parts. I especially admire:<br />Nowhere Man<br />Michelle<br />In My Life<br />You Won't See Me<br />and<br />If I Needed Someone<br />George Harrison's input is an important ingredient. His sitar contribution to Norwegian Wood [which continues a little of the style of You've Got To Hide Your Love Away] gives the song an interesting feel, and his songs Think For Yourself and If I Needed Someone show his development as a composer.<br />McCartney plays some amazing bass lines on several tracks, including:<br />Nowhere Man<br />Think For Yourself and<br />Michelle.<br />An outstanding album. Maybe their best.
630445838X|2.0|I'd say this is one of Williams' worst movies.  He's not funny at all here, although the movie does have some mild humor here and there.  Unlike his other movies, there is really no moral to story, meaning that the plot is ultimately pointless.  <br />The movie begins in the 1860's when two kids bury some locked chest.  Then, a boy discovers it on a construction site and pulls it out, discovering a board game inside called Jumanji.  He gets a girl to play with him and he is sucked into the board, reappearing like 20 years later, saying and looking like he had been living in a jungle most of his life.  Unfortunately, with him also came undesirable things from Jumanji, such as monkeys taking over the town, stampeding elephants, disease, spiders the size of basketballs, and the like.  To end it all, they must finish the game, which means it's going to get worse before it gets better.  They end up finishing it alive (barely) and then they are back in time as kids right before he got sucked into the board.  So the two keep the secret to themselves since no one is aware anything happened and they'd never believe them anyway.  They also get married.  Awww, how cute.  So they rid themselves of the damned game of course but stupidly just set it in a creek to float away, instead of burning it (duh!).  So then in Japan or somewhere on the beach, two kids hear the African drumming coming out of the board ahead and they rush towards it in curiosity and delight at their finding.  Oh boy!  Maybe this means there will be sequel!  Then, we can learn where this game came from and how and why it does what it does.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Maybe because I'm a West Virginian there is something in me that is instinctively drawn to this sort of music. This is my first experience with bluegrass and the only reason I bought this cd was because I was bored with all of the emotionless and plastic pop,rock,country songs coming out now. I heard Man of Constant Sorrow on CMT, liked it, and decided to try out the CD. I was surprised by just how much I loved it! I've been listening to it over and over again, I don't think I've ever listened to a cd as repeatedly as I've listened to this one. One thing that I really love about the songs on here is that even though they are so simple yet they are full of meaning and deph and unlike most modern songs they are songs that anyone can identify with. The movie was okay but the soundtrack is a masterpiece! It makes me want to get in touch with my roots and learn more about old bluegrass/gospel/country music.<br />1.Po Lazarus- Besides the instrumentals, this and Lonesome Valley are the only songs on this cd that I don't really ever listen to. Po Lazarus is a real recording from the 1950s of a chain gang singing. Interesting, but it doesn't really make for great listening especially since the chopping sound is way too loud and drowns out the singing. <br />2.Big Rock Candy Mountain- Remember Shirley Temple singing this song? Well, this is a very very different version! The oldest recording on here (1928) it's about a paradise for hobos. It's not a big favorite of mine but I like it because it was recorded in the same era that most of the other songs came out of and adds a nice flavor to the album by using a real singer from that time period.<br />3.You Are My Sunshine- I LOVE this song, it's so catchy! I find myself singing it all the time, it's one of those songs that is really hard to get out of your head.<br />4.Down to the River to Pray- A real treasure. Alison Krauss's voice is so beautiful and spiritual in this song! <br />5. I am a Man of Constant Sorrow- Although my favorite version of this song is the fast version (track 16) I love this version too. <br />6. Hard Time Killing Floor Blues- Unlike the other songs on this cd which are mainly country/bluegrass/gospel, this is a blues song. It goes along well with the rest of the cd and is a very cool song.<br />7. I am a Man of Constant Sorrow(instrumental)- I hate to say this but I never listen to the instumentals. I wish that they would have put some more songs on this cd and left the two instrumentals off.<br />8. Keep on the Sunny Side- Another catchy, peppy song that you'll find yourself singing in the shower or humming at work.<br />9. I'll Fly Away- I really love this song. The vocals are lovely and the song has really meaningful and spiritual lyrics. Like many other songs on this album the lyrics are about death but deal with it in a very joyful way as an escape(unlike O Death) <br />10. Didn't Leave Nobody But the Baby- One of my favorite songs on this cd. The singing is very soulful and sexy, and there's a weird trippy feel to the whole song. The lyrics are really obscure though.<br />11. In the Highways- I really like this song although I'm not so fond of the kid's squeaky voices.<br />12. I am Weary (Let Me Rest)- This almost ties with Angel Band as being my top favorite song on this cd. It's such a beautiful, sad song. I love the lyrics: 'But now i shall slumber sweetly/ in a deep and lonely grave' Very sad and yet so poetic in a beautiful, simple way. Poignant and bittersweet.<br />13. A Man of Constant Sorrow- Another instumental.<br />14. O Death- O Death is a somber song about a man pleading death to spare him 'over to another year' I've heard that O Death is a really old song and was probably written during a time when people died young left and right (O Death please consider my age/Please don't take me at this stage) The lyrics are sad and almost frightening in their intensity: 'Death I come/To take the Soul/To Leave the Body and Leave it Cold/To Drop the Flesh off of the frame/The earth and worm both have a claim' Your average goth couldn't come up with a song about death this frightening! I love Ralph Stanley's singing and it really suits the song.<br />15. In the Jailhouse Now- A catchy, fun song, and I love the yodeling!<br />16. I am a Man of Constant Sorrow- The best version of this song in my opinion, and the reason I bought this album in the first place.<br />17. Indain War Whoop- An instrumental, but a fun one.<br />18.Lonesome Valley<br />19. Angel Band- MY TOP FAVORITE SONG ON THIS CD!!!!!! This has become my newest favorite song of all time and I've been scouring stores for Stanley Brothers cds ever since first hearing it. It's a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, spiritual song. I love the lyrics: 'My latest sun is sinking fast/my race is nearly won/my strongest trials now are past/my triumph has begun' and the imagery of an angel band bearing someone on their snow white wings to heaven is just beautiful. The singing is potent and inspirational, and the song is a lovely, haunting masterpiece.
B00005U122|5.0|After reading all the reviews about how great the concert is, I waited a very long time for it to finally arrive in New Zealand. Well, 7 months later it did and i am happy to say, it was well worth the wait. The camera work is amazing, the interactive menus are very well done, the sound qaulity is superb and, man this concert rocks. Plain and simple, it rocks. I wish that Roger had come to New Zealand as i know many people would have loved to see him perform. The guitarists do their work amazingly, the way the guys make those guitars sing, it brings a tear to a guys eye. :) I would tell any floyd fan, even if they dont like Roger Waters solo works, to buy this DVD, as the floyd classics are there and played brilliantly. Another thing that i like about it, as a learning guitar player, there are plenty of shots of the guitar playing and it is easy to slow the dvd down to note it and learn from it. Just sad about one thing and that there was no music from Roger Waters Radio Kaos album. they could have played the tide is turning or something like that. :( ah well, guess have to save that for the next tour eh.<BR>Enjoy this DVD and shine one everybody<BR>Scotty
B00005NW02|5.0|and made right! I've been in love with them them ever since the release of &quot;Chop Suey!&quot; on the radio. So pretty soon i downloaded &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Chop Suey!&quot; off the internet. Within two days I had heard it blaring nextdoor, so i hung out for like thirty minutes by a window listening. Then my brother got one of his friends to burn the cd. The lyrics are so smart, and the aggressive beats are aweosme. You cannot be system of a down no matter how hard you try. The driving guitars, the fast drummming, the good bass. It all comes together, and I think the fact that Serj (singer) is arabian really makes the singing interesting. Buy it! It might scare you if you like JImmy eat Wortld, hoobastank, incubus, linkin park, etc. No rocker should live without it. You dont know what ur missing.
B000001E3L|5.0|Will I am no expert in music. But I know what I hear and I sure know what I like. This is one of the best live performances that I have listened to. There is nothing to be said about Van Morrison that his fans do not know..<BR>But the arrangement the intensity of the music. The harmony that you can clearly identify in songs like it \\"is a man's man's world\\" is just tooo great<BR>Again we find John Lee Hooker  in this CD along with some great performers and musicians <BR>This CD is a must have. No matter what type of music you like you will love this CD
B00005QDW1|3.0|This Cd is alright - if you want to go to an insland for the summer! It took me completly by surprise. Gwen usually doesn't have this &quot;jamaican&quot; style to her songs but it seems this way on this Cd. I personly didn't like it, considering I'm a punk person and Gwen is usually the limit to my punk/pop music tastes. However I do recommend it to anyone who enjoys Gwen's funky styles of song writing and singing.
B00005YXZH|4.0|While I don't think this album lives up to their AM album from a few years back .... it is definately worth buying if you are a Wilco fan or if you want to simply listen to an excellent recording.  You must give it a chance though!! One litening of the album may not cut the mustard for some who are unfamilar with Wilco or similar bands (For some reason this recording reminds me of the Beta Band).
B00003CXI1|1.0|Okay, everyone's read the book, loved it, can't wait for the next 17... and so on. So someone decides to make a movie. The only reason I can see to make the film they made is to make money. Doesn't anyone care about making a good movie? There is absolutely no artisitc talent in here besides J.K. Rowlings. Someone just read the book, typed in the dialogue, and found some rich millionaire to fund their movie. I see these people gushing over how Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Widescreen Edition) stayed so close to the book. This movie didn't deserve to be made. I read the books, I liked them, but what I was really hoping for was something different, someone's else's interpretation of the book. But that wouldn't make money, would it? Three-fourths of the country would attack Chris Columbus whining and complaining that they have read each of the books 10 million times backwards and that the movie should have beem EXACTLY like the book because these people have the IQ of a microwave and can't handle new plot lines. A note to the country: grow up. If anyone tries to give me this DVD, i'm burning  it.
B000066NW0|4.0|Wow, I heard Complicated and it got stuck so i had to buy the cd.  It's full of poppy goodness.  Sk8ter Boi isn't bad, all the songs are good. But I'm ashamed to admit I like this because, well most of my cds are punk.  I usually listen to this as some downtime inbetween the Misfits and Minor Threat.  So I like it, but hey people say i'm weird so don't always take what you hear from me.
B00005JL3A|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came into theaters.I thought it would be a bit cruddy because i didnt follow the same story line as the Resident-Evil video game.When i saw the entire movie I thought it was the best ever.I especially like Slipknot making music for it as well.The movie and games had similarities but I think this was the best ever made.And i hope that Constantin Films creates a Resident-Evil 2 because i have heard rumors of another movie and at the end of the movies you see milla walking out into the street and resident evil 2 the game takes place on the streets of Racoon City. This is all for now and i hope the little wish comes to be.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|This is a great CD! It has really beautiful music. I especially love the &quot;Concerning Hobbits,&quot; and &quot;The Breaking of the Fellowship&quot; songs! They are so cool! <BR>     It's a super CD!
6303022901|5.0|The movie The Joy Luck Club based on the novel of Amy Tan was a simply beautiful and uplifting treasure! The movie follows the origonal story well and doesn't try to add anything new in. This movie shows us both China and the relations between mothers and daughters. The movie is done mostly in flash back memories of a certain part in their life when everything was down hill. In these stories adventually you see how these clever people pulled through this rough period in their lives and survived. <BR>The Joy Luck Club also has a wonderful ending to it. I must say in the movie the ending was done much better than in the book. The movie had many parts better than the book. My reason for saying this is that the movie added more emotions, more strong feelings! It gave me a greater feeling and understanding for these charectors!<BR>So, now you know a little about this spectacular movie. Please don't miss out on owning this remarkable little treasure! Act now and buy it. You'll love it! I guarentee it!
B000002OMN|5.0|You know when you're little and you hear all these songs that you like but don't know who sings them or what they're called?  It was like that for me up until I was six and I heard &quot;I'd Do Anything For Love&quot; when it came out in '93.  I knew the whole title (meaning that I therefore knew half of the song!), and that Meat Loaf sung it, and, I loved it.  Even at that age, I knew it was a beautiful song, and it still is.  It's my absolute favourite song of all time, and nothing is going to change that.  My Mam also got Bat II on tape for Christmas, I think, and I can always remember seeing it on top of the video cabinet beside the stereo.<BR>I only heard it properly a couple of years later on the way to our caravan, and I realised that I'd already heard it, it all came back to me.<BR>I love the songs, I love the lyrics, I love the music...I basically love anything and everything on this album, especially nine years down the road when I'm able to understand them more.  It's a great follow up to Bat I, ignore the bad reviews, people.  It's brilliant!  So how about a Bat III?!
B00003CXXO|1.0|This movie A.I. was a total waste of time and a total waste of money both for the people that saw this movie and for the people that made it. Maybe I can save some of you your money. This movie A.I. is way too long at 2 1/2 hours and never gets a plot going. The story keeps changing drastically and you get lost and confused very easily that you might have to watch it hundreds of times to understand. Steven Spielberg should move on from science fiction because obviously this is not a genre that he is familar with! A huge dissapointment. 2 1/2 hours of worthless tiring garbage that belongs in the trash. So save yourself the money and your time. Get something better than A.I.!!!
630027120X|5.0|Where to begin... this is absolutely the best movie there is.  I wish I had had a chance to see this on the big screen.  From the very beginning- with a man tied to a wooden cross going over a waterfall- the cinematography is absolutely stunning, and is so throughout.  There is betrayal and redemption, but redemption found in a most unexpected way.  Robert De Niro is in his best role ever, I think, as a man who was evil and turns to the path of goodness under Iron's direction.  Jeremy Irons is the unwavering Jesuit priest, who maintains his faith through all evil.  The music is uplifting and powerful, and often it is the soulful-eyed natives who sing it- creating a strong image to be heard and felt.  For while De Niro has a personal, moral and religious struggle, and political struggle ensues over the right to all the visual treasures of waterfalls and rainforests shown in the film, it is the natives of South America who endure the most heroically of all.

6304385668|3.0|I would almost give it 4 stars, but there are some things which can't be excused.  First of all, if you are interested in Irish history- rent it.  Of course it will give you a biased viewpoint on Michael Collins- its hollywood.  But if you study Irish history, you will find that care went into this film from the details- notice the pin that Alan Rickman as Eamon De Valera wears to show he speaks and supports Irish/Gaelic language.  Real footage plays at the end (I won't give it away for you) with music that will make your heart swell whether you supported Collins or not.  From the very beginning, the movie has the feel of the times.  Excellent uniforms, costumes, scenery.  Great lines delivered by Rickman and Neeson.  Neeson and Rickman portray the parts of Collins and De Valera- in appearance, in mannerisms, in speech- excellently.  Stephen Reyes also gave an excellent performance, for however brief his part, he delivers a believable character.  Downfall- Julia Roberts, not entirely her fault though.  Her Irish accent (also attempted in &quot;Mary Reilly&quot;) made me cringe.  This movie should be about Ireland's struggle, not romance-caught-amidst-the-war.  Are we supposed to care about her choice between two men (and are we surprised that she chooses Collins?).  It doesn't blend in with the storyline well at all.  That's entertainment, I guess.  And there's one scene with Roberts, Neeson, a rose and a bed, which flashes between violence and then back to Robert's dialogue to her love.  It is one of the worst scenes in a movie I've ever seen.  I don't know whether to laugh through the melodrama or fast forward it.<br />Whatever your viewpoint on the war, this film can still be of benefit.  I am always happy to see any movie on Irish history and culture, and Michael Collins is a figure in it, like it or not.  The division between Collins and De Valera is well done by script and actors alike, and will give a better understanding of the main forces behind the strife in Northern Ireland to the present.e in Northern Ireland to the present.
B000002UUX|5.0|When I listen to early Metallica and early Megadeth I have to ask myself,who's copying who here? The lead guitars sound strikingly similar, Was Dave trying to copy Metallica and ride their coattails of success? After all,they threw him out(get this,for drinking,haha!Like they should talk).Or did they hire Kirk as a prototype replacement. At first it was hard to tell. By the time Mustaine hooked up with Friedman and Cliff died,it was evident who had the talent. Metallica sold out,Megadeth progressed(die hard Metallica fans may disagree).<BR>   Rust in Peace is the best album Megadeth came out with. I respected Dave for deviating from the formula that he had created,the galloping guitar riffs and soloing style which HE had invented along with Hetfield. Before all that they recorded this album,which showcased Dave Mustaine's increasing prowess as a great songwriter and guitarist. Marty Friedman complements Mustaine's rougher style with his smoothe flashy soloing. The songs are great. Holy Wars shreds. Hell the whole album is great.<BR>    Their newer material never quite hit it like Rust in Peace did. I always knew that Mustaine and his band had talent,oh and I must mention Ellefson and Nick Menza. It seems as if the focus was lost in the shuffle. Nonetheless this is a classic metal album that should be in any music fan's arsenal.

0316666343|5.0|I bought this book based on Anna Quindlan's Today Show review, &quot;If you read no other book this summer, this is the book you should read.&quot;  She was right, right, right!  Alice Sebold is a first-class story teller - who captures the spirit of a 14-year-old girl perfectly.  I look forward to future novels from this talented writer.
B00003CXDB|5.0|When this movie first came out on video, I was in high school and worked as an assistant manager at a video store and watched this movie every night! I'm not a big fan of Oliver Stone but he did turn out a great movie and was able to get Michael Douglas to give the performance of his career as Gordon Gekko. With the current mess on Wall Street this movie shows that it is still even more relevant today than when it came out 15 years ago!
0446608955|4.0|This was a wonderful book, remarkable story!  I recommend it to all!
0060392886|4.0|You wouldn't expect Motley Crue to provide the rock bio of the decade, not that they don't have a compelling story it's just that you wouldn't think they could think of more words than &quot;dude, I died, dude&quot;. But they came through and did a great job on telling us their story, warts and all. Perhaps one of the most honest rock autobio's ever published! Like Hammer of the Gods and Mick Fleetwood's book &quot;The Dirt&quot; should be required reading for any rock fan who loves to read!
B00005YXZH|5.0|Yes, Virginia.  Wilco has arrived...  I checked out the latest from Wilco out at a music store kiosk and knew I had to own it.  Unfortunately, I was without cash at the time, but jonesed until I was finally able to make it my own.<BR>Easily their most ambitious effort (it really goes without saying).  What's more, is the fact that the industry passed on it and they responded with a confident &quot;F--- you!&quot; and produced the album themselves.<BR>End-to-end solid and heartfelt work.  A creative blend of folk-centric lyrics and music, delivered in ways that continue to surprise.  Each song includes an element that stands out (you may have to listen); the others have hooks that can't be missed.  <BR>I can't say enough about the fiddles on &quot;Jesus, etc.,&quot; or the borderline hysterical, misguided soloing on &quot;I'm the Man that Loves You.&quot;  My favorite thing to point out: &quot;By the way, that's a dulcimer...&quot; on &quot;Heavy Metal Drummer.&quot;  <BR>Lyrically, forget about it.  Every single one is fantastic and thought-provoking.<BR>There may be low points, which will differ for every listener, but the positives are more than resounding and rewarding.<BR>Intelligent, toe-tapping, earnest, and bold.  The best I've heard in a while.
0312265859|5.0|By far the best Plum series yet. Stephanie was her normal self and brought out the full characters of her family and friends, not to mention her mixed up love life. The villians were bold and mean and stephanie was far from cool and calm when tackling with them. Between snakes, geese and giant rabbits I have never laughed so hard at one novel. And grandma mazure was a pure delight even tho she was a little more tame in this book.
B000001GQJ|5.0|I came to Argerich late.  But a friend of mine told me to get this disk years ago and I did.  I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  How could I not heard of a pianist this brilliant?  Well, everything I have heard from her since has confirmed over and over again for me what a treasure and genius she is.<br />Yes, her technique is brilliant and flawless and her interpretations are uniquely hers, but that is a virtue to me. Is she convincing? Yes!  She takes such chances and is able to hold a line while letting it almost run out.  She never plays it safe.<br />You can pick your favorites on this disk, but they are all worth hearing. The b-minor sonata of Liszt is for the ages.  The specifics of each performance are really not the point.  You should hear this disk and it belongs in your collection.  It will challenge what you think you know about how these pieces should be played.
B00005NWM3|5.0|First I thought that &quot;How You Remind Me&quot; was the only good song.  But now I realized That they had other great songs like &quot;Never Again&quot;.  A MUST buy for anyone who likes tempo changing music.
0743201140|3.0|Listened to the audio (CD) version.  Interesting; online test was OK, too.<br />For the future, Author Buckingham should take his book's advice about playing to one's strengths.  Mr. B. is probably an OK author but the role of 'narrator' is NOT one of his strengths.  Next time hire an actor whose strengths/skills match the job.<br />As an audio/video producer, I know there is no shortage of professional actors whose talents bring 'life' to the content of authors and similar experts.<br />Maybe next time...
B00003CX5P|5.0|First of all, I really enjoyed the movie, but there were a few things that really bothered me about it.  I realize that some of this was because of the wider appeal that Lucas was trying to get, but Jar Jar Binks was just annoying.  As a matter of fact, the whole Gungan race was a little annoying, although I can see how they fit into the story.  There were several times in the movie that I thought were a little hokey and slapstick for the rest of the movie, but I let these things slide.  Obviously, the special effects were top notch.  I kind of assumed they would be going in, so I wasn't really surprised by that.  I was impressed by the detail in the pod race and the battles.  I knew I wanted the DVD to add to my collection, even if it only included a nice digital master of the movie with some director commentary and cast and crew profiles, but extremely pleased when I discovered the wealth of extras included.  Apparently, Lucas is a bit of a perfectionist, because he wasn't satisfied with the normal deleted scenes method of simply shoving them in as is.  There are seven fully restored scenes including a much lengthier pod race scene.  You can't even tell these were removed before final production, they are up to the same level of quality as the film itself.  On top of that, there are all the featurettes, too many to count.  All in all, a must have for anyone who even remotely liked the movie and especially the few who may not have seen it yet.
B000006TRV|5.0|There is nothing to be said about this CD that could fully explain it's greatness. Track by track, there truly is no bad songs. All the songs are geniusly written by Roger Waters, my favorite songwriter. David Gilmour's guitar work is awesome. The riffs from songs like In The Flesh, Young Lust, and Empty Spaces are such a driving and brutal force, it almost empowers Roger Waters lyrics, but not quite. Waters bass playing on this album stands out among the other Floyd albums to me also. It is in full force on this album. Richard Wright's keyboard playing further enhances this genius album as does Nick Mason's exquisite drumming. 5 Stars for sure
B00005JKED|5.0|This film is full of surprises from beginning to end.  It's one of those movies you can watch more than once and see more things each time.  What's also a nice touch is the extras included on the DVD.  Often, I find that some filmmakers come up short when it comes time to put out the DVD.  I find this very disappointing, but in this case I was pleasantly surprised.  The film was actually shot in the neighborhoods depicted, which lends it a sense of realism and credibility that would otherwise be absent.  There are real people (gangmembers, kids, grandparents, etc.) that live there in the movie.  The performances by the two lead characters are really something to behold.  You must see it to believe it.
0871137380|4.0|This book moves at a sprinters pace and never tires.  The reader gets the sense that he/she is part of the action.  There is the feeling of being like a mouse on a wheel as one event leads to another.  I put the book down a few times out of exhaustion. <br />I recommend this book although, be warned, it is a troubling story.
6305311463|5.0|The other reviewers just don't get it.  Armageddon is a hilarious and completely epic movie if you look at it in the right light.  Scientifically ridiculous?  Of course it is - so what.  This is an ACTION movie with an excellent cast of quality action movie actors and a variety of interesting and fun characters.  It's totally classic.  The visuals and soundtrack are very well crafted.  The first 30 minutes is like one long music video.  Turn off your brain and just enjoy it - or turn on your brain and enjoy the excellent cinematography, editing, visual effects, sound effects, sound editing, etc.  I liked this movie OK when I saw it in the theatre but with repeat viewings, I like it even better.
B0000542D2|5.0|This movie defines the word classic. It is without a doubt the best musical of all time. I cannot wait for the DVD to be released.    For those who have not seen this movie , watch it , and you will see like me and millions of others why the Beatles are the biggest selling act of all time. The death of George makes this movie even more of a classic. Do yourself a favor and buy this movie. Generations to come will love this movie.
B00005NGAK|5.0|I'll try my best to do this production as much justice as I can. This performance, titled &quot;Feet Of Flames&quot;  is billed as Michael Flatley's last performance in the role of the &quot;Lord Of The Dance&quot; and I think he does an excellent job here! It is a fitting send-off, very grand and epic in scope and scale. I did get to see the original Lord Of The Dance show live on stage in Philadelphia in 1997 and was totally blown away by the experience. The dancing, the beautiful music and the celestial and haunting singing of Anne Buckley remain in my heart to this very day. There is just something about hearing that music live and feeling the vibrations course through your body with every step the dancers make. It gives new meaning to the saying that you just HAVE to be there. There is NOTHING like the energy of a live stage dancing performance. Particularly not one like this one, with sure fire and energy and passion.<BR>     Do not be fooled into thinking that is is just  an out-of doors version of the original Lord Of The Dance show. It IS in a sense, and yet in many ways it is not. This show takes the original Lord Of The Dance production and kicks it into high gear. All of the original music and dances are back, but the dance routines look different a bit and more elaborate. They are longer and feature quite a bitof  more complicated step work and more character interaction. There are also many new dances and more original musical pieces that make this a totally new experience.<BR>     I loved the fact that Bernadette Flynn (the &quot;good&quot; girl in the show) got to do her own solo dance in the middle of this. It really gave her a chance to shine. The new numbers played by the dueling violinists were lively and lovely at the same time. The costumes and sets for this show were much bigger and elaborate than those for the original show. I would EASILY say that for me, the combination of old music and new numbers with more elaborate and totally new dancesequences was wonderful to watch. It made certain that I did not feel I was watching &quot;the same old show&quot; done over again. There were just so many new things to see and to hear and to take in. I loved Michael Flatley's solo flute performance near the beginning of act two. Very lovely stuff. I must say though that for me the highlight was another chance to hear Anne Buckley sing. What a GOLDEN voice. So beautiful and tender, yet rich and deep and passionate. The three songs she did here were even better to me than the ones she sang in the original Lord Of The Dance show. Her version of &quot;Marble Halls&quot; to me was even better than Enya's rendition, which I had previously loved. Ms. Buckley  introduced me to the haunting love ballad &quot;Carrickfergus&quot; that had me reaching for my Kleenex even as I was wide-eyed and smiling from ear to ear. And the Gaelic piece she did (An Maigdean Mhara, if my memory serves correctly) was so beautiful that mere seconds after Ms. Buckley began to sing this number, my floodgates FLEW open and did not close for the full 3+ minutes of this song. Also I loved the fact that in this show instead of having just the green hooded cape for all three of her numbers, this time Anne got to wear three diffferent and very beautiful dresses, one for each song that she did (green, white, and gold). Exquisite costumes to fit with a stunning voice and an incredible beauty with great stage prescence. I for one cannot wait for her solo debut album.<BR>  In short, this was an unforgettable experience. I have loved Celtic music and dance for years now and this performance only made my fires burn all the hotter with enthusiasm. The music, the dancing, the lighting, the story of a noble warrior saving his land from a dark knight's conquest...they combined to take my breath away and give me one of the greatest entertainment experiences of my life. If you get to see this I hope you get to enjoy it and even love it as much as I did. I still love this show today, more than two years after I got to see it, and I know I always will. Peace.
B00000ILDF|1.0|David Fincher, the man who would later be responsible for Seven and Fight Club (two movies that are strongly recommended), directed this third installment of the Alien saga (which was supposed to be the last one).  Fincher lends what would become his trademark stylistic direction, but that alone can't save this film.  The first time I saw this I said to myself the series should have ended with Aliens.  Alien 3 takes everything built upon in the first two films and throws them out the window, and trust me thats not good.  Its played out like a horror/slasher movie, waiting to prepare yourself for the next big shock, instead of being an intelligent action/sci-fi hybrid we were used to before.  There's nothing but a lot of running, screaming, and cursing as the new (and poorly designed) &quot;dog&quot; alien hunts down Ripley and the prisoners.  Not to mention complete logic is disposed of, if you want to know what I mean read Jeff Bollen's review, and one of my biggest complaints is after all 2 and a half plus hours of Aliens where Ripley fought to keep Newt and Hicks alive, they are both dispatched at the beginning of the movie.  Alien Resurrection would follow later on, and would try to breathe new life into the series, but Alien 3 remains a landmark at how to ruin a good thing.
B00000I4XR|5.0|How can I do this movie justice? Well let's see... I'll try my best. Since my high school days I have read Peter Benchley's novel JAWS upon with the movie is based many times. While the book DID have some suspenseful moments in it, by-and-large the novel is an overly-gory sex-filled hunk of bodice-ripping, political commentary garbage with a shark thrown in for color and flavor.<BR>     Enter Steven Spielbery, Carl Gottleib, John Williams and their band of merry men. These people trimmed a lot of the aforementioned gore and sex and political malarkey from the book and what they came up with a very lean, tight and gripping suspense story. THAT is where the movie version of JAWS absolutely EXCELS. It is driven by SUSPENSE. The terror is largely pschological.  We are more terrified by what we DON'T see than by what we do see in this film. You don't even get to see the shark in his entirety until well over an hour into the film, and the fact that the shark's first appearance is preceeded by a very funny line of dialogue makes the effect triply powerful. This film does of course has it's \\"blood and guts\\" moments. The death scenes are well done and dramatic and shocking (particularly the death of Quint, at least for me), but they are not overly gross or over-done as in the novel. They ARE gross though. This is NOT a movie for young kids.<BR>     Peter Benchley and Carl Gottleib wrote the script here and the dialogue is 100% compelling and effective. There is not one wasted word and none of the lines sound forced or fake or rushed.<BR>     Enter Roy Scheider (Brody) Robert Shaw (Quint) and Richard Dreyfuss (Hooper). No matter how good a script is you NEED good actors to pull it off. These three men were PERFECTLY cast in their roles. The chemistry they have on screen is evident. They gave such life to the characters on the written page that you could CARE about these characters and laugh at them and with them.You could even grumble under your breath if you want. I LOVE these guys! Brody is the normal guy we all identify with that goes above and beyond the call of duty to save his town and conquer his fear of the water. Hooper is a young, wise rich-kid know-it-all that comes across as a bit of a goofball. And Quint is the crusty old foul-mouthed sea dog that you LOVE to hate but he's cool in his own way and you sympathize with him as he faces his destiny in the film. Even Quint is a hero, albeit a tragic hero.<BR>     Of course I cannot forget the contribution of Star Wars maestro John Williams to this movie. The theme he wrote for the shark is of course, classic stuff. When you hear it you get a chill because you instantly know that SOMEBODY'S in trouble! But there is more. This score is NOT a one-hit wonder. It crackles with tension and adventure. The scene where Quint tells the story of the USS Indianapolis going down features a light and ominous string and harp melody with other soft instruments that absolutely REEKS of suspense and coming danger. The scene for the preparation of Hooper's diving cage features a brilliant cello melody that gives a real sense of \\"Okay, now we bring the war to the shark, go get 'em Hooper!\\" The music throughout all the beach sequences and the final hunt for the shark has touches of lighthearted playfulness, nail-biting horror, and lots of rousing adventure and mystery. Kudos for a job well done.<BR>     In short this film has everything a great film should. A very intense and involving story of man vs. a force of nature gone totally berserk. A top-knotch musical score. A wonderful script and some of the BEST acting to date in ANY horror, suspense, drama, or adventure movie. If you want GRAND entertainment of the highest order, do NOT miss Jaws. Even though this movie scared me to death when I was younger, I have grown to love it, and I think you just might love it too. Peace.
B000002UJQ|5.0|What can you say about this alblum, except that if you don't already own it your are missing out on life. This is the most brilliant alblum you will probably ever hear, and listening to it is like having a dream you never want to wake from.
B000005RFN|3.0|Never Say Die! tends to take more than it's share of critical slagging when compared to other Ozzy-era Sab releases.  The main reason may be it's lack of focus and discipline, although at times, that's exactly what makes this album more interesting than most of their previous works.  In fact, Never Say Die! is considerably more complex than it's much hailed studio follow-up, Heaven and Hell.  It's likely that this was somewhat accidental on the band's part, and I suspect that quite a lot of time was taken in the production room with this one in order to clean it up.  At first listen, the sound is frequently flat and the songs themselves sound hurried, almost as if this was recorded as a jam session with production trickery added later.  Legend has it, Never Say Die! was recorded (the basic tracks) in a 24-hour period... and the title track certainly shows it.  But numbers such as Johnny Blade and Air Dance breath with an unfamilar (to Sabbath) openness and warmth.  While I wouldn't say that Never Say Die! is ambitious or even enjoyable in its entirety, it is the definitive scrapper of the Ozzy-era (next comes Volume 4).  Also, it must be said that the weird Pink Floydian jazzy interlude on Breakout is, well, weird.  But don't be so quick to judge this album, patience takes time!
B00003CYLT|5.0|I'd never seen a live Cirque du Soleil performance, so I expected some fine, but predictable acrobatics and sets. Nothing in this beautiful production is ordinary or predictable, and the decision to shoot it as an IMAX 3-D film was necessary to capture the essence of these fine actors and gymnasts. The 3-D experience combined with the exquisite performances are very powerful, and I saw many people in tears after the show.<br />The only dissapointment is that the movie ends too soon!
0812548094|4.0|If you love a page turner this is it, this book is a great sequel to Wizards First Rule.  I was hooked from the first 10 pages.  This book is a building point for the sweeping story of Richard and Khalan, you begin to understand their strugle and pain, their power and weakness.  I will read all of Terry Goodkinds novels, he has created a world of magic and inspiration.
0380820846|5.0|The Bridgerton series gets better with each installment.  We had gotten to know Penelope Featherton in the previous books, but this story allowed us to get to know her even better.  Now resigned to her fate as a spinster alongside Eloise Bridgerton, Peneolpe gets caught up with the rest of the ton and their search for the real identity of Ms. Whistledown. As with the other books we get to know the Bridgerton family members even better.  Plus we get to check back in with Anthony, Benedict, Daphne, and their own ever growing families.<br />The only negative aspect to this book is the fact that I will have to wait another 6 months for the next book in the series.  Get this book, and all the others if you haven't already!
0671024256|5.0|The guy knows what he's doing.  There are some who will look down on Stephen King because of his popularity, or for the fact that many of his books get classified as being 'Horror'.  However, as a writer, Stephen King has truly been a force now for many, many years.<br />This book is unique, because it isn't a strict memoir, nor is it merely a writer's manual.  It succeeds because it is both, giving the reader insight both into the mechanics of the craft as well as an example of the personality that is infused into the writing.  Both are essential for a great book.  If books could merely be printed using an 'idea machine', you know that we would have invented some such already.  At the same time though, anybody endeavouring to write needs to have the type of tools and discipline to be able to write something readable.  <br />I would recommend this book to anybody who is thinking of doing any sort of paid writing, because it is truly a glimpse into writing and a writer's world that isn't often offered.
0316666343|5.0|I was mesmerized from the very first paragraph. I read the book in two days, stopping only for things that absolutely needed to be done, such as feeding the kids. If you have lost a loved one this book lends a warmth to that cold spot in your heart...the possibility that they are still around, explaining the little personal miracles that sometimes happen.
B00005JKNC|1.0|Have you ever seen Shaw's Pygmalion with Leslie Howard and Wendy Hiller?  In each beautifully acted scene, you are waiting for the Lerner and Lowe music to appear, but you still love the film.  Well, in this movie you are waiting for the comedy to appear, a la Hail the Conquering Hero and it doesn't appear.  So now you are stuck with a fantasy/drama about the blacklist.  But there's already a good documentary &quot;Hollywood and the Blacklist&quot; and there's &quot;The Front,&quot; with Woody Allen and Zero Mostel.  Then you are hoping that Frank Darabont's follow-up to the superb Shawshank Redemption and the watchable if over-symbolic Green Mile will be a humdinger.  The movie theater is beautiful, the subject still draws us in, but Jim Carrey's final speech is inspiring but too late.  Instead you purchase the following adjectives from the movie mistake candy counter:<br />Snail-paced: the greatness of Jim Carrey is his unpredictably mad but sharp timing.  The great movies of the 40's and 50's relied on timing.  Are you telling me that most audiences from that era would have stayed around for this potboiler?  I'll take a Howard Hawks screwball comedy any day.<br />Corny-As my father, a movie lover since the 20's, and another reviewer have exclaimed.  Here's three examples.  First, you know you are in trouble when you have Jim Carrey, drunk, spill his life to a stuffed smiling monkey.  And it's our misfortune that the monkey artistically reappears at the end of the movie.  (You know, &quot;Monkeybone&quot; is not that bad a movie.  Brendan Fraser is funny and has a great goofy smile and the monkey talks back and torments, as a monkey should.)  Second, based upon the theater renovation montage, I was expecting Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney to show up and give their all.  And, third, what book does the lawyer girlfriend leave for Carrey before he meets with the HUAC?  My wife predicted Plato's Republic.  Hah-I won-it was the Constitution!  Thank goodness it wasn't The Prophet.<br />Scene-chewing: Martin Landau is a master, but you shouldn't resort to ravenous comsumption when the dialogue doesn't inspire.  No, Mr. Darabont, tell Martin to pull it in, we get it!  He looks daffy instead of dignified.  <br />Implausible: Are you telling me a father couldn't tell his son from an imposter.  C'mon, any good enough parent lovingly knows the contours and quirks of his or her child's body.  And as my wife pointed out, where are all the smokers in this little town?  In normal life, more citizens than not had a ciggy dangling from the lips.  And don't tell me that this is just a fantasy of a small town and life in the 40's and early '50's.  Note the flashback scene of WWII soldiers writing playing cards and writing home to their honeys.  Almost EVERYONE is smoking in that short scene, unfiltered!  The movie structure unsuccessfully swings both ways trying to be fantasy and real life.  <br />Stiff: When Carrey's character leaves the sody-shop with his supposed long-lost love, the whole town follows the two of them down the street.  That's the director pushing the blocking to create &quot;charm.&quot;<br />Trite: The movie collapses under the weight of it's script when it descends in a &quot;movie of the week&quot; scene: the elderly black man, who opens up the theater on time is given a watch(why is there only man of color in the town, and how could he stand it?).  It's the glances and sentiment that are makes one squirm.<br />Why do Frank Capra's films shine when this this one doesn't.  A sense of humor, enough believability to overcome sentiment and corniness, great writing that complements great acting and not the opposite.  These are intangibles.  I hope that Mr. Darabont and his colleagues learn from the failures of this noble effort and make a thrilling film next time.
B00005O3VC|5.0|You can not be a fan of comedy and certainly not a Python fan without owning this DVD. From the hilarious subtitles in the opening credits to the abrupt and unfinished ending, the movie is a classic.

If you've ever wondered just what to do with your coconuts, or you have dreams about &quot;The Knights of the Round Table&quot; in Legos, this is your special day.

0061091480|5.0|I don't know that any one review can do justice to this book, but I will contribute mine, in order to help anyone considering buying Your Erroneous Zones.<br />In short, this book is no less than the basis for modern psychology.  If you have been to counseling, literally all the general advice you will ever receive is derived from this book.  The goal of every one of us to to become self-actualized.  <br />A self-actualized person is someone who is happy and enjoys life no matter what their circumstances are.  As Dyer says, happiness always comes from within.  We are happy when we choose to be happy.   <br />The \\"erroneous zones\\" are negative, pointless emotions such as worry, guilt, depression, helplessness, anger, and neediness.  We can choose not to feel those emotions.  We can also choose to stop procrastinating.  <br />Our happiness, again, comes completely from within.  There are some things that we cannot change, such as injustice, poverty, and crime, can work to solve those worldly problems without choosing to feel depressed and helpless.  <br />Your Erroneous Zones is filled to the brim with pearls of wisdom.  I find myself constantly re-reading the book in order to make new discoveries.  Today, for example, I pondered this statement by Dyer: \\"Make a decision to live five minutes at a time.\\"   <br />When we do that, then procrastination becomes pointless.  Feeling unhappy becomes pointless.  Dwelling on mistakes from the past becomes pointless.  Boredom becomes pointless.  (es, boredom is another emotion that we choose to feel.)<br />How do you feel right now?  And why did you choose to feel that way?  The bottom line is that we choose the way we want to feel...

B00005QG9J|5.0|Ok, despite what all the old fans may say, this is an excellent CD.  I hopped on this band wagon during Fungus Amoungus and I loved every minute of it.  It's un-true that with hits like Drive and Stellar that a situation like this was un-avoidable, the guys did this because they wanted to, my view is that 9/10 the guys will come back and do another psuedo album like Fungus Amoungus or S.C.I.E.N.C.E.  The band said that they rented a beach house and recorded this album because they felt they should take time out from what they do normally to make a CD about how much they appreciate friends and the little time they have to spend with them.  You &quot;long-time&quot; fans that say they are turning into teeny bopping media pleasers should shut your mouths and appriciate them for what they have done and what the are still doing.  This is in no way a &quot;pop-fan&quot; pleaser it still very much atones to rock hungry fans, it's just more &quot;EMO&quot; this time around then &quot;psuedo grundge rock&quot; don't worry guys, they'll be back to please us with tunes heard back in the days, but until then, I leave you with Morning View....
0312979479|5.0|Ten people are invited for a weekend getaway on an island, unknowingly that their lifes would end in just a few days. One by one, each person is killed in a way that relates to a poem that is hanging in the hotel entitled \\"Ten Little Indians\\" (which used to be the former title of this book), that hangs next to ten porcelain indians. As each person dies, one indian breaks. This story will keep you guessing who the murderer is until you finish the book. Beware it may not be who you think! I hope this review helps you pick out a great book to read as the seasons change, and more people stay inside around the fireplace, and cuddle with a good book. This is that one book that needs to sit by the fireplace with you!
B00005JLKB|4.0|Surprise, surprise. Blithely ignoring the protests of fanboys and the head-shaking of nay-sayers, the WB's Superman series \\"Smallville\\" turns out to be quite watchable. More than that; even GOOD. Interesting characters, top-notch acting and some lucky breaks for the network as far as casting goes made the series a smash that continues to garner impressive ratings. In the first \\"Smallville\\" DVD we are presented with the Pilot episode in wonderful widescreen, along with some commentary from the producers and director.<br />The Pilot episode, rather blandly titled \\"Premeire\\", sets up the story for us nicely, if not particularly excitingly. Typical peaceful and idylic middle-America town Smallville is the corn capital of the US, until one fateful day when the sky suddenly starts raining meteors. Water-towers fall, cars are blown sky-high and many people are killed, including the parents of sweet four year old Lana Lang.  Lionel Luthor, head of LuthorCorp, is visting his Smallville plant with his son when the meteors hit; his son survives a close call, although his hair unfortunately does not. And we must not forget the goodhearted Kents, who discover something unexpected in a still-smoldering cornfield.<br />The action then fast forwards ten or so years later; and we get to know the people of Smallville. The Kents have named their discovery Clark (Tom Welling) and raised him as their own, although initially he does not know the truth about his origins. Clark is hopelessly in love with the orphaned Lana Lang, played by the radient Kristen Kreuk. Problems for Clark arrive in the form of the scattered meteor rocks, which make Clark extremely sick whenever they are in his vicinity. The adult Lex Luthor also lives in Smallville, and he and Clark strike up a tentative friendship.<br />The strength of the show is definitely the casting, which is uniformly first-rate. Tom Welling as the young Clark Kent is solid, managing to convey the slight awkwardness that plagues Clark while giving him a strong moral balance. Kristin Kreuk as his love interest is lovely and exudes a wistful kindness. Allison Mack as Clark's friend Chloe is spunky and funny, and acclaimed actor John Glover is fittingly slimy as Lionel Luthor.<br />And then there is Michael Rosenbaum. He is without a doubt the series' Ace. Rosenbaum plays Lex Luthor in the same spirit most actors play Hamlet; shrewd yet tortured, strong yet vulnerable, longing to let the good in him shine through while simultaneously fearing it a weakness. All that Rosenbaum requires is a few strong plot lines and he will make Lex the most complex and interesting character on TV today.<br />Which brings us to the writing, the show's weak point. Not exactly bad, and sometimes actually quite good, most of the time it is lackluster. Uninteresting villians and frequent implausibilty put a damper on a great concept.  The show survives on the appeal of the clean-cut Welling and the amazingly sexy Rosenbaum , but better writing could guarantee this show a gigantic following. Let's hope.<br />All in all, a decent start to a show that is getting slowly better episode by episode. You'll catch this one from the begining if you're smart; it's going places.e giving him a strong moral balance. Kristin Kreuk as his love interest is lovely and exudes a wistful kindness.

B00005JKL8|1.0|With only Tomb Raider coming in as a worse film, Behind Enemy Lines is simply the second worst film of the past year.  Why?  It's simple, with overdone, hyperkinetic direction, helmer John Moore has shown he truly believes his audience suffers from attention deficit disorder.  Worse yet, for such a cheesy action movie, there's actually very little action.  With the exception of the destruction of a fighter jet and a skirmish at the end (the latter of which is horrendously choreographed), not much happens except seeing Gene Hackman barking over and over about how he wants his pilot back and watching Owen Wilson run in slow motion, run in normal speed, run with disjointed camera work, and uh...occasionally walk, even in slow motion.  <br />There are all the usual cliches, such as the commander who won't leave his man behind, the \\"villainous\\" admiral who would rather leave the pilot in enemy territory for the sake of a peace treaty, and there's even a uniform switch that gives our hero the chance to escape.  I don't know about you, but I would have rather just seen some Mcgyver-type stuff, considering the lack of seriousness involved. <br />There are other problems plot-wise, such as very poor introduction into the political situation in Bosnia. The movie introduces a teen who helps out Wilson, then he just suddenly exits the film.  What the heck?  <br />There's zero suspense because you know how it's all going to end.  And I don't know about the rest of you, but I had a hard time rooting for Wilson, considering all the dumb moves he made (such as, oh, flying off mission, leaving his flight partner behind, etc.).  But that's okay, all we need is a final scene shot in slow motion with hundreds of seamen and pilots cheering our \\"hero\\" on with a rock song playing in the background to let us know this is a \\"good\\" movie.  There are even subtitles at the end that reveal the characters' fates, as if we even care enough by that point.
B00003CXXP|2.0|This is a very disappointing film. I expected a lot more than I received. A lot of the film a fast forwarded through. The acting on the part of the Mom and Dad and even the real son was somewhat less than good. However, the AI boy and the Mecca (Gigalo Joe) and the Teddy Bear was outstanding.<br />The actual story was real good. a different take on androids and society. <br />This is a film that can be watched, but don't expect it to be something that you will want to repeat...
0783226063|1.0|To date, I can only think of one movie of David Lynch's that I like, and that would be his most recent, Mulholland Drive, and even I thought that was a bit overrated.  Then there's Dune, a monstrously budgeted sci-fi epic based off of Frank Herbert's enormously popular novel, and well, let's just say it's beyond your typical disappointment.<br />Dune has its fans, but all I see is a cheesy sci-fi film that is admittedly visually impressive, but suffers from a lack of dramatic power or sense of fun, two elements that are crucial to a movie of such proportions.  Take the recent The Lord of the Rings, which ranks among the best novel-to-movie adaptations I've seen.  That was a spirited fantasy/adventure, and represents all that this film is not.<br />Actually, I would really just recommend you check out the recent sci-fi channel mini-series instead, which turned out to be a very enjoyable and surprisingly well-made film.  I found it better on almost every level, as it featured even more impressive sets and special effects, better battle scenes and duels, and most importantly, much more coherent storytelling.
B000065U1N|5.0|I am not an effusive reviewer, but I cannot help but award this movie 5 stars.  The exacting detail of the execution of the mission and the horrific hour after hour conflict of America's Elite versus a veritable mob of forces with superior firepower does nothing but inspire respect for the men who wear our uniform.   The pace of the movie is frenetic and unlike most hyberbolic reviews, you will be on the edge of your seat the entire movie.  <br />Given our politically correct atmosphere, it may be hard for some to watch.  Somali followers of Adid are depicted as they truly were:  grasping killers, who would use food as means to obtain power.  It also makes you realize that as much as we would like, the US military is not there to help Third World nations who do not wish our help.  There are some conflicts, as much as it may hurt our sensibilities, that we must let run their course.<br />If you are a fan of Bill Clinton, this film does not do much to instill confidence in his leadership or international/military decision making.  In fact, it shows why we probably should not have elected a man who 'loathed' the military.   At the end, you will feel hatred for the Somalis and perhaps for the administration that allowed this debacle to occur.  You may not like that fact, but in reality it is good.  It is important for those of us who are not in the military nor will ever be, to understand the effective use of force and its limitations.  We must also be reminded that even in a post-communist world, we still need grown ups at the helm in the White House.

B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's \\"let go\\" is one of those c.d.'s that for some reason never can find their way out of your c.d. player! This is proboly because her songs are ones that you will never get bored with. All of her songs are intirely written by her so its very easy to pick up on her individuality and lifestyle. Alot of people may think that Avril Lavigne is \\"pop\\", but thats really not the case. Her songs are, in my opinion, a mix between Punk Rock and The Dixie Chicks. It is a very beautiful sound that is entirely her own. Also, alot of people I have found compare her to Pink. Well, Pink has nothing on Avril thats all I have to say! So if your thinking on buying this c.d. it would be a great decision. Take my word for it, you will not be dissapointed!

B00003CXI0|5.0|Our whole family enjoys this movie.  The movie did a great job of bringing the book to life.  As in any movie made from a book, many details are not present.  I read the book to my 5-year old daughter prior to seeing the movie, so it did help to make more sense out of everything.  I would still highly recommend this movie for all ages.  It may be a bit scary at times for little kids, but all in all it is a great movie.
B00003CXAY|5.0|If the quality of this upcoming Koyaanisqatsi DVD release is at LEAST as high as that of the limited private issue from the IRE, then I would say that devotees of Koyaanisqatsi are in for one phenomenal, blow-away experience! Yes, about a year ago I did bite the bullet and send in my donation, and I haven't regretted it for a single second! The DVD I received from them is in every way superior to any home-video version heretofore on the market: the 5.1 sound is smooth, wide-range, gutsy and detailed (remarkable, considering its age!); the colors are vibrant -- in fact, I was noticing subtleties of color I'd forgotten were even there; the picture has depth and excellent resolution. To be honest, right now the only other thing I can think to ask for is that someday we be given a true high-definition transfer of this remarkable film. Then I'll be able to die happily and go to heaven with few regrets!
B0000640VO|4.0|\\"Amelie\\" is an imaginatively conceived, well-directed French film that will capture your interest. Whimsical, young and light-hearted, Amelie searches for love. This fresh-spirited movie has surprises around every corner. The French subtitles are no problem as you will easily enter Amelie's world. Highly recommended!
0316666343|5.0|I'm not much of a reader.  Manage maybe one book a year.  The other day I was wandering around [local store] and picked up \\"Lovely Bones.\\"  At first it was the cover that drew me.  Then I leafed through it and found I couldn't put it back down.  Found myself sitting in one of the bookstore's overstuffed chairs for next three hours and read l/2 the book.   I surprised myself at how quickly and totally this book captivated me.  I'm not a reader by nature - but I read this book and glad I did.
B000002JOH|5.0|No real fans of true metal should be without this classic. Pantera's Vulgar Display of Power started the metal revolution in the early 90s and it proudly showed that metal is back.<br />Mouth For War- the first metal song ever to debut at No.1 on the Billboard charts. A great opener.<br />A New Level- just as it is entitled, it demostrates the band's determination to rise to the top.<br />Walk- If you do not know this song, you can't call yourself a real Pantera fan... period.<br />Hostile- a classic, and still one of Pantera's crowd pleasers at concerts... after 10 years<br />This Love- the best anti- love song ever written and even better when it's heard live.<br />Rise- awesome song, good lyrics about today's society.<br />No Good- just like Rise, but Anselmo raps on some parts... yeah Phil can rap.<br />Live In a Hole- great tune, depressing lyrics in a way<br />Regular People- good track with boastful lyrics.<br />By Demons, Be Driven- this is a heavy, anti- religion song<br />Hollow- soft beginning but gets real heavy towards the end. A song about Phil's best friend, Mike Hatch.<br />This CD is a metal masterpiece. Go buy this!!!
B00003CXRM|5.0|Superb. Brilliant, right up there with the best by the Coen brothers! Plenty of surprises! I especially enjoyed Clooney as the rube with an education as well the evil political guys. The kids' reaction to their long lost daddy is probably the best kid reaction I've seen on the screen. The KKK scene alone is worth the price of admission. BUY it.

B000002UY5|2.0|Although they are frequently mistaken for an alternative band, Blind Melon are really a hard rock band in the tradition of The Black Crowes and Led Zeppelin. Fans of 80s metal will find much to admire, as will fans of hard rock of any time. I find them virtually unlistenable. D

I mean now you have probably seen it a million times so you know what all the jokes are and what the storyline is.  this movie was the top movie of 1984 and it grossed 238 million dollars.  I could see why these were top of the line special effects back in 1984.  It stars Bill Murray and Sigourney Weaver.  This movie is a buy and the DVD is great.
B00005RFAI|4.0|Personally,I liked Pink better when she was a thugged out white<BR>girl/tomboy singing funky,spunky pop-funk ditties like \\"There You Go\\" and \\"Most Girls\\" and the actually steamy \\"You Make Me Sick\\".But since Ms. Moore ditched the hip hop beats and soul singing for a more rockier(whiter) sound with \\"Missundastood\\" she's both impressed me and yet she has as she once sung,also \\"made me sick\\"!<br />Pink gets props because \\"Missundastood\\" is a great attempt to stake some actual grit and to try to get a chance at longevity.<BR>Tracks like \\"Just Like A Pill\\",\\"Lonely Girl\\",\\"Gone To California\\",and the comically tragic stunner \\"Family Portrait\\" show a moodier,more truthful Pink actually singing with pain,anger,and<BR>aliby yet while not getting her cute little made-up face dirty.<BR>The production courtsey of former 4 Non Blonde Linda Perry and<BR>Dallas Austin is sturdy and focused.More rock inspired yet nothing to over Pink's 12-17 fanbase heads.<br />But Pink has made me want to gag a bit as well.First,altough I appauld her for taking a risk and changing her sound and style.<BR>She seems to be trying WAY to hard to be a \\"rocker chick\\".Her <BR>\\"rock chick\\" persona is very contrived and plastic.It only comes off appealing because of Pink's personality.Gwen Stefani is way more fun,exciting,and genuine than Pink's rehashed,very 1994 rock star getup.Plus cuts like \\"Numb\\" and \\"Misery\\" come off flat.<br />But overall,I'm not mad at Pink.\\"Missundastood\\" is a very solid disc.Reccomended to pop fans who want to feel \\"bad-a**\\" for a <BR>day.But come on,don't you just wish that Pink would just dye her hair fuschia again and wear pink duds and sing \\"There You Go\\" just one more time!!<BR>APPROVED
B000002U9L|5.0|This soundtrack is so beautiful.  This goes along great with The movie.  I love the movie the movie was released in 1986 and so was this soundtrack.  Every song on here you can get addicted to and every song in here is easy to sing along to.  These songs take you to a different world whenever I hear them.  For a David Bowie or a fan or the movie or just the common listener I reccomend this CD for enjoyment.
B00005QHPQ|1.0|Enrique's &quot;Escape&quot; is HORRIBLE.He can barely sing.The songs are SOOOOOOO corny it's a wonder how a music-buying public that supposedly reviles such acts as Vanilla Ice and Barry Manilow<BR>would embrace such shoddily made music.&quot;Hero&quot; is a horrid ballad<BR>with AWFUL vocals courtsey of Enrique and the laughable &quot;Dont<BR>Turn Off The Light&quot;.The music is so CORNY and silly sounding.<BR>People take this seriously? <BR>Why do Ricky Martin,Marc Anthony,and Shakira-along with Enrique<BR>do the most horrendous music in English while they make first-rate music in their native tongue?<BR>RASPBERRY!
B00001MXXH|5.0|This movie is probably the greatest teen movie of the 1980s to most people.  I mean who could forget the classroom part &quot;Bueller, Bueller&quot; or the jealous sister or the part where the car has to many miles on it so they try to get the mileage down by putting the car in reverse and it runs out of the shack.  This movie released in 1986 is a classic and shouldn't be forgotten.  The DVD could have been much better featuring extras but is great in widescreen and feels like you're watching it in theatres.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I love this CD.  It has instantly become the best  one I own.  I think John Mayer is amazing.  His music is so relaxing...I could listen to it all day.  It is my favorite.  I never go ANYWHERE without it.  Everyone should get this CD because it is so wonderful.  You will not be disappointed!
B00005B36H|5.0|This album is truly amazing.  That it took 5 years to conceive means nothing.  the wait was worth it, for Lateralus is in fact Tool's greatest release to date (Aenima, while excellent, had a darkly psychedelic production that added to the atmosphere of the music, but made it a dreary listen from start to finish, and Undertow lacked the depth of later releases).<br />Lateralus is an epic and spiraling album, with references to mysticism, mathematics (ha!), and even the supernatural.  But as intriguing as the lyrics are, it is the music on this record that truly deserves acclaim.  Since the music tends to use minor pentatonics, it has almost a classical grandeur.  The classical comparisons actually may not be too far fetched, seeing as how Tool effortlessly arranges and executes these very complex songs. The (real) songs are usually in excess of 6 minutes in length, and contain multiple rhythmic changes.  mid-eastern and even aboriginal strains punctuate much of this record.  Additionally, the sound is very \\"mind-expanding\\", if you know what i mean.  Most importantly, it is one of the few records i own that is not just good from start to finish, but EXCELLENT.  The sheer size of this album alone ensures that one will have to listen to it more than ONE CURSORY TIME in order to appreciate it in earnest.  Although it's hard to point out highlights, mine are The Grudge, The Patient, Lateralus and Reflection.  Perhaps if more music groups today took their cues from this hard-working and excellent band, the current musical environment wouldn't be so bland.<br />But then, maybe it's not for everyone.  Maybe an album like this will never be all that popular.  In fact, it seems many of Tool's more metal-oriented fans have lost faith in them.  Their loss.  Some may say the sound isn't immediate enough.  Well, hey, thats fine.  Go listen to the Strokes or any number of indie bands more than happy to regurgitate old ideas, or even better, listen to the lifeless trash that inundates the airwaves.  Me, I'll listen to this.  Highly recommended to those with an open mind.
B00005JL3A|4.0|Simply amazing! What's great about this movie is that it's the first good video game to movie transition I've ever seen! As an avid Resident Evil fan, I noticed that even though the characters and storyline differ from the popular Capcom games, many of the basic elements are still there! I even noticed similar sound effects and background music at certain points of the movie!<br />For all of you Resident Evil fans out there, go see it! You won't be disappointed! As for those who haven't played the video games before, you will enjoy this as one of the more scarier movies since Aliens!
B000002JS0|5.0|The day I turned 18 in 1989 I walked into Sunstrip Tattoo and &quot;Little Mike&quot; forever emblazoned my skin. The tat I walked out with epitomized everything I felt and believe should represent rock n roll(singer.) Bon Scott WAS RNR and this is him at his most vulneralble and electrifying!<BR>Any rock fan who doesn't like this isn't a rock fan. <BR>Yes I are!
B00003CXDG|3.0|Big on visuals, but lean on story substance.  MI:2 should satisfy action or visual lovers.  Anyone else may be a bit disappointed...<br />THE STORY:<br />Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) returns to prevent the bad guy from unleashing a biological horror on the world.<br />THE ANALYSIS:<br />Personally, I found the story to be a bit on the boring side honestly.  The action sequences and cinematography (as you'd expect from a John Woo film) were just AWESOME.  The movie had a mix of romantic elements in it as well.<br />For me though, and this could be just me personally, I found myself phasing out for most of the movie and only really perking up for the action sequences.<br />THE DVD SPECIAL FEATURES:<br />The DVD features do not disappoint.  Beautifully designed and chalked full of great stuff, DVD fans should be pleased with this offering.<br />1. Behind Mission:  14 minute \\"Behind the Scenes\\" featurette with interviews of the cast and crew discussing the movie.<br />2. Mission Incredible:  5 minute featurette discussing how the action sequences and stunts were filmed.  Pretty enlightening stuff.<br />3. Impossible Shots:  Director John Woo discusses how several of the key action sequences were filmed.  Again, cool stuff.<br />4. Commentary:  Feature length audio commentary by Director John Woo.  Always interesting to hear.<br />5. Metallica music video, \\"I Disappear.\\"  4 minutes.  Better than average music video for a movie.<br />6. Alternate Opening Sequence:  30 seconds.  Pretty cool.<br />7. Mission Improbable:  6 minute gag interview with Tom Cruise's stunt double, \\"Tom Crooze.\\"  Features footage from previous Cruise films.<br />8. DVD-ROM:  More cool things for you on your PC.<br />THE VERDICT:<br />Well, if you are big on some pretty cool and visually stunning action scenes, this is the ticket for you.  Substance wise though, I found this a bit lacking...
0393312836|2.0|I recently finished reading \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" and quite frankly, I expected more.  Instead I found it to be quite predictable and ordinary.  The protagonist, Alex, is nothing more than a posing hooligan trying to fit in with his \\"crowd.\\"  His brand of violence is not really shocking in this, the 21st century.  He is merely a victim of peer pressure.  The only thing that sets him apart and adds a slight air of menace is that he embraces a lot of different types of violence - from rape to beatings to petty theft.  He is not a true believer of his own world, though, with his reluctance to pull off true crimes in the form of burglary and out-and-out murder. And his supposed shocking \\"rehabilitation\\" is simply aversion therapy.  The last \\"lost\\" chapter is neither a shocker nor a surprise and I really don't see any significance in it at all other than the numeric importance to the author.  Sort of a cop out - time heals all wounds... and psychopaths.  I will grant that the slang language invented by Burgess is a very good tool for transporting the reader into the \\"droog\\" world.  Otherwise, I don't see the fuss over this predictable novella.
B000068QY7|5.0|What more do you want! This album has everything from hard rock 'n' roll to pop! Liam's songs are a real hightlight of the album and everyone should buy this album to to hear his songs oh and the other songs arnt bad ;-).
B0000640VO|4.0|No one can tell you what the Matrix is...<br />Sorry, wrong movie but the sentiment is appropriate. It's a story of a young woman who comes out of herself in an amazing way. Her cleverness and originality are amazing to behold. You can watch this over and over and not get it all.<br />There are some situations in the movie that as a Christian, I would not be proud of or condone in my own life, but I found the story wonderful nonetheless.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|Okay, first thing's first:  I admit that I cannot vouch for the accuracy of this film.  I've never really heard about John Nash until I saw the film, and I had never read the book.  Is this based on a true story?  Yes.  Is it accurate.  I would like to hope so, but I cannot say that it is so.  What I DO KNOW is that this film touched and entertained me on so many different levels.  &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; is such a great movie.....it's hard to put in words.  But I will try.<br />The movie is based on a true story.  (Yes, it's true.  How accurate it is, I do not know.  Nor, do I tend to find out.)  This is about a man named John Nash, a genius who suffers from an illness that causes him to be dillusional.  (I do not know how to spell the word that describes the illness, so I am not even going to try to spell it.  You know what it is.)  It gets to the point where he cannot tell reality from illusion.  This is the story of a brilliant man and his struggles with life.  And how love from one woman most likely saved his life.<br />The acting is incredible.  Russell Crowe does in outstanding job in this movie, and really was robbed at the Oscars.  Jennifer Connelly also does a terrific job, and very much deserved her Oscar.  And who can forget about Ed Harris, huh?  What about him?  He too needs to be acknowledged for his role in this very important film.<br />The movie was very well directed, congrats to Ron Howard.  I never seem to be let down when I watch any of his movies.  This wasn't the easiest picture to make, but Ron did an outstanding job.  And the overall product shows that.<br />The DVD is amazing.  Picture quality; top notch.  Sound; impressive, but lacks in some scenes, though I doubt that's the DVD's fault.  Would've been nice to have it available in DTS.  Lots and LOTS of extra features.  So if you enjoy extras on DVDs, you won't be disappointed.<br />This really is a great movie; one of the year's best.  The movie won &quot;Best Picture&quot; for a reason.  If you want to see a great, moving, and touching film, see &quot;A Beautiful Mind.&quot;  Bound to be a classic, despite all of the controvercy over it.  I will watch this movie as much as I can, and I'm sure I will feel the same way when it's over.  A spectacular film.ason.

6305127697|5.0|PRIMAL FEAR is one of those rare movies that improves with age.  Not that it wasn't a fine film when released:  the complexities of the story took front seat as well they should.  After not having to figure out how the interplay is going to work, it is a pleasure to sit and just respect the fine casting, writing, directing, editing and acting.  Richard Gere once again proves he is a taut actor, Laura Linney gives an Oscar worthy performance, of course Edward Norton is a tour de force performance, but the joys come in the cameos by Andre Braugher, Frances McDormand, Alfre Woodward, Steve Bauer, John Seda, etc.  This is fine ensemble playing in a beautifully photographed and scored thriller.  See it again!
B00005A46T|4.0|Slipknot is now a flat out heavy metal band. They don't use samples anymore and use the DJ only once. So why don't they just kick out Craig and Sid? And the 2 extra percussionists, as they do nothing as well. Oh, well, on to the reviews (of the songs I like).<BR>2.People=S**t-5/5-This is the only song with turntable/keyboard work in it, and it lasts for 3 seconds. The rest is pure metal. <BR>4.My Plague-5/5-The verses are Ok, but what really stand out are the choruses. This song is actully kind of...(dare I say it)... melodic.<BR>6.The Heretic Anthem-4/5-This is pretty much Iowa's signature song. The intro drumming is just rapid beating, like Slayer. The problem:gets broing.<BR>8.Left Behind-5/5-This is Iowa's first single. Nothing really to say here, except it's awesome.<BR>10.I Am Hated-3/5-This is a weird song. Corey's voice changes evry 2 seconds, and you can hardly understand a thing going on. And it's only 2 and a half minutes long.<br />Get this if you like Slipknot's first album, Mudvayne, Spineshank, KoRn, System of a Down or Slayer.
B00000GAIW|5.0|&quot;Over the top, pretentious, all flash and no substance...&quot; hey, this album may have been excessive in places, but it was a heck of a lot more exciting to listen to than James Taylor OR Grand Funk Railroad back in 1971! Ian Anderson and company COOKED as a musical group at this time. Martin Barre, THE most underrated guitarist in rock, steams along with an energy that soars without going into riff-happy overdrive. John Evan and Clive Bunker also have talent to burn and if painter-turned-bassist Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond isn't quite in everybody else's league musically, he at least isn't a stone around the band's collective necks. But it's Ian Anderson's nimble singing and nimbler flute-playing that carry the whole shebang forward. If his lyrics are a little twee in the title song and &quot;My God,&quot; they're marvelous to hear in &quot;Mother Goose&quot; and &quot;Cross-Eyed Mary,&quot; and special kudos goes to &quot;Wond'ring Aloud,&quot; one of Anderson's prettiest ballads.<br />Do believe the hype. This really is a CLASSIC rock album!
B00005LW7R|2.0|Prior to hearing this recording, I didn't think it was actually possible to kill Verdi's comic masterpiece, but Abbado tries awfully hard.  The tempos start out swift but the accents aren't pointed, and by the end of the second act the whole thing sinks into a lagubrious mire.  Terfel acts Falstaff superbly, giving a true Shakespearean dimension to the role, but \\"L'onore! Ladri!\\" and \\"Quand'ero paggio\\" do not a total performance make.  The women sing well, though Larissa Diadkova is awfully disappointing after one has heard Angelina Cravcenko, Cloe Elmo or Christa Ludwig in the role.  Daniil Shtoda has a nice comprimario tenor voice, and is a slight improvement on the Fenton of Toscanini's 1950 performance, but the Toscanini performance practically bristles with life compared to this.  In short: no humor, no sparkle, no momentum, and an opaque, fuzzy orchestral sound that just doesn't make it.  If you want a good digital reading, search out the 1980 Karajan performance (audio or video) with Kabaivanska, Perry, Ludwig, Araiza, Taddei and Panerai; if you want the best overall performance, get the 1937 Toscanini-Vienna Philharmonic version with Somigli, Vasari, Cravcenko, Borgioli, Biasini and Stabile; but even the 1950 Toscanini recording is better than this.  Big, big disappointment to me, who usually admires Abbado in comic opera.
B00002SSRZ|2.0|I wrote the following review on the DVD-Audio DTS 5.1 surround release of Abraxas, _NOT_ the CD remaster. It should've never appeared here with the remasterd CD reviews. Appearently Amazon[.com] has discontinued selling the DVD-Audio release of Abraxas, in my opinion Santana's finest album, and good riddance. Santana's Abraxas is certainly a 5 star album, and unless you're a vinyl purist who prefers original LP releases (like me), the remastered CD is the way to hear it. The DVD-Audio release, which sold for nearly twice as much, is not.  This is why...<br />Original DVD-Audio DTS 5.1 surround review from July, 2002:<br />After listening to this on my roomate's DTS 5.1 surround system and being less than impressed, I got motivated enough to go wandering eBay for a functioning Quad 8-Track player. I had this thoery that it was basically just the old quad master transfered to a DTS 5.1 DVD-A. In case you're too young to remember, Abraxas was released during the peak of Quad's popularity. After a little hunting, I found a respectable old Akai Quad-8 deck, and hooked it up to the 4 \\"video aux\\" analog surround inputs on his new reciever. It was laughably funny seeing the 8-track player sitting with the new reciever, HiFi VCR and DVD/CD player, until we popped in the Santana Quad-8 cartridge I rescued from a thrift store. I lost my bet; the DTS 5.1 CD was definatly a different mix. And a rather sad one by comparison. The Quad-8 had tape hiss, sure, but it wasn't much to put up with in exchange for much fuller bass and an overall better mix. We had drummers at seemingly random places all around us and at times it seemed the guitars were swirling around our heads. Unnatural, yes, but in 1970, that's what Rock in quad was all about, and when you really think about it, DTS 5.1 really is the digital re-birth of quad. Perhaps the DTS 5.1 should've been made from the original quad masters; changing it was messing with a classic. I had a few, and now I'm on a mission to find moreQuad-8 tapes! Long live analog surround!<br />-- Dan Dan Leimone
B000069HK2|5.0|I am so proud of these guys, Yes they are from my hometown of Orem Utah, I never thought I would see a band from my hometown get to have fans all over the USA. It is motivational and it's really kind of cool. They write great music and if you like them you can check them out on the Warped Tour 2002 CD compilation. And on the Atticus CD, Dragging The Lake. These guys really do Rock, not just because they are from my hometown, but because they rock when you see them live in concert too! Buy the CD and show them that you support them!!!!!!!
B0000640SA|1.0|I read the earlier review that gave this limited edition a ONE STAR and was a bit \\"offended\\". <br />I, too, LOVE this movie.  So I ignored the reviewer and purchased the \\"limited edition\\" thinking it would be better than just the \\"normal\\" edition.<br />How frustrating is this edition.   Perhaps there is some rhyme or reason to the STUPID quiz at the beginning which EVENTUALLY will lead you to the special features, but all it ended up doing for me was PISSING ME OFF!!!!!!!   It served no purpose as far as I was concerned.<br />I returned to the store today where I bought it, who's policy is that OPENED DVD's may only be returned for the SAME item.<br />I pleaded with the clerk to let me exchange it for the NORMAL DVD version, explaining that the price is the same or less than the LIMITED EDITION and... \\"it's basically the same movie\\".<br />Fortunately, he agreed.   I now own the NORMAL DVD and am much more content with my purchase.<br />Stay away from this limited edition...
B00005TT77|5.0|This is a wonderful collection of Beatles songs.Although it is impossible to forget the original versions, this soundtrack gives us a chance to hear the songs interpreted and personalized by different artists. I have a wide collection of CD's, but this is one of my favorites. It will be treasured by people of all ages.
B00005OWEG|1.0|Kung Fu Joe, your mission, should you be boozed up enough to accept it, is to discredit all American servicemen who served in Vietnam by making it seem that the war was prosecuted in the field by the wild bunch of out-of-control cowboys and psychopaths the movie-indoctrinated American public readily imagines is an accurate representation of the average soldier in Vietnam.  Why is this?  Because leftist filmmakers and writers whose basic anti-Americanism would not be nervy enough to produce a WWII picture wherein the men under arms behave in such a way as to make a khat-chewing, technical-operating juiced-up Somali look like a level-headed and competent soldier WOULD jump at the chance to vilify the American soldiers who fought competently and bravely in the Vietnam war.  This film and others like it are a shameful extension of the vilification of soldiers that occurred at the time of the Vietnam war.  Rather than being respectful tributes to the many men who tragically lost their lives in the war, such movies basically spit on the graves of American soldiers by creating and perpetuating the myth of the ubiquitous ugly GI that is supposed to typify the men of the Vietnam war.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|It was one of those movies that at first I was unsure about.  I rented it, watched it, and was amazed.  The movie itself is beautiful... the acadamy awards that it won for costume design was worth it.  The art of the movie is also interesting... the sets of the nightclub and surrounding area is eyecatching.  Plus, Satine's room is inside an elephant!!!<br />The music for this particular musical is something completely different from other musicals.  Instead of original songs (although, I guess you could call the way they use each and every song original), they use a myriad of other songs.  THe soundtrack includes \\"Your Song\\" by Elton John, \\"All You Need is Love\\" by The Beatles, \\"I Will Always Love You\\" by Dolly Parton, \\"Like a Virgin\\" by Madonna, the theme from \\"The Sound of Music,\\" the French can-can, and, to my amusement, \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" by Nirvana, and countless others.  Each of these songs is used in a way completely different than what is expected... and even though this movie is set in 1899-1900, the music works.  It goes from strange to reassuring to hear songs that you are already familiar with being sung by all the characters.<br />Finally, the actors are wonderful.  I never knew that Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor could sing!<br />If you haven't seen this movie, definately check it out, and try to stay with the movie until the tragic end.  I've known a few people turned off by the strangeness of it, but I've known more to enjoy it.
0312265859|5.0|Although this was far from my favorite in this wonderful and quirky series, it did not disappointment in the entertainment department.  I do not read Janet Evanovich's books for the mystery element (there are much better mystery writers); I read them for the non-stop slapstick humor and oddball characters and, like the previous books, Hard Eight had me laughing out loud from start to finish.  Remembering the dryer scene with Kloughn alone still makes me break out in spasms of giggles.  Two complaints:  Although I missed Grandma, who only has small scenes, I loved the annoying new character Klough.  However, Ms. Evanovich, more of Grandma Mazur in #9 please.  Secondly, the love scene with Ranger was nothing but a fleeting moment after all the sexual tension and build up.  Surely it deserved more ink!
B00005JKQX|2.0|Not that I expected a documentary, but playing John Nash's delusions straight for the bulk of the film and then jumping out and yelling \\"Surprise!\\" reminded me a bit of the Ewings trying to pick up their lives after Bobby died, in \\"Dallas,\\" and then having him show up in the shower the following season because Pam was dreaming for all of last season. It was a cheap trick.<br />This film exploited Nash's schizophrenic hallucinations at the expense of the very real handicaps he had to overcome, and I didn't appreciate it one bit.
B00005QDW1|1.0|I would know, because I did download it. I couldn't risk wasting my money after hearing their last 2 albums and all the filler tracks on them. This CD is no different - Hey Baby and Hella Good are good songs with a creative new No Doubt sound, but that is pretty much where it ends. The lyrics on this album are absolutely terrible, but you can tell that from the first 2 singles (&quot;you got me feeling hella good so lets just keep on dancing&quot; - give me a break). The only reason those are tolerable is because the music is pretty good. If you like music with absolutely no substance then maybe you will find this CD halfway enjoyable - otherwise save your money and your bandwidth.
B000002H6C|5.0|Its very sad but you look in magazines saying that Motley Crue or Slayer has the best metal CD ever but they always underlook this one.  Truly its brutal and honest and takes no prisoners.  The album truly has no flaws except for the fact that because of the crappy production the bass guitar of Jason Newstead is no where to be heard.  But the album drags you in with the creepy beginning to Blackened but then slays your senses in the most brutal fashion by shoving an onslaught of speed metal.  But the albums glory no doubt belongs to To Live Is Too Die.  If you understand the big story of Cliff Burtons death then this song brings tears to your eyes.  Metallica show they have hearts but writing the most beautiful peace of music in the past century.  Not to down tracks like Shortest Straw and Harvestor Of Sorrows kill you over and over again with hallacious lyrics and brutal licks.  One is one of Metallicas masterpieces.  It is simply amazing from every aspect.  It has a brutal end and is killer start to finish.  And to justiy the albums superioty the last track Dyers Eve is Metallicas fastest and hardest song to date.  It is rumored that it is so hard that the band cant even play it!  Kirk does his best solo ever and Jaymz does wonderful double tracking on the song.  The rest of the albums tracks are mostly overlooked but are truly masterpieces in their own right.  The album truly has no flaws at all from start to finish.  I still dont understand how Hetfeild was able to double track with such persistions.  <BR>For sure And Justice For All is Metallicas best work.  Forget the Black Album or Master Of Puppets, And Justice For All is the greatest work of metal the world will ever know.
B0000640VN|5.0|First, let me echo the sentiments stated earlier:  this is a very nice escapist film containing excellent performances.  I had never really planned to watch it, fearing a tired re-tread of earlier movies with the too-familiar time traveller and his wacky antics in the modern world.  Fortunately, the mood struck me today and I watched this DVD... ALL of this DVD (including commentaries and extras), which took several hours.  Those who wrote earlier reviews touched on the story and the fine job done by both Jackman and Ryan, so I won't dwell on those points except to reiterate that the film is worth your time.<BR>  What I would like to comment on is how different the two versions of the film contained on the DVD really are.  The disk contains both the original theatrical release and the director's cut.  If you are a real movie aficionado and plan to watch both versions, let me recommend that you watch the theatrical release first and then watch the longer, unedited director's cut second.  It amazed me how much the deletion of just a few minor scenes and snippets of dialogue can alter a movie's basic story. There are some major plot differences between the two versions, the main one centering around a relationship between two of the characters that doesn't exist at all in the edited version (I won't spoil by going into further detail).  My personal preference is for the edited version, but you can make up your own mind.  You can listen to Mangold's feature-length commentary for either version, but let me offer additional advice: watch the commentary for the director's cut, even if you have only watched the theatrical version.  That way you can still experience both versions even if you're too strapped for time to watch the movie three times (imagine that!)  This DVD definitely is not at a loss for extra features!  Anyway, you will enjoy Kate &amp; Leopold, regardless of how you choose to experience it.
0767830555|5.0|Robert De Niro stars as a lonely taxi driver named Travis Bickle in this Martin Scorsese film about alienation and the human desire to belong.  Travis is a single New Yorker that is having problems sleeping at night so he decides to drive a taxi to help keep him busy.  You quickly learn that Travis hates most of the people in the city, remarking that they are all \\"pushers, pimps, thieves, crooks...\\" among some other things.  The only thing that seems to keep Travis going is his apparent love for a young campaign worker named Betsy(Cybil Shepard).  He gets enough guts to ask her out on a date and she excepts.  On their second date you learn of Travis's inexperience in dating since he takes Betsy to a \\"dirty movie\\".  It is then that she dumps him and Travis begins to slip into the realm of psychotic.  He buys a handful of guns and begins to work out vigorously.  Travis then meets a twelve year-old prostitute named Iris(Jodie Foster) who is working for a small-time pimp named Matthew or Sport(Harvey Keitel).  Travis decides to become her body guard which eventually leads him to violence.  Taxi Driver is a film that can seem shocking and vulgar to some, but also as a masterpiece to many others.  If you are planning on buying Taxi Driver I suggest you buy the Special Edition DVD because it has better picture and sound than the VHS version and also has a 90-minute documentary on the making of the film.  So sit back, get a soda and watch one of the greatest films that the 70's has to offer!
0425170349|5.0|Although I'd read the book several months ago, I still recall it as an exciting and uncomplicated read, compared to Clancy's other books, i.e Red October. It limits the amount of technical jargon and describes how an elite international strike force is recruited, trains and is deployed to various areas around the globe. I recommend it to any Clancy fan's summer reading list.
6300182193|5.0|When I saw this movie several years ago as a kid, I was really impressed. I just bought it several days ago, and I love this movie! Unlike most other versions of Dracula, the whole movie was both exciting, terrifying, and mysterious. Langella is surpassed only by Lugosi. Both deliver suave,sinister, mysterious, and charismatic performances. Langella brings a slight sympathetic element to Dracula, though. The plot was fabulous and original. It begins with the doomed schooner crashing into Whitby's shores, where Dracula has purchased Carfax Abbey. From there, the film is somewhat like the Lugosi version, but still keeps originality. The special effects were wonderful! My personal favorite scene is when Harker and VanHelsing confront Dracula is Carfax. They find his coffin empty, and suddenly Dracula appears out of thin air behind them. The music by the legendary John Williams was fabulous and perfect for the movie. All the acting was great, but Renfield could have used a bit more polishing. This and the Lugosi original are the BEST Dracula's ever!
0312265859|5.0|I have been frustrated with the last 3 Stephanie Plum books.  Books 5, 6, and 7 were reruns of the previous four.   <br />This one was still funny, but not to the point of nausea. The relationship between Joe, Ranger(who I am not a fan of), and Stephanie seemed a little more defined... although Stephanie still doesn't seem to know who or what she wants.  Stephanie comments in this novel that 'somewhere along the line Joe has grown up'.  Will Stephanie-or will that destroy the story?
0440234743|4.0|I have read most of Grisham's books. This is one of my top three.  He does a good job making Nate O'Riley look like a genuine burnt-out lawyer, but you don't hate him.  I was pulling for Nate after a few chapters.<br />The overall siuation, billionare leaves all his money to an illigetimate child who is now a missionary in South America is obviously far fetched to say the least - but I kept reading the story anyway.<br />I like how it ended and would probably pick up its sequel if one was ever written.
B000003TSP|3.0|It's always been my hobby to explore different styles of music with the help of amazon, the rolling stone, other magazines and friends. Then I try to review this music as honestly and objectively as I can and help other people that way. Sometimes it's very hard like in the case of Portishead.<BR>'Portishead' was highly recommended wherever I went and I was sure it wouldn't disappoint me. In a way it didn't. First of all I'd like to say Beth Gibbons' vocals are beautiful and very complete, the arrangements are impressive, I even think Portishead have the best drums. 'Over' was the first song to persuade me completely with 'Only You' and others to follow. I listen to Portishead mostly at night and Beth Gibbons' voice quickly takes me to the world of dreams where I'd be later in. However, I always need fresh air after my Portishead sessions, that automatically means Portishead out of my CD player. In contrast to that, Tricky, who is supposed to be from the same gang as Portishead, delivers music for all times of day though people believe his work to be depressive.<BR>Some critics say 'Portishead' is a classic but I disagree on this one. Each track of a classic album must have a different mood which just isn't the case on 'Portishead'. Or it's the vocals that have to vary, that means a male voice to sing along with Beth Gibbons which would be perfect. These two facts prevent 'Portishead' from being a classic album- on this occasion I'd like recommend Tricky. No disrespect to Portishead but I wanna share a funny thought with other listeners.  'Portishead' was recorded in 1997 but it sounds like a depressed Marilyn Monroe singing into a four track and Portishead inventing the arrangements(Marilyn, we love and miss ya forever!!). All in all worth the money and I hope Portishead read my review, have a good laugh and make it even better next time.
0385335482|5.0|I loved this book. It was a good read and it was light hearted and funny. I can't wait to read the next one!!
B00005QDW1|2.0|well.. this album is completely different from something like tragic kingdom. I really liked tragic kingdom, I don't really like this. I guess you have to respect them for being willing to change their musical direction. But... unfortunately unhappy heartbroken Gwen Stefani made for better lyrics and music than happy content Gwen Stefani. Most of these songs have a real lack of depth. There is not one &quot;deep&quot; song on the album. Which can be ok. It's a fun album. Nothing special.

B000002G0P|5.0|This album is definitely one of the most underated rock albums of all time! That is partially due to the fact, that it was not really heard by the public, except for die hard fans! It was also released at the wrong time. It should have come out around the new millinium, with bands like CREED and their spiritual message and music! Only a few singles were released from this album but by that time, NIRVANA were beginning to rear their ugly head. It may sound like I am ripping on Nirvana and it is because I kind of am. It is a known fact, that at one point Kurt Cobain threw shots at EXTREME...why? Because he was jealous that they could write amazing songs, maybe he should have listened to this album, along with the music industry...but we all know they don't know what they are doing! Just check out \\"AM I EVER GONNA CHANGE\\" and if that doen't make you want to pick up this album, well then...you are probably never gonna change!!! PEACE!!!
B00003CXXR|4.0|Not a bad sequel. It's one of those movies that you go to the theater for some fun. If you have read both books by Michael Crichton, then you'll notice some familiar parts in this third installment that did not make it into the previous two films. Speilberg now has an idea for Jurassic Park 4. I'm hoping it will be a continuation of the story line that was set up in the first movie, how Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight) was hired by Biosyn to steal embryos. Maybe Biosyn and Ingen will have a showdown!! Or, Jurassic Park will finally be built safe for visitors!
B00005614N|5.0|Sometimes a set of music is a no brainer. Duke Ellington's piano backing Up Louis Armstrong through 17 of Duke's greatest hits should be all one would need to say. The music here is simply timeless. Backed by Danny Barcelona on drums, Matt Herbert on bass, and the overlooked Barney Bigard on clarinet Pops and the Duke swing hard from top to bottom. It is hard to hear &quot;In A Mellow Tone&quot;, &quot;Dukes Place&quot;, or &quot;Don't Get Around Much Anymore&quot; without cracking a smile and tapping your foot. This is a classic recording that should appeal to fans of music outside of jazz and goes without saying that it should be in all jazz collections!
0553282980|3.0|In comparison to the movie, the book doesn't convey that many feelings and emotions. In fact some scenes are written quite affectionately so they really touch you. <BR>But on the whole I think the book is a fairly short reproduction of the film.<BR>And even though the book is a shorter presentation of the story, it is nice to read -especially it allowes you to take a closer look at the poems! And since the story is just breathtaking, it seems impossible to write a &quot;bad&quot; book about it!
0380725398|5.0|As this story opens, Mary Yellan's mother dies leaving this young adult on her own in a dangerous time.  On her deathbed her mother tells her to go live with her Aunt Patience at an inn called Jamaica Inn near the Cornish coast (Corwall, England).  Immediately upon arrival at Jamaica Inn she knows something is wrong since her once colorful Aunt Patience has turned into a simpering wimp and her Uncle Joss Merlyn is a towering cruel character with dubious past and present.  Soon Mary learns about criminal activities surrounding Jamaica Inn and it's inhabitants.  She is drawn into a mystery so intense and frightening that she'll brave the trecherous moors to escape.<br /><br />This is one Daphne Du Maurier's best books.  Don't miss this tale of twisted greed and terrible peril -- this is an EXCELLENT book that'll keep you up past your bedtime as you won't be able to put this book down!  Buy it!  This book earned itself a permanent place on my shelf!

B00003CY5J|3.0|I don't know. After watching the film HEAT, this gangster film (about a guy who is on the verge of retirement) really leaves little to be desired. It lacks depth. Too much action without emotion. I didn't grow to care about any of the characters. Predictable too-- so much so, that I felt my intelligence was a little insulted. I love De Niro, don't get me wrong. He is a gift from the heavens. I just think that his talent was wasted in this one. For your average Hollywood thrill seeker, this movie might be entertaining. But for me, it didn't do much to my emotions. Now, HEAT... ahhh, that's another story--- spectacular!
0743200799|4.0|Gene's account provides historical background to the development of the backroom operations of the space flight, thing that he made glamorous. His TV appearance on the Apolo 13 was more forceful, the book is subdued and at time repititious. On the whole it's a readable account, particularly for those who are trying to round out the events.
B000001DTM|5.0|U2 is probably one of the greatest rock bands ever created and Achtung Baby has reaffirmed that time and time again.  This CD isn't as political as War, but it's just as appealing. Their hit &quot;One&quot; is probably my favorite U2 song for this reason :It shows that a relationship won't last if one person won't carry their own weight.  Another one is that there is hope when they try to accept their differences.  &quot; Until the End of the World&quot; sounds kind of futuristic and I like that!  &quot; So Cruel&quot; is a haunting ballad about two lovers who have drifted apart.    <BR>&quot; Acrobat &quot; is a slow, un-heavy-metal like way of telling u not 2 let naysayers bring u down.  It offers hope by saying that your day will come and that nothing bad will stay.      <BR>      The vocals on this are amazing and this is a CD that I would listen to again and again!
B00003CWNR|3.0|Well acted and interesting story centered around New England orphanage.  Toby Maguire plays orphan/physician's assistant to Michael Caine's gruff but loveable doctor/abortionist.  Although essentially a subtle paen to the abortion culture, the movie is redeemed *somewhat* by its interesting characterizations, beautiful cinematography and fine acting by the principals.  The pro-abortion innuendoes are all too apparent to students of this violence.  Yet in a curious and inexplicable lapse, the producers fail to justify their &quot;safe abortions&quot; premise--virtually all of those involved in the crime meet unhappy fates!  Still, a good film if one knows how to objectify these things.
B00004RF97|5.0|If you haven't already seen this movie, get it right away! The Philadelphia Story is an excellent and intelligent comedy full of witty dialogue and amusing situations. For some reason, movies like this one seem to be in short supply now. The quick, hilarious dialogue used so well in The Philadelphia Story has, for the most part, been replaced by special effects, violence, and obscene language.<br />Anyhow, as for the cast, it couldn't be any better. Cary Grant, Katherine Hepburn, and Jimmy Stewart - that says it all. Furthermore, they each give performances in TPS that could be considered among the best in their respective careers (which says a lot).<br />Cary Grant adds surprising depth to the role of C.K. Dexter Haven - his sly, funny glances and quick comebacks steal scene after scene! He is a talented comedian who made it look easy: but, as usual, he was ignored by the Academy Awards. Katherine Hepburn also does a wonderful job. She, with her aristocratic voice and haughty, proud looks, is perfectly suited to the role of Tracy Lord. Last, but not least, Jimmy Stewart is very funny as the sarcastic reporter.<br />The DVD is great, but you don't need to get it for the special features. The movie itself is a must have!
0312265859|3.0|Is eight enough?  Or is that \\"Are eight enough\\"?<br />I will admit that I have read all eight of Evanovich's Stephanie Plum novels.  And I will admit that they make me laugh.  I bought Hard Eight for a vacation read, and read it aloud to my wife as she drove us from South Carolina back to Virginia.  It was her first taste of Plum, and there were times she laughed so hard she nearly drove us off Interstate 95.<br />In this episode,\\"bounty hunter\\" Plum undertakes a freebie on behalf of a neighbor whose granddaughter, Evelyn has gone missing, taking her own daughter Annie with her.  Because there is a child custody bond payable to Evelyn's ex, if Annie doesn't return, the search is somewhat up Plum's alley.  Not only does Evelyn's ex want to find her, so does her landlord, Abruzzi, a truly evil man who likes to play war games.  Plum's investigation finds her the object of evil games and even murder attempts by an oversized rabbit, a bear, Bill Clinton and even Richard Nixon.  With the usual help of Ranger, Morelli, Grandma Mazur, Lula and (surprisingly) her mother, Plum is able to....   well read the book and find out.<br />Evanovich has a good schtick going, but one would think that Stephanie would eventually learn such basic elements of capturing FTA's as taking the keys out of the ignition to her car, loading her pistol and keeping track of her handcuffs.  <br />Hard Eight is amusing fluff, as are its prececessor novels, but the theme is growing tiresome for this reader.
0316666343|5.0|this book reminds me of the books that I used to read when I was a child - one of those books that you pick up and can't put down until you finish - and then you feel a bit sad when it is done, because you have become so involved with the characters that you almost feel that you are one of them.  I can't say enough good things about this book. The subject matter, murder, initially put me off, until I read an excerpt of the book on Amazon (the whole 30 pages, as a matter of fact) and was completely taken in. THe writing is so crisp. One feels as if he/she is hearing Susie's thoughts, and the author seems to have a perfect recollection of a fourteen year old's mind and what would be important in her world. The book is about death, of course, but it is compelling in that the book's secret is that it is really about LIFE, who we are, the choices that we make, how we live our lives, how the lives of others affect us, and how we are perceived by others. Susie takes us on a wonderful journey through her own heaven and realizations about life, love and family, and we see the journeys of those closest to her. This book is so fantastic! Check it out!!
B000008GS2|5.0|When I was almost done with High School there was this one song that I had heard in a video on MTV, and it was &quot;Crazy,&quot; from this album, which had me haunted. The video began with a DJ (Iva Davies, the band's leader) in Sidney, Australia (where the band is from) giving good morning to his listeners, as a gal calls in, with the first rays of sunshine sipping in through the blinds of the transmission booth... as the first cords of the guitar start to sound in the background. I thought it was an incredible intro to an incredible song. Transports me to 1988, but still sounds great in the 21st century. Enjoy!

B00001OH7P|5.0|If Sergeant Pepper was the soundtrack to the psychedelic Summer of Love (1967), Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars was the soundtrack to the glitter/glam rocking 1972.  While The Beatles' message was to get high with a little help from your friends, Bowie's was to \\"freak out in a moonage daydream\\" and \\"let the children boogie.\\"  <br />Bowie as Ziggy, the gender-bending alien rocker, along with his band, The Spiders from Mars, led by axman guitarist extraordinaire Mick Ronson, mesmerized the earthling listener on the opening track \\"Five Years\\" with his apocalyptic science fiction vision.  On \\"Soul Love,\\" David whips out his sax, combining with an acoustic guitar track to create an intoxicating cosmic groove -- picture Mr. Spock boogieing on \\"Soul Train\\" and you get the idea.  Beam us up, Ziggy!  Bowie's and Ronson's string arrangements on the album are lush and dramatic, providing a cinematic quality to the disc, comparable to George Martin's work with The Fab Four.  <br />The \\"Rise\\" of Ziggy is depicted in the testosterone-driven songs \\"Star\\" and \\"Hang on to Yourself.\\"  (Check out the red-hot live versions on Bowie's fine double album Stage.)  The classic title cut tells of the spaceman's fall, Ziggy's inflated ego, and a murder spelling the end of the band.  The incendiary hard-rocker \\"Suffragette City\\" and coda \\"Rock 'N' Roll Suicide\\" complete the album.  \\"Suicide\\" is Bowie's \\"A Day in the Life,\\" with its final violin note suspended for dramatic effect.  <br />Ziggy is a conceptual tour de force by Bowie and Co.  For fans of the glam rock movement of the early '70s, Ziggy, T.Rex's Electric Warrior, and Lou Reed's Transformer are essential listening.  A production masterpiece for sure, Ziggy is also David's finest studio album and a rock and roll landmark.

B000002KIE|3.0|Never Mind the Bollocks, released to so much fanfare in 1977, has all the energy of an English soccer match gone to hell.  The Sex Pistols were always more about appearances than good music.  If it's attitude and image you want, you came to the right place.  For good music, the debut albums of the group's punk contemporaries, The Clash and The Ramones, should be given first consideration.  In fact, after this album things receded to lower depths, as Sid Vicious, who couldn't sing or play bass to save his life, became a more primary figure.  But he looked damned damning.  <br />Musically, my favorite cut is \\"Anarchy in the U.K.,\\" but after that it is a step considerably downhill.  However, while I do not think the Sex Pistols were musical maestros, their raw power put some needed spark into the rock and roll scene of the time.  Still more significant are Johnny Rotten's venomous vocals, full of sarcasm and contempt for society.  Indeed, the group's lyrics in this album are laced with striking disturbing images, as well as negative political and social statements, that captured the public's imagination.  The significance of The Sex Pistols should not be underestimated.

B000001FK3|5.0|If you think \\"They Call Me The Breeze\\" sounds exactly like \\"Lay Down Sally\\" it's no accident. Clapton openly credits J.J. Cale with much of his \\"shuffle\\" influence. Likewise Knofler, though \\"Really\\" was probably his favorite album. <br />This album is straight out of the 70's and very home-made sounding. They actually used a wooden Coke case as an percussion instrument. The engineering is poor, but adequate. Lots of things jump out when they could have been much better handled. We didn't care much in those days, but now it can be jarring. <br />J.J.'s \\"Really\\" album is the other great opus, and most of the songs are better engineered, with real studio musicians (fantastic piano and bass & better drums). J.J. is not better known because he didn't WANT to be better known. At one concert where he was sitting in on guitar he almost fell off his stool when the spotlight landed on him. Important music history here.

B00003CXSP|5.0|Anthony Hopkins reprises his role of Hannibal Lecter in the sequel to \\"Silence of the Lambs.\\"  Although \\"Hannibal\\" is not as intriguing or intense as \\"Silence,\\" it still provides a night of good (albeit gross) entertainment.  Here we see Hannibal Lecter living a seemingly \\"normal\\" life in Italy and Clarice Starling (now portrayed by Julianne Moore) struggling in the FBI.  To be honest some scenes in this film are sick and others are so outrageous they can only be called funny.  The additional and alternate footage on the DVD is good and better than the original theatrical release, however, my only regret is that the alternate ending did not end like Thomas Harris' novel.  For those wanting true perversion, I suggest buying a copy of it as well.

B00005JKNF|2.0|A normally outstanding cast makes up a so-so whodunit, focusing on the stark contrasts between the well-to-do and the working class servants who take care of them.  &quot;Gosford Park&quot; has too many people whose identities get lost in this myriad of affluence.  Yes, the cast is great (hence the 2 star rating) but it's hard to tell who's who, no less than whodunit.  Perhaps a smaller cast would be better or better yet...if everyone wore nametags to identify themselves.

Poor, poor unhappy people they must be.  As you read their reviews, it's as if they purchased the CD expecting virtuosity (actually, there really is some good music behind this).  How can people so completely miss the point of an album?  This guy is out there, rockin' his --- off and having a good time.  Fortunately for us, he cares enough to share the fun.  Buy the CD, spread the fun to your friends and consider that your part in trying to cure the world of these sad, blind, hypercritical, no-fun-having children.  Hopefully they'll loosen up and smile.
B00004VXF2|5.0|This album is Lou's answer to La Monte Young's brilliant 1960 work, &quot;Poem for Tables, Chairs and Benches, etc.&quot;.  The irony of &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot; is that any four minutes of the album is (enjoyably) more listenable than 90% of current Top 40 radio dreck.  It is truly a rare occurrence when modern mainstream music possesses an element that is both affecting and artistic.     <br />Industrial cacophony and unrelenting, yet impossibly beautiful, feedback is not everyone's cup of tea; therefore, it's understandable that &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot; is one of the most misunderstood records of the past 30 years.  <br />Without &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot;, there would be no Sonic Youth, no Nirvana.  Sonic Youth's &quot;Sister&quot; LP is clearly influenced by &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot;.<br />If you find &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot; pleasurable and wish to pursue similar avenues of profoundly attractive white noise, most releases by Skullflower and Total (especially their albums on the Seattle-based label Majora) are uniquely gorgeous.
B000066NW0|5.0|If I was to describe this CD in one word...AWESOME! One of the best female artists to hit the scene in a long time. This CD knocked my socks off.  My husband (a hard-core rocker) loves this CD! Her music appeals to the rocker and the pop lover - she is an incredible talent.  Best track on the album &quot;Losing my grip&quot; it rocks!
B000008H1Y|5.0|The years 1977 and 1978 marked a transition for Ian Anderson and Jethro Tull, from explosively creative, cerebral, urban working-class themes, best exemplified by albums like Too Old to Rock 'n Roll: Too Young to Die (1976) and War Child (1974), to more basic yet polished, beautiful folk-influenced acoustic pieces. The albums Songs from the Wood (1977) and Heavy Horses (1978) represent this extraordinary and very central period in the evolution of Tull. <br />Songs from the Wood shows the remarkable depth of Ian Anderson as a song writer. The melodies are energetic while retaining the underlying rustic, rural feel of the album, and range from the structured, clearly projected, expressive, more distinctly folk-inspired acoustic songs like Songs from the Wood, Jack-in-the-Green, Cup of Wonder and Velvet Green to the more vibrant, bold compositions such as Ring Out, Solstice Bells and The Whistler. The lyrics are all pure, luminous Tull poetry. The band is on solid footing after having replaced bassist Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond with John Glascock. This was probably Tull's best and most talented band, with John Evan superbly on keyboards, Barriemore Barlow on drums, and the incredibly dynamic lead guitar of Martin Barre which is brilliant in Pibroch (Cap in Hand), one of album's most creative tracks.<br />Great music is to a large degree about nuance. A good composition will have the listener returning for repeated listenings. Songs from the Wood will have the listener coming back for more to gain new and deeper appreciation each time.
B00005YW4H|5.0|On paper, it sounds unbelievable: how can an artist blend jazz, R&amp;B, and country on one album? Only someone like Norah Jones -- a musician who undertands minimalism and understatement (from the instrumentation on her tracks to their average length of about 3 minutes), and possesses such a silky, otherworldy voice, could make this combination work. There is nothing on the record that brings jazz to mind, however; I'd sooner call it ambient music than jazz. She never cuts loose and belts, but instead maintains a languid pace in which the listener is guided through and then slowly enveloped by each song. This album is a soothing, beautiful piece of artistry that is cohesive, consistent, and thoroughly enjoyable.<br />It is in comparisons to other artists -- particularly jazz or R&amp;B artists -- that Norah Jones seems to disappoint some listeners. A few guitar solos bring the country influence along, and I suppose her slow, smooth vocal style is what inspires some to cite R&amp;B influences in her work. But taken on its own merits (which are many and substantial), &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; is a wonderful record for quiet, reflective time, created by an obviously reflective artist. I am not a fan of jazz or country music, and I cannot recommend this album highly enough.
0784011796|3.0|The movie had it's good points and bad points.  It began very well, depicting the main character as a paranoid, somewhat idiosyncratic mathematician, showing his complex method of thought, taking his principles learned in mathematics and applying them to life and philosophy.  As the movie progressed, however, the mathematic reasoning declined to the point that computers achieving cognitant thought came into play.  The theological reasoning was extremely flawed as well.  For example, Chassidic Jews (portrayed badly) wanted the 216 digit number from the main character to bring about the Messianic age, saying that the number was the Hebrew name for G-d that would allow the Kohein Gadol to bring them closer to this age.  Given that it contained 216 characters, and Hebrew is not written using vowels, the Kohein would not know how to pronounce this name, even if he had it! (The niqudot were not included.)  Furthermore, the movie failed to mention that the only name the Kohein Gadol used to use in the Yom Kippur service in the Holy of Holies was the Tetragrammaton, the four letter name of G-d that is known today, not some mystical 216 letter name.  As I said, the movie began as a culturally diverse depiction of the world of a mathematic genius, but degenerated into his fight for survival at the hands of Chassidic Jews wanting a nonexistant name which causes computers to gain self awareness.
B0000072VM|5.0|Of PFM's two best albums; this is the better one compared to Storio de Minute. The 5th track, in particular, is awesome with great keyboarding. It reminds me of Chris Squires' Canon Song on Fish out Of Water - including a heavy bass synthesizer and orchestral counterpoints.<br />It really is some of the very best Prog Rock ever produced. Italian lyricks add to the overall effect.
B00005K3OT|5.0|This had to be one of the years' best movies. I just loved it, and Johnny Depp was such a pleasent surprise.<br />It's a feel good movie, that will make you glad that you decided to watch it.
6305165912|5.0|I knew there was something uniquely appealing about The Big Lebowski after seeing the previews back in 1998.  I saw it in the theaters and haven't stopped watching since.  A wonderful comedy with Jeff Bridges giving an absolutely great performance of &quot;The Dude&quot;.  I personally really like the supporting role of Julianne Moore as Maude, such dry wit, marvelous.  I can't think of any movie to compare this to, but I do know that all my friends at college enjoy this movie.  Share this film with your friends and I suspect the same will happen.
B000053VAF|5.0|What can I say? I just love the movie Dogma. The movie is so well written by Kevin Smith, that it really makes you think. Chris Rock, did a great job in his role, and I just loved George Carlin trying to give the Catholic Church a revamp that it needs so badly. (Something that it needs today.)<br />So go ahead and rent Dogma.....you'll be glad you did.
0783226160|5.0|Stuipd jokes, drinking, drugs, sex, food fights, cheating, breaking and entering....everything a good movie should have you will find inside Animal House, which I condiser one of the best movies of 1978, even though I wasn't born until 3 years later.  This movie is based on what college life was like in the 1960's, with all the drinking, drugs, sex, parties and crazy people in this movie.  The funniest characters are of course Bluto, Flounder and Pinto who fools around with the 14 year old Mayor's daughter of all girls *LOL*  This movie is just one laugh after another, most people know what Animal House is and have seen it 50+ times, but if you haven't even seen it once you owe the late John Boluchi the respect of seeing at least once.  Besides, thats all it takes.  Once you see it the first time it becomes a classic hit to you that you want to watch over and over again or at least any time there is nothing on tv or your cabel is out.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Even if you have never read the books, you can still fall in love with the movie. <br />Director Chris Columbus, did an excellent job bringing Harry and his friends to life. <br />The movie is great and entertaining for the entire family. It is a must see for everyone.
B00003CXAA|2.0|I eagerly awaited this title to be released on DVD, however when I received it how disappointed was I!!!<br />I have watched the Godfather many times on VHS format & had the luck to view it as it should be seen - starting from scicily right through to the end (with all the cut scenes included in the final film)<br />I sat down to watch & looked forward to a great evenings entertainment - I was disappointed!!<br />A great opportunity has been lost to release this film on DVD the way it was meant to be shown - I watch it more on VHS now, more than before!!<br />Maybe there will be a directors cut in the future!!<br />I live in hope
B00005QCYD|2.0|While I'm a huge fan of Jurassic Park, the last movie could have been much better. The characters weren't developed enough and the movie just moved along too quickly. <br />The movie did have scary parts in it and the dinasours were great, it just wasn't the same as the original. Maybe if Stephen Spielberg himself had directed it, it might have been better.
B00005NW02|5.0|after reveiwing this cd, i discovered that system of a down not only revolutionzed modern rock....they also created a new genre.  first, all the songs on the cd sound unique.  each member of the band is highlighted in each and every second of each track.  john dolmayan pounds on his drums and cymbals, making each fill in and beat match perfectly with the music.  shavo's smooth bass creates a strong deep tone and Daron's immaculate guitar skills shine on guitar creative melodies and solo's.  last but not least, serj tankian's great voice and deep lyrics contribute the finishing touches to perfect the band.  i recommend to EVERYONE to buy this cd and give it a chance.  you may think it is awkward at first.  but soon you will learn to grow upon it and love it.  system of a down's cd &quot;toxicity&quot; is truly a remarkable experience.
B000066NW0|2.0|yea well avril, u don't wanna sound like britney spears but, to me you sound like britney spears. with guitars. the lyrics are even worse than ones i can write by myself. I think this cd is a waste of time and hard earned money.
B000065U1N|5.0|God! I thought Saving Private Ryan was the best, most realistic war movie . . .ever (D-day part), but I guess I was wrong.<BR>  This movie is an account on modern warfare, you know, RPGs, gattling guns on helicopters,. . .and helicopters.<BR>  Starring \\"Pretty boy\\" Josh Hartnett (Pearl Harbor, 40 Days 40 nights) and Tom Sizemore (Saving Private Ryan) Black Hawk down is one of the most realistic, shocking accounts of war. And it's based on true events. Yes, I read the book; Blackburn really does fall out of a helicopter, there is a Sergeant Eversmann, and this raid DID happen. Enraged Somalies, a.k.a. Sammies or Skinnies with AK47s and about twenty soldiers WERE wounded.<BR>   The movie is disturbing, but not as much as it would be if they added in all the stuff AFTER the raid, you know, the Skinnies dragging (I think it was Bill Clevelands?) body around after the raid.<BR>  At the end, they tell what happens in the days after the raid, you know those two Delta snipers that come to rescue Mike Durrant and died? They were awarded Medal of Honors. <BR>  This is a masterpeice war movie directed by a great director (Ridely Scott) and it is realistic and gorey as a true war movie.
B000003BEV|5.0|&quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot; is by far my favorite Rolling Stones album. As the other reviews state, it is uncharacteristic of much of the band's more popular work, and is often unfavorably compared to Sgt. Pepper. A comparison between the two albums proves to be very interesting. The original lp cover of Satanic Majesties prepares you for the experience. While the similarity to Pepper's front cover is hard to miss, the Stone's 3D vision says that there is something spacier going on inside. The original album opened up to reveal a maze that you could not successfully navigate. This is another clue to the contents of the album, because Satanic Majesties is full of puzzling, beautiful, trippy music. It seems that TSMR starts where Sgt. Pepper ends. This doesn't mean that it is a better album; it just takes your mind to a farther, very often darker place. In fact, there is a recurring Sci-Fi feeling to many of the tracks. Satanic Majesties starts off with a nice sing-along number appropriately titled &quot;Sing This All Together&quot;. This tune and the lovely &quot;She's A Rainbow&quot; are the lighter moments of the album, and they are the beginnings of sides one and two respectively on the original album. &quot;2000 Light Years From Home&quot; creates a terrifying feeling of deep space loneliness, while &quot;Citadel&quot; and &quot;2000 Man&quot; seem to prophesize the paranoia of the 21st century. &quot;In Another Land&quot; speaks of dream states and astral travel to fantastic other worlds. In summary, there is a  mood being created when you listen to this album that almost plays like the soundtrack to some very far out movie. It's as if the Stones took the template of the Sgt. Pepper lp and veered off into their own direction. When they finally land on planet Earth, they &quot;see us safely to the door&quot; with the album's closer &quot;On With The Show&quot;. The journey is over, but with &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot; you can take off again anytime.off again anytime.
6305907145|1.0|This is the worst Jane Austen movie adaptation I've seen thus far, with the exception of the 80s Northanger Abbey adaptation. The 80s version of Mansfield Park is surpasses this by far and stays very true to Jane Austen's brilliant novel (as all her novels are). I was greatly disappointed with the way Miramax completely butchered this story. I found some parts of the film to be truly frightening. I advise any Jane Austen fan to stay clear of this horrific adaptation! Go watch A&E's Pride and Prejudice instead of wasting your time on this...
B000002LND|5.0|This collection is certainly a production and talent masterpiece.  It's ending begs for more as it's beginning sets the pace for a downright stunning experience.  <br />Although, the first tracks convey the simplicity of many early 80's hits, they still were handled like double-platinum albums in the realm of production and professionalism.  It's like they knew somewhat that they had an extraordinary talent, and understood that by harnessing this talent by giving it ample respect, that instead of exploiting it hastily, that the potential alone of handling it carefully with full dignity   would propel it to great heights, so harness and shape they did.  <br />Ok, so they marketed her as a pop star.  They plastered her image wherever possible.  Yeah, commercial success sell albums, but I must say that still, the music didn't suffer.  Thank God.  <br />The production and mastering of her earliest tracks are as abnormally superb as her talent is in performing them. The greatest thing is that throughout this compilation, there is no loss of talent of either Maddona, or her production staff.  The sound is consistant in muscicianship, clarity and impact as one listens on through.  I like how there is much space, depth and sensuality in everything.  <br />Her voice is magical at all times.  Huge almost always, but always personal,very personal.  That's her professionalism.  That's her standard.  That's what sets her apart.  This album focuses on that and makes it flow fluidly without any flaws.  <br />None of her early material sounds old.  None of her new material sounds out of place. This is why I've not selected-out individual tracks for review.  I can't, and there is no reason to.
0689825498|5.0|This is a great early book.  The zoo sends various animals as a pet but they are all unsuitable for some reason (the giraffe is too tall, the monkey is too naughty etc).  Finally they send the perfect present: a puppy!  The language is simple (in fact, this book was recommended to me by a speech pathologist) and the humor is perfect for the 2-4 age group.  My son loves lifting up the flaps and making noises for all the different animals hidden below.  The flaps are also cleverly illustrated so that enough of the animal is visible to allow the child to guess which one is being sent.  I must have read it to my son more than 100 times but neither of us are tired of it yet!

0399226907|5.0|My son is 2 and this is one of his favorite books and has been for some time.  The story is simple, the illustrations are gorgeous and the holes in the pages are irresistible to little fingers!  One tip: for young readers the board book is definitely the way to go.  Not only is it more robust (I got sick of sellotaping the paperback pages back together), but it is very satisfying for my son to poke his fingers through the holes and have me poke mine back from the other side.  This book was my salvation on a 4 hour plane trip!
B00005R23S|5.0|My soul has been moved...Initially i got into The Boss as a joke. He is sadly institutionalized into the school of the classicly abused rock n roll icons, and by that i mean that for the uninitiated [or ignorant] his Born in the USA stereotype will be hard to shake. In fact i believed that he was the embodiment of the pathetic 80's values and arrogant patriotism. <br />With that said, the reunification of the Boss and the ministry of Rock 'n' Roll [the E-Street Band] have pulled off another timeless concert movie. Whether it be Little Steven's Nixon impersonation, \\"Big Red's\\" overture, the do-see-do of Clarence Clemons and Nils Lofgren [Clemons looking remarkedly similar to Ghost Dog], the Boss' raving lunacy on Tenth Ave Freeze Out, or the um...\\"fashion\\" of Max Weinberg.<br />\\"Bruce Springsteen & the E-Street Band: Live in NY\\" marks as truly one of the great performances from truly one of the greatest musicians...every single song shatters its past connections and seemingly becomes a gospel number, sung [completely unpretentiously] by both the Madison Square Garden's audience and the E-Street Band. It's more relatable than Dylan, more personal than the other 99.9% and far, far more giving than most.<br />i cry...you will too.
0316666343|5.0|I hated for it to end, and when it did, I went back to the beginning and read it all over again.  I have never been so touched by a story.  It was beautifully written.  I just can't say enough good things about this book.  I have bought copies for my friends because I refuse to give up mine.
B00005MP58|4.0|This mini-series captivated me the first time I saw it on A&amp;E.  It has much of the original Austin dialog and great visual scope that adds to the drama and understanding of society in 1813.  It is masterfully done and captures me and everyone I have shown it to over the last few years.  Unfortunately the DVD is not well done.  It does provide a nice &quot;making of&quot; segment and the wide-screen format is also quite nice.  However, as I watched my new DVD I couldn't figure out why everyone looked so washed out.  The dresses, faces, and walls all seemed to be the same color.  The outdoor scenes have lost much of their brilliance.  Thinking I imagined the original I played the VHS and DVD side-by-side and was amazed at the poor quality of the DVD picture.  Other reviewers have confirmed this poor medium.  Given the choice, buy the video tapes and copy them onto your own DVD when DVD-RAM recorders get cheaper.
B000006OAM|5.0|The editorial review for this album was ridiculous.  Yes, it is a dark album, with a somber mood, but why is that automatically a bad thing?  Natalie has a beautiful voice and the orchestral score is enchanting.  She really gets you engrossed in each song through the way she performs the material and through the often mysterious lyrics.  Is it pretentious?  Perhaps a bit.  But that's not always a bad thing- at least she is willing to be serious and do the best she can and put herself on the line.  My favorite songs are the title track, &quot;life is sweet,&quot; &quot;my skin,&quot; &quot;break your heart,&quot; and &quot;king of may.&quot;  However, there's not a bad track on the album and it is well worth the money.
B000002Q7Y|3.0|KANSAS were a very different band without KERRY LIVGRIN.<br />Carrying on without him was a difficult and brave move for KAN-<br />SAS, and they did at least a respectable job at first. On POWER,<br />STEVE WALSH came back, along with ex- STREETS bassist BILLY<br />GREER and virtuoso guitarist STEVE MORSE. Having MORSE in the<br />band was a mixed blessing; on one hand he was probably the most<br />talented guitarist KANSAS ever had. On the other hand, he was not<br />even half the songwriter LIVGRIN was, so the result was an album<br />that was high on musicianship, but merely average in the song-<br />writing department. The sound was much heavier, but also more<br />pop oriented and radio-friendly. None of these songs exceed the<br />5 minute mark. STEVE WALSH'S voice had changed also, it sounded<br />much rougher and more scratchy and he couldn't hit them high<br />notes with such ease anymore. The album is a mixture of 80'S<br />pop songs, like ALL I WANTED, POWER and JUST CAN'T CRY ANYMORE,<br />combined with heavier,in yo' face numbers, like WERE NOT ALONE<br />ANYMORE, MUSICATTO and THREE PRETENDERS. I think the first three<br />songs on the second half of the album are the three best songs<br />here; MUSICATTO is like KANSAS meets the DIXIE DREGS and they<br />jam out and have a big party; TAKING IN THE VIEW is a very quir-<br />ky acoustic guitar number that's catchy yet very odd at the same<br />time and THREE PRETENDERS is probably the best song here, it<br />has a good solid guitar riff to it, with an interesting bass line<br />and it also feature's WALSH's best vocal on the album and also<br />MORSE'S best guitar solo on the album. TOMB 19 is okay, tho'<br />it's slightly silly and could have easily been called PRODUCT 19,<br />that yummy cereal I used to eat! NOT BAD!
0380729407|5.0|I've only read one of Bradbury's books, but I loved it. I have only seen the movie of this book, but it was awesome. It's quite creepy and strangely keeps you hooked on every word. Go with the majority of the reviewers, this book is awesome and appropriate for all ages.
B000002Q88|2.0|The 80's was a rough decade for BOB EZRIN; KISS/MUSIC FROM THE<br />ELDER was a commercial flop, tho it was a great album;ALICE COOP-<br />ER/DADA was a low selling and very strange album, tho' it did<br />contain ALICE COOPER's funniest song ever in I LOVE AMERICA, and<br />then we had PINK FLOYD's A MOMENTARY LAPSE OF REASON, which sold<br />VERY WELL, but was a horrible album. Then we had this album, IN<br />THE SPIRIT OF THINGS. BOB EZRIN was clueless with KANSAS. Why<br />did they employ so many outside writers and extra studio musi-<br />cians? Is that supposed to be FREDDY KRUEGER on the back cover?<br />What happened to PHIL EHART's hair? Did he buy a wig or a toupee?<br /> Or did he actually grow all of it back? He was starting to go<br />bald on POWER! As a concept album, this record doesn't work, BUT<br />there are still some nice moments on this album, like the opening<br />song GHOSTS, which is very mellow and has some nice singing from<br />STEVE WALSH. ONE MAN, ONE HEART has some good vocals on it, too.<br />I saw KANSAS in concert back in 1994 and one of the highlights<br />of the show was THE BELLS OF ST. JAMES, which STEVE WALSH really<br />sang the heck out of, almost destroying his vocal chords in the<br />process! POWER had alot of great lead guitar playing on it by<br />STEVE MORSE; this album doesn't have as much and the songs are<br />weaker and less KANSAS like. I wish my vinyl version had the<br />song times on it!
B00005YUNY|5.0|I have only seen Yes once, in the summer of 2001. This DVD is an excellant representation of what I saw-almost the exact setlist and of course the orchestra brings out all the 'magic' of this music. The only problem is the 'glitch' where it changes layers-this has been written of all over the internet by now. Other than that...Perfect introduction to the band for first timers, or great for longtime fans too!
0783226063|5.0|I started reading the DUNE series when I was eleven and have read the prequels to the first book. After reading all the books, I went to Blockbuster to rent the movie. When I watched the movie, I thought it was great. I kept watching it over and over.<BR>   The effects were great! The acting to me was great! But I was dissappointed at the end. It left the end wide open for a sequel.<BR>I went to the internet after seeing the movie to read the reviews... I was shocked! <BR> I think that people didn't like because they didn't under stand it. You probably need to read the book before you see the movie. But for those who liked the movie, an ongoing cult has been going on. I've seen the remake of film on the sci-fi channel, and thought it was ok. Not as great as the oringinal.<BR>  The 3hour version has recently been on T.V.  The newer seens were good, but that old guy talking was too much. With every new thing that we know about, he gives a 5 min history lesson.<BR>   The movie was over-all great. One of the best movies I have seen. If there is a sci-fi  movie you need to see, watch DUNE.
6305291446|4.0|I believe that any real fan of the Halloween series would agree that this one is the best since the start. There are so many little nuances in it that are similar to the original that you can tell that the producers & Jamie Lee Curtis put some real thought and time into making it better than Parts 4, 5, & 6. The fact that this film doesn't make reference to those three movies worked for me. Any real fan knows that the core story is about Michael and Laurie and everything else is just filler. They can add all the new characters and killings they want but without Laurie or \\"family\\" for Michael to obsess over none of it makes any sense.<br /><br />This version is true to the original in that Laurie is naturally still shell shocked and scared after all these years and Jamie Lee Curtis does a great job and obviously has fun in the part that made her a star so many years ago. Not all of the characters are necessary, which happens a lot. I think L.L. Cool J was fine but Adam Arkin was wasted here.<br /><br />My pans for this film are: It could have been a tad longer, especially the BIG fight scene, which the audience had waited 20 years for. It should have been much longer and tougher on both characters...we deserved it!<br /><br />I loved all the little references to the original film(s); Laurie bumps into everyone, Mr. Sandman playing twice and Laurie getting sliced on the same arm AGAIN ..OUCH, that ain't ever gonna heal!! Also loved the fun they have with Jamie Lee's mom Janet Leigh and poking fun at Psycho..Her name is Norma (Norman Bates) and she drives the exact car she did in Psycho, cute! I for one would have LOVED a cameo by the actresses who played Linda and Annie in the first film. She kept seeing Michael everywhere she looked, so why not her dead best friends occassionaly, that would have been fun for the audience I think.<br /><br />Oh well, you can't have everything. I do highly recommend this film if you enjoy this series, though as a fan you only need to own the original Halloween, Part 2, and H20 and you'll have the whole picture....buy and enjoy! Peace. :o)Halloween, Part 2, and H20 and you'll have the whole picture....buy and enjoy! Peace. :o) <br />
B00005JKQZ|3.0|The Lord of the Rings was a superior film in every way; acting, drama, design, cast, effects, story, directing, production, etc. etc. etc. etc.<br />In 5 years from now people are going to say, &quot;Beautiful wha?&quot; &quot;Huh?&quot;<br />The Lord of the Rings is a timeless, epic masterpiece that was robbed by the academy because of the simple &amp; sad fact that they felt like they owed their own (Ron Howard) after snubbing his earlier (and better) films.<br />So sad.
0780626494|3.0|This is an enjoyable film in a brain bubblegum kind of way; Brendan Fraser is charming, Alicia Silverstone is adorable, and the rest of the cast perform well, too.<br />Christopher Walken is a brilliant scientist who has created a huge, completely self-sustaining, unbelievably well-stocked nuclear bomb shelter beneath his family's home. During the Cuban missile crisis, he mistakenly believes that a nuclear bomb has been dropped, and locks his pregnant wife into this 35-year-time-locked bomb shelter. Brendan Fraser's character, Adam, is born there, and spends the first 34 years of his life underground, with only his parents for company. Predictably, after the 35 years are up, Adam emerges a bit odd, very polite, and exceedingly naive (but very well-schooled, thanks to his scientist father.) Adam learns about the modern world with help from Alicia Silverstone and David Foley, and searches for a wife (I'll give you three guesses as to whom he falls for, but who isn't interested in return.) Adam is not only lonely for female companionship, but he's lost as well; he can't remember how to get back to the the family's bomb shelter, which understandably causes him great distress. It's basically a happy movie, though, and appropriate for the family.<br />Even though the story isn't compelling or particularly well-written, it's charming and entertaining, anyhow. Fraser is adorable as always, and Silverstone turns in an enjoyable performance as well. This is a nice feel-good story for an evening or afternoon when you don't feel much like turning on your brain.
0316666343|5.0|I devoured this book in three days-- a miracle, for me.<br />I loved it! I mean, when you're reading the delicately written phrases that Ms. Sebold spells out for the reader, you really get a sense that you're living in this lovely world, where everyone is bound together, however subtly, by the death of someone that meant something different to each one. She meant constraint to her mother, the world to her father, a blur to her younger brother, and a friend to her sister. She meant nothing to Ruth until her death, and everything to Ray even after she had passed<br />This book made me cry...a fourteen year old male. It's really affecting and moving.<br />Even though towards the end, the story lines become a bit jumbled and unbelievable, the emotions are still real, and watching Susie Salmon's family fall apart, and later reform, is both heartbreaking and heartwarming. Seeing the characters change for better and for worse is like watching a family in your own neighborhood, in your own life.<br />Ms. Sebold paints a beautiful portrait of loss and beauty, innocence and lost dreams, friendship and family, responsibilities and remembrance. This is worth your time. Buy it now.
B000068QY7|5.0|I have to admit that after my first few listens i didn't like this album at all, but I HAVE COMPLETELY CHANGED MY MIND: THIS IS A CLASSIC!<BR>1 Hindu Times(10)- The now familiar 1st single. Classic Oasis.<BR>2 The Force Of Nature(10)- One of the songs i didn't like at first, but absolutely LOVE now. I'll describe it Oasis doing These Boots Are Made For Walking...<BR>3 Hung In A Bad Place(10)- Classic Definitely Maybe style track even though it was written by one of the new guys. <BR>4 Stop Crying Your Heart Out(10)- Brilliant ballad. This will be the song remembered by non Oasis fans from this cd.<BR>5 SongBird(8)- First Liam song here. Very happy go lucky tune.<BR>6 Little By Little(10)- More classic Oasis. From the &quot;Cast No Shadow&quot; repertoir. &quot;My god woke up on the wrong side of the bed!&quot;: Brilliant!<BR>7 A Quick Peep(7)- Very quick peep indeed. A short minute long instrumental.<BR>8 (Probably) All In The MInd(6)- The only song that i still don't like.<BR>9 She Is Love(8)- Another happy go lucky tune.<BR>10 Born On A Different Cloud(10)- This is the main song that i've changed my mind on. At first i hated it- it sounds like the name of the song repeated endlessly, but this is in face a brilliant surreal track(by Liam!) and a great homage to John Lennon(Cold Turkey, Happiness Is A Warm Gun etc).<BR>11 Better Man(8)- Last Liam song. Nice if not great.<BR>After a long 30 minute break(VERY ANNOYING) you get another instrumental(7)- alright, but NOT worth the wait.<BR>Minus points: The 30 minute break, no words(very depressing), not even references to who wrote what on the cd.<BR>It's also very short, but i suppose that's the natural length of a good cd with no fillers. Having said thay they have absolute gold on their 2 singles:<BR>The Hindu Times features<BR>Just Getting Older(10)- Poignant song.<BR>Idler's Dream(10)- One of the best and most romantic Oasis songs ever.<BR>Stop Crying Your Heart Out features:<BR>Thank You For The Good Times(10)- written by Andy Bell. Could have been released instead of Hindu Times. Both sound like David Bowie's Heroes!<BR>Shout It Out Load(10)- The twin brother of Little By Little.<BR>In short- classic stuff: can't wait for the next single, not to mention the next album. The great thing about this cd is that it sounds different from previous cds and is like a fresh start for a great band. Buy! Buy! Buy!
6305728437|2.0|This forgetable film has a chinese dragon with Eddie Murphy's voice.  How stupid.
B00005YU1O|5.0|Almost invariably, \\"Waking Life,\\" the 2001 animated film from Richard Linklater is described as `original.'  For once, this oft-overused moniker is accurate: there isn't anything quite like this movie.  It advertises itself as a series of philosophical vignettes, which range all over the subject spectrum but are usually united by a common thread of meaning: that of dreams and the reality of the `dream world.'<br />A film based upon that premise could easily fall into the highschool-discussion/drug-induced-nonsense level of discourse, but \\"Waking Life\\" plunges headlong into the fray without batting an eye.  Fairly early in the film, pretentious philosophy is dismissed with a nice rebuttal to the sophomoric question: \\"What if you're just a construct of my dream, and exist only in my mind?\\"  \\"Well, then I'm as real as anything else.\\"  And that's the starting point for a meditation on the meaning (if any) of dreams, and some of the dreamlike things people encounter in their daily lives.<br />\\"Waking Life\\" is also animated, using a pretty unique form of animation: each scene was shot, and then \\"drawn over\\" by animation artists in a variety of styles, from expressionist art to nearly-photographic digital renderings, depending on the mood of each scene.  The result is something that resembles an acid trip or a hallucination, where tables of restaurant patrons float above the ground, faces change while moustaches stay the same, and the background is in a near-constant state of flux.  It can get nauseating after a while, but the overall effect is subtle enough not to draw attention from the content of the film, which is a rare quality for so-called \\"art\\" films.  It's almost a crime that \\"Jimmy Neutron\\" was nominated for \\"Best Animated Film\\" while \\"WL\\" was not.<br />Because of these varied qualities, \\"Waking Life\\" isn't for everyone, and certainly gets a \\"rent-if-before-you-buy-it\\" caveat.  The DVD presentation is as good as one could want: an anamorphic widescreen presentation with crisp colors and a 5.1 soundtrack (not that philosophical conversation requires dynamic sound), and a nice helping of extras.  Don't write \\"Waking Life\\" off as something smart people (or those who pretend to be smart) will enjoy and yack about - it's just not the average, everyday film and requires an attentive mind and (perhaps) multiple viewings to fully enjoy.  For those willing to take the plunge with an open mind, \\"Waking Life\\" is a rewarding film experience.<br />Final Grade: Aon with crisp colors and a 5.1 soundtrack (not that philosophical conversation requires dynamic sound), and a nice helping of extras.

B00003CXUM|5.0|This is one of the most breathtaking movies I have seen in recent years.  A lot of people complained about the slow pace of this film, calling it boring, but I find it fascinating and captivating...there was never a minute of boredom while i was watching this movie, and I usually don't have much patience. I don't know what some of the people are whining about...because you obviously don't go to see this movie and expect action. I think the pace of this movie suits the ambience of the film perfectly.  I am just thankful that there is a director like Wong Kar-Wai who gives so much care about the all the little intricate details.  Superb acting, gorgeous cinematography, amazing details, unconventional film making...what more can i say...I love it.<br />Love it or hate it...it's a movie that cannot be ignored!
B00005T30L|5.0|One of the few teen films to adequately capture the paralyzing emptiness of the post-high school blues (and most of Western pop culture). Thora Birch is particularly convincing as the too-cool-for-school teen coming to terms with her future and her friends.  But it's the minor players like Illeana Douglas as Roberta the art teacher and Dave Sheridan as Doug the crazy Sidewinder customer, who'll you'll remember forever. Daniel Clowes and Terry Zwigoff's script is pitched at precisely the right level. It's brutally real without losing its sense of humour, and ultimately hopeful without slipping into sappiness: that's a fine line to walk, but they do it to perfection. Quite an achievement.
6305718954|4.0|\\"Stigmata\\" is a thought provoking, if sometimes religiously confused, MTVesque journey through the possession/stigmata of Frankie Page (Patricia Arquette), a twentysomething atheist raver who suddenly exhibits stigmata (the wounds that Christ received on the cross) after receiving a recently deceased priest's rosary in the mail (her name, combined with later symbolism (the doves feeding from her hands, the statue of St. Francis in the garden), is an obvious nod to St. Francis of Assisi-one of the original working titles was \\"St. Frankie of Pittsburgh\\"). However, director Rupert Wainwright appears fundamentally confused on basic issues, confusing stigmata (which appear to devout Christians) with possession (Frankie speaks in tongues, stabs herself, levitates, and scribbles in Aramaic on the walls).<br />Gabriel Byrne is fantastic (as usual) as Father Andrew Kiernan, an Irish organic chemist turned man of the cloth, who is sent around the globe to investigate bleeding statues and religious sightings. Frankie has an attack in the subway that is witnessed by a priest, and word filters down to the Vatican, where Father Kiernan is hastily reassigned after discovering an authentic bleeding statue of the Virgin Mary in Brazil. Angry at being silenced, Kiernan arrives to find Frankie seeing hallucinations, hearing voices, and sporting some gaping holes in her wrists (the hospital staff fears self-mutilation and suicide attempts) that continue to bleed.<br />The film follows the pair as Frankie's condition deteriorates and the attacks become more violent as another mystery, this one inside the walls of the Vatican, unfolds.  The \\"Stigmata\\" tagline says it all: the messenger must be silenced. The explanation for the phenomenon is unexpected, as are the two different endings: the theatrical ending and the director's ending. Due to poor test screenings the theatrical ending was substituted, but Wainwright's ending fits in more with the predictions of Father Andrew. There are several deleted scenes, including an alternate opening that explains Father Almeida's death. Factual errors run rampant, including Father Kiernan's assertion that no one had ever received all five stigmata (untrue, St. Francis received all five at once), that St. Francis of Assisi was 23 when he first received the stigmata (he was in his forties), and the fact that Cardinal Houseman wears a goatee (prohibited by the Vatican).<br />The visuals are striking if overwhelming. Multitudes of candles are present in almost every shot, as is water, doves, and blood. The scenes of Frankie receiving the stigmata are almost seizure-inducing-strobe lights, split-second flashes of nails being hammered into wrists, Frankie's bloodied face from several angles, all without transitions, rushed and drowned in a hard-rock soundtrack (the visuals alone built up a sufficient atmosphere of foreboding; the hard rock was overkill) penned by Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan. Sinead O'Connor and the Afro-Celt Sound System contribute, as does Natalie Imbruglia, and David Bowie.<br />\\"Stigmata\\" is entertaining, although it is extremely violent, gory, contains graphic sex, and is easily religiously offensive. There really is no Satanic demonic possession, rather something using Frankie as a messenger for good (albeit with extreme Machiavellian means).  The movie casts a less than flattering light on the Catholic Church and the Vatican, and seems to glorify Frankie's hedonistic lifestyle. But the stigmata and Father Kiernan inevitably leave a large impact on Frankie's life, Frankie, who was once so self-assured in her partying ways and the non-existence of God. As the messenger she utters these words from the gospel of St. Thomas: \\"The kingdom of God is within you and all around you. It is not within buildings of wood or stone. Split a piece of wood and you will find me. Look beneath a stone and I am there.\\" Although at times it looks like an outtake from Madonna's \\"Like a Prayer\\" video, \\"Stigmata\\" is thought provoking and visually stunning.is thought provoking and visually stunning.

B000066NW0|4.0|4 Stars for Canadian new-comer Avril LaVigne. At only 17, she has created a spectacular and soulful album. The joy in it is that she wrote all of the songs on this album, although she does not know how to read music. &quot;Let Go&quot; has a diversity of musically appreciated tracks, including the teeny-bopper pop hit &quot;Skater Boy&quot; (which is to be the follow-up single to &quot;Complicated&quot;), a track that reaks of Pink's &quot;love me for me&quot; theory &quot;Losing Grip&quot; and the happy and easy to listen songs including &quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot; and &quot;My World&quot;. Avril has certainly created a name for herself in Canadian, American, and international stardom. The album is amazing, and it is about time that the World was struck with another amazing act from Canada. 4 Stars!

B000068QY7|4.0|You know, it is funny, there is always one common criticism of Oasis; &quot;why can't they write more songs like Wonderwall...&quot;  I think it is sad that peoples expectations become stagnant and they become upset when a band changes direction.<br />It is true that Oasis are heavily influenced by the Beatles.  Can anyone fault them for that?  The Beatles defined rock'n'roll.  They set the bar by which all others are measured and everyone who has come after have failed to reach that summit.  Lets face it, no one ever will, so instead of looking for the next Beatles lets look for the next big band.  <br />Oasis put together tunes that shake your soul and Liam's voice, well I'm not sure if I want to get up and dance or rip my ears off, his voice is down right raw.  It is, in fact, excellent, and the most unique voice out there right now.<br />Retreading old styles is a common theme these days.  Who among us would deny that the Stokes' album is simply a retread of Iggy Pop and the Velvet Underground?  You know what, I don't care.  That album is great too.<br />My thought on Heathen Chemistry is this.  If you like the raw guitar of Noel and the rough voice of Liam get it.  If you don't, I'm sure the is something else out there for you.  Now slag off.
0316776963|5.0|I have never in my entire life laughed more from a book.  I would be sitting in a park in between classes and just cracking up!!  I got more than a few strange looks in my direction, to say the least. <br />David Sedaris has become one of my favorite people.  I love him.  I want to meet him and become one of his best friends and invite him over for BBQ's. I want to be able to brag that David and I are good friends.  I don't think I'm alone in this yearning.  His writing seems to have that effect on people. <br />After reading this, I immediately went out and bought Naked, which I am in the process of reading. So far, it has only heightened my desire of him.  <br />Read this book.  You will laugh so hard people will think there is something wrong with you.  And you will wonder why all the mundane events that happen in your life are not half as entertaining as when they happen to David.
B00005JKQZ|3.0|&quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; is based on the life of John Nash, a brilliant mathmetician who also happened to suffer from schizophrenia. Although the film has received criticism because it is not 100% accurate, it is a great story. To be honest, most true stories need to be embellished some anyway in order to be entertaining. <br />I cannot divulge too much information about the plot of the movie because you will get some major surprises along the way that should not be spoiled, but just know that you will laugh and cry and be frustrated along with the characters. <br />Why 3 stars? While this was a solid movie, definitely worth a rental, I can't say that it makes my list of all-time favorites. It is a great story that deserves to be seen, and there is nothing necessarily wrong with it. There's just not much more to it that makes it worthy of 4 or 5 stars.
B000065U1N|5.0|You'll see a lot of comments here about character development or storyline flaws, even a few gripes about the film being too loud, violent, and confusing...   There are even critiques regarding how Ridley Scott could have done a better job as director   ---mostly from people who can barely hold a steady picture for home video.<br />These reviews might make sense if your biggest adventure in life lies somewhere between teletubbies and a trip to Burger King, but they won't help if you're really interested in this film, and more importantly, the story behind it.  Some fitting dialogue from the screenplay is where SFC Hooten says \\"....They won't understand. They won't understand why we do it. They won't understand that it's about the men next to you, and that's it. That's all it is.\\"<br />Call me biased as a former Ranger, but for the best assessment of Black Hawk Down, skim through the reviews and look for what the Rangers have to say.  The rest is mostly chaff.<br />The only comments I have to make are that this movie had a powerful impact on me, the kind that burns in a permanent impression; it also conveyed the extremes of pride, pain, professionalism, and amazingly hard work that comes with duty in Special Ops.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This is definitely a love or hate movie. After renting the movie, I was sure I would never watch it again, but I was drawn back to it by the soundtrack, which is hands down the best part of the movie. I ended up first buying the soundtrack and then the movie, which I watched over and over and over again. <br />Moulin Rouge is the third in Baz Luhrmann's Red Curtain trilogy, where he has told stories through three mediums: through dance in Strictly Ballroom, through Shakespearean poetry in Romeo and Juliet, and through music in Moulin Rouge. And this story is definitely told through the music. The most important moments in the movie occur during musical numbers. And at first I was turned off by the fact that there is only one original song in the soundtrack, \\"Come What May,\\" I finally realized that they were trying to show the genius of Ewan MacGregor's character, the young writer, by having him pen some of the greatest songs of the 20th century. <br />Everything else about this movie is fantastic as well. The story takes place in late 19th century Paris, where a young Engish writer (MacGregor) just moved to \\"live a penniless existence\\" and write about freedom, beauty, truth and love. He is discovered by a group of Bohemian actors and asked to write a play for the Moulin Rouge. He falls in love with the star of his play (Nicole Kidman), but they are forced to have a secret affair because she is the \\"property\\" of the play's investor.<br />Kidman and MacGregor do an awesome job. I was especially impressed that they used their own vocals. If I had not known they were singing, I would have thought their voices had been dubbed.<br />You should definitely rent this movie and give it a try. And try not to write it off after you see it once. I think this is the type of movie that enjoy more every time you watch it. And the DVD is packed with extras. Make sure you find all the hidden easter eggs, too.
6305263248|4.0|Tense male bonding picture with chick sub-plot.  DVD is okay, but could have had some more extras.  Film itself is a sharp transfer and the commentary by John Frankenheimer is pretty good.  The ease at which DeNiro slips between speaking French and English makes the film believeable.  A top notch film with a solid cast.  May be too intense for some, but still a take no prisoners movie.  Chase scene through Paris is a bit reminiscent of the one in To Live and Die in LA but still well done...unless the Princess Diana parallels bother you.  Put this on, pop open a cool one sit back for a wild ride.

B0000640VN|2.0|The title of this review is one of the biggest flaws in a picture that really requires you to suspend disbelief.  Forget the fact that his ex- lives one floor up and still waltzs in his fire escape window to claim her stuff anytime she wants (ever hear of locks on the window in NY?)  This guy has no apparent job, and yet he can afford to furnish a 12 room aparment with a river view in NYC?  What does he have rent control from the 20's?  Why is it in every New York movie, any person central to the film has a beautifully decorated apartment with a view of a river.  The only poor people ever seen are either there to provide that bit of squalor to make the film seem dark or to show the nobility of poverty.  K &amp; L is a typical meet cute film set in the fantasy land of the beautiful people...pity life is not like this.

B00005OM4K|5.0|Why in the world would you want to buy a Creedence Clearwater Revival box set?  A band that has been so overplayed on classic rock and oldies stations that I used to joke every time I heard CCR on the local dinosaur station that they should have a CCR song of the day segment in addition to Getting the Led Out.  I will tell you why you might want to buy this box.<br />CCR matters, it's as simple as that.  In the midst of the 1960's Haight-Asbury drug-fueled self-indulgent morass of most bands from San Francisco (early Sly and the Family Stone a notable exception), CCR crafted passionate, intelligent, simple, to-the-point American rock that has rarely been equalled.  Other bands have drawn on American roots music as inspiration, but they seldom achieve the distinctive and original sound CCR did.  A great song is a great song no matter how oversaturated it becomes.  If you can extract from your consciousness every two-for-tuesday pairing of \\"Fortunate Son\\" with \\"Run Through the Jungle\\" you've heard in your life, you can truly appreciate what fantastic pieces of work these are.  There's nary a clunker in the entire CCR catalogue.  Personal unsaturated favorites are \\"Walking on the Water,\\" \\"It Came from the Sky,\\" \\"Don't Look Now,\\" \\"Feeling Blue,\\" and countless others.<br />Every CCR recording is represented in this box set-from their early days as the Tommy Fogerty and the Blue Velvets-through the Golliwogs-and up through their only real low point as CCR, Mardis Gras.  Also included are the posthumous live records, and a couple of non-LP CCR singles.  You get all the hits, all the albums, and the entire collection has been remastered (finally!).  If you've never actually owned a CCR record you'll be suprised at the consistency and high-quality of dang-near everything they did.  Sure, the music is basic meat-and-potato rock, and sounds deceptively simple-but if simple was so easy, why hasn't every roots band written a \\"Proud Mary?\\"
B00005JKQZ|5.0|If you liked &quot;Mr. Holland's Opus&quot;, then you will probably like this movie. The setting is mathematics instead of music, but you do not need to understand mathematics at all. This is similar to the way that chess was presented in &quot;Searching for Bobby Fischer&quot;. Not surprising, the music is from James Horner (&quot;Searching for Bobby Fischer&quot;), as you can tell from the first couple notes.
B00005JKQZ|1.0|I was very disappointed in this one. It was so slow in places that I almost went to sleep twice. The story might have been better if it were really taken from true life. The movie only showed his second wife and did not show his children from his previous marriage that from all accounts he abandoned. Realism is usually better than a contrived story line.
0780626494|5.0|What an adorable movie is Blast From the Past.  The acting is fabulous and the story is just precious.  Plus, the characters were all so nice (it was hard for me to root for Meg Ryan in Kate and Leopold because she was such a witch) that you immediately wanted Eve and Adam to get together.      Since I am a child of the 60's, I do remember bomb shelters and bomb drills so the concept was not entirely unbelievable.  This is one of the few FAMILY films that appeals to young and old.  No violence and very little bad language.  This movie makes me happy (all ten times that I have seen it) and it will you too!
B00005OM4N|5.0|I happen to be a fan of Britney Spears, and I was not disappointed by her recent self-titled CD release. The music is catchy and fun, with a good rhythm. \\"Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman\\" is my absolute favorite. It's a very good piece of music for young girls trying to find themselves, and I think Britney did a good job with it. It's inspirational to me, and I think she should do more ballats like this. Some of my other favorites on this CD include \\"I Love Rock and Roll,\\" \\"Let Me Be,\\" and \\"Overprotected.\\" If you're a Britney fan, then by all means buy this. Just be warned that many of the songs include content that may be inappropriate for younger fans. Other than that, I think it is satisfying enough if you enjoy Britney's music.
B000065U1N|4.0|\\"Black Hawk Down\\" is excellent in almost every way.  It's tough.  It's gritty.  It's realistic.  And it shows the supreme patriotism and dedication to duty shown by the young men and women who serve in our Armed Forces, when they're confronted by an armed foe...<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with the story of \\"Black Hawk Down,\\" this film is based on actual events, specifically the Battle of Mogadishu, Somalia, in October, 1993.  U.S. Army Rangers and Delta Force operators were among American forces stationed there, with their mission being to bring various warring Somali factions to heel, so that United Nations humanitarian workers could distribute food to Somalia's starving population.<br /><br />On October 3, 1993, a small force of Rangers and Deltas were sent into Mogadishu via Black Hawk helicopter and Humvee vehicles, in order to apprehend two of Somali war lord Mohamed Farrah Aidid's top lieutenants.  The city was already in a near state of anarchy, with several factions fighting each other.  When Aidid's followers received a tip-off that American troops were on the way, they responded with alacrity.  Armed to the teeth with automatic weapons, rocket propelled grenades (RPGs), and other light and medium weapons, they manned roadblocks, rooftops, and any other advantageous location they could find, in anticipation of giving the Americans the fight of their lives.<br /><br />Almost from the minute the Army Rangers began rappelling down ropes from the Black Hawks, they came under intense enemy fire.  The Rangers and Deltas were successful in capturing Aidid's lieutenants... but at a heavy cost.  Within an hour of the mission's start, Somali rebels managed to shoot down two Black Hawks and kill several American troopers.  What began as a routine mission that should have taken no more than an hour became a protracted 22-hour long battle that resulted in 19 American and as many as 1,000 Somali casualties.<br /><br />\\"Black Hawk Down\\" is a very good depiction of what happened on that day.  I had read Mark Bowden's book of the same name (upon which the movie is based) before watching the film.  While many events have been, of necessity, condensed, and others have been chronologically altered in order to adapt a 400 page book into a two and one-half hour film, director Ridley Scott and his crew did an admirable job of conveying what actually happened on that fateful October day.<br /><br />Although the acting is by no means Oscar-worthy, it's actually pretty good throughout the film.  There are no real standouts in the cast, but that's because the film seems more focused on the events of the day, rather than the people who carried out those events.<br /><br />Many scenes in \\"Black Hawk Down\\" are pretty tough to take, especially if you're a viewer who feels uncomfortable with a lot of blood and gore.

I had read Mark Bowden's book of the same name (upon which the movie is based) before watching the film.  While many events have been, of necessity, condensed, and others have been chronologically altered in order to adapt a 400 page book into a two and one-half hour film, director Ridley Scott and his crew did an admirable job of conveying what actually happened on that fateful October day.<br /><br />Although the acting is by no means Oscar-worthy, it's actually pretty good throughout the film.  There are no real standouts in the cast, but that's because the film seems more focused on the events of the day, rather than the people who carried out those events.<br /><br />Many scenes in \\"Black Hawk Down\\" are pretty tough to take, especially if you're a viewer who feels uncomfortable with a lot of blood and gore.

015670160X|5.0|Woolf's skill of imagery in writing is amazing. Her love of her character Orlando is apparent in the gentle way she carries him/her from the 15th century to 1928. I wanted to jump into the story, sit beside Orlando, ride a horse beside him, and kiss him as a man and then again as a woman. A stunning read and one that should be on any well-read person's read and read again list...enjoy.
1556154844|5.0|Having no formal programming education, I found this book to be the BEST book i've ever read about programming! It has information that is increadibly useful, and is hard to find elsewhere! The book is not focused on any language specifically, but helps you greatly improve your code in ANY language! No matter what langauge you program in or your experience, GET THIS BOOK!<br />    As well the book contains information on organizing projects, and doesn't have the tactic of &quot;always do these steps no matter what size the project&quot; as I've seen some things say, but instead relises that some projects require lots of planning, and some projects require none. Worth the price!
630514415X|5.0|Lee highlights problems not only in the world of professional sports, the ghetto, and race in America, but he does it all while weaving a moving story about basketball, redemption, and the relationship between a father and son. He has big things to say about the sold-out soul of professional athletics, but the film would be remarkable without this social commentary. I don't care if Washington won an Oscar for Training Day, this is truly his greatest performance. Ray Allen is also surprisingly good as the country's best high school basketball player, who is being pursued by everyone from NBA agents to his own girlfriend. The people who dislike this film are always ignorant about good filmmaking, and too involved in their white suburban lives to understand what Spike Lee is attempting to say about a variety of social topics.
B000065U1N|5.0|This movie was great.  I loved the role of Josh Hartnett. Alot of action it did not drag like other war movies it was great.
B00005JKJA|5.0|People seem to either LOVE this movie or hate it with a passion. Those who don't like it seem to think that there are countless holes in the plot that are left unfilled. This simply is not true. Every humans views of things are slightly different other humans views. Views become even more twisted over time. Chances are that most of your memories are slightly askew from what the reality was at the time. Betty/Diane came Hollywood expecting it to be everything in her dreams. When she realizes the reality of things she gets torn apart mentally. Thats why she kills her lesbian lover at beginng of the movie(the end chronologically) and it is why here memories of what happened are get so twisted until she shoots herself in the head to kill the demons inside. I can understand someone not liking this movie because of its disturbing nature, but everyone should atleast acknowledge and give credit to director David Lynch because he is certainly smarter than the average movie maker.
B0000042MY|4.0|The Last of the Mohicans is one of those films that can't be separated from the music.  When I listen to the soundtrack I feel once again the loss...loss of a way of life for the Indians, loss of wilderness, loss of love, all of which the movie displays so brilliantly.  It is rare to find music that rises to meet such important themes.  This soundtrack does.  One other that comes to mind is Samuel Barber's Adagio For Strings which was used for the Platoon soundtrack.  All the tragedy and loss of war are in that song.<BR>     Last of Mohicans, the film, is remarkable not only for its powerful music but because of its perfect casting.  And, if anyone has read the novel, they'll know that the story has been changed somewhat.  Usually it annoys me when scriptwriters take such liberties with a piece of literature, but in this case the story is actually improved.  Not many things were altered, just a few major ones like who loves whom and who dies and how at the end.  Plus one character from the novel isn't even in the movie.  That last cliff scene is one of the most memorable in contemporary film.  So the scriptwriters deserve lots of credit too.<BR>     Next time, though, I'd ask record companies to include the entire soundtrack.  I too was disappointed by the shortened versions and felt a bit cheated.  No excuse not to include the whole Clannad song, for example. But despite that flaw, the CD is still very much a success.
B0000039LE|5.0|This was a great scary movie and is now in this day and age simply because it is an &quot;old&quot; movie. There must be some unwritten law about we can only watch new movies and not old ones. Anyway this movie is very creepy and scary, not as good as Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th, but still it is one of the big daddies. This isn't the scariest movie of all, The Exorcist still holds the title, but who knows, one of these &quot;new&quot; horror flicks may actually do it. Buy this one, now! While you're at go and buy the scariest slasher of them all The Texas Chainsaw Massacre!
0380820846|5.0|What a great book!!!  I've been waiting with great anticipation for this book to be released ever since I read the teaser in \\"An Offer from A Gentleman.\\"  Colin has always been my favorite Bridgerton because of his great wit and ease.  I was very pleased to see how JQ had given Colin's character more depth without ruining his charm.  It was very nice to see a hero who wasn't brooding over a very serious problem from his past but had personal issues that dealt with insecurities and simple confusions.  <br />Penelope Featherington was a perfect compliment to Colin.  She's witty and although burdened by her own insecurities of being a wall-flower her entire life, she proves to be a strong (yet caring) woman in the sometimes very cruel ton.  <br />JQ manages to reinvent these well-known characters from the Bridgerton series without ruining their endearing personalities.  I loved how she brought back past characters from her other books.  It was a great surprise to read about Lucas and Jane Hotchkiss and to find out that they're both old enough to be in the marriage mart.  Also the supporting characters were a great compliment to the story.  I couldn't help but smile to see another side of the usually cruel and very feared Lady Danbury.<br />Overall, this was just a splendid book with lots of laughter and tears as the relationship between Colin Bridgerton and Penelope Featherington gradually grows from friendship to love.
B0000639F4|5.0|es una fina muestra de la incomparable musica cubana, a la que la mayoria de nosotros no tenemos acceso. este es una obra maetra de la musica universal, contemporaneadelicada y deliciosa. musicalmente tiene ritmo, cadencia, cuerpo y melodia. si te gusta la buena musica, este dvd es un deber.
B00005RFAI|5.0|From the first time I heard Pink on the radio, I could not get the grooves out of my mind.  In fact, I did not Want to.  At first, I did not realize that several of my favorite songs were by this Artist. \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\" often played in my mind, throughout the day.  Every time I heard \\"Get The Party Started,\\" I cranked-up the radio.  Then, one day, I watched the \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\" video, online, and I was hooked.<br />  I soon found myself looking-forward to the times when each local radio station played Pink's music....however, it wasn't enough.  I had to own this collection of great songs.<br />  \\"Just Like A Pill\\" began playing, locally, while I waited for my CDs to arrive, creating greater anticipation.<br />  Now, I own the CD and I can listen to Pink whenever I please (often), I can honestly say that I was very surprised. I am accustomed to purchasing entire CDs with only 1-4 good songs on them, and a lot of \\"filler.\\"<br />  \\"Missundaztood\\" has no filler material.  Every song is amazing and heart-felt.  It seems each tune is belted-out, or sung in breathy vocals, from the soul.<br />  I am thrilled to see a musician throwing caution to the wind and doing what She wants to do...not what some record company demands of her.  Even the few silly things that could have been edited-out, such as the end of the first song,<br />\\"Missundaztood,\\" add to the over-all Freedom of the collection of tunes.  The song, itself, is great--very catchy.<br />  Pink's music has catchy grooves, great intros and Lyrics that stick like glue to your mind.<br />  It is wonderful to see people using this genre of music for fun and self-expression again, without using the Seattle formula.  I quit buying music, for a long time (with the exception of Prince).  Pink has renewed my interest in this genre of music and inspired me to delve back into the Rock/Pop field.  The opening riff of \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\" is worth the price of the CD, alone.<br />  Pink seems to be quite the Feminist and may be surprisingly inspirational to women of that persuasion, as well.<br />  If you are tired of Formula Bands, Seattle-inspired Gloom & Doom...and Industry-generated copy-cat Pop....  try \\"Pink.\\"he Feminist and may be surprisingly inspirational to women of that persuasion, as well.<BR>     If you are tired of Formula Bands, Seattle-inspired Gloom & Doom...and Industry-generated copy-cat Pop....  try \\"Pink.\\"
0395925037|1.0|This book is just written by a mad man who repeats himself and makes up words.  The only people who could like this book is if you are white power.  I read it cause i am studying World War II.  If you are not studying World War II and you arnt white power, dont get this.  He has no idea what he is talking about more than half the time.
B00005QXDD|5.0|Jack Black is hilarious.  All of these songs are incredibly funny, and any Jack Black fan will like it.  I reccomend it highly.
6305165912|3.0|which, when you consider that against many other movies, ain't so bad. Nevertheless, I've seen 'em all and this is definitely their dud. As usual, the Coen Brothers are showing off their ability to create extremely strange characters, along with their signature blend of fantasy and reality, and nifty camera work. However, the plot is not all that coherent, and the characters, for all their oddity, are not that compelling. Jeff Bridges plays a burned out hippie leftover(\\"the Dude\\") who, by way of having the same name as a millionaire, gets himself involved in one misunderstanding after another regarding the disappearance of the millionaire's wife. However, John Goodman steals the show as his bowling partner, a Vietnam vet with a hair trigger temper and a knack for springing into military style action when the Dude's passivity allows him. Together, they screw up one thing after another in trying to disentangle the Dude with the circumstances. What I imagine the Coen Brothers were trying to achieve here was to make the Dude into  some sort of modern Zen/Tao master/independent maverick who, by virtue of his ignorance and willingness to just let things happen to him, ekes himself out of intrigue. My belief that this is the aim of the movie is supported by Sam Elliot's narration of the story in a cowboy hat, attempting to assign some importance to the Dude's actions and style. It doesn't really all come together, really, 'cause theres nothing good about being \\"a dude\\", no matter what prism you filter him thru. <BR>I'm no prude. But the f-word is bandied about so many times in this movie you get tired of hearing it. It was funny when the Soth Park kids did it, but here it grates. I imagine alot of people are going to think this is a great movie because of that and the lead character's casual and frequent pot use, and I suspect that those who thought this was one of the greatest movies theyve ever seen must have the same smoking habits as the Dude.
B00001PE4D|5.0|Cruel Intentions portrays a tale of seduction, betrayal, selfishness, and love in an excellently crafted manner that will leave you breathless after the film is completely over.  <br />One thing that should also be noted about this film, is that it also supports a top notch cast.  Sarah Michelle Gellar, who is my favorite actress, plays the selfish self-absorbed Kathyrn with great grace and talent.  This character is a complete opposite from her television character Buffy Summers, and Gellar manages to play it off extremely well and convincingly.  Ryan Phillipe plays the sex-driven scheming Sebastian who begins to fall in love with the sweet and charming Anette, played by Reese Witherspoon, who is supposed to be the target of his bet placed with Kathyrn.  Selma Blair and Joshua Jackson also co-star in this well written, superbly directed film.<br />The DVD contains whopping extras such as music videos, trailers, featurettes, commentaries, and deleted scenes.  I highly recommend this film for anyone's DVD collection because it contains something interesting for just about everyone.
B00005QDW1|4.0|...but hey, it's perfect pop music. No Doubt's latest is the bastard child of 80's romantic, dancehall, original ska, and some loose R&B, and it blends perfectly. The best way to describe this is as the band's 'Kid A' - it is pretty experimental for them. I have a friend who prefered their previous releases, but got into this album after repeated listens. I advise you to do that.<br />[Highlights: 'Hella Good', 'Waiting Room', 'Making Out']
B0000683DH|5.0|With a great cast and an enemy you just love to hate this one just keeps on ticking.  Kirk and his old enemy Khan butt heads over a device that can create planets called \\"Genesis\\".  The only part I didn't like was when Dr. McCoy got all religious about the creation of planets.  I know that he is a country doctor and that this is the point, but I just don't think it adds to the character.  I only write this review knowing that if you don't know this already you are not a Star Trek fan.  If this is the case I urge you to reconsider this movie is wonderful strictly for its entertainment value.
B000068QY7|4.0|While not their best CD, Heathen Chemistry will rock anyone, no matter what cloud they were born on.  There is a good combination of hard-rocking songs and slower, more melodic songs.<br />Best of the bunch: The Hindu Times (rocks), Force of Nature (catchy beat), Stop Crying Your Heart Out (beautiful), Little by Little (catchy beat) and Born on a Different Cloud (beatiful, and the best on the CD).<br />Any CD that contains more than 4 good songs is a CD you need to buy.  Heathen Chemistry contains at least 5 very good songs, and the others are all very good, as well.
0446677450|3.0|Many of &quot;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&quot;'s critics argue that Robert Kiyosaki is  too elementary in his recipe for accumulating wealth.  Tempting as it may be to criticize simplicity, there is truth as to what the author professes. Frankly, I found the clear language Kiyosaki used to explain his philosophies rather refreshing, amidst a glut of droll, yet mentally exhausting writers who entangle concepts in a puzzle of abstract theories; if only to reassure their own literary superiority.  Others attack Kiyosaki on the basis that he lacks credentials, arguing that he provides no information regarding how he acquired his wealth (besides writing a lucrative series of financial books!), and suggest,therefore, that his wisdom is highly suspect.  Whether Robert Kiyosaki earned more money writing books than he did investing does not invalidate his advice, which is perfectly sound advice at that, and certainly applicable to anyone's financial situation.  Indeed, it is difficult to argue against his advice to acquire more assets than liabilities, or to save a portion of your income.  Granted, at times the book is repetitive and it lacks neccessary details, the book helps more than it hinders, and is a great foundation book for anyone interested in building a solid financial future.
0380977788|5.0|There once was a young girl named Coraline who moved into a new flat with her mother and father. The neighbors are friendly, if not a bit odd and a bit confused, repeatedly calling her \\"Caroline\\" by mistake.  The little girl is a self-proclaimed explorer, taking walks around the neighborhood no matter what the weather.  With both of her parents occupied by work, she counts the doors at home, and figures out how to open up a door which is supposed to open up to nowhere - more specifically, a brick wall...<br />Coraline's curious nature is akin to that of Alice (in Wonderland), Anne (of Green Gables) and other historical young heroines. Far from being a damsel in distress, Coraline is witty, intelligent and aware. Her 'White Rabbit' comes in the shape of a black cat who has no name; as he wryly explains to her, cats know who they are so they don't need names, unlike insecure human beings.<br />\\"Coraline\\" is a fantastic read for all ages, genders and critters. This is a book to read late at night when huddled under the covers with a flashlight. The gothic feel of this book will please long-time Neil Gaiman fans as well as fans of classic dark fairy tales.
B00005JL3A|4.0|I am not going to sit here and pretend i liked this movie when i first saw it but i am a big fan of the games so i had to give it a shot. I love the games and have defeated them all and i just bought a game cube simply to the R.E. remake so yes i am a true fan of the games themselves which is why i was disappointed with this film. Where was Jill? Where was Claire? Where was Chris? Where was Barry? Where was Wesker? I'm sure you get the point. How can you call a film Resident Evil and then go and not have any of the characters from the game in it? Then when i read that the zombiemaster himself George Romero had walked off the set i just knew it was in trouble. Then an amazing thing happened i saw the film a second time then a third and by then i loved it and it has turned into a fovorite. I have gone on a rampage and purchased a movie poster signed by the cast, various banners, standees and other stuff. I have to say i loved this movie but that was only after i had accepted the fact that Milla was not Jill. Paul Anderson has a good track record as far as i am concerned as i loved Event Horizon which did a wonderful job of blending horror with sci-fi but i still think Resident Evil would have been a better film if Romero had done it. It does lack gore and that certain punch that a zombie film needs and that would have been what Romero brought to the table. Alice doesnt even get a gun until halfway through the movie which is rather disappointing but all in all a very well done quite enjoyable little romp that all fans of the game should own.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This is Pixar's forth movie with Disney and they just keep getting better.  Kids and adults will find something enjoyable about this film.  The cutting edge CGI art work and design are top notch and impressive.  Voice talents Billy Crystal and John Goodman bring their characters to life with humor that both is clean for the children and entertaining for the adults.  Unlike some movies of late, this has a really original idea and well written script.  A highly likable film that I recommend everyone see, regardless of age.
B00004SCX6|1.0|I was disappointed when i got to this form and realized I couldn't give 0 stars. heh heh. It's a complete mystery to me how this garbage sells. It's the same song, over and over and over and over and over. And what is with her jaw-droppingly bad cover of \\"Satisfaction\\"? The sad thing is, the pre-teens who listen to this trash probably don't even know that it was once a good song! That made me very very upset. Another thing that drives me crazy is that the girl has absolutley no talent! She can't sing, and her voice sounds like a cartoon alien or something, way over commercialized and just... really bad. Do yourself and humanity a favor and do not buy this record.
B00003CXI1|4.0|A classic tale of good verses evil.  The boy who survived an attack that killed his mother and father would grow to be a great wizard some day.  After being raised by his aunt and uncle who treat him less than nice, Harry gets an invitation to go to Hogworth School of Wizardry.  Good adaptation from novel.  Not good for small children who are easily scared and have a problem setting still during movies.  With its length being over 2 and 1/2 hours long, I suggest this movie for children ages 8 and up as well as adults.
B000002J09|5.0|This is definitley one of Led Zeppelin's best, if not THE best album they released. It is very original, with unbelievable vocals by Robert Plant and incredible guitars by the rock legend Jimmy Page.  I would personally like to know what kind of drugs \\"dapeacedogg\\" is on that would make him say such complete and absolute rubbish! Nickleback, Puddle of Mudd, Staind, and all of the other artists he mentioned are anything but \\"fresh\\". They are nothing but a bunch of Seattle/grunge posers and wannabes who are doing an incredibly horrible job of doing so. I'm sure it's a complete insult to every member of Led Zeppelin to even have their name in the same sentence with any of those \\"artists\\", without being compared to them. GEEZ! This is a brilliant piece of work that every rock fan should have in their collection.
B00003CY0V|5.0|From the directing team of Gone in 60 Seconds comes a tale that will have your head spinning when the final blow is delivered before the closing credits.  One of the best films of its kind I have ever seen.  A masterfully written script that will have you guessing until the end.  A must see for anyone tired of the same old good guy vs. bad guy movies where the plot is so predictable and paper thin that you could cut through it with a dull pair of scissors.  Hugh Jackson and John Travolta deliver very good performances as wells as Hally Berry.
014028009X|1.0|I seldom dislike books.  This one I did.  I dislike it because there is nothing to see that produces a change in Bridget except a man.  It is a stereotypical plot - a woman is nothing without a man, and she cannot relate to herself without the context of a man.  And, Bridget is an alcoholic, surrounded by alcoholics, swimming in a sea of self-loathing, self-doubt, self-negation, until a man comes (literally and figuratively) into her life to save her.  Sure, this book reflects many of the dark moods of women, but it does nothing to redeem its charracter.  I will say that Bridget obviously has good friends, and is capable of caring about others, and has others who care about her - but she cannot believe in her own worth, except in the relationship with another, usually a man.  The world is a reflection of her self-worth, and changes from moment to moment.  Not a healthy ego.  The only thing which redeemed the book, on the first (not fifth) mentioning was the being eaten by an Alsatian.  Too bad the manuscript was not eaten by Alsatians, long before it got to press.
0316666343|5.0|I have not read a book in years!  Shameful isnt it?  Well I do not really like reading actually.  MY eyes cross and I fall asleep most of the time.  But I have to recommend this book.  I saw the article in newsweek and bought it immediately.  When I got it I couldnt put it down.  My husband was extremely jealous of this book taking away his quality time with me.  =)  Great great book!
B00005R87Q|4.0|I think this is a very good and interesting. The movie is mostly about this guy named Dominick Toretto (Vin Diesel). Dominick and his friends high-jack a few trucks with dvd players, t.v. and stuff like that. So the cops send Brian Spilner (Paul Walker) to join Dominick's racing gang to find out whos high-jacking the trucks. So David and Dominick become close friends.And in the end Brian and Dominick drag race eachother, and Dominick gets in a car accident and the cops had already found out that Dominick was the one who was high-jacking the trucks, and when the cops were on their way Brian let Dominick go.<BR>I would reccommend this picture to people who like cars,racing,and action.
B000000WZ4|4.0|After recooperating from DM's nightmare of an album Songs of Faith and Devotion and suffering from the traumas that seemed to be plagueing lead singer Dave Gahan this album came to a relief.  Ultra couldn't have come at a better time.  Just as fans were about to dismiss Depeche Mode, Ultra came as a real treat to the many DM fans that were anxiously awaitng some new material from this inspiring band.  Ultra has put Depeche Mode back on the musical spotlight again after a haunting absence.  Though Ultra is a little more on the subtle side, the album contains some nice songs and some beautiful music.  Unlike their previous album, this album is more remenicent of Depeche Mode's earlier work that DM fans cherish so dearly.  Barrel of A Gun was the first single to come out of this album and though it is not the best song on this record it is still very catchy with some great classic DM style music.  Sister of Night is probably the most beautiful track on the album with beautiful music and lyrics.  Both instrumental tracks of Jazz Thieves and Uselink add musical quality to the several highlights of this album.  The band stuns with a great hard rock influnced track of Useless in which Dave's voice sounds as good as ever.  <BR>This entire album is a further insight into the enigmatic realm of Depeche Mode.  This album will not dissapoint.
0553812173|4.0|I greatly enjoyed Steven Erikson's &quot;Gardens of the Moon&quot;.  Its a grim, epic fantasy in the vien of Glen Cook's Black Company series.  Steven Erikson has a vivid, well-imagined world peopled by soldiers, spies, wizards and assorted baddies all competing for not very well-defined goals.  If I have a single difficulty with &quot;Gardens of the Moon&quot; its that every character, no matter who seemingly insignificant, has some power or skill that raises them far above the human norm.  This gets old very quickly.
B00003CX9Q|1.0|I am not pro gun or anything, but altering the movie so that the crooks have walkie talkies instead of guns is just stupid.  Why do Lucas and Spielberg insist on editing the classics.  I wouldn't take this DVD if you gave it to me.
0393317552|5.0|The author undertakes to explain why Europeans and Asians (especially the former) came to dominate the world instead of Africans, New Guineans or other cultures. Diamond has a scientific backgroud and includes lots of data to support his thesis that geography (not innate abilities or cultures) was the primary factor. But this book doesn't make an open-and-shut, scientific case for Diamond's position -- a fact he acknowledges in his epilogue by urging further scientific research.<br />Nonetheless, Diamond makes a good case that in general, geographic access to the opportunity for food production led to denser populations, which led to the disease-resistance, weapons production and scientific advances that made conquest of other societies possible.<br />Some of Diamond's conclusions are supported better than others. For example, he dismisses in one paragraph research claiming that some races are more intelligent then others, then goes on to claim based entirely on anecdotal evidence and speculation that the average New Guinean is more intelligent than the average American.<br />Diamond also concludes several times that remarkable historical figures could not have changed the inevitable rise of societies blessed with geographic advantages. But later he attributes the Chinese people's failure to reach the western Americas almost entirely to a single political decision to end shipping.<br />Despite these flaws, more obvious in some chapters than others, Diamond has done an excellent job to explain why world history turned out the way it did. He condenses an extensive amount of data into a lucid, readable argument for his position.
0380789035|2.0|I would have loved to give this a much higher rating.  However, I was completely disappointed by the plot.  Gaiman had a great idea going and could have done much better.  Most of the &quot;twists&quot; turned out to taken from daytime soap operas.  I guess the first red flag was when (and, trust me, I'm not giving away any of the plot here) Laura came back from the dead... And our main character was not even remotely suprised.  Really now.  I felt the characters were devoid of all... um... character... extremely flat.  However, the idea behind the book was great.  I just wish Gaiman made up his mind on wheather or not this was going to be humorous or serious (would have been much more enjoyable if he didn't try to be so serious).  If you were disappointed as I was with this book, try Good Omens.
B0000636UN|2.0|this one is just a few notches below other cd's of hers that i love (globe sessions, tues...).  she just doesn't seem as &quot;into it&quot; and the songs all sound alike.  also, her voice is a bit different and i don't like it.
B000068QY7|4.0|Oasis have come back into their original form with the release of their new album Heathen Chemistry. As with any album, they have a couple of poor mistakes added to the track listing but they are soon forgotten when the songs like 'The Hindu Times', 'Stop Crying Your Heart Out', 'Songbird' and my personal favourites 'She Is Love' but most of all 'Little By Little' come on. Heathen Chemistry has the odd twist with the singing performances being shared between both Noel and Liam Gallagher. It is made very apparent that the brothers have made their idols The Beatles but with sounds like The Beatles, who can go wrong? A few of the songs on this CD have potential to be radio singles if things turn out well for the band. At least they are back in their usual form which is the important thing. Well worth buying the CD though. &gt;Enjoy&lt;
B000065U1N|5.0|I am a historical drama fan! So, when this movie came out I went to see it right away eventhough I do not like Josh Hartnett and Ewan McGregor. This movie had completely blown me away! There were several faces that was alien to me but their performace were so good that gave a lasting impression. Most notable were Eric Bana and William Fichtner.Bana is gorgeous and his portrayal of a brave, manly and mucho delta force solider was right on.<BR>The action is amazing and accurate. One must note that there are a lot of gut ranching and bloody scenes, from this I must conclude that BHD has captured the intensity of the terrors and violence of war. <BR>Special features included the making of BHD. It is only after watching it I realize that Bana is Australian(his accent). There is some footage of the actors going to boot camp before shooting and you can tell they had bonded and had a lot of fun.One should never miss a movie like this!<BR>There is one more thing, this is an entertaining  film, do not treat it like  a documantary because it tend to be one-sided and overly exaggerated the American heroism. If you want to know more about the what really happen, I recommend you to pay attention to the history channel, they have a special documentary about the truE story of BHD!

0609610570|5.0|This book starts with a story of a CEO who has had everything in his favor - A fine strategy, an excellent team empowered to perform, a good market, the best consultants; yet the company fails to meet its goals, quarter after quarter. Shortly afterward the board fires this CEO. In reality 40 CEOs of top 200 Fortune 500 companies lost their jobs- not retired but fired by their boards in 2000 alone.  The gap between aspirations and performance, between Companies that get the results against those who wish to reach there is what this book is about.<br />To give us a detailed account of this reality, I doubt if we can ever have a better team than this. Welcome to Execution. This book is not just for CEOs but is a must read for all Managers who are accountable for results. <br />The Organizational processes are classified as Strategic, People and Operational. The Strategic aspect deals with Economy, Markets, Competition and where the Organization would like to go from where it is. The Operational aspect deals with putting strategy into action; the how of reaching there with details on budgeting, reviews and course correction in the short run. The People process emerges as the core and most important element of the three. It is ultimately the people who are responsible to put Strategy into action. It is they who define the culture of the Organization and build its character.  In fact it is recommended that the CEO should never delegate the responsibility to hire and apprise his A team. The CEOs main strength comes from the top 30 percent of the people. It is important that a strong culture for performance and rewards is nurtured to get Strategy into reality.  Human Resources function should play a key role in assisting the CEO in this vital area. HR is not a staff function for hiring and compensating people, but it should integrate itself with he Operations and Strategic aspects to understand the quality of people required for the successful accomplishment of goals. Organizational mechanisms to identify high potential employees, constant appraisal and feed back and a plan to get the best out of these bright people is the foundation of the people process. Needless to say, Organizations run the risk of losing their best people to competition if such systems are not in place. In such a system it is also important to identify and remove obstacles for growth. Sometimes, over a period of time some people are elevated to their levels of incompetence and are occupying positions that are key to success of strategy. But unfortunately, while these executives have been successful in the past there is no guarantee of their reaching anywhere near the goals in future. They fail to understand markets, are not culturally tuned to performance driven environments and are a sure prescription for disaster. The people process should take the courage to clean up such patches and bring in the flexibility to hire the required talent from outside. <br />The CEO's is not an ornamental position of meeting the press, analysts and consultants, but an integral part of running the business; day in and day out. It is through such deep involvement and setting personal example of getting things done that he or she can continue to preside over the engine of growth and wealth creation.<br />This book is about achieving excellence in action. Highly recommended.
0815411839|5.0|Donald Spoto must have done a lot of hard work to uncover all this information about Marilyn.  In this extensive biography (the best I've read) we learn things that maybe we'd never heard about before.<br />And, by interviewing people close to Marilyn such as Milton H. Greene and Inez Nelson (?), by reading papers from Marilyn to Lee/Paula Strasberg, Pat Newcomb, and others influential in her life, DS gives us further insight into the life of this beautiful but misunderstood immortal screen goddess.  <br />We also learn the truth about her death.  No, Marilyn was not killed by the Kennedys.  (Both Bobby and John had alibis, and the information DS presents show no reason why they would want to assassinate her anyway.) And from what DS says, Marilyn was planning to remarry Joe DiMaggio and to her friends it didn't seem that she was planning to kill herself.<br />His hypothesis is that her suicide may have been accidental, after being fed all those barbituates by different people through all the years, and Dr. Ralph Greenson and her housekeeper, Eunice Murray, may have had a hand in it.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book and learned so much from it!

B00005JKQZ|2.0|The Performances were exceptional, but that was about it.  The pace of the film was really unbalanced, lingering in the wrong places, rushing through others.  It didn't even cover Nash's life very well, leaving out a lot of key points, but focusing intensely on some of the less interesting aspects.  A lot of things were never explained.  It just felt way too long, but at the same time incomplete.  Thus, it was very, very boring.  Ron Howard has kept up his tradition of following strict Hollywood formulas, steering clear of any originality the script even had potential to offer.  This movie wasn't terrible, but it's nowhere near worthy of the praise it's recieved let alone the Best Picture award.
0553381709|5.0|Wolves, lions, and dragons converge in A Storm of Swords.  Dark, powerful and sinister as you want to imagine.<br />Brilliantly realized characters of complexity (like the Hound) - one of my favorites - and contradictions like Littlefinger (who I love to hate).<br />Characters of cruelty and brutality among oathbreakers, turncoats and cutthroats at every turn.  Plus a beautiful, most evil sorceress.  Revenge is scored high with dripping horror.<br />This book is not for the faint of heart.<br />Just when you think to toss this book when (seemingly) absolutely everyone and everything is spiraling downward into despair (without one ray of hope) comes along a few stories full of twists and mind-stretching events that capture real genius in the telling and you are once again held spellbound.<br />· The Knight of Flowers and the day of the Tourney<BR>· The Frey's wedding party for the Starks<BR>· All the Maid of Tarth's story (especially in the bear pit)<BR>· The presenting (and to whom) of the reforged, famous greatsword Ice<BR>· How Kingslayer redeems some measure of honor (bit by aching bit)<BR>· The Red Viper's duel with Mountain---You will never forget the name, Ella of Dorne, I promise you!<br />For these stories alone, this last book (in a trilogy) is a must read.  Martin (to my humble estimation) has not equaled this mammoth saga before or since.

B0000203YT|1.0|If you are a lover of Shakespeare, English and/or period movies, be prepared to be extremely disappointed with this movie. If you really want to own a DVD or video of this movie, rent it first. If you like Judi Dench, you may want to buy it for this reason alone, then you can scan the part where she is shown, otherwise this movie is not worth watching again or worse, owning. This is the first movie I've seen of Gwyneth Paltrow and I think this is the main reason why I could care less if I see another movie with her on the cast. Paltrow is dry and artificial. This movie is so ridiculous, it is almost insulting. Not even Judi Dench's magnificent performance (as always) could save it.
B000066F6H|3.0|while &quot;hate to say i told you so&quot; is a great single, and the cover of &quot;find another girl&quot; is a great listen, this has so been done before, and so much better... i know, i know, not everything can be completely original, but i find a great deal of these songs to be just plain boring. the supposed &quot;raw&quot; energy just isn't there, as this album has been over produced. either pickup some old stooges or mc5, or the white stripes if you want new... listenable, but nowhere near the quality of those other works.
B00005V3Z4|2.0|Through all the angst of the movie, all the confusion and just general darkness, I kept thinking it would probably have some ending that would blow me away.  After all, look at the cast.  Some fine acting talent there.<br />Unfortunately, it is rife with huge logic leaps.  For example, we have a teenager that is in therapy and under medication for hallucinations, imaginary friends, whatever.  Does he start asking questions about hallucinations?  Precognition?  Drug side effects and expansion of the mind?  Nope.  He suddenly has an intense interest in wormholes and time travel.  Not only is it not a logical deduction for the audience, we're never given any inclination as to why the character made the jump.  Apparently they don't have Star Trek in his world, because he has to go get the answers from his science teacher.  He could've gotten more detailed information from a single Star Trek: The Next Generation episode.<br />So, when we get to the end of the film, we have a deus ex machina that comes in and fixes everything.  Ta-da!  As a viewer, I felt cheated of the climactic ending the rest of the film demanded.  Unfortunately, that's gotten to be typical of horror flicks lately, though I wouldn't classify this as horror.  It left me with the feeling that if they'd just made a few changes, they could've made this an outstanding movie.  As it was, when the credits started rolling I was left with one overwhelming question: \\"huh?\\"
B0000640VN|5.0|This is perhaps one DVD I'll watch till the disc melts in the DVD player.<br />Dashing Leopold (Hugh Jackman) is the epitome of very vitally attractive gentlemanliness. And going by Kate's (Meg Ryan) expression in one scene, I was just as shell shocked. Horray for men who still have integrity all rolled up into one swooningly romantic package of gentlemanly courtliness. Bravo to this romantic comedy for bringing back a reminder of just how beautiful (so what if it's hokey?) romantic movies are without the blatantness of sex scenes or gory violence. This movie restores my faith in the movie industries talents and skills to make a film that offers funny, old-fashioned romance (even one set in the 21st century) without a lot of sex and violence. Even my 4 year-old niece watched this movie with me! All four times!<BR>A major plus to your DVD library.
B00006690G|4.0|Like any rapper who lasts more than 15 minutes, it's a bit hard to separate fact from fiction in the world of Marshall Mathers/Slim Shady/Eminem.  Luckily for us, the facts make for some pretty entertaining music.  Assuming all that has been said in the press about him is true, one hopes these albums are cathartic for the boy.<br />When you have 3 public personas, then you're bold enough to name your first 3 albums after each one, a pattern has to emerge.  THE SLIM SHADY LP was a white underground rapper shooting for the big-time.  THE MARSHALL MATHERS LP unleashed the genie from the bottle, yet its most resonant words (not from the fictional yet affecting \\"Stan,\\" but from the title track) were probably Eminem's seemingly heartfelt, \\"I'm just Marshall Mathers.\\"  And it's this that forms the basis of many of THE EMINEM'S SHOW's finest moments.<br />\\"White America\\" inevitably goes too far, yet anyone with any sense of hip hop history knows its words ring true.<br />\\"Business\\" is the strongest of the many Batman references.  And it's just damn funky song.<br />\\"Cleanin' Out My Closet\\" is the emotional centerpiece of the disc.  And just when you're starting to feel sorry for Mathers, Eminem steps back in and tears into his mother with unchecked fury.  \\"I would never dis my own mother just to get recognition,\\" he says.  It's up to you to decide whether that's true, but the song is unforgettable.<br />Of course, we've heard in past recordings how much Em loves his daugther, Hailie.  It's foregone conclusion that the child will someday end up in therapy, but give the man credit for one unexpected moment of self-censure: While juxtaposing his love for Hailie with his hatred for her mother, Em expresses gratitude that Kim didn't [edit] the child before she was born.<br />Curiously, the weakest songs on the disc are the collaborative efforts with Nate Dogg, D-12 and Dr. Dre (except the flawless \\"Business\\").  Em may still be \\"down\\" with his homies, but he really doesn't need them at this stage in the game.<br />\\"I'll never be Marshall again,\\" Eminem blares in \\"Solider.\\"  And he's right.  This is, after all, The Eminem Show.hem at this stage in the game.<br />\\"I'll never be Marshall again,\\" Eminem blares in \\"Solider.\\"  And he's right.  This is, after all, The Eminem Show.
B00005RY7X|1.0|I can't even believe this album seriously exists.  Can this be for real?  It's almost like a parody of itself!  Now, I don't want to come off as some snob who only listens to cerebral music, I enjoy AC/DC, Van Halen, and some hair metal, but with all due respect, most of their lyrics make me want to hurl.  I can handle dumb party lyrics to some extent, but this is just too much.  Really, this guy makes AC/DC look like Rush.  Plus, the music is way simple, and they go overboard with \\"catchy hooks\\" to the point where it's just annoying.  I can stand to listen to just about anything longer than this.<br />I can't imagine how anyone can hear this and honestly say it's good.  If you want some fun music for a party, go crank up Quiet Riot's \\"Metal Health\\".  If this dude is the savior of rock, then rock doesn't need to be saved.
B00005R87Q|3.0|One of the hallmarks of a true B-movie is the camera work.  When there's more loving detail placed on the race scenes (or the surfing scenes or the fight scenes--whatever!) than on the actors themselves, you know where the director's (and the cinematographer's) priorities lay.<br />One of the most amazing things about &quot;The Fast and the Furious,&quot; is that it takes a cast of relatively attractive young people and makes them look singularly unappealing.  Glam shots do not exactly abound here.  Which may be a plus in the final analysis.  On some level these fairly seedy characters are not actually glamorized.  One could argue that's a good thing.<br />The plot itself does sort of lionize the outlaws, though--not so unexpectedly.  We've seen the whole undercover cop developing sympathy for the bad guys routine before.  Usually, though, they're supposed to snap out of it.  I guess it's harder though when you're in love with the gang leader's sister.  But let's not divulge much more of the not-too-substantial plot.<br />Vin Diesel could be a compelling  screen presence and has been in the past.  But although he has some hot cars here, it's plain that he needs a better vehicle than this.
0316776963|5.0|The rooster is what I call myself whenput in a threatening situation.  David Sedaris has tried to kill the rooster. Twice.  One time, I was in the Seattle Airport eating some recommended by Oprah fried chicken,and I waslaughing so hard at Barrel Fever that I actually choked on Oprah's chicken and had to pull a bone out of my throat.  The rooster choked on chicken. ........Well, the second time Sedaris almost killed me was last week when I was reading the story \\"You Can't kill The Rooster\\".  This is a story about his brother who is so very different from the rest of his family.  This is a masterwork in storytelling and and character.  I was laughing so hard that I nearly died.....People argue that Sedaris is inconsistent.  I certainly didn't laugh out loud at all the pieces but I did at least thirty percent of them.  I really can't think of a time I have laughed at thirty percent of anything........In this world of guarded storytelling, Sedaris is not afraid to show his warts, his families blemishes, and the world's scabs.  Whether it be teaching,tourism,fancy restaurants, Easter(Jesus Shaves in another hilarious piece)or living in a foreign country,Sedaris consistently translates the plight of the odd man out in such a way that you laugh until you choke on a chicken bone, but you can't help but think about the pieces for a while after. ...This is a highly hilarious and recommendable work.

B00005YW4H|4.0|It's good to see so much young female artists in the Jazz Vocal world. Success came to Diana Krall, Cassandra Wilson and now it seems like the beautiful Norah Jones has that pleasure. <BR> &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; is, in my opinion, an overrated record by the media. Norah has, indeed, a beautiful and gentle voice, and her interpretations have, at times, the likes of &quot;country-style&quot; female vocalists. This album has, globaly, a warm and soft sound, but Norah Jones never seems like she's falling asleep. I mean, there's always a strong feeling in her voice. She's there! The more fast tunes are there too and the melodies are instrumentaly rich.<BR> This is an album that worth a carefull listen. Jazz fans (like I am) will enjoy this work by a singer with... a smooth voice. Well done!
B00003CX8J|5.0|I enjoyed this movie at the theater but felt like the story was a little difficult t follow (like reading the comics). I rented the DVD, however, and now I can appreciate the X-men like so many others!<br />Despite some fine special effects (I particularly liked the scenes when Storm lets loose with her powers) and a worthwhile script (Thank goodness), the acting is what stands out and makes the movie a classic. Of course, Patrick Stewart is wonderful as Dr. X! Ian McKellen is more than superb as the villain- WOW! The final of the \\"Big Three\\" is Hugh Jackman who plays Wolverine (Logan). I didn't shine too much at first to Jackson, and thought he couldn't pull off the most interesting comic character, but he did by showing toughness and a lot of heart, just like Woverine. Fun, fun, fun movie...........Can't wait for the sequel!!!
B00002E224|1.0|Geez, what a mistake! I looked at the score (4.5 \\"stars\\" - not bad) and bought the DVD. Watched one third of this movie with great hope to see some action. Nope. Not in this one. I fast-forwarded the rest, stopping at some points... still nothing. Obviously there is something missing... something that makes miles of film into a movie. The play is horrible (seems like some cheap real time show with teenagers). Unfortunately, cannot rate this with zero (or negative). That would do it...
B00000IQV6|5.0|i absolutely possitively love this movie. not only was it touching but it was also sad when the guy shot his girlfriend. i had so much to say to mr williams for an excellent portrayal in a true story. he has a jim carrey esque man on the moon feel to him. actually if andy was older they probably would have hired mr williams. great acting , great story , just plain great.
0452281881|5.0|To my knowledge there just isn't anything out there quite like \\"e\\".  Sure, there may be other books that use the texts of e-mails to advance their stories, but in Matt Beaumont's extraordinary first novel the e-mails do it all.  Set in the London offices of a worldwide advertising agency called Miller Shanks--Armitage Shanks being, in real life, a popular British urinal manufacturer--which is hot on the trail of an account with Coca-Cola.  They might win it, too, if the self-aggrandizing executives and back-stabbing secretaries would allow the lascivious creative staff the freedom to do the job.  <br />Anyone who has worked in an office, or knows someone who has worked in an office will recognize Beaumont's archetypal characters even though he has blown them wonderfully out of proportion: the artistic director who does no work and takes all the credit; the lonely accounts staffer who runs auctions from his desk; the secretary who can't do simple tasks because she has a body waxing appointment; the tongue-pierced graphic designers who only come to work for the toys, the female co-workers' cleavage, and the beer money.  That's just the outer offices!<br />Beaumont gets a remarkable number of different voices pitch-perfect.  The only time I was able to put this book down was when it forced me into uncontrollable fits of falling-off-the-couch laughter.  I've laughed out loud to other British authors Stephen Fry, Nick Hornby and Martin Amis, but to none of them so often or so long as to \\"e\\". If you like sarcasm, if you like dramatic irony, if you love it when horrible people get exactly what's coming to them, you will not be able to put \\"e\\" down either.<br />And once you've enjoyed \\"e\\", check out Amazon.co.uk to pick up Beaumont's short, but worthy follow-up not published in the US: \\"The e Before Christmas\\". Cheers!
B000062XM7|5.0|i absolutely loved this excellent piece of art. it definetly got my thumbs up reviews. it is fantastic. the artwork , the setting , and the battle scenes were so gripping that your on the edge of your seat while watching it. i first watched this movie in history club when i was in 7th grade and it is still great.
B000002UAR|5.0|Revolver is a fabulous album. Don't know why, but it was not well-publicised in Australia in 1966. I didn't even hear about it until after Sgt Pepper.<br />This is the first Beatles album to include studio chatter, though the chatter and count in at the beginning of Taxman were added afterwards! Taxman breaks new ground, with direct references to the Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition and Greek mythology. Thus, from the album's beginning, you know that The Beatles are charting new territory.<br />Eleanor Rigby is one of the very best Beatles lyrics. The harmony is simple [you can play it with two chords], and the musical arrangement for string octet [2 each of the instruments used in a string quartet] is much more sophisticated than Yesterday's, though that is clearly its inspiration.<br />George created a clever backwards lead guitar solo for the middle and end of I'm Only Sleeping. It is hard to imagine the song without it [though that is how it was first released in the US.] Lennon has skilfully created music that sounds as lazy as its lyrics.<br />Love You To also breaks new ground with its more full use of Indian instruments and scales. It is leaps and bounds further on the way than the first attempts in Norwegian Wood.<br />The vocal harmonies of Here, There and Everywhere recreate some of the great moments of Rubber Soul. George Martin says this is one of Paul's favourites of his songs.<br />Yellow Submarine introduces interesting sound effects, mostly created in the studio for the simple singalong song. Ringo plays his part perfectly.<br />She Said She Said is John's first foray into unusual rhythms. The song still sounds contemporary, 35 years later.<br />In Good Day Sunshine, Paul pays tribute to The Lovin' Spoonful. The pianos and vocals evoke a happy Summer's day. The surprising key change at the end of the song still stops you in your tracks.<br />Lennon's And Your Bird Can Sing has a wonderful obbligato played by two lead guitars. This is a clever musical arrangement, with a great bass line, too.<br />For No One has a simple descending bass line, and a great french horn solo. But McCartney sounds a little out of tune on a couple of descending phrases, as he did on a descending section in Hold Me Tight [from With The Beatles].<br />George's I Want To Tell You makes effective use of an opening crescendo [like Eight Days A Week], dissonance and the #9 chord [itself jarringly dissonant], so effectively used by Jimi Hendrix in Purple Haze and Foxy Lady. This was really my introduction to dissonance.<br />Got To Get You Into My Life has a great Tamla Motown sound, mostly created by the brass instrumentation.<br />Tomorrow Never Knows is one of the most unusual Beatles songs, due to the creative collaboration of Lennon, the writer and singer, and McCartney [who did the tape loops that are such an important part of the song].<br />One of the cleverest Beatles albums, and the favourite of many.<br />Highly recommended.clever musical arrangement, with a great bass line, too.<br />For No One has a simple descending bass line, and a great french horn solo.

B0000025D0|5.0|This album literally changed my life...and probably saved it. Anyone who is 15 and has more pentup rage towards parents, school and life in general than a rabid Pit Bull  can relate to the immeasurable resentments that live in &quot;Badlands,&quot; &quot;Something In The Night,&quot; &quot;Adam Raised A Cain&quot; and the title song. Just knowing that someone - ANYONE - knew what I was going through was enough to keep me going through the psychological  field of land mines that is adolescence.<br />     Many people have criticized this album as being to emotionaly overwrought. I disagree - Springsteen's point here is that part of livng a successful life is to feel things with passion. The older I get, the easier it is for me to forget this valuable, hard-earned lesson. I need to listen to this album more often, and ANYONE who loves rock &amp; roll needs to hear it at least once! Buy this album!
6305807086|1.0|I'm not a movie hater, but this movie had to be the worst movie ever made.  As other reviewers have said, the idea/plot for this movie was totally unique &amp; interesting, but that is all the movie had to offer!

0812550706|5.0|Since you are most likely going to read Ender's Game yourself, I'm not going to bore you with a summary. Really, aside from deep characters and a wonderful plot, Ender's Game is a brief read, yet endlessly satisfying. On one hand, it is a straight forward science fiction story (one of the best) that will please any younger reader. On the other, it is a human drama that deals with much more than starships and space battles. Ender's Game also thrusts unique characters (in some ways, not too unlike us) into difficult situations that rarely have the outcome we expect. It gives older readers so much to think about and leaves you literally screaming for more books about Ender. Orson Scott Card keeps your eyes riveted to each page and eager to see what happens next. Even if you don't like science fiction, you will probably be pleased with the skill and dedication that clearly went into the writing of this book.
B000002UYZ|3.0|As far as the music contained on \\"Red\\",I give it 5 stars.But honestly,Capitol Records could have fit both albums on 1 CD.They did it with \\"Endless Summer\\" by The Beach Boys. I can see \\"Blue\\" being on 2 because it is too long to fit on 1 CD but \\"Red\\"? You do the math.The Beatles put out some good music in their career but as usual,Capitol Records is finding a way to scam the record buying public.Wait!..they could have put some bonus tracks-oh,that's too much like straight.
B000002GXX|5.0|'One of these nights' is the Eagles' best album to date. While most Eagles albums are spotty through out, this one stands strong.<BR>Several hits came out of this record, including &quot;Lyin' eyes&quot;, &quot;Take it to the limit&quot; and the title track. Although, there are more than hits included here as well. &quot;After the thrill is gone&quot; is a great song. Don Felder's only lead vocal contribution, &quot;Visions&quot; is one of the album's finer moments. And the slow &quot;I wish you peace&quot; builds to a fitting conclusion for the album.<BR>Even some of the odd, or weak songs are pretty good. &quot;Too many hands&quot;, and &quot;Hollywood waltz&quot; get better the more you listen to them. And the instrumental &quot;Journey of the Sorcerer&quot; is just different enough to keep your attention.<BR>If there is a true Eagles album to have (not including any of their 'Greatest hits' packages) this is the one. Anyone interested in the Eagles, if you started off here, you won't regret it.
B000002P5R|5.0|After reading the reviews here, I went and ran my old Cry of Love through record cleaning machine and gave it a whirl. Happily it is in very fine condition. The sound has not changed. If you love Hendrix, you'll love these cuts. I would not spend too much time worrying about whether the cuts are in the right order. The point is that the man is playing on these cuts, the music he wanted to play.<br />...Picked up the CD. Sound engancements are great.
B000056JYB|4.0|I really enjoyed this cd, jam sessions and all. I suppose I could have bought just the single re-mastered original but what vintage Steve Winwood fan could possibly do that?? Steve was 21 years old at the time and not only could sing incredibly (the Blind Faith material showcases him singing with his hardest vocal edge - wow!!) but was a virtuoso on the piano, organ and guitar. (Can anyone even imagine a similar 21 year old rock star today??)<BR>I would love to give this cd 4 1/2 stars, taking 1/2 star off for its not matching Winwoods work with Traffic at the time.

I'm not going to go into why I hated this film,(I couldn't do it in less then 1,000 words) I'm just going to tell you why I hated the DVD.<BR>      This DVD is horrible because it doesn't have scene selections. You have to fast forward. I was at the 2 hour mark when something happened to the DVD player and I had to start at the beginning, I was just hoping to God the film would end. I just wanted to finish the film! BUT NO! I had to spend what seemed like an hour, fast-forwarding through the stuff I had already scene (AND HATED). One of the pluses of having a DVD is so you don't have to fast forward. If you really want to waste your money on this film, buy the VHS.<BR>      I will tell you this, after watching this movie I felt I had been cheated, that I had wasted almost 3 hours of my life, and had gained nothing. That's not a pleasant feeling.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I will be sweet and short to the point. I love this movie. I like all of the Jane Austen Adaptations, but this one is different from the rest. It's gritty, not as showy. The characters are well portrayed. Get this one. You will not be sorry.
B00000JCOV|5.0|...I tip my hat to Slipknot, for they have come a long way, even with these heathens screaching about how bad they are. This CD, along with Metallica's 'Ride...' were the albums that got me into the world of metal, so I this album gets even more praise.<BR>   Listen, if you truly listen to the album, there's really no comparison to bands like Korn, and you can truly see that, even if you don't like the music, these are talented musicians. Which leads me to another point. It's quite alright if you don't LIKE the music, it's just, what makes you look like a more mature person...or making good points about why you don't like the band (like the wickerman, etc.)?<BR>   One lat point before I describe the band: Tell me, who wore masks and jumpsuits before Slipknot, hmm? Let's see....Mr. Bungle. That's all. Nowadays it's Slipknot, Mushroomhead, and Berzerker (and Mr. Bungle, if they're still around). So WHY is this 'mask-n-jumpsuit' thing called a trend? You wanna see a trend, look at how many people are bashing Slipknot nowadays.<BR>The Band-<BR>   Sid, turntables-...Sid does an excellent job with a basically unused instrument in the metal industry, and he is definately one of the reasons I see Slipknot as a different band than the rest.<BR>   Mick, guitars- AHH. Why must people rip on him all the time? So WHAT if he doesn't play leads? Neither does most of your precious black metal and death metal bands! And just check out the solo-esque riff on 'Surfacing'. Mick even teaches guitar. So please, go naysay on Mortician's guitar before you say anything about Mick or Jim.<BR>   Jim, guitars- Many people think it ignorant and pointless to have two guitarists in a band like this. What I think is incredible is how Jim and Mick can do these dual guitar rhythms with no solos and sound even better than a song with a solo. Many bands out there today need only one guitarist, but with Slipknot, only two will work, and Jim is the perfect spot-filler.<BR>   Corey, vocals- Corey sings with much more intenisty and brutality than people give him credit for. Try singing like him while thrashing around on stage. And plus, I believe Corey was being an individual by writing about hate back in '99. I mean, back then, we had 'true' black metal bands singing about satan (Ooh! What talent! What individuality!) and we had watered down...death metal singing about gore. While it might be trendy today, it's still more brutal than any of these new bands' lyrics.<BR>   Paul, bass- I repsect Paul greatly. I am a bass player, and I have decided never to use a pick, just my fingers, and it's always inspiring to see another in the metal biz that can play awesome music, intricate, fast riffs, and still be able to punch 'em out with just their fingers. Just check out his stuff on 'Spit it Out' or 'Eeyore'.<BR>   Joey, drums- What can I say about this can that has already been said? While his speed can be matched by just a handful, it's Joey's style that seperates him from the crowd. It's indescribable. Just listen to ANYTHING on the CD and you'll know what I mean.<BR>   Shawn & Chris, percussion- It's Shawn & Chris's odd percussions that makes this album and 'Iowa' such a differnet album. I mean, they just make you go 'Jeez, that drummer must have eight arms and legs and one one expensive drum kit!' until you see the band members in the booklet. I mean listen to 'Surfacing' or '(sic)'. Who used custom percussion like this in the metal world other than Igor (Sepultura)? These percusion notes pounded out by Shawn and Chris add that one huge element to the album that makes it just a cut above all other 'nu'-metal bands.<BR>  ...Who had a SAMPLER in their band before Slipknot, huh? And who does it better, that dude from 'linkin park' ot this guy? I mean, if you really sit down and listen to it, those odd songs on this CD that are just full of samples and weird percussions are truly a musical journey. That's what makes this guy so good at what he does. I was a little dissapointed when he didn't get used on as much on 'Iowa.'<br />Well, there you have it. This album really is something differnet if you're curious about nu-metal. I mean, I can understand why some people don't enjoy as much, being that they maybe grew up listening to Korn, but if you've never dabbled in the genre of nu-metal, this TRULY will blow your mind.<br />P.S.- Still aren't believing that Corey and Jim can sing/play, hm? Why don't you check out there blues/classical (with some metal songs, I think. Haven't heard the complete album.) side project, 'Stone Sour.' Now tell me, what band from any genre of metal pull off something like a blues/classical album?
B00003CXXP|1.0|One of the other reviewers noted that you will either love or hate this film. They were absolutely correct. I hated it. True, it will raise interesting questions, but who ever wrote the screenplay has never experienced parenthood.<br />First, there is a line in the movie that asks &quot;imagine having a child that will stay a child forever.&quot; No parent would want that. Part of the thrill of being a parent is watching the child develop. <br />There are also a couple of incidents where parents jump to a conclusion about something, I am trying to not give too much of the story away. Again this shows that the screenwriter knew nothing about parenting. The first thing a parent learns is that when something happens you ask a child to explain. They never do this. If they had there wouldn't have been a story. It is like a bad &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; script where there is an obvious and easy resolution to the problem, but you don't do it because you need to have a story.<br />This is one of the MOST depressing films I have ever seen. I typically don't walk out of movies, but this one was SO rediculous that I would have if my wife hadn't prevented me. By the way, she hated it as wel
0312265859|3.0|In Stephanie Plum's eighth adventure, she is doing a favor for her parents' next-door neighbor. The neighbor's daughter, Evelyn is missing as well as Annie, her grandchild. If they do not show up within the next few days the neighbor will lose her house which she put into collateral in a child custody bond. Evelyn's former husband will be glad to collect and he has not made it a secret. Stephanie will try to do what she can since she is a bounty hunter and not a detective.<br />What have we learned from the other seven novels? Stephanie has bad luck with cars, she is always way over her head, and there is a skip tracer who always manages to make Stephanie look like a fool. This novel is no different. There is little emphasis put in Evelyn's story in order to make room for Stephanie's misadventures. The ending of this novel seemed to be rushed and the story does not have a clear resolution as to why Evelyn disappeared. The story that Evelyn gives Plum sounds a bit bogus and unconvincing.<br />Anyone who has read Ms. Evanovich's previous novels will read this book no matter what anyone else says. It is just that it is about time for Stephanie to grow as a character and be able to do something that is important and meaningful to her besides Tasty Kakes and sex. There is much more that the author can explore with this character and hopefully it will happen in the future. It is time for Stephanie to be involved in a case with very high stakes whether they are personal or emotional. She is always bumbling until she gets the job right. Why not let her do something that she can be proud of? Maybe it is just wishful thinking.
B000068QY7|4.0|I must admit that I avoided Oasis for years because I thought Noel and Liam were pretentious and arrogant fools. That changed one day last summer when I purchased Familiar to Millions and Definately Maybe. I was hooked instantly. I quickly started to collect their remaining C.D's and purchased their book to try and gain a different insight into these guys. Are they arrogant ? YES. Are they talented, YES. Do they deserve the success they have achieved ? YES.<br />As Noel once said, if you tell enough people you are the best band in the world, they will eventually believe you. Maybe Noel has figured out the road to success but you are not going to fool all the people all the time and at some point, you will see through the disguise. The fact that Oasis are still loved by millions would suggest that they have an undeniable talent. Maybe the critics are simply jealous because they never managed to find the same success and find it comforting to pan them all the time. <br />Onto the new C.D.........<br />My only criticism is that it is too short. When I first put it into my C.D player, it gave a running time of 73 minutes. Great. However, the last song &quot;Better Man&quot; never shuts off and so instead of 73 minutes of heaven, we get approximately 43 minutes. &quot;The Hindu Times&quot; is a classic. You can't help but sit up and take note. Along with some of the other classics that Noel has written, this one is right up there and will prove to be a very popular choice at concerts. Liams' contributions fit in well and do not sound out of place. &quot;Songbird&quot; could have been expanded because it has the potential to be a great song. &quot;Born on a Different Cloud&quot; and &quot;Better Man&quot; are two of my favourites. It is nice to see Gem and Andy contributing but again &quot;A Quick Peep&quot; could have been expanded into another &quot;Swamp Song&quot;. &quot;Stop Crying Your Heart Out&quot; will definately become an Oasis classic and &quot;Little By Little&quot; is another great song. <br />Do we actually care that Oasis constantly pays tribute to the Beatles ? NO <br />As a songwriter myself, it is impossible not to be influenced by other artists. Who really cares. I am sure Paul McCartney is honoured by the fact that Noel and Liam are such bigs fans of their earlier albums. <br />The true measure of any musical composition is whether or not people like it. It doesn't matter who influenced who, music is what really matters and if you are an Oasis fan, you'll love their latest C.D as much as the others.
0792839625|1.0|One of the most spectacular shows in Broadway history makes a total bomb as a movie.  Part of it is that this musical wasn't really meant for the movie, but part of it is band directing and bad acting.  There is too much focus on Michael Douglas as Zach (in the original show Zach is heard speaking from a microphone, usually from the theatre's sound booth, and is only seen a few times) which takes the glory away from the dancers.  Among the dancers, the focus is further taken away from the group as a whole and the spotlight thrown on Cassie, especially when she sings \\"What I did for love\\", a song more meaningfully done by Diana on stage.  In addition, the omission of the songs \\"The Music and the Mirror\\" and \\"Montage\\" are incredibly disappointing, most especially since the songs they are replaced with are just horrible.  Do not buy this video, wait until a local theater does it.
B00005JL3A|5.0|I was so excited when I first heard that they were going to make the movie Resident Evil. I am such a huge fan of the series and know everything about the plot. I went to see it four times at the movies and loved it. I recomend this action packed thriller to everyone.

0446677450|5.0|I am shocked and appalled at the people who did not at least gain insight from this book.  I loved it. I tell everyone about it. It was so much fun to read, so motivating and had totally new information in it. I have read at least 30 financial books and many of them say the same things but not this one. I believe the author and I believe he is sincere. The truly rich people I know do what he says. My own brother has instinctively done these things and he is worth about $250 million at age 32 without a college education. The masses are doing the opposite of what he says. Who do you know who has used the equity in their home to pay off credit card debt?  I will admit that most people do not have the guts and discipline to do what he advocates and so they are better off reading the Millionaire Next Door and the Millionaire Mind and doing what those books advocate. I, however, do not want to clip coupons. I want assets to throw off income to exceed my living expenses and I already have one business that is doing that and I am researching some rental property. I can't say enough good things about this book and the next 2 books he wrote which were equally good and go into more detail. I have the Cashflow for Kids game and my 8 year old son is more knowledgeable now than many of my friends. By the way, my husband and I are self-employed and have been incorporated since 1992 and have done very well for ourselves but now we will do even better. I think you will miss out on a very important and enjoyable book if you don't read it.

006092988X|5.0|In an effort to move away from books that are published to appeal to women's book groups, we decided to select a classic.  No wonder \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" has endured!  This book was so far ahead of its time, it pleases me no end to imagine that school students are still reading it and finding meaning in it.<br />I would be hard put to decide which of the well-defined characters would actually be my favorite character.  <br />I think I will carry Francie Nolan, her mom, Katie and her aunts in my heart always.  I also loved the way Johnny Nolan's alcolholism was treated.  The author was so wise to just tell the story and not moralize as would be the temptation.  The same can be said of the poverty of the people.  It simply spoke for itself.<br />I will simply never forget this book.
0316666343|5.0|I just finished this book which I sped through in two days.  It was one of the  most moving and beautifully written books I have ever read.  I am still thinking about it.  I loved the spiritual elements as well , which I found consoling.  I plan to read her previous book, &quot;Lucky&quot; next because I want more of this author's voice.  Not a light beach read but a life-changing experience.
B00005QIPH|4.0|I first became aware of The Strokes when a friend from work recommended them to me.He had heard some of their music from singles that were released before their first album came out.When I heard &quot;Last Nite&quot; for myself, I decided to purchase the album.I liked it from the start. This was 70's influenced rock and roll done well. Clearly taking their inspiration from the The Clash and Television, The Strokes put on their own mark on that type of music.&quot;The Modern Age&quot;, &quot;Soma&quot;, &quot;Barely Legal&quot;, &quot;Take It or Leave It&quot;, they all sounded great. I play this album all the way through without skipping any tracks. My big complaint, however, is that the some of the vocals seem to be muffled on purpose, for some reason.It isn't really necessary, they don't need to do it. Aside from that, I really enjoyed &quot;Is This It?&quot;.
B000063DFN|5.0|This was my first Iron Maiden album.  Before i bought this i always thought of iron maien as a band that goes crazy and plays freakishly loud without any talent.  Well i was wrong.  Iron Maiden is one of the few bands that have gotten it right.  They managed to play metal loud and fast (no big deal there) and they also managed to add some meledy to the sound.  The songs on this album show what talent Iron Maiden really had.  I can't stop listening to the incredible harmony in the middle of Flash of the Blade.  That blows me away every time.  Powerslave has an awesome chours that you won't be able to stop thinking about for the rest of the day.  The epic Ancient Mariner is what many people consider on of the best Iron Maiden songs of all time. The CD Extra thing is good but its annoying how you have to go through so much to play it in your computer.  Its worth it to see the videos though.  I don't know if this happened to anyone else but the clips on the other albums didn't work for me. Bottom line is if you're a metal fan or a fan of music in general BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!!!
B00005OM4Q|5.0|This director's edition of &quot;Almost Famous&quot; is one of the best DVDs on the market. &quot;Almost Famous&quot; is Cameron Crowe's autobiographical story about a teen-aged reporter on the road with a rock and roll band. The character that Crowe based on himself is William Miller (well played by Patrick Fugit). A reporter for his high school newspaper, the unpopular William dreams of writing for a rock and roll publication. He gets his big chance when he meets his idol, rock reporter Lester Bangs (Phillip Seymour Hoffman, in a great supporting role). Bangs tells William to write an interview for Cream Magazine.  That interview (with Black Sabbath) does not happen, but he meets the opening act, Stillwater.  Soon, Wlliam finds himself on the road with Stillwater, with an assignment to write an article about  them for Rolling Stone.  William is befriended by groupie Penny Lane (Kate Hudson, who deservedly won a Golden Globe and an Oscar nomination), whose boyfriend is the band's lead guitarist (Billy Crudup). What follows is William's sometimes funny and sometimes painful experiences with life on the road. He becomes friends with the band and falls in love with Penny, all while trying to write an objective article for the magazine. It is hard for him to stay objective about his new friends. As Lester observes:&quot;They made you feel cool. And I've met you. You are not cool.&quot;  These situations are all observed with a lot of heart and soul in Cameron Crowe's Oscar winning script.  Frances McDormand adds just the right touch as William's mother, who doesn't understand her son's dreams, but wants to be supportive anyway.  The &quot;bootleg&quot; edition DVD is loaded with lots of REALLY COOL extras. The first disc includes a director's cut with 35 extra minutes, including a birthday party scene for Penny, among others. The second disc includes the original film. The package also gives you commentary by Crowe and his mother Alice; behind-the-scenes foootage; unseen Stillwater concert footage; the original shooting script; an interview with Bangs from 1973; Crowe's top 10 albums of 1973; reprints of Crowe's articles for Rolling Stone; even a six track CD of Stillwater's songs. Only &quot;Fever Dog&quot; appears on both this CD and the soundtrack album. All the songs on the bonus CD are great. &quot;Almost Famous&quot; is one of my favorite movies in recent years. If you are as big a fan of the film as I am, you'll want to get this double disc set. It is a &quot;must purchase.&quot;

0790729628|4.0|The movie gets a perfect score of 5 stars, and I can't really choose between the directors cut version and the theatrical version.  The DC version allows the viewer to come to their own conclusions regarding Dekard and whether he is a replicant or not, and allows you to develop your own insights into the characters.  The Theatrical version on the other hand pretty much holds your hand through the whole movie, which I personally don't mind, yet isn't really necessary, I like a movie which forces you to think about what is going on...and the DC version does just that.<br />This DVD version falls short of 5 stars simply because they didn't digitally remaster the sound and picture quality.  Blade Runner is the perfect movie for 5.1 surround sound, hopefully they will release another version...

B000063JDE|5.0|Blue Velvet is among the most effective two hours of film ever made.  The story of a young man on break from college who goes back to his home town to help out in his father's hardware store seems innocent enough.  But by the time he is being held and beaten by drug addled lunatics while overweight floozies dance on the top of the car to Roy Orbison music you know you are in some very dark and sinister territory.<BR>Dennis Hopper gets under your skin and you fear him as much as any monster or villian in film history.  He is a madman with limitless rage and what's worse is he has an equally freaked out entourage that seem to encourage him to ever more sadistic behavior.<BR>The truly amazing thing about Blue Velvet is how it draws such sharp contrasts.  Laura Dern is just a normal high school girl, but compared to Hopper's character she is as wholesome as an angel.  She represents decency and goodness and lends temporary relief from the madness of the film.<BR>But by the third act, the director throws these contrasts together and the movie erupts with intense drama.<BR>The scene where Jeffrey has Laura Dern and Isabella Rossellini together in the car and Laura Dern's character finally realizes the truth of their relationship is simply fantastic.  You want to crawl under your sofa and hide your head, but you absolutely must keep watching.<br />And then after all is said and done, you remember the quiet little moments.  Ahhh...heineken.

Maybe you have to be a Catholic or at least a Kevin Smith fan, but my advice would be: Don't waste your time OR your money!  There's far better entertainment available.<br />This project is proof positive that not even a great cast can redeem a stinker.  If I were Ben or Matt, I'd be embarrassed!

0140042520|2.0|... I just couldn't get into this book.  It's a beat classic, so I hear, and it's about traveling and living free and enjoying life on lots of levels.  From the descriptions and glowing reviews, I figured I should have loved it.  I even read it while I was traveling up the US/Canadian west coast, and I grew up familiar with many of the areas mentioned in the book.  In spite of all that, I didn't like it at all.  For one thing, it's full of these obscure Buddhist terms and concepts, and although religion is sort of a hobby of mine, I didn't know enough to make sense of all the boddishatva-dropping, and the writing wasn't good enough to make up for that.  I guess I just don't like it when the narrator introduces dialogue with &quot;sez I.&quot;
9992975733|4.0|DR. NO is fun to read but it is also a disappointment.  The first problem is that James Bond very distinctly died in the last book, FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE.  As Arthur Conan Doyle did with Sherlock Holmes, Ian Fleming must have decided that Bond deserved to be resurrected, but he does so unconvincingly.  Bond didn't really die from the sure-fire poison of Rosa Kleb, he was resuscitated and made it through.   <br />Conan Doyle is not the only classic adventure writer Fleming borrows from in DR. NO - there's Edgar Rice Burroughs and Jules Verne in here, too.  Also, strangely, there's a little of the bird guide written by a long forgotten ornithologist with the boring name of James Bond from which Fleming got the name.  All of this meshes together well as a pulp fantasy-adventure book except the part about the birds.  <br />Birds, absent from the movie version (which, along with THE SPY WHO LOVED ME, is one of the only two movies to actually improve upon the Fleming novel), play a central role in DR. NO.  Their presence however is ridiculous, and their contribution to the death of Dr. No is about the silliest moment in the entire James Bond series.<br />The problems with DR. NO don't stop with the birds.  Bond once again makes his way along by his physical endurance rather than his wits.  Sure enough, Bond suspects foul play when other authorities don't, and this time he picks up a few obvious clues that he nevertheless would have missed in prior books, but he always muscles his way out of a jam.  The reader then cannot admire the way Bond thinks, or the way Fleming devises clever situations.  As with most Bond novels, the reader is left to admire how Fleming puts together words.<br />Fortunately, Fleming can still put together words quite well.  Despite DR. NO's faults, it somehow works out to be the most exciting Bond novel of the series thus far.   The book is basically a string of fantastic action scenes, interspersed with characteristic descriptions of food, drink and Bond's surroundings.  This is what Fleming excels at, and he may have had an upper hand in writing this book because he set it mostly on Jamaica where he lived and the nearby Crab Key.  <br />Each Bond book contains certain genuine surprises.  While none can surpass the surprise ending of FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE, DR. NO does not disappoint in this regard.  The biggest shock is the extent to which Bond kills in cold blood here.    Bond murders at least four unsuspecting guards, participates in a (mildly) torturous interrogation of  a young woman, and ends up sleeping with a girl half his age (though he resists her throughout the book).  Combined with his familiar superhumanly heavy drinking and smoking, this rougishness substitutes for character in maintaining Bond as interesting.<br />On the whole, I get the sense from DR. NO that Ian Fleming was tired of his main character and wanted to write a different kind of book.  As a \\"different kind of book\\" it works, and it is fun to read.  Many of the later John Garner and Raymond Benson books seem to follow the DR. NO fantasy model, and that is too bad.  Fleming gets away with it because nobody does it better.
6302637899|5.0|Let me ask this question- do you consider yourself to be normal?  Conventional?  Conformist?  If so, unless you're on drugs, you probably won't like this.  But if you aren't any of these things, you'll love this movie!  It lets out the wild side of you, lets you open up your mind to a world that you might not have known exists.  It's probably especially fun to see live- I still haven't had the chance- but if you're like me and you can't get to it live, the tape works just as well.  Watch it to have a fun time, and if you're watching it with friends, you'll have a greater time!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I've noticed that my film viewing habits include movies that deal with predeterminism, time, and the questions about what constitute reality. Donnie Darko takes on all three and does it admirably. Richard Kelly's first screenplay and directorial debut challenges everything you think you know about time travel and sets it in a wonderful 80's family setting. I loved his family and even though we never know why Donnie's seeing a psychiatrist, we see a slice of his life at home, at school, and in his dreams that alter his and our own ideas about realities. Get it for the Gary Jules version of Tears For Fears' Mad World tune alone.

0345451325|5.0|The Fall of Reach is the excellent prequel to Halo the video game.  It's an entertaining book covering all of the events up until the crash landing on Halo which occurs at the beginning of the video game.  It follows the development of the Spartan soldiers, including the Master Chief.<br />The book is written vary well and is extremely entertaining from the beginning to the end.  I read it in two days, barely being able to put it down to go to sleep.  Even if you're not a fan of the game, you'll be a fan of the book.<br />The only down part to the story is that it makes the Master Chief in the game look a little less talented then he really is in the book.  I also felt that the author was a little constricted in what he was able to write about due to storyline restrictions put upon him by Bungie (you can't really point any out, but you can tell that they're there).<br />In the end, it gives you a very good idea about the entire game.  Many aspects in the book will most likely be brought up in future Halo games, so it may be a bit of a spoiler for some.  Overall, I really did like the book, and if you're into Halo, you should easily be into this book.
B00005Q3TZ|4.0|Pearl Harbor is an entertaining movie,with great visual effects and battle scenes,but one of the sappiest love stories ever.<BR>Most of the performances are decent enough,but Ben Affleck's(normally a very decent actor) character is just downright annoying at times,and his version of a southern accent is not good.<BR>As for the new director's cut,it is a step up from the original,and worth an extra 1/2 star over the original.<BR>The attack sequence is much more graphic and brutal.Really shocking in contrast with the first part of the film.There are other small changes as well.<BR>Of course the sappy love story still remains.<br />The extras are what really makes this new release worthwhile.I haven't listened to any of the commentary tracks yet(there are three I think),but the documentaries are very interesting-the History Channel's documentary on the real Doolittle's Raiders is especially interesting.<BR>There are lots of other extras as well,including a production diary which shows the actual filming of certain sequences.<br />Picture quality is outstanding,and the 5.1 sound(both Dolby and DTS),is fantastic.<br />Overall,while still not a great movie,this is a great DVD release.
0345442970|4.0|Star Wars: Cloak of Deception is one of the most intricate Star Wars novels I have ever read. The book goes into great detail about the events leading up to Episode One, including the Taxation of Trade Routes, the baseless accusations that Chancellor Valorum faced, how Nute Gunray and his lieutenants met Darth Sidious, and more. This book gives the reader a deeper understanding of just how seriously ill the Republic was, and the enormity of the problems in the senate.<br />While the book's plot is fast-paced and enjoyable, it's a more lesiurely read than most. Whereas I can usually polish off a Star Wars book in three to four days, \\"Cloak\\" took me a week to finish. The book does not hide the fact that it is more a political thriller than a regular Star Wars adventure, and the page-turning incentive isn't quite as high until towards the end, when the action kicks into high gear.<br />Still, James Luceno must be commended. In the hands of a lesser author, all the talk about politics and taxation would have come off dry and tedious. Here, even if the reader isn't quite sure what's going on, the dialogue between the characters feel so real, so natural, that one can't help but read on. Luceno captures all the characters from the movie PERFECTLY. From Qui-Gon to Yoda to Palpatine to Nute Gunray, you can hear their voices exactly like you were watching another movie. Many of the Jedi council members also speak, assuring fans that they weren't all mutes in the movies.<br />Star Wars fans will also love the little character cameos thrown in. While some only pop up for half a page of dialogue and feel blatent and jarring (think of movies that hire celebs for a bit part, and when you see them you go \\"Ohhhh! I know them!\\", completely taking you out of the movie), they tie in the overall saga rather nicely.<br />This is a great, well-written Star Wars book. It's different from most of the others, but reading it will make you respect Episode One just a little more.
B00005KHJT|5.0|I have the THX remastered theatrical disc and also the extended television version.  I was not particularly thrilled with the sound on either disc.  The 5.1 THX disc was clear as crystal and it enhanced a lot of obscure background sounds that help enrich the production, but I was constantly adjusting the volume to hear dialogue then avoid ear-splitting music and/or &quot;stingers&quot; (one-note musical bursts to catch you off guard and make you jump).  The Dolby 2.0 track on the extended TV version was much more even.  Picture quality of the two discs was too close for me to be concerned about.  Both offer sharp, brightly colored images, though the added scenes on the TV version are a little muddy and the sound is definitely not up to par.  I was thrilled to find that the extended version is indeed the &quot;R&quot; rated version (brief nudity and some objectionable language) with the TV scenes thrown in.  Both discs boast a 2.35:1 aspect ratio but the view on the THX disc is slightly wider than the TV version (who really cares).  As for the story, it is a masterful classic.  Younger viewers need to look for the art of the film and not expect a bone-chilling thriller as those of us did who quaked in our boots at the film's 1978 debut.  The times have changed too much.  This film is a keeper and a huge credit to the film technology and writers of the 1970's, a decade where so many films were just too trendy and dumb.  Buy both discs.  View one of them on Halloween and watch its immediate sequel!
B0000024UO|5.0|A must have for EVERY blues fan! Period.
B00000JPH6|4.0|I loved this film when I saw it for the first time on the big screen in 1982.  I have seen it several times since then, but I have never owned a copy until I bought the DVD.  The disc is an excellent transfer but there are a few imperfections towards the end of the movie which are the result of spots on the original negatives.  I saw them only once, and only for a moment.  The colors are rich but not as brilliant as they were in the theatre, i.e. the scene where the skeksis and mystics are reunited into one being.  The white images of the beings and the castle interior are not as well illuminated as before.  Also the very last scene where the planet is shown in a restored condition is quite bland compared to the vibrance it displayed in the theatre in 1982.  Otherwise the transfer is as close to perfect as one can get, and I am very pleased to own it and would highly recommend this product to anyone.  Too bad the disc art is so paper-bag plain.  The disc almost looks junky.  At least the keep case art is well designed.
1590710037|5.0|Everyday I'm faced with resistance to my deep rooted desire to be a writer.  Pressfield explains the resistance and provides a road map for beating it.  The final &quot;book&quot; (there are three) descibes the spiritual aspect to creativity.  I absolutely agree with Pressfield that there are angels, emissaries from God, who are vitally interested in the creative process and will be of great help if we will only listen.  So, I come to the keyboard with as much humility I can muster and let God direct through his angels/muses and amazing things happen.  I've experienced it many times:  Am I writing, or am I taking dictation.  Wow!  I love to write even more than before.  Thank you, Steven Pressfield!<br />PS:  My only negative, I didn't like the chrome cover.

You will be very surprised at how many songs you know!  <br />This album will bring you back to the good ol' days when music really was music.<br />&quot;Don't Mean Nothing&quot; - a great song about, well, nothing.  But it's a great song!  Real catchy tune.<br />&quot;Endless Summer Nights&quot; - makes you feel like you are in an island paradise slow dancing the night away with the black sky and bright stars and the moon as your chaperone.  Palm trees dance with each other along with you and your partner.  Yes, that's what the songs brings to my mind!<br />&quot;Now and Forever&quot; - a wedding song if there ever was one.  How many songs are out there that a man can dedicate to his love?  This is it!<br />&quot;Should've Known Better&quot; - This will get you rockin' and dancin'!  Great arrangement.

For audiophiles, this CD is a wonderful compilation for quiet listening, dinner parties or singing along in the car.
B000068QY7|1.0|I have been a fan for years, and this is by FAR the worst CD yet put out by Oasis. Amateur, uninspired, just thrown together rubbish.

B00004RFFS|3.0|I never thought Tom Cruise would undertake the Impossible Mission (no pun intended) of being cast as a vampire.  The storyline, script, editing and special effects are all superb in this blood-sucking classic, but what made me give it a \\"3\\" rating on a scale of \\"5\\" was Tom Cruise.  I spent the entire time trying to make Cruise \\"fit\\" into a vampire film.  Though he is convincing, I couldn't help but picture him in \\"Top Gun\\", \\"Rain Man\\", \\"Mission Impossible\\", and \\"Cocktail\\" while I was viewing this flick.  When the dust settled...and the last \\"stake\\" had been planted, I came to the realization that if a horror fan watched this film with no past knowledge of Cruise, it would be a classic.  For example, Jack Nicholson was cast in the horror flick \\"Wolf\\" with Michelle Pfeiffer.  He was the most horrific werewolf I had ever seen on the big screen.  Trying to adapt the \\"cool\\" Cruise...the macho womanizer...to a vampire role, was not quite as easy a task.  It works, but true Cruise fans will look beyond his evil spirit and never truly believe that this guy could be a relative of Dracula.  Don't get me wrong, this is one of the best vampire flicks I have ever seen.  However, I would have cast someone like Willem Dafoe (of \\"Spider-man fame) or Matt Dillon (aka his role in \\"Wild Things\\") for a more believable film.  If you are a true vampire flick fan...add this to your library.  If you want to see the best vampire flick of all time, invest in \\"Fright Night\\" (starring Chris Sarandon, Roddy McDowell, William Ragsdale and Amanda Bearse).  You won't be disappointed.  It will scare the ... you.
0684847817|5.0|From the first time i saw this book i was drawn to it. i begged my mom to buy it for me but it was a bit pricey.A few months went by and my birthday came around. As i was unwrapping presents, one of them caught my eye so i opened it and it was this fantastic book. I was overjoyed!At the time, i was twelve. I am now fifteen and have since gotten Faeries(the book done by Froud and Lee)and have not stopped reading either of them. They are, without a doubt, my favorites!!!
B00005NB8K|5.0|The best die young.  That is a cliche', but when you think of Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Mama \\"Cass\\" Elliot and Jim Morrison, there is truth in that wisdom as you look back upon the late 60's and 70's music genre.  This film, a classic by Oliver Stone and what should have been an Academy Award winning performance for Val Kilmer, is a revival of one of the most remarkable rock musicians of all time - Jim Morrison... Morrision was a charismatic wizard of rock...and mesmerized his audiences not only with music...but with his poetic talents and mastery of the English language.  Yes...Morrison defined his life with the statement - \\"I am the Lizard King...I can do anything\\" - and this film captures the essence of that statement.  Val Kilmer was perfectly cast in this film.  He was either kin to Morrison or found a piece of his soul when trying to emulate the influence JM had on the youth of the Sixties.  I'd give this film a rating of \\"6\\" if it were within the rating scale.  Meg Ryan is so convincing, I asked my friends if she ever had a romantic relationship with Val Kilmer outside of this film.  No one knew.  And the soundtrack (of course) is awesome.  If I had led such a tragic life as JM...and had wallowed in the mire (no pun intended) with alcohol and drugs like he...I would have been honored to have such a film pay a tribute to my life.  This is, by far, the best film ever produced on the life and times of the Sixties.
0316666343|5.0|I really loved everything about this book. The story was beautifully written. It was wonderfully touching.
0446605409|2.0|I loved Charm School and The Gold Coast, so when I read the blurbs on the cover of Plum Island that this novel combined the best of both styles I was excited to start reading.  What the heck happened to my Nelson Demille?  It's hard to believe the same man wrote all three books.  I kept waiting for Plum to &quot;kick in&quot; but it never did.  In fact, it turned out to be extemely corny.  I read a review that suggested that it was meant to be a parody.  Who knows? A MAJOR disappointment.  <br />If you've never read Demille before don't start with this one.  You'll might be so underwhelmed with ND that you might miss the EXCELLENT Charm School and Gold Coast.
B000063UR2|4.0|I was glad to hear Scott was putting out a directors cut of one of my more favorite movies.  Yet I have come to find the original American realease is still my favorite.  I like the additional scenes in the UK version, but I'm partial to the Tangerine Dream score.  I like the original score but there is something about the Dream score that is more mistical than the more classical score used in the UK version.<BR>     Still this is a must see for any &quot;fantasy&quot; movie buff.  Tim Curry's over the top, melodramatic performance makes Legend a legend in this type of  film making.  And I don't think I have ever seen a Scott film that I didn't like.  He is a master film maker.<BR>     Check out both versions and decide for yourself.  You'll see the light and not be disapointed.
B000003S0I|4.0|King Crimson never really wrote the perfect album. Even the mercurial &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot; had the worst 7 minutes of music you are ever likely to hear, tacked tastelessly on the end of their most sublime ballad. Equally, each one of the albums in the &quot;first phase&quot;, had at least two King Crimson classics on it.<br />Larks Tongues could be seen as an attempt to dash this myth of imperfections. The opening opus &quot;Larks Tongues in Aspic Part 1&quot;, is a classic prog composistion, alongside Pink Floyd's &quot;Echoes&quot; and Yes' &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;, it throws a clinical fripp metal riff amongst climatic strings. This is before maniac percussionist Jamie Muir opens with an impossible series of bells.<br />following this follows the ironically minimalist ballad &quot;Book of Saturdays&quot;. It's dreamy, wispy nature could be taken as plain boring, yet it has subtle charm and grows on you unlike any other track here. it centres around a clean, loungey guitar twang, and fripp even chucks in a few backwards solo's.<br />next follows exiles - and here is where the album takes it's customary dive. the build up is painfully slow, and even when it gets going (albeit with Wetton singing on the tethers of his vocal range), it dives back into the avant garde build up again! the tune is rather good though, and fripp supplies a fine solo to close. however, the clunky middle 8 is another drawback.<br />Easy Money is, in parts, exceptional. however, the mid section is needlessly drawn out, before Fripp finally gets it together with a bit of urgency in his guitar work before the catchy vocal hook returns. Some of the funk guitar is a little lightweight at the beginning, rather like &quot;Ladies of the Road&quot;, but Wettons bass is as muscular as ever.<br />The Talking Drum - Probably the third best thing on the album (tied with easy money), this instrumental. Great climatic build up with frantic work from cross. the volume levels should not be tampered with as it is intentionally quiet to start with. the larks tongues being &quot;cut&quot; at the end is very, very, very, painful.<br />larks tongues in aspic part 2 - brillaint conclusion to the album. classic prog moment at the end with everyone playing their instrument as fast as possible in a crescendo. some of the time sigs are impossible to most impossible musicians, and a lot of this must have been taken in by Slint.<br />a great, if slightly flawed album.<br />steve

0679777547|4.0|I became aware of this movie after seeing the movie \\"The Ninth Gate\\", which was based on this book. I thought the movie was very good, and I think the book is even better.<br />Perez-Reverte creates a world of mystery that is filled with unique hints of supernatural motives and diabolical villians. One of the most enjoyable aspects of this novel was finding out that everything is not as it seems.<br />Slowly and deliberately, the author takes you on a journey filled with wonderful characters and atmospheric locations. The unraveling of the mystery, as well as the main character Lucas Corso, is presented in a plausible, rational manner. What's so interesting is how the irrational is made to seem rational.<br />There is a great deal of literary history that is central to the characters in the novel. A lot of it revolves around Alexandre Dumas and his \\"Three Musketeers.\\" Bibliophiles will fall in love with several of the characters in \\"The Club Dumas\\" and will also learn a good deal of information on the way books are valued and treasured by other, true bibliophiles.<br />There are moments of suspense that made my imagination race, trying to figure out what was going to happen next. There is a good amount of subtle humor that takes place, as well as some excellent dialogue and psychological and intellectual dueling.<br />To sum this up; memorable characters, intriguing mysteries, surprises, humor, sex, violence, books, cigarettes, and gin all blend together in this exciting, stimulating, intellectual journey into the recesses of a man's madness and ultimate salvation. Well done!
0553573411|5.0|The second instalment of the Farseer Trilogy lives up to it's predecessor so well that I can't decide which is better! Rather, it is best to think of it as an extension of the original, though it is quite possible that this one could also stand alone, as much of what happened in the first is briefly explained.<BR>The language of Robin Hobb's books and the wonderful plot and character development never cease to amaze me. FitzChivalry is a very in-depth character and the workings of his mind are so clearly portrayed. These are some of my favourite books now.<BR>The story finds Fitz on the uphill road to recovery after his poisoning by Prince Regal. He returns to Buckeep where the court is slowly falling apart. Verity is tired, Shrewd is feeling his age more than ever, and after the death of Galen, his successor Serene has a vendetta against Fitz. And all the while the red ships keep coming, keep forging the people and keep destroying the costal Duchies' livelihood. <BR>Fitz throws caution to the wind and develops his Wit, bonding to a young wolf cub that he rescues. <BR>Royal Assassin contains one of the most original plot twists I have seen in a long time, and ends on another cliffhanger.  I definitely had to read the next book in the trilogy after this.
0805209999|4.0|First, if you don't want to know what happens at the end of the novel, don't read the translator's preface before reading the text.  He may be an enthusiastic and exacting translator but not the most sensitive reviewer.<br />As for Kafka's story, I want to offer a somewhat different interpretation that might perhaps attract readers who are not interested in another despairing man against society theme.  I think Kafka is telling us that we are free yet we are obsessed by our accusers and allow them to control us.  The bad news is we choose to not to resist but to grumble and suffer subserviently.  The good news is we don't have to.  The interesting news is what we as a society who reads Kafka will choose to become.  Do we read it and say, yep that's the mire we're stuck in?  Or do we read it and realize that he is arming us with the power of insight, assertion, and choice in facing our lives.<br />Don't miss the last 30 pages or so including the chapter titled, &quot;In the Cathedral&quot;.  The story the priest tells K. and their ensuing discussion is fascinating and still has my mind whirling.  If you know what it all means, tell me.  Is there a support group for this book?<br />I must say that the &quot;Fragments&quot; included after the story lent little to my understanding of the whole.  If you want more, it's there; if you don't, you wouldn't be missing anything by skipping it.<br />But don't skip the rest of it, particularly if, on one level, you just want to see a great writer's insights into the labyrinthine constructs of his own legal profession.
B00005JL3A|1.0|How do films like this get past hollywood executives. when a film that is Based on a video game comes out, I never look forward to it. The people making it always look at it as \\"hey, this is from a video game, games are for kids, and therefore only kids will see it. So lets fill it with techno heavy metal music and pointless action\\". This is why we get films like Tomb Raider, Batman and Robin( recently voted worst movie ever), final fantasy, super mario brothers, street fighter, mortal kombat..., the list goes on of... game, comic, action series films. I am sure that we will never see the end to these films... Directors like Sam Raimi (spider-man), Peter Jackson (Lord of the rings). These are the people we need making these kinds of films, not people who only care about how many t-shirts can they sell in an hour! Resident Evil should have been a gothic, dark, horror film! but instead, it was like zombie matrix!...
B00003CXZ1|1.0|This movie was exploitive [junk].  I'm sure the DVD will continue in the tradition.  DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!  IF YOU BUY THIS DVD YOU WILL ONLY ENCOURAGE HOLLYWOOD TO PUT OUT MORE...LIKE THIS!!!  FIGHT THE POWER!!!
B00006690G|5.0|I didnt like Eminem at first.  I was never a big fan of him at all.  In fact I hate his first 2 CDs.  However, my brother played his latest for me, and I was totally turned around on my view on him.<br />Lemme give you a little history on Eminem and his music (and why I never liked it).  The first album (Slim Shady) seemed \\"little kid-ish\\" to me.  It reminded me of vulgar, South-Park-Like humor with a wry twist which would appeal to pre-teens and 13 yr olds.  I hated \\"My Name Is\\" and the rest of the CD didn't seem appealing.  I passed...<br />Then Marshal Mathers came out...I liked Stan and the other singles, so I borrowed my brothers CD.  I was totally freaking shocked!  One of the most disturbing CDs I've ever heard.  From \\"Kill You\\" to \\"Kim\\" I just hated the whole CD.  Many of the tracks, I heard a angry Eminem describing how much he hates those who dis him and his life in general.  It seemed Mathers had gone psycho to me.  I was disgusted.h<br />From there I decided I disliked Eminem.<br />Finally, my brother let me hear a few songs off of The Eminem Show...I first heard White America (my favorite) and I was taken back by his words.  All of a sudden, he was making sense to me.  I burnt my brothers CD and listened to the whole album track to track. I love this CD now!  I owe Em an apology.  I didn't know he was capable of this stuff.  This CD is very political and doesn't have all of that \\"I'm gonna kill you and this is how\\" stuff I found on Marshall or the \\"Hi kids I cuss and I'm cool\\" I found on Slim Shady.<br />This CD is his best work by far.  I can't put the ... thing down!  I find myself listening to the songs every day.  I'm definitly buying this CD and you should too.  Em deserves the cash for this.<br />Favorite tracks: 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12, 13, 18, 19
B00004Y9PP|3.0|... the result could very well be Vin Diesel. A hunk of a man with a sweet face and the ability to smirk in the camera while acting at the same time. He's the low-life you like in spite of his past or his rude behavior.<br />He is one of a handful of passengers on a space-faring transport vessel.  Passengers range from a group of Muslims en route to \\"New Mecca\\" on another planet, to a bounty hunter and his prisoner, Riddick (Diesel).<br />When a meteor shower damages the ship, the crew is forced to crash-land on a nearby planet, that fortunately for them has an oxygen atmosphere. The crash landing kills a number of crew and passengers and the crafty Riddick takes advantage of the situation and escapes briefly. To aid in his criminal life, Riddick has had his eyes surgically altered so that he can see at night in near pitch-black conditions without the aid of a flashlight. This makes him vulnerable to normal lighting conditions that force him to wear sun glasses most of the time.<br />It soon becomes apparent that while he is a deadly criminal (although you never really find out what it is he's really done... it's all rumors, mostly), the rest of the crew need his abilities and strength to survive.<br />The planet is totally barren. Remnants of a human campsite are there... trailers, water condensers, a small laboratory and no signs of life. A small kid who was a passenger on their ship is heard screaming and vanishes. Blood and sinew are left behind. Another man is pulled into a hole in the ground and when others go in after him, they discover the awful truth.<br />A swarm of aliens, each about the size of 2 gorillas, is living on the planet and they eat blood (lots of it) for breakfast. A few of the aliens' skeletons are spotted and the hundreds of razor-sharp teeth are about as chilling as their size and their numbers.  In addition to a couple of alien skulls, the crash survivors find the skeletal remains of a number of humans and of some very large animals (dinosaur size) that all apparently were wiped out by their alien co-habitants.<br />Fortunately, they are light-sensitive and having a flash-light beam them is enough to raise blisters on their sensitive skin. The planet's relentless 3 suns make daylight a 24-hour-a-day event and the heat very oppressive.<br />They learn that as long as they don't go into any dark caverns, they are safe from these deadly creatures... until one of the crew stumbles upon a planetary model that shows the 3 suns... turning the model shows the revolutions of the planet around the 3 suns and then there is a rude awakening... there is an eclipse on this planet every 22 years and this unlucky crew just happened to crash-land a few days before darkness hits for days. It soon appears that those who died in the crash were the lucky ones.<br />Are there holes in the plot? You bet! I mean... what have these creatures been eating during the past 22 years? Are there some cheesy, over-acted scenes? Yes! But this is a film that keeps you on your toes.<br />The film did fall short in not enabling the  viewer to emotionally bond with any of the characters. An emotional connection to Diesel comes close ... but it never comes to fruition... so in the end, you really don't care if anyone survives... you just want to see some sci-fi special effects.<br />If you only want to see aliens or cool special effects, you'll be more than a little disappointed... the alien is only seen in sparse glimpses. While it's true that the unseen is often more scary than what can be seen, there just is simply not enough to appreciate. The movie, \\"Alien,\\" on the other hand, showed the alien just enough to where you really didn't want to see it ever again. In \\"Pitch Black,\\" you're just hoping to pause the DVD in just the right spot so you can see what the heck it looks like.<br />In spite numerous flaws, the story had some really good sci-fi concepts. The film could have been much better, but such that it is, it's still an entertaining flick.<br />The R rating is for language and lots of bloody violence and death... not one for the kiddos.ning flick.<br />The R rating is for language and lots of bloody violence and death... not one for the kiddos.
B00003CXTG|1.0|I hated this film. Hated it! It was chock full of cheap, insencere sentimentality and unnecissary violence. None of the characters were remotely believable, and you would expect better performances from the actors for the copious amounts of money they received to appear in this piece of fluff. I felt no connection with any of the characters. In fact, this film failed miserably to get any sort of emotional reaction out of me besides boredom and annoyance. The revisionist history and unquestioning idolization of the military all to present in this film were just the last straw for me. It's garbage like this that makes me lose faith in the blockbuster system.
B00005B36H|5.0|I feel real pity for those of you who rated this album poorly.  All I can suggest is to just listen to it more.  This is the most hauntingly beautiful album I have ever heard.  This is even better in that regard than the fragile, an album I thought could never be topped.  If you dont like it at first schedule some time in your day, every day to listen to the entire thing through.  After a few weeks your life will begin to change.  Be patient.
B000002J1S|5.0|This is mainly a reply to the reviewer who asked the question \\"Does anyone under 25 like Genesis?\\". I would have to say the answer is \\"very few\\", but I'm one of them. Other artists of the 70s have huge numbers of young fans, i.e. Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd; however, Genesis has been totally obscured (in the US especially). I have listened to a variety of rock radio for over 10 years and I have NEVER heard ONE Genesis song played! The only Genesis I've heard on the radio is some Collins-era hits on Lite Rock stations. I have been a HUGE rock fan since the early '90s, and I was totally unaware of Genesis's history until last year. This would seem strange to most people, especially considering I own over 14 Pink Floyd albums. <BR>  Better late than never, though, and now that I have heard Genesis I am acquiring their entire discography quickly. The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway is certainly a top-quality double album (as evidenced by the other 100 5-star ratings). Most, if not all, of Genesis's other albums are of comparable quality. Since I have only been a fan since 2001, I am able to stay away from all this Gabriel vs. Collins and prog vs. pop stuff and just enjoy the music. I mean is there anyone else out there whose 2 favorite Genesis songs are 'In Too Deep' and 'Stagnation'(From Trespass)?!!! And to those fans who don't like post-Gabriel/post-Hackett Genesis, please admit that 'Driving the Last Spike' and 'Fading Lights' are TREMENDOUS efforts. Or are you that jaded?!
B000001ELL|4.0|After the flurry of albums in 1978, i.e. the Double Platinum and four solo CDs, KISS released their first collective studio album since Love Gun.  Dynasty did have a new sound, which led to a decline in their popularity.  That's too bad, because Dynasty isn't as bad as its reputation.<br />The album kicks off with their quasi-disco hit, &quot;I Was Made For Lovin' You,&quot; which not only got to #11 on the Billboard Singles Chart, but was recently covered by Paulina Rubio on her English debut album.  The original is way, way better.<br />Ace does a racing cover of the Rolling Stones' &quot;2000 Man,&quot; successfully injecting vintage KISS guitar.  He does the same in the bitter breakup song &quot;Save Your Love.&quot;<br />The grinding &quot;Dirty Livin'&quot; is Peter's only song here and the last studio song until Psycho Circus's &quot;I Finally Found My Way.&quot;  One thing I didn't know was how bad Peter Criss's attitude had sunken.  So they had to bring in an uncredited session drummer?  That's rough.<br />The songs from &quot;Charisma&quot; to &quot;X-Ray Eyes&quot; do indeed have the new sound.  It still rocks, but it's somewhat slowed down.  The sole exception is, yes, Ace's &quot;Hard Times.&quot;<br />The lead vocals distribution was out of the ordinary as well.  Gene only got to sing two songs--&quot;Charisma&quot; and &quot;X-Ray Eyes,&quot; while Ace got to sing a record three.  Well, he would also sing three on Unmasked as well.  I favor his contributions over the others, as they save the album from being a disaster.  Then there's Paul's three and Peter's one--that makes nine, right?<br />Dynasty is the first and best of KISS's four transitional albums.  Not quite a genre album, but the material still rocks even though not as much as Destroyer or Rock And Roll Over.  Even so, this album does not deserve the epithet &quot;stinker.&quot;
B00005V3Z4|5.0|this director's first feature is incredible. i was floored by the plot, it is so unpredictable and daring. he uses a combination of sci-fi, horror, drama and comedy in a suburban environment, kinda like american beauty turned inside out, outside in. <br />the film takes place in 1988 and everything that era was about, supported with an excellent selection of songs. the high school, his friends, the whole environment back then is dead on.  early in the film, the director uses an unbroken, one take shot gliding through the high school, introducing us to all the main characters,like the opening scene from \\"a touch of evil\\", with a 'tears for fears' song playing in the background, masterful. the director also uses a creepy, sinister score for the film's darker and deeper moments, done wonderfully by michael andrews. <br />donnie darko is the main character, a 16 year old high schooler who takes mediciation for being schizo. after a demented bunny saves him from death, donnie begins his journey into figuring out how to stop the world from ending, with burning down a house, flooding his school, getting a girlfriend and understanding time travel.  along the way, we're introduced to unforgettable characters and incidents, with many laughs.<br />this movie covers alot of ground and is hugely ambitious. it's not your typical film but has layers of meaning, depth and warmth like no other film i've seen in a while. people say the ending is confusing, but if you take the time to understand it, it's mindblowing; worth watching more then once and owning.  the dvd has an awesome special features section that is definitely worth checking out and the deleted scenes explain alot. the web site is super cool (google donnie darko) , a virtual reality type game that helps tie together everything.  it's too bad this got a limited theatrical release due to its small budget... ENJOY!
6305428220|4.0|I didn't expect much from \\"The Faculty,\\" despite liking Robert Rodriguez's work. I was happily surprised to see, if not a perfect movie, quite a good one peeking out amongst the forest of such teen horror drek as \\"Dangerous Minds.\\" The plot is fairly basic: The teachers at an Ohio high school have been replaced by aliens (or have they?) as the first part of a plan to take over first town and then the world.<br />Not surprisingly, given Kevin Williamson's screenwriting duties, the script is highly self-conscious, and almost immediately, characters in this alien invasion film begin comparing events to \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\" and Robert Heinlein's \\"The Puppet Masters.\\" (They then make a few leaps in logic that, while perhaps necessary for the plot, seem a little silly and it's disappointing to see that their assumptions are pretty much spot on.)<br />Unfortunately, Williamson's normally good work with teen characters -- although they may be highly stylized, you can't say his \\"Dawson's Creek\\" teens aren't at least interesting -- gets a little too broad here. We have Zeke, the super-genius drug pusher who's stayed back a year in school, a number of rather cypher-like other teens (including the coolest girl in school ... the editor of the school paper? Huh?), although one at least is supposed to be a cypher.<br />While the teen stars of the film somewhat disappoint, given the degree to which they were underwritten, the titular faculty of the high school in the movie is a hoot, with a good number of marquee stars almost unrecognizable as high school teachers. Salma Hayek is anything but glamorous as the school nurse, as is Famke Janssen, who spends most of the film looking like anything but a bombshell. Jon Stewart is a convincingly scruffy high school science teacher and the obligatory \\"cool teacher\\" every school seems to have. And Bebe Neuwirth, perhaps typecast because of her role as Lilith on \\"Cheers,\\" plays it cool as the school's principal. The actors are clearly having fun as the teachers-turned-alien invaders, and it's a pleasure to watch them wind the film to its inevitable conclusion.<br />That conclusion, incidentally, isn't quite so inevitable as it might seem, with a few well-done last minute twists and turns, although the big confrontation with the boss alien falls into the same trap as Stephen King did with \\"It\\" -- was it really necessary after a story full of effective small scares to go with a big boogeyman of a monster? Likewise, the denouement is a little hard to believe, and beneath both Williamson and Rodriguez.<br />But those are minor quibbles. Overall, \\"The Faculty\\" is a fun, and surprisingly well-made space invaders movie, and a treat to watch.<br />A strongly endorsed rental pick for fans of the writer or director of for fans of old science fiction horror films.early having fun as the teachers-turned-alien invaders, and it's a pleasure to watch them wind the film to its inevitable conclusion.<br />That conclusion, incidentally, isn't quite so inevitable as it might seem, with a few well-done last minute twists and turns, although the big confrontation with the boss alien falls into the same trap as Stephen King did with \\"It\\" -- was it really necessary after a story full of effective small scares to go with a big boogeyman of a monster?

B00005JKQZ|4.0|1.  Russell Crowe's performance.  He's turned out to be a remarkably versatile actor.<br />2.  Jennifer Connelly's performance.  I had no idea she had such depth. A breakthrough for her.<br />3.  The music.  Rarely is there such a perfect match between what's onscreen and the sounds propelling it. The music creates a feeling that supports the script perfectly.<br />Forgetting the debate about whether this was truly best picture--of course it wasn't--I can only say, this movie is well worth seeing because it is unlike anything else.  It tells a great story (which may, in fact, be a total distortion), and takes you into a world you don't usually see depicted in such depth or detail.  It is compelling and moving.
B00005A46T|5.0|One of the best cd's I have ever purchased.The first time you listen to this it will not be very good except for a few songs listen to it three more times and you will listen to it every day. My favorite songs are my plague,heretic anthem,and left behind. every song is great actually except for the song Iowa it's kind of boring you have to wait for like ten minutes to kick in for it to be good. Other than that this is perfect.
B0000667RO|2.0|This recent release from Bryan Adams is noticably skimpy on the hits, of yesterday. Although I am a big fan of Adams, I have to say that this compilation seems to be focusing more on Adams' ingenious output from the '90s and, therefore, is missing many of the songs - which brought him fame - from the turbulent '80s. His break out hit from '82, Cuts Like A Knife, isn't here! The tender ballad, Straight From The Heart, is absent, also. This Time, Heaven(how could they omit that), It's Only Love(with Tina Turner), Somebody, Kids Wanna Rock, Heat Of The Night, and Do I Have To Say The Words? should have all been included, as well!  A 2 disc collection, with all of these songs included, would have been more deserving to Bryan Adams fans, worldwide. I would recommend the So Far, So Good album, for a more '80s based hit collection. We might have to wait another 10 years for a more stellar and complete collection, from the great Bryan Adams! Best Of Me is very disappointing, in the meantime.
B00005JKJA|5.0|First off, no more talk about \\"no chapter stops\\".  Are you people so ADD that you can't watch an entire movie straight through?  David Lynch does not use chapter stops.  Period.  So quit whining.  Also, David Lynch will not do any interviews, director dialogue, nothing for his movies.  So stop complaining that there are no extras.  Enjoy the freakin' movie.<br />This movie is unconventional.  Yep, it is.  If you don't like thinking, go back to \\"Rush Hour 2\\".  But this movie will require your attention.  The movie seems very complicated at first, but after a second viewing, the plot does start to fall into place.  Again, this is Lynch, so be patient.<br />It's a shame this didn't get picked up as a series.  I've had about enough of shows like \\"Will and Grace\\" and \\"Frasier\\" being considered good television.<br />Enough of my whining.  Anyone who is a David Lynch fan (and you would probably already know this) should go to davidlynch.com.  You can pick up a DVD of his early films (well worth the money), and Eraserhead is supposed to be released any day now (although it's been on back order for months).<br />Long story short, this is a great movie in the era of fluffy garbage (\\"Pearl Harbor\\", anyone?).  Please just give it a shot, then go read a Kurt Vonnegut novel (I suggest \\"Breakfast of Champions\\").  You'll be a better person in no time...
B00003CXBK|5.0|This anime is truly amazing. I have rented three times from Blockbuster, and plan on buying the DVD as soon as possible. The plot is well developed, the visual aspect of it is amazing! I genuinly recommend this breathtaking movie if you are into anime or not! (and I recommend for all those otakus to bring in the non-believers with this movie! You will have them hooked, I promise!) It is worth the thirty bucks, I swear. You will watch it again and again! I was impressed with the dubbing. Very well done. The voices match the characters, the songs are beautiful. (I, personally, like the ending song in the English version better than the one in the Japanese version. The English voice is somehow more to my liking.) Overall one of the best movies I have ever seen. (Non-anime and anime alike)
B000002572|5.0|This is my absolute favorite CD! The songs are classics, I never get tired of them! Like I said, it awesome!!
B000065U1N|4.0|This was an incredible movie.  However, Black Hawk Down is a very difficult film to watch primarily because you can relate to the guys so well.  My wife actually stopped watching halfway through because it was so tough to watch.  It is not sensationalistic in its portrayal of guys getting shot and/or killed, but it is very realistic.<br />My only complaint with the DVD is there is no director's narrative to go with the movie.  I don't need it to appreciate the film, but I love the insights those commentaries provide.
B00005JL3A|2.0|this movie is fun...no doubt about it!!! great action sequences....decent zombies(not as scary as george a. romero's zombie versions) great \\"licker\\" sequence!! movie didnt have as much suspense or mystery as the video game, which definitely hurt my viewing experience! in the game it was a mystery as to why there was a mansion in the middle of the mountains...and in the game, you didnt find out who exactly the \\"umbrella\\" corporation was until 3/4 the way through the game's storyline..in the movie, its just all laid out in front of you...no real surprise. the red queen addition also hurt the story!! they should have been fighting zombies all the time!!!not some stupid computer!! bottom line: if they had just followed the videogame story and not made their own, this would have been a 5+ star movie. the two stars are for the zombies, the zombie dogs, and the \\"licker\\" sequence!!! the acting lost it a star.
B000066NW0|5.0|This cd is so awesome! Avril is taking the music world by storm. She is a young, confident, and extremely talented. Her music is straight from her heart so teens can easily relate to it. Avril's sk8ter punk look and sound is a refreshing change from the pop princesses like Britney and Christina.  Avril's powerful voice is so addictive. It basically entrances the listener. Avril describes real things that have happened in her life and that most likely have happened in any teen's. In Complicated she refers to people in life who are fake. Mobile is basically the story of Avril's transition to becoming the star she is by having to pack up and move to NY.  Avril's song Anything But Ordinary definitely describes her.  She is who she is and doesn't care if people like it or not. She said in an interview that she will not be like Britney and change her image so that people will like her. Let Go is also an enhanced cd, which makes it even better. This allows you to view the video to Complicated and even a day in the life with Avril.  This was so cool to me. It allowed me, as a fan, to see the real Avril and see that she is truly down to earth teenager. She is truly an inspiration and deserves the respect of the music industry and her fans. She is a role model for her fans as well. So, I highly recommend this cd to any and all teens and hey adults, you might even like it too. Rock on Avril!!!
B00005JKWJ|5.0|Well I'm a huge Blade fan and I wasn't dissapointed when with this movie. I was kind of scared to go see it because it seems sequels always get screwed up but this one was pretty good. The first one is one of my favorite movies of all time and I still like it more then the second but the Blade 2 is still awesome. Great fight scenes, the only thing I wish they changed was the way the vampires died, I think it was much better looking in the first. I wish they had another villian like frost in this one... not very good villians in this one. The new vampires looked cool but their character wasnt developed as well as frost or other vampires in the first. If you liked the first you'll probably like this one but still which they changed some things.
0453005071|5.0|This story may be one of the scariest youl ever read. This story however, happens unfortuantely all to often in today's world. \\"Rage\\", the first of the Bachman Books is about a teenager who walks into school with a gun, shoots two teachers and a student, then proceeds to hold his entire class hostage. <BR>I'm almost possitive that they burned all copies of this book after the columbine incident, because it seems almost impossible to find a copy these days,i looked in every bookstore and library and have had no luck finding one. Its a damn shame that they take contraversial books out of print. Most of the time they are the best ones. This brings us to an even scarier topic, CENSORSHIP =/
B00005JKQZ|2.0|The primary reason I did not like this movie was the extremely cavalier way in which the writter and the director approached the portrayal of schizophrenia.  They made this illness look almost romantic to the point that I have had several friends, and even a family member, tell me that they can really empathize with what Nash went through because now they think they might also be schizophrenic.  <br />My wife is a nurse and has put in quite a bit of time in several mental wards, and currently works in an emergency room where they see many mental illness patients, so she can tell you, from personal experience, that schizophrenia is one of the most awful, debilitating mental illnesses there is.  Unfortunately, the writer and director decided to put forward a completely incorrect dipiction of this disease for the sake of making the main character more likeable and able to form an emotional connection with the audience.<br />My other problem with this film was it's billing as a &quot;true story.&quot;  It really bothers me when a movie is claimed to be a true story, or even based on a true story, when a  more proper description of the film would, at best, be &quot;inspired by a true story.&quot;  I really wish the film makers had billed &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; as inspired by a true story, and then changed all the names of the characters, because this movie really plays fast and loose with the actual life of Nash.
0553213105|5.0|I thought this book was magnificent. It gave me wonderful insight into old England and early authors. But what makes me give this book 5 stars is the fact that it was truly enjoyable. Pride and Predjudice can easily be called a vintage classic but also a modern classic. The book is easy to relate to on certain issues, let alone very amusing some times. READ THIS BOOK! YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY!
B00005JKCF|5.0|Spider-Man is a great movie in EVERY way- direction, acting, writing, and special effects. The story is entertaining and includes several twists and plot devices. I really didn't think that this movie would be good, but it surpassed my expectations by so much. Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst were suprisingly and pleasently perfect as Peter Parker/Spider-Man and Mary Jane Watson. Willem Defoe was creepy and believable as the Green Goblin, and James Franco was great as his son. This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole running time. I can't wait until 2004 for the sequel!
B0000029GA|5.0|Nas raised the bar so high on Illmatic that he himself couldn't jump over it with his later albums. This captured everything right about hip hop;far from what its detractors said about its glorifying of violence and drugs; the story of a young man and his quest for something better in life than what was handed to him. If you love good music, get this album.
B00005QG9J|5.0|The newest arrival from Incubus is amazing! It is a stark cry from their S.C.I.E.N.C.E album and a little more grown up than the late bloomer Make Yourself. This album has everything, the hard punk songs like \\"Under My Umbrella\\" and \\"Nice To Know You\\", the sappy mood songs like \\"Mexico\\" & \\"Echo\\" and then there are the songs that started out as experiments but turned into something radical, like \\"Are You In?\\" and the lengthy \\"Aqueous Transmission\\". There is a definitive maturity in not only the music, but also the lyrics and the entire vibe of the CD. Brandon Boyd's stellar vocals are easily heard while the rest of the band jams in the background. Overall the whole album flows nicely, I personally can listen to it over and over again. This CD is a must have for anyone who is into the alternative rock of the late 90s and early millenium. Morning View allows for a break from the sad and bitter rock of Linkin Park or Staind (both great bands, but come on, lighten up!)Incubus' newst release is a groovy new way to cruse down the highway jamming to your favortie bad. ROCK ON INCUBUS!<BR>1) Nice To Know You- edgy but not angry<BR>2) Circles- great lyrics & still a little hard<BR>3) Wish You Were Here- instand single! awesome song! <BR>4) Just A Phase- you think it is a sleeper, but is has a <BR>   suprise waiting for you!<BR>5) 11am- another seeming sleeper, but it gets better <BR>6) Blood On The Ground- the agriest you will ever hear Brandon   <BR>   get<BR>7) Mexico- smooth melodious song about the character of our<BR>   society today<BR>8) Warning- newest single with a great message<BR>9) Echo- another moody song, but a great shot at Brandon's<BR>   lyrics, very personal<BR>10)Have you Ever- picks up the pace after all of the deep songs<BR>11)Are You In- an experiment that totally paid off! KUDOS<BR>12)Under My Umbrella- the final hard song of the album<BR>13)Aqeuous Transmission- you have to hear it to believe it, just<BR>   think \\"meditation\\"
038533558X|3.0|&quot;Gone for Good&quot; was the first Coben book that I had read.  I really enjoyed it, finding it a quick and well-plotted book.  It was entertaining and suspenseful, and I would have been prepared to give it a higher rating than I have, if I had not bought and read Coben's earlier novel, &quot;Tell No One,&quot; immediately after.<br />It turns out that &quot;Gone for Good&quot; is not as fresh and original as I had believed.  Rather it is a variation on the very similar plot of the earlier novel.  In each case the narrator is a somewhat naive character who suddenly has reason to believe that a loved one who was long believed dead may still be alive.  There are plenty of plot twists before a surprise ending that is quite unbelieveable. <br />Coben's writing style becomes annoying if one pays attention to it.  <br />If you want a fast-paced, light mystery novel, go for &quot;Gone&quot;.  But if you want a really superior book, find something else.
B00005OAIE|4.0|Singer-songwriter John Mayer has proved to be awesome. After his pop single, &quot;No Such Thing&quot; many people probably thought he was going to be a one hit top 40 wonder. But that is definately not the case. The &quot;No Such Thing&quot; single that was released is not the original, which is so much better. Songs like &quot;Your Body Is A Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Neon&quot; would have to be my 2 favorite songs on the album. Anyone who likes DMB (who I am not personally a fan of) would like John Mayor.
B00000JGHM|1.0|Al Pacino,Robert DeNiro,John Voight...You'd think with actors as great as these (along with such talents as Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore) this movie would be put in the hands of a brilliant director.Martin Scorsese?Nope.Sidney Lumet?Wrong.John Frankenheimer(R.I.P)?Think again.Sadly,this movie was directed by the guy who did Miami Vice.This movie is built more like a TV crime drama-with many plots going on at once-than a great crime film.And then I see Henry Rollins on the phone with DeNiro.Okay,I can take that.But Tone Loc sharing screen time with Al Pacino???Who did the casting for this film?Carson Daly??Trust me,instead of this incredibly over-rated waste of celluloid,check out the very under-rated &quot;Carlito's Way&quot;.
B00003CXI0|5.0|this movie a great action of the book.  some of the actors and actresses could have been better picked but otherwise it was done great
B00005QIPH|5.0|This is the best new band I've heard since Weezer.  That's right, it's been that long.  Buy this cd, every track is great, nothing is disappointing, and they live up to all the hype.  What more could you want?
0316666343|2.0|I had heard quite a bit of hype for this novel before its release, and so I pre-ordered it. I had even heard one reviewer make a comparison to To Kill a Mockingbird. <BR> I was very disappointed. Writing is such a difficult task and I'm sure a labor of love for the author, so I don't want to say this book is poor, but it is most satifyingly read by adolescent girls (12-17). Although the novel is not \\"themed\\" --I bet they'll be sorry when I'm dead--in fact, maybe more accurately--I'll be sorry when I'm dead, the novel does not rise above some awfully trite teenage angst notions. <BR> Although I do not often read crime stories, the elements of the novel dealing with the killer, Mr. Harvey, were often fascinating: his compulsions, his brutality, his thwarted efforts to control his psychotic urges. <BR> So for the right audience, this novel may be satisfying. But it lacks the universal truths of such great novels as TKAM. If you want a superior read in the voice of a child/adolescent, try The Miracle Life of Edgar Mint by Udall--a much more rewarding and literary work.
B00005QIPH|4.0|\\"Is This It?' is not an album that is going to change the music<BR>world or provide the antidote to whatever is killing rock music.<BR>It is simply a debut album from five guys who enjoy playing<BR>music.  The band and the album have both been grossly<BR>over-hyped by the rock media in search of the \\"next big thing\\"<BR>in music.  But this is not the band's fault so before listening<BR>to this album one must clear his head of any and all prejudices<BR>he may have for or against this band and album in order to<BR>properly enjoy or hate it.  First off the album may come off<BR>as being repetitive, and boring after the first couple of listenings.<BR>The songs do in fact swim so well together that they threaten<BR> to drown one another into a sea of derivativeness.  However,<BR>further spins of this disc reveals an album whose songs are not drowning<BR>but swimming together in perfect synchronicity.  The entire<BR>album of course has a low-fi feel to it that makes the music<BR>sound deceptively tired, and effortless.  A deeper look into<BR>these songs, however, reveals that the music is far from tired<BR>or effortless and is in fact refreshingly subtle.  The dingy atmosphere<BR>of this album effectively enhances the urgency of the vocals<BR>in tracks such as \\"Barely Legal\\", \\"Someday\\",Alone,Together,<BR>and Hard to Explain.  The nasal-toned delivery of lead singer<BR>Julian Casablancas is the most refreshing voice to come<BR>out of rock music in almost a decade.  Sure The Strokes <BR>borrow heavily from The Velvet Underground, however, there<BR>is a youthful vibrance to this album that gives it its own sound.<BR>Sure this is not the most technically proficient album of all time,<BR>but most great rock music isn't.  The key to this album is to<BR>take it for what it is, a delightfully retro-album, with a modern<BR>twist.  The fact that this is the Strokes DEBUT album speaks<BR>volumes about the potential they possess as musicians.<BR>I personally can not wait until their follow-up album because<BR>I believe that one COULD posibly live up to the hype.<br />To you people blasting The Strokes all I have to say to YOU <BR>is this, PUT DOWN ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE!!!!  Everyone<BR>here who berates this album keeps repeating that its overrated.<BR>By whose standards, Spin Magazine?  Look, buy the album<BR>not to measure it against the unbelievably absurd hype of<BR>the aforementioned magazines, but to enjoy the music of<BR>one of rock's most promising young bands.
B00003CXI0|5.0|this movie a great action of the book.  some of the actors and actresses could have been better picked but otherwise it was done great
B000065U1N|5.0|One of the best way movies ever.  Great depiction of the situation our troops went through in Somalia.  The acting is fantastic and real.  You want to see it over and over again.
B0000666DW|5.0|Leave it up to Relapse records to continue their streak of finding astounding bands with talent and songwriting chops by signing Atlanta's Mastodon.  Made up of former Today Is the Day/Lethargy members, Mastodon takes the best elements of those groups but adds more depth and emotion to the songs.  Add the great production by Matt Bayles and you got what's shaping up to be a contender for Best metal album of the year.  <br />Opening with a fitting title &quot;Crusher Destroyer&quot;, this song punches the listener in the face right away with fleeting blasts of fury highlighted by Brann Dailor's kinetic drumwork and Bill Kellhior's mix of metal and rock breaks.  &quot;March of the Fire Ants&quot; capsizes this one-two punch, and I gotta say, this has got to be one of the best-written metal songs in the past five years; it builds with crushing intensity, then into the crescendo guitar-driven bridge before peeling out one juggernaut ending which can be described as the sonic equivalent of falling off of a thousand-foot cliff while getting eaten by animals at the same time.  &quot;Ole Nessie&quot; is another building song, capsizing at the end, and Mastodon has this practice down pat.<br />The overall guitar tone is one of the best and edgiest I've ever heard on a metal album, with no muddiness or over-trebeled mix.  All of the players are masters at their instruments, especially the rhythm section, currently one of the best in all of music.  Great album, HIGHLY recommended.
B000006OS2|4.0|Perhaps some people give this a low rating because it is not a typical &quot;Wayne western&quot;. It is a warm and funny film with Wayne and O'Hare showing their chemistry.
B0000639FE|5.0|This film is on my top ten list of best movies ever, because you basically have so much fun watching it. And it has comedy, drama, romance, sports, great characters and a great script. And Cuba Gooding Jr. rocks here.
B000063JDE|2.0|I won't say anything more on the movie. it's a &quot;love it or hate it&quot; kind of movie. But I have to point out the very poor transfer. It's full of digital artifacts and my dvd player confirms this by showing a transfer rate that is an average of 4-4.5 and drops very often under 2.5. this is really poor and unacceptable from a &quot;Special edition&quot; version. I guess they had to use such a high compression to fit all the extra material. but I'd rather watch a good quality dvd than some dull extras.
B000068QY7|3.0|In a way, &quot;Heathen Chemistry&quot;, Oasis' 5th studio album (not counting the superb &quot;The Masterplan&quot; compilation of B sides), is undone by the great single &quot;The Hindu Times&quot;, released 3 months ago, and creating great expectations. I ended my review of the single by writing that this album would confirm if Oasis is &quot;really, truly back in the saddle&quot;. We have the answer now, and regretfully it is a clear &quot;no&quot;.<br />&quot;Heathen Chemistry&quot; is book-ended with high-energy tracks &quot;Hindu Times&quot; (to start) and &quot;Better Man&quot; (to end). The 9 tracks in between are a very mixed bag, with simply too much mediocrity, certainly compared to the &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot; and &quot;Morning Glory&quot; albums. Surprisingly, Liam contributes 3 good tracks, the sweet &quot;Songbird&quot;, the epic &quot;Born on a Different Cloud&quot; and the earlier-mentioned &quot;Better Man&quot;. Gem Archer and Andy Bell each contribute one song, both just filler.<br />So what is the problem with Noel? He contributes a mere 6 songs, none of which are truly classic, the exception being &quot;Hindu Times&quot;. Could it be that his muse simply has left him? In the years 1994-1996, great songs came out of Noel like water out of a faucet. Can somebody turn his inspiration on again?<br />This is not a bad album, but it's certainly not a great album, not better than &quot;Standing on the Shoulder&quot;. Anyone new to Oasis should not buy this album, but instead stick with &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot; and &quot;Morning Glory&quot;. For the dedicated Oasis fan, this is a necessary but disappointing addition to the catalogue.<br />PS there is a &quot;hidden&quot; track, 30 min. after &quot;Better Man&quot;, a 4 min. lazy instrumental that begs the question... why?
B00003CXTG|3.0|The action part of the film is fine, the love triangle a little too much, and there are some historical inaccuracies. The best, and most factual, account is still Tora Tora Tora.
0380820846|5.0|While it is not my favorite of the Bridgerton series, this is a wonderfully enchanting romance.  I especially love the description of Colin and Penelope's first kiss - amazing writing, Ms. Quinn!  The book's dialogue is fast, witty and fun.  I read this book in less than 24 hours and highly recommend it to all romance fans!
B00003CXAW|5.0|King Kong is highly regarded by many to be the greatest classic horror/sci-fi film of all time, it certainly had a wider audience than most sci-fi or classic horror. The story of an ape the size of a small building who just wanted the tender love of a city woman used as bait by the tribes people of the island, Kong is then sedated and taken to NY, New York City, The Big Apple, well you get the point. Kong is then displayed to many in a theatre and then breaks loose and starts running wild and dangerously around the city of NY. One of the most memorable scenes in this film and in movie history would be when Kong climbed the Empire State Building and is in a battle for his life with US airfighters. This movie has a tragic end and in it has made history and will never be forgotten, this is without a doubt one of the best ever! An experience you shall never forget till the day you die.
B00005JKED|5.0|Denzel acts his a** off in this film.  Against type and dead on target.  I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen when I saw this in the theatre and bought it as soon as it hit the store shelves.  Undeniably one of the BEST performances ever!  He scared me in this role, that's how convincing he was.  Not a bad script and great support by all around.
0425179877|5.0|No one who saw &quot;Apollo 13&quot; can forget the heroic image of Ed Harris, as the man in the white vest, who held the team of Apollo controllers together and made the safe return of the three astronauts happen, against all odds. Now read the true account, written by the real hero, whose story is even more heroic than you dreamed.<br />I myself got in on the ground floor, joining NASA in 1959 to help send men to the Moon.  It was my life's work for the next 10-12 years.  But I had no idea what Chris Kraft and Gene Kranz were doing, and only the vaguest notion of the flight control center they helped to create.  What they did was nothing less than to create a whole new engineering discipline: that of the space flight controller.  It was a monumental achievement, one that changed history.  It also took a level of dedication to excellence and to purpose that few humans in the history of mankind have ever experienced.<br />Everyone needs to read this book, if for no other reason than to understand the things mankind is capable of, when we set our minds to it.
B000068QY7|4.0|OK, OK, so it isn't 1996 anymore.  That being said, the new Oasis LP &quot;Heathen Chemistry&quot; is both a return to form and a reflection of the &quot;new&quot; Oasis.  The last two records, while sporting unbelievable highs suffered from overproduction, a lack of focus and more &quot;filler&quot; than &quot;killer&quot;.  With all of the songwriting previously falling to Noel Gallagher, and the band almost imploding during the making of &quot;Standing on the Shoulder of Giants&quot;, it is a actually a relief that the band exists today. With the addition of Gem Archer and Andy Bell, Oasis is a more cohesive unit both creatively and musically.  This album has a more consistent feel to it. The songs have all of the qualities of classic Oasis, optimism, roaring guitar layered sound and great hooks. The Hindu Times being the most instantly recognizable of the &quot;old&quot; sound.  Stop Crying Your Heart Out will most certainly be their biggest single since Wonderwall. Other highlights include Gem Archers Hung in a bad place, which they played live during their ten year anniversary shows in the UK in October, and She is love, an acoustic number sung by Noel.  Liam's 3 tunes are much better than the one song he contributed to the last album and actually sound like John Lennon solo material, the best of which is Born on a Different Cloud.  Casual fans will certainly enjoy this one more than the last two.  The songs are very strong and the production is more straight forward and consistent throughout. For hard core fans (are there any other where Oasis is concerned?)the fact that Noel sings three of the songs may leave them wanting a little more Liam.  One more Liam-sung 3 minute rocker and this one would be a five star effort.  For now, Oasis is back and sounding as good as they have in six years.
B00004TJJZ|4.0|Being very wary of TV stars turned movie makers-I was not incredibly optimistic. And I was 100% wrong! Will Smith mkaes the transition from prime time to film look effortless. His tv roots only helped his incredible comedic timing and obvious energy in the movie. And what a treat to see Harvard-grad Tommy Lee Jones taking a fun turn! His stoic,tounge in cheek performance stole the film!<BR>Where the two leads were great-the supporting cast kept right up with them. Most noteable were Rip Torn (Nadine) and Vincent D'Onfrio(Ed Wood,The Player) as, repectivly, Zed and \\"The Bug\\". Rip Torn, a veteran actor of stage and film, brings such fun into the movie as Zed, the head of MIB. He is obviously enjoying the chance to go nuts with his character. And D'Onfrio, who seems to morph for every role he does, is totally off the wall as a bug packed too tighly into an \\"E'gar\\" suit. His physical comedy in MIB shows us yet another side of him.<BR>Probably the best highlights, as a New Yorker myself, were the one-liners.Using the world fair as a cover up for alien landings was brilliant-and Frank the Pug sitting next to a \\"statue\\" of Riff Raff from \\"Rocky Horror Picture Show\\" was classic. All in all-a movie lovers' movie!!
B00005YU1O|3.0|I usually do not like rotoscoping, the animating technique of (at lest for foreground action) drawing over real film footage of a person and then, after the animation is complete, removing the live-action footage so that the animation is all that is shown.  Rotoscoping has been used in Ralph Bakshi films such as Heavy Metal and in Delta Airlines' preflight video showing people buckling their seat belts or grabbing an oxygen mask.  Rotoscoping sometimes produced a strange effect, with outlines squiggling around.  This is because every frame of the film was traced independently, often with loose or flowing lines, so the lines did not line up from frame to frame.  Even when the tracing was more exact and caused less line-wiggling, rotoscoping usually has had nothing to offer over live-action film or animation.  The resultant images in rotoscoping did not move as smoothly as in live-action film, but they were too constrained by the live action images they were based upon to have the exuberant, cartoonish movement and expressions we would expect of characters in an animated feature.  The outcome often was a clumsy hybrid of animation and live-action filmmaking.<br />Waking Life gets around these problems.  The chief animator developed a computer program to make lines flow more smoothly from frame to frame, so that the action can be more photorealistic when desired.  In other scenes, the animators use the initial live-action images as only a loose basis for their own animation, so that they can take advantage of the creative possibilities of animation.  Also, the super-saturated colors of the film are quite pleasing.<br />Despite the cutting-edge, playful animation, the film's spirit is surprisingly old-fashioned.  The movie is painfully earnest, even in scenes with awful, pretentious dialog.  Some scenes are like sitting next to a bunch of stoned Deadheads trying to explain the meaning of the universe.  Sometimes you wish that somebody in the movie would cast an ironicalglance at the movie and see the humor in scenes such as when the protagonist walks by a stranger who says something to the effect of, \\"As you go deeper into puzzle passive acceptance is no longer an option.\\"  How did the actor utter that line without breaking out laughing?  Indeed, Waking Life is always so serious and earnest in its philosophical musings that watching it can be like being stuck in a feminist consciousness-raising session or in a high school existentialist club.  The only time humor deliberately creeps into the film is when the protagonist catches a ride in a car that looks like a speed boat and gets a comical lecture about life from the, er, captain of the boat.<br />That is not to say that there are not some fascinating ideas in the movie, but the gems are mixed in with the dirt.  How many of the ideas are new to you will depend in part upon whether you have taken, say, Philosophy 101, but even this seasoned philosopher came across some interesting ideas new to me, some ideas being big-P Philosophical and others just being interesting observations about the human condition.<br />The structure of the movie is like a sequence of animated lectures.  There is a lot of talking and very little plot.  This hardly seems like the best use of the cinema's possibilities.  If you want a lecture or essay, take a class or read a book.  When serious themes are explored in a movie, you would expect the filmmaker to bring the themes come alive through an engaging story.  For instance, the story in the Matrix cleverly illustrates  Descartes' worry that an evil genius could be altering all of his perceptions.  Waking Life offers didactic philosophy lectures rather than an organic union of plot and ideas.  The only exception to this generalization is that the theme of dreaming is nicely echoed by the trippy visuals.<br />Waking Life is too overtly philosophical to be most people's cup of tea, and some people will dismiss it as pretentious nonsense, but others will find this cosmic-wow of a movie to be just the right way to be introduced to philosophy.
0380977788|5.0|When reading \\"Coraline\\" one has the almost overwhelming urge to read phrases and paragraphs and entire chapters to anyone within range. The first impression I got when I read it was that the author desperately wanted to come to each and every person's house and read the book, and that the print version was only a temporary measure.<br />Well, okay, that was the second impression. The first impression was that this was a seriously creepy story. Not terrifying in the way that so many authors try to startle you or shock you, but ominously creepy in such a way that you have to keep reading or the story will never end and you'll go through the rest of your life with this crawly feeling all over you.<br />Coraline is a young girl, small for her age, whose family moves into a new house. The house used to be larger before it was subdivided, and so there is an old door opening onto a brick wall. Coraline is fascinated by this intriquing exception to an otherwise boring existence; this, along with some odd neighbors, are all that liven up her summer days. Further investigation leads to a mysterious other side, complete with other side parents determined to keep Coraline with them, even if it means stealing her real parents away. This may be a children's book, but only in that it speaks with a child's sensibilities and focus. At no point does \\"Coraline\\" speak down to the audience, and that's one of the marks of a children's book that will last.<br />The other is excellent writing, and he's got that covered too.

0345448898|4.0|These three books are wonderful.  Now that they come in one book you'll be able to read the whole Magical series.  This book is adventure,humore,action and is heart breaking.

You will be dissapointed that there are only three books in this series, but that makes your imagination explode with ideas!  This book is wroth reading over and over again.
0765342294|5.0|Ender Wiggin is a very unusual boy -- he's a brilliant tactician, a genius, and a despised \\"third\\" in a future that only allows two children. He's also six years old.<br /><br />And despite the fact that Orson Scott Card's sci-fi classic is about a little boy learning how to be a warrior, \\"Ender's Game\\" is a pretty gripping and sometimes grim adventure story. The descriptions of children being taught out how to be cold-blooded warriors is pretty creepy, but the well-developed future world that Card comes up with is pretty awesome.<br /><br />After a fight with a gang of bullies, Ender Wiggin is approached by an army officer who wants him to join the elite Battleschool, where kid geniuses become soldiers -- basically because aliens are about to attack Earth AGAIN and may end up wiping out the human race. His brother Peter is too wild and cruel, and his beloved sister Valentine is too mild-mannered.<br /><br />Ender accepts, and quickly finds himself in a dog-eat-dog space school where he soon becomes loathed for the special treatment the teachers occasionally give him -- when they aren't observing his every move. And it soon becomes obvious that Ender has a natural ability that exceeds that of most of the Battleschool recruits: he instinctively knows how to outmaneuver his opponents and protect himself in a fight, even if he annoys some of the \\"army\\" commanders who don't like being outshone.<br /><br />Back on Earth, his brother and sister try to alter the increasingly unstable politics of Earth by subtle manipulation of the public, a situation that may bring the ruthless Peter into greater power. And as Ender reaches the end of his training, he faces both the buggers and the knowledge of what he is capable of.<br /><br />\\"Ender's Game\\" is kind of an unusual space opera, because the actual war between humans and buggers is not front-and-center until the last act of the story. Up until then, it's about following Ender and his equally unusual siblings as they develop prematurely into adulthood -- these are genius kids who can reshape entire worlds, but you're not really sure that they SHOULD.<br /><br />Card writes in a detailed but brisk style, with pretty realistic dialogue and some ugly dark spots (the description of Peter flaying a squirrel... for no reason). Ender's time at Battle School and Command School feel rather slow at times, only for things to blossom in the final laps of the novel -- Card suddenly turns all our feelings and expectations on their heads. The tragedy of children turned into soldiers becomes even more tragic as we discover what the war is actually all about.<br /><br />As you'd expect from Fascist Hogwarts In Space, there are a lot of kids at Battle School who are developed to certain degrees. But the center of the story is Ender himself -- and despite being a tactical genius with loads of natural ability, Ender never seems like a Wesley Crusher. Like a boy destined to be a Spartan warrior, his inborn skills are what will keep him from ever finding peace. His childhood is sacrificed for war.<br /><br />The other part of the story rests on Peter and Valentine -- Valentine is too nice, while Peter is gradually revealed to be a ruthless genius who works anything and anyone for his goals, which may or may not be self-serving. It's oddly fun to see the growing influence of \\"Demosthenes\\" and \\"Locke\\" on the cruel government.<br /><br />\\"Ender's Game\\" is an intelligent, gripping space opera with an undercurrent of intense tragedy -- it's kind of slow at times, but the strong writing and intriguing main trio keep it afloat.rematurely into adulthood -- these are genius kids who can reshape entire worlds, but you're not really sure that they SHOULD.<br /><br />Card writes in a detailed but brisk style, with pretty realistic dialogue and some ugly dark spots (the description of Peter flaying a squirrel... for no reason).

B00005JL3A|5.0|Its about time they made another zombie movie.this movie is for the fans of the game and horror fans. some people say it should have been like the game,if it was then the res fans would know what happens in the movie, a big dajavu,that would suck majorly, the reason they made the movie different is so it would grab u like the first time u play the game. if u played an memorized all the games {like i did} then it would not be as good because u know what happens, but the movie being different left u open to a whole new excitement, and for those who think that sci fi is not horror your very wrong, resident evil was sci fi from the beginning.buy this movie for one heck of a ride im the resident evil master so all I say is the truth, trust me
B00005QDW1|5.0|Some of No Doubts best work to date.  Not so punk, a wider mix of styles.  Guaranteed to have you moving.
B0000069NM|4.0|As others have already pointed out, Scofield, Medeski, Martin &amp; Wood are a killer band together. I like that Sco kinda lays low and really lets his band shine, which they do. I could have done with more of Medeski's organ freakouts, but I guess this isn't that kind of album. Admittedly, some of the tunes seem rather unimaginative, but the sound is great and the groove does not fail. I can say with confidence that I will definitely be checking out some more MMW because of this record.
6304288433|5.0|Personally I think that this movie is one of the best sequals. Not only does it follow on from exactly where the origional finnished but it has twice the blood and gore and a really good story line. It is a must see.
B0000640SA|1.0|The film is great, don't get me wrong. It is a five-star film. Just do NOT buy this special edition without being warned. The &quot;special&quot; part of this is that the director made it almost impossible to actually watch the movie. All of the great extra features on the disc 2 are not available unless you figure out some sort of puzzle and answer random questions the way that the director thinks they should be answered. <br />There are cheat sheets for navigating the menus available on the web, but you really shouldn't have to do a Google search in order to watch something that you paid for!
B00005YW4H|5.0|What else is there to say.  Her voice is beautiful.  Great music for a lazy day.
B00003CY0V|2.0|After hearing all the bad hype about this movie, I saw the DVD just to satisfy my curiousity.<br />It was watchable. Some good action scenes but the acting wasn't much to write home about. A good enough movie to watch on a slow night.<br />There's a great piece of dialogue by John Travolta in the very beginning about why Hollywood movies suck, then the movie takes it a step further and ends up proving its own point.<br />It's nowhere near as bad as Wing Commander, though.
B00005OAIE|2.0|I saw John Mayer's \\"Room For Squares\\" packaged with an extra disc a long while ago, maybe a few months before he started getting radio airplay around here. I bought it because it was [cheap] for both cds. I popped the disc into my cd player as soon as I got to my car, and you know, intially, I thought it was actually pretty good...EXCEPT for his voice. A school year has passed, and the cd has not gotten any better through repeated listenings and a sincere desire to want to like the album. I will admit, his cd does a good job at showcasing his formidable musical abilities, but it's all ruined by his passion-less singing and his drab lyrics.<br />The lyrics could defintely use some work. Sure, they're easy to relate to, but that doesn't make them any better than some junior high girl and her diary of unrequited loves and forlorn frustrations. The lyrics for \\"No Such Thing\\" were particularly irksome. Sure, he's got to write the obligatory I'm-gonna-do-what-I'm-gonna-do-look-at-me-now kind of anthem; everyone does. But really, it was laden with cliches and recycled material, and just didn't work well.<br />Some of the songs were great until he started singing. Examples of these include City Life, Neon, Why Georgia, and 3X5. It sounds like he's straining a lot of the time, like he can't quite reach the notes, and often sounds like he's a little out of breath. <br />Even his pockets of musical bright can't redeem what paltriness the whole of his album is. It lacks true depth because his lyrics and his voice don't carry it further than mediocre hooks, and it's a shame. Maybe he could meet success if he had a little fun with his music, stuck himself in his music, and didn't make it sound like a chore...churning out the melodies for the ever-hungry masses.<br />So what has become of my copy of \\"Room For Squares?\\" After letting it marinate in it's state of non-use for about 4 or 5 months, I gave it to my friend. She liked it, I didn't. I should have sold it back to a cd storebecause maybe then, I could have gotten at least a couple bucks for it.
B0000640VN|3.0|Again Meg Ryan returns to the silver screen in another implausible and sappy romantic comedy as another Kate (remember French Kiss?) to again act cute and have her character's ideas about love and relationships proven very wrong by the irresistible leading man. This woman has actually built a career on being cute! It's almost irritating how cute she is - almost. On the other hand, Hugh Jackman's Leopold is the dashing and completely refreshing saving grace of the picture. And the plot, though highly implausible, works on the romantic fantasy level and serves as the film version of the everyday woman's mental escape. Frankly, were it not for Hugh Jackman I would not have gone to see this film - or rented the DVD for the behind the scenes look at the film. Though it is a seeming trite and recycled sort of story -  with the same characters, it is a good movie because it does have a certain amount of honesty and plenty of heart. It's good - very good, but not great.
B00005UEAR|3.0|I will skip the formality of this review, and move right on to the positive and negatives regarding Six Degrees of Inner Turbulance by Dream Theatre.<br />Reasons for buying this album (AKA positives):<BR>1. Absolutely wonderful musicianship, especially in guitar, percussion/drums, keyboard, and vocal arrangement.  It's Dream Theatre!  Nuff said.  Myung- don't be afraid to shine on the bass buddy.  Rudess-  The piano sections are especially attractive to the music.  They add a certain maturity and depth to the music.<br />2. Disk two.  The 42 minute title track:  \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulance.\\"  If there is any reason why I would not throw this album in the used cd bin, it is because of this second disk.  It is a wonderfully written piece with a drama and struggle built around the music.  It does more than just capture excellent musicianship, but also goes about evoking emotion, and seems to move forward in a story-like quality.  It is why this album is worth getting.  It is what lacks on the first cd.  Organized structural composition.  Kind of like a finely written essay.  Dream Theatre should stay with this format, because it is what people will keep buying their albums for.  It is what will build them a legacy, and why kids will buy \\"Six Degrees\\" and albums like it in 20 years.  On a side note...I recommend plugging this 42 song into your disk player and taking it out for a steady athletic workout sometime.  It fits perfectly.<br />Reasons why this album is not 5 stars (negative points):<BR>1.  James LaBrie's voice.  I love the vocal arrangements on his songs, but despise his voice.  The Genre of Dream Theatre is heavy progressive, unfortunately- LaBrie's voice doesn't sound that heavy.  It doesn't have that cutting hard sound that you would find in James Hetfield or Maynard o Keenan.  Don't get me wrong; Keenan and Hetfield's chords are exceptional to a point that they sell millions alone on the sound of their voice.  But that is also because they sound as heavy as the instruments playing along with them.  LaBrie does not.  I do however hear some hope for Dream Theatre.  James, keep your tone at conversational level, and deep.  Stay away from the Queensrythe/Zepplin vocal pitch.  It works for Jon Anderson or Geddy Lee, but not you.<br />2.  Lyrics-  This takes special consideration of the second disk in particular.  Now do not get me wrong, the song is wonderful, and the vocal arrangements are perfect.  But the subject matter does not quite match the inflection of the music.  The lyrics are about depression, but the music is not quite depressing enough to tug at my heart strings.  It sets this dark story of a girl living with chronic depression.  But the music is too much of a fantastic journey and not enough brooding bitterness. If you want bitterness, include dark scary violins, cold lonely finger dancing on the piano, have Myung take a lead role on his bass guitar, and have Petrucci follow behind Myung with a distorted steel guitar.<br />3.  Rudess: on your keyboard- Piano Setting=good and beautiful.  Moog Synth setting= cheesy and lame.  Replace it with something more powerful.<br />Regardless of the problems- buy the album.  It is worth the money if you are an aspiring musician hoping to get better, or someone frustrated with mainstream rock's inability these days to crank out intellegent music with skillfull ability.  Six Degrees on Inner Turbulance has both of these qualities, and the second disk in particular will make it worthwhile to own.
B00005RYKV|3.0|Sony has cut this version, removing some of the scenes spoken in japanese as well as digitally editing out some of the gore and changing the colour palette.<BR>the UK R2 version is apparently the best, but for US buyers the fact that it is in PAL format is a major problem, unless you happen to have a television that can playback in PAL or your DVD player converts it for you. Simply dezoning the player is not sufficient. You won't get any picture.<BR>the Japan and Hong Kong R3 versions I believe are both in NTSC. The Japan version might be anamorphic (like the UK version) but the Hong Kong version is non-anamorphic. These are both in DTS. The Hong Kong version might be the best bet for US buyers as the menus are in English. It is often on ebay.<BR>The Australian R4 version is 'rental only' but can be found in second hand shops. Big problems: it is in pan&scan (4:3). It is uncut, however, and the colours are the original muted palette.<BR>I went for the UK R2 version and I'd urge all non-US English language buyers to do the same.<br />P.S. Another issue with the R3 Hong Kong version -- the English subtitles appear during all the dialogue, whereas in the R2 UK version the subtitles appear only when characters are speaking in non-English languages.  Also, some of the extras that appear on the UK version -- such as the documentary -- are not on the Hong Kong version.  Also, a new R4 version has been released for sale; I have not viewed this version.  I remain very happy with my R2 UK version.

This is definately a good time, chill out, let's have a philosophical discussion after the movie, kind of movie. At least that's what I did w/ my friends after the flick.  The most talked about point being the origin of The Angry Inch, which is both horrifying and darkly funny. I and my co-horts are always fans of guys-in-make-up movies (The Rocky Horror Picture Show and Velvet Goldmine are excellent examples) but watch this movie for good looks, good fun, good music, and a really good story.
0345448898|5.0|It has surprised me that this book can even be compared to Harry Potter.  I have been a huge fan of His Dark Materials series since i first laid my hands on the Golden Compass.  This has everything a reader could want, magic, suspense, cunning, love and leaves the reader basking in wonder.  What can possibly happen to the characters next?  The aggravation I went through waiting for the Amber Spyglass, imagine waiting for years for this amazing novel to finally arrive.  These three books are at the very top of my list and i recommend them to anyone who does not mind spending sleepless nights completely glued to them.  Philip Pullman is an amazing storyteller and you will never know what to expect next.  Consider yourself lucky to have the full collection all at once.
0446310786|4.0|This book is a timeless classic.  It shows how brutal people can be given their surroundings.  When three children experience the depths of prejudice, they realize how cruel and closed minded people can be.  A great read.<br />The reason I didn't give this book a fifth star was because of the poor ending.  It was too ... unreal and the final pages didn't show the depths of the story and didn't give a very nice closure.  I could predict the last chapter from the very beginning.<br />Overall, pretty good.  Lots of symbolism and depth.

0385503954|5.0|Atonement is one of those novels that begins slowly, grows on you and becomes impossible to put down.  McEwan has crafted a tale that begins with the Tallis family in 1930's England and ends in 1999.<br />  Briony Tallis is a 13 year old girl prone to fantasies and daydreaming who has a particular talent for writing.  On a hot summer day in 1935, she witnesses a scene between her sister Cecelia and the housekeeper's son Robbie that confuses her and sets into motion events that spin out of control.<br />  The novel follows the aftermath of this one day through Cecelia's, Briony's and Robbie's life which includes a stunning and heartbreaking description of the retreat from Dunkirk in 1940.<br />  McEwan writes with exquisite detail about the surroundings and each character.  Some readers may find this difficult but this novel is not meant to be read through at breakneck speed rather each detail is to be savored and refleced upon as he slowly builds to the stories climax.  Once you come to know the characters you are hooked and this fine Booker nominated novel brilliantly concludes leaving the reader wondering if atonement is ever truely possible.
B00005YU1O|5.0|I've read some of the negative reviews and I want to stick up for this fantastic film.  The only parts that are spoon-fed to you surround the character's growing awareness of the dream, the actual plot line.  There is some beautiful, rewarding thought in this movie and drawing out the path of the conversations--why this guy comes before that guy--is a gratifying exploration of theme and ideology.  The first half hour alone justifies this movie ever being made.  I feel those that didn't get it were used to a spoon-feeding extravaganza of a blockbuster bent or simply don't get turned on by humanistic existentialism and a little thrashing of post-modernism.
0380977788|5.0|An amazing story of an explorer who loves her parents very much, knows chocolate is bad for dogs, has no fear of buttons and knows how to handle a cat.  Very fun.
B00004X01U|1.0|Nope.  Wretched, contrived scat.  If music had a soul, this would be on the first freight train to Hell.  After listening to this, I had to get a colon flush for my ears.
0345413377|4.0|Like the previous two books in this trilogy, \\"The Amber Spyglass\\" is a mesmerizing read. It draws you in and refuses to let go. The plot was wonderfully interwoven with symbolism and subtle humour, the characters are fresh and lifelike, and the overall writing is almost surreal. <br />So why did I not rate this book 5 stars? The ending. All right, yes, the ending was beautifully written - no question about that. It was, however, a rather weak ending to such a strong trilogy. It was so terribly sad it made me cry, and I was disappointed that Pullman chose to end his series with a whimper rather than a bang. In my opinion, this ending is the coward's way of finishing the trilogy (or maybe I just like happy endings). Nevertheless, it was meant to tug at the heartstrings and so it did. It was, really, unbearably sad, and made me think about what became of the characters for far too long afterwards. <br />The religious part I enjoyed, because it isn't a very popular opinion in the world today. The \\"killing God\\" angle really was very interesting. To everyone who objects to this book for religious reasons, remember: it's called freedom of speech. If you don't like it, don't read it. Be forewarned now that the book presents controversial views of the Church. <br />All in all, a book worth reading. Just be sure to have some Kleenex for the end.
B000002UJQ|3.0|Those who were able to hear \\"OK Computer\\" when it was Radiohead's newest release are surely better able to appreciate the evolution that led to \\"Kid A\\".  Unfortunately for me, I started with \\"Kid A\\" and, encouraged, started working my way backward.  So, with apologies to the legions who clearly love this disc, I offer a warning to those moving chronologically backward as I did: in retrospect, \\"OK Computer\\" sounds like more of the same.    That's not necessarily bad, is it?  3 stars is not an unrespectable rating, and it's not an unrespectable album.  For those in love with the \\"Kid A\\" sound, there's plenty on this recording to like at first listen and plenty more as it grows on you.  But, for me, that's the problem.  Conventional wisdom (and, indeed, Amazon's own editorial review) has it that \\"Amnesiac\\" is the first one to sound like its predecessor; so, it was in hopes of hearing something I hadn't heard before that I purchased \\"OK Computer\\".    There's more guitar rock on this album than on \\"Kid A\\", and that's to be expected, knowing where they started with \\"Pablo Honey\\".  I haven't heard \\"The Bends\\", so I don't know how much of this palette of soundscapes and production techniques first appeared on this album.  But the chord progressions, melodies, and lyrics are definitely a product of the same band, in mostly the same mindset, that resulted in that album to which I keep referring.  So much so that, to my backward perspective, \\"OK Computer\\" sounds practically redundant.  There is nothing I have to learn from this release that I haven't already heard.
B00005JKYI|5.0|I still can't understand why the studio that made this film has not put this 'classic' film on DVD.<BR>Instead, they put such garbage as 'Jay and Silent Bob' and other MTV crap on that format instead.<br />Kevin Bacon is one of those actors who will never get any big time awards but, he is a big time actor. This is a simple story but, it is all about freedom and what is inside you.<br />If you have not seen this film, you should. It is a film with alot of good actors such as Kevin Bacon, Lori Singer, John Lithgow, etc. It also is a story which is timeless.<br />You can never outgrow this film and it's basic concepts.<BR>Also, the sound track is fantastic.
B000066C87|5.0|Gosford Park is more than a murder mystery.  In fact the murder is incidental to the story.  It's about two classes of people.  The servants and the served, two groups at the opposite extremes of social acceptance.<br />Altman does a great job of showing how intertwined and dependant they are on each other.  The rich are often snobbish, self-absorbed and just plain mean.  But not always.  The servants are full of gossip about their employers, simpler (that might be arguable) and kinder.  But again, not always.<br />Pride and lust, money and vengence and a lot petty squabbles end up being greatly entertaining.  Not in a soap opera fashion, but rather at sociological study of inter-relationships between classes.<br />For me, the best moment is when the \\"film star\\" plays and sings at the piano with the aristocats who are bored with it while in the shadows of the hallways and staircases the servants are captivated by his music.  The cynical seen-it-all-before attitudes of the upper classes contrasted with the star-crossed servants who are willing to let themselves be entertained without constraints.<br />I liked Altman's \\"The Player\\" as a comment on Hollywood and in a similar fashion, Gosford Park is his comment on class and society in England.  Highly recommended.
B00004XOWM|5.0|I didn't think so.  Maybe it's cuz of the loud, slammin' beats on this record, or maybe it's that people can't hang with Durst's cuzzing;  either way, dis is the best record to come out in a long, long time.  <br />Basically, the production on this album is so pumped up it's totally whack.  I can see why many could not &quot;get&quot; what this album offers, not to be stuck up or anything.  <br />Fred Durst poignantly spews out some of the most inventive lyrics of his career, and that's saying a lot.  Besides Eddie Vedder and Bob Dylan, I'm not sure there are too many other singers/lyricists who write with such depth.   <br />Alright, I've said enough.  If you think you can hang, buy it.  If not, go back to listening to your Radiohead album.<br />PEACE OUT!!
B00000G3Q4|5.0|If you like horror than this is the one.  Lots of all the good stuff you look forward in seeing when watching such a movie.  The DVD version is very interesting as it has lots of extras.
B00003CX5P|3.0|A random mishmash of good and bad. Varies from scene to scene, often within the scene. In honor of the movie's plot, I'll list the good and bad in short blurbs, paying little attention to style.<br />THE GOOD: Special effects, settings, Ewan, Liam, Darth Maul, it is Star wars, Portman's cute, plenty of dvd extras, musical score, opening scroll, mercury ships, and Yoda.<br />THE BAD: Jar Jar, Jake, ethnic allusions, teenagers flirting with pre-adolescents, plot, misplaced odes to droids, dialogue, kid's mother, queen's clothing, bumbling robots, pod race fiasco, miticlorions?, Jake, and Jar Jar.<br />All this having been said, I've watched the DVD a dozen times and have disliked it fractionally less with each viewing. What does that mean to you? I have no idea, flip a coin, buy it or don't.
B000055X3U|5.0|Anathema is such an amazing and diverse band I wonder how I didn't discover them earlier. With Judgement, they make some of the most beautiful and inspiring music i've heard in quite some time (along with their other releases, of course). You probably won't &quot;get&quot; the entirety of this album right away, it takes a little while. The musicianship and production are probably Anathema's best on this album. The opening track &quot;Deep&quot; is a very bleak however refreshing and upbeat song... kind of hard to explain but it's a perfect song to start the album. There are some very emotional songs, especially the moving &quot;One Last Goodbye&quot;, and the short but very sweet &quot;Parisienne Moonlight&quot; which also includes some beautiful female vocals and piano melodies. the title track seems a little strange and experimental, but thats what Anathema does best. That song has a doomy, stressful feel with an unexpected ending. There is much keyboard/piano melodies found, but no violins such as on Alternative 4. Also a lot of great acoustic guitar work. Also the album is a good length and not drawn out or extended with filler tracks. There are some instrumental tracks and they are done excellently. An unforgettible album, it will most likely be turn out to be one of the best albums in your collection reguardless if it's you first or last by Anathema.
0312954468|5.0|This was the first of Smith's books that I have read. It takes a pretty wonderful book to impress me and this one has. Your imagination is treated to images of love, hot passionate sex, betrayal, revenge, hardship, and triumph. Taita the slave is completely devoted to his mistress who leads her fellow Egyptians with dignity and grace. I was impressed with Smith's vivid descriptions of the battle scenes and the tools of war used during the time.  For the historical fiction reader, this one is hard to beat!
0140186409|5.0|Steinbeck's Graphes of Wrath is an amazing book.  I recommend this read to anyone who enjoys Steinbeck's style of writing.  It is an excellent story.
B000000OA6|5.0|This is one of Queen's greatest albums. It is poignant, beautiful, and addictive. The album starts with \\"Innuendo\\", an essay of human behavior which features biting cynicism not heard since \\"Great King Rat\\". Next is \\"I'm Going Slightly Mad\\" and it is classic Mercurial madness. \\"Headlong\\" abounds with excellent rhythm and rocking quality. \\"I Can't Live With You\\" is a wonderful pop-rock hybrid with good group vocals. \\"Don't Try So Hard\\" is beautiful, one of my favorite songs conceived by John Deacon. It displays some of Freddie's best vocals. \\"Ride the Wild Wind\\" is completely hypnotic. Loud, blaring, and simply great.<br /> \\"All God's People\\" is the only inferior song on the album. It gives me a headache. Roger Taylor displays his most beautiful song, \\"These Are The Days of Our Lives\\". Undeniably a tear-jerking song. \\"Delilah\\" makes me smile every time I listen. \\"The Hitman\\" shows Brian May's ability to make thunderous rock songs. It is followed by \\"Bijou\\", a spectacular love song with a brief vocal from Freddie. It shows more guitar wizardry from Brian. \\"The Show Must Go On\\" is the best song on the album. Brian pens this haunting masterpiece, and it features Queen's ne plus ultra of emotion. Buy this album. You will be glad you did.
0060930349|3.0|I was really disappointed in this book's treatment of the past 50 years in American history, and found enough inaccuracies throughout the book that I tend to doubt most of what the author says.<BR>Political correctness is alive and well in the conservative world, and Johnson demonstrates his grasp of this in his portraits of the presidencies of LBJ, Kennedy, and Nixon, to name a few.  I was hoping for and expecting a neutral viewpoint, rather than an ideological right-or-left wing perspective.  Unfortunately, that's not what I got.<BR>3 stars for readability, 1 for accuracy, 0 for his opinion.
068981528X|5.0|Our oldest son read this book at school and he liked it so much that he insisted we buy it. When my husband and I read it we could not stop laughing. It puts an unexpected twist on the original story of The Three Little Pigs. You can't wait to turn the page to see what the Three Little Wolves will come up with next and what the Big Bad Pig will do to destroy it. There is also a surprise ending. The story is hillarious and the pictures are excellent. This is definitely going to be one of our favorite books. I don't think we will ever get tired of reading it to our boys. Buy this book, I promise you will love it.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Make no mistake, not everyone will love this movie.  In fact there seems to be only two responses to this movie - love it or hate it.  I personally loved it.  Ewan McGregor and Nichole Kidman have such a chemistry that they carry this whirlwind of a story along with their side-long love-struck glances alone.  Sure, the plot was predictable, so what?  Believe it or not the point of this spectacular movie was something beyond the plot, beyond the actors, beyond the dazzling set.  This is a movie that is truely more than the sum of all its parts.  It is beautiful, wonderful movie and I would reccomend it highly.
B000002UAC|5.0|I have heretofore avoided writing Beatle album reviews for amazon, partly because the group is so indelibly stamped in our minds that to say anything more seemed pointless.  But an average four-star rating for one of the most influential and famous albums of all time seemed a little odd, hence this attempt to set the score straight.<br />To put it simply, \\"With The Beatles\\" (better known with a slightly rejigged running order as \\"Meet The Beatles\\" in the US)<BR>is a legendary album, almost critic-proof.  Many people who did not grow up to witness how truly different and profound Beatlemania was in its first incarnation see the album as dated, even a precursor of \\"boy band\\" pop like N'Synch.  How incredibly wrong this assessment is on so many different levels; \\"With The Beatles\\" is filled with cheery, catchy pop songs sung by a group of four English white boys, to be sure--but those four men were John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. In November 1963 (tellingly, \\"With The Beatles\\" was released on the same day as JFK's assassination) this album was the most hardcore rock music you could find, and teenagers then knew it.  Those effortless melodies, those crashing cymbals (Ringo never gets his true due), those chiming guitars...but most all, the <BR>powerful, definitive voices of Lennon and McCartney were overwhelming in an era of Bobby Dee and Bobby Darrin.  The group even rocked harder than their 50s heroes, although they also <BR>knew how to put on a bright pop sheen to their work which--astonishingly--still sounds honest to this day.  This was not a pre-packaged, mechanical hit machine--The Beatles were a natural organic phenomenon, the spiritual tap from which all others took pop music in the decades since.  Every band wants to have a breakout album like \\"With The Beatles\\"; originals such as \\"It Won't Be Long\\", \\"All I've Got To Do\\" and \\"All My Loving\\", are clever, fresh and sound like a revolution is about to take place, and the covers are all done with more finesse than the debut album (as good as it was), \\"Money\\" achieving almost punk-like levels of energy, Lennon's howl of rage a definitive rock'n'roll moment.  The pop music scene would change within a year of the album's release--a change largely spearheaded by the group themselves and their peers--which only makes \\"With The Beatles\\" an even more epochal moment, because it foreshadows the hurricane to come.  My favorite moments here, interestingly, are from George and Ringo--\\"Don't Bother Me\\" sounds intriguing right from the start, beginning an association with the dark horse side of his personality that would define him for years, and \\"I Wanna Be Your Man\\" is nothing less than an all-out rocker, one of their most charged of the period, with screams and hammond organs swirling out of control.  Ringo for president.
B00005QCYC|5.0|Steven Spielburg presents a trilogy of Dinosaur Sci-fi Epics inspired by Michael Criction. The first one &quot; Jurassic Park&quot; stunned audiences everywhere with it's Special effects and became one of the top grossing movies of all time, then there comes &quot; Lost World&quot;, a underrated sequel with bigger dino action. then last years's part III which maybe the weakest of the series but hey it's got good Dinos.<br />This is a must have for DVD collectors, enjoy.
0743216385|5.0|Ambrose's gripping tale of the elite paratrooper unit is an incredible account of Easy Company's birth in the States and their grueling basic training all the way to their final mission at Hitler's nest in the hills of Berchtesgaden.  By providing just the right mix of character development and dramatic battle scenes, Ambrose allows the reader to understand and relate to each soldier in Easy while still keeping the text extraordinarily exciting.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone remotely interested in Wolrd War II, and I look forward to reading some of his other works.
0792156684|5.0|I was not there when the Titanic sank on its maiden voyage. The story though was well known to me even so. A testament to the triumphalism of man...the Unsinkable ship...the largest and most palatial ocean liner ever to set out upon the Atlantic Ocean, destined never to reach port. <br />Quite simply, by watching this film I get a ringside view of the sheer horror of events as the great ship slipped beneath the waves taking the majority of those on board with her. <br />The inter-weaving story is sweet of course and there to create a beginning, middle and end which it does, and does well. Otherwise just show the film from when the iceberg hits and call it documentary, since the historical accuracy apart of the overlaid fictional story is not in question. Shots were fired into the crowd to maintain order, the third class passengers were kept locked below to a watery fate, lest they swamp the boats of the more life deserving first class passengers. (Horror on so many levels). The band really did play on...to the last and to a man.<br />The story was told in my infancy as a lesson in big-headedness. This film makes that lesson visible. I found myself saying a prayer for all those souls. Utterly spectacular. Utterly distressing.
B00003003R|4.0|Very impressive cd set. I've seen G 'N' R Live a few times and this is the best I've heard them. <BR> The main track that comes to mind is \\"Move To The City\\"...not their greatest song, but the band goes off!! At the end of the song, Axle introduces the band and they show why they're in the band.<BR> Another track I never gave a lot of ear to is \\"November Rain\\"...not much into the more commercial stuff. However, combined with the intro on this cd, it's spine-tingling.<BR> All of the tracks from \\"Appetite For Destruction\\" sound great. I was disappointed with some of the song choices from the Use Your Illusion set...\\"Estranged\\" and \\"Don't Cry\\" should have been excluded or put earlier in the set. They brought the end of the show down. I never liked \\"Yesterdays\\" either. I would have rather heard \\"Locomotive\\", \\"Garden Of Eden\\" or \\"14 Years\\". I also could have done without \\"Patience\\", but knew it would be included.<BR> I was very pleased otherwise...very happy to hear \\"Pretty Tied Up\\", and \\"You Could Be Mine\\" is always awesome. <BR> I hadn't actually gave \\"It's Alright\\" any listening time prior to this release, but it's placement in this set is perfect. This track was made for a live performance.<BR> All in all, a very good live cd. This was definately intended for the radio crowd, but has enough good stuff for the die-hard fans like myself, who just want their [rear] kicked.
B00004XOWM|2.0|I give cd 2/5 because 2/5 of it is worth listening to. Before I decided to buy this cd, my friend showed me the lyrics to hot dog. The funniest thing I have ever seen. Every other word is f---, which doesn't sound terrible with the song. But just seeing the lyrics was hilarious. I only like 3 songs on here. Can you guess which ones? My generation, my way and rollin. I must admit, I haven't even tried listening after livin it up. I wanted to puke. Limp Bizkit would do much better if they stayed with 'metal' (if you call what they sing metal). I still wouldn't listen to it, but i think other people would. Ps: I don't think I have heard a limp bizkit song where they did not mention how great they are. Ugh! It reminds me of Eminem! =(
B000053VAF|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  Matt Damon and Ben Affleck were hysterical as fallen angels and Jay and Silent Bob were great, as always.  Smith has written a smart, funny movie that points out the faults of organized religion with a giant neon light!  Also, the way he was able to also poke fun at other major institutions (Disney, for one) was great.  Check out Jay and Silent Bob's secret stash for cool stuff.  I have a 6 in. Buddy Christ in my car.  Although George Carlin's role was brief, he was great as well.  The deleted scenes are fantastic and one of them made me fall off the couch and cry, I was laughing so hard (Jay and Silent Bob's Fat Albert scene).  See this movie!
6305127697|5.0|This absorbing courtroom drama refuses to buckle down and be traditional in its plot. Not only does the story lure the watcher with its strangely subjective view of the law, but its characters chill and amaze. <br /><BR>       These people aren't bowling pins that refuse to be knocked down by the final, heart rending twist. They're alive in every sense of the word, and especially Richard Gere and Edward Norton crackle with intensity and soul when in the same room. <br /><BR>       The movie depicts Gere as a hotshot defense attorney defending Norton as an altar boy (in his impressive debut) who is on trial for murdering an archbishop. But did he do it? Nothing is as it seems, and though the court scenes have every opportunity to be boring, they never are. Laura Linney is naively brazen as a prosecutor.<br /><BR>     Ultimately, though, it's Norton that puts the scare into &quot;Primal Fear&quot;. Why? I'll leave that for the lucky watcher. I have never been this emotionally involved in a movie. Or maybe I have been. <br /> Or maybe I'm &quot;of two minds&quot; on the matter.
038533348X|2.0|Where is the contemplation in this \\"classic\\"?<BR>This book, though an interesting insight into one man's thinking and life journey, certainly did not seem to merit the hype it has received.  <br />It seemed very whiney and a little condescending, talking down to the reader.  If the world annoys you, Vonnegut, work to improve it, or better, your view of it, rather than complaining to the world!  Cat's Cradle seemed like an explanation of one man's depression and corruption so we could understand, even agree with him.  I am certainly not saying the world is perfect, but if you are looking for a pensive and melancholy-toned book about its problems, I suggest \\"Demian\\" or \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" and others of Bradbury's classics.  In comparison, Cat's Cradle is merely a collection of a cynic's complaints creatively assembled.
B000060P79|5.0|Simple Plan is my fave band. Their new cd is the greatest! They sing about real stuff..stuff that teenagers can relate to. Now quit reading this..and BUY THE CD!!!
B00006690G|4.0|all I can say is this is a GREAT cd.Intianally I wasn't into Eminem because all they hype,but the hype never died down,and then I heard him w/elton john do \\"stan\\"and I was hooked right then&there.so I got this album and I am glad I did!!!to sum it up <BR>it is a dark,humorous and touching cd all wrapped up into 1.and ppl shouldn't take him too seriously.He speaks the truth about some things and other times he just over-exagerrates but come on ppl it's entertainment so don't whine about his music.why get an em cd when you know what his rep is then whine about how awful it is on amazon.must be pop fans huh?<BR>I couldn't believe how great em and his new cd is.I don't have a fav song or skit because they are all great and his lyricks rock.He's the only rap I listen too and am very proud to have him in My cd collection.I suggest getting this cd&giving eminem a chance!
0767836286|5.0|This one kept me riveted throughout; I swear I didn't exhale until the last five minutes. No, I didn't see the ending coming, but it makes absolute sense given the ficton created therein (Roger Ebert is full of PRUNES when he says that it &quot;flies apart in the last 30 minutes;&quot; it not only works, it's the only way the film CAN end and maintain its integrity). The performances are spot-on (including Joan Cusack; hello? The woman is allowed to do something other than &quot;zany&quot; roles-- especially when she does so damned well with a role like this one), the plot is complex and yes, far-fetched, but pulls you in and keeps you in a stranglehold. But as I titled my review, do NOT watch this movie if you have to see good conquer evil/hope springs eternal etc.-- you WON'T LIKE IT. It is good drama, an excellent thriller, and while the nods to Ruby Ridge (NOT Waco,as has been suggested) and Oklahoma City made it timely when it was released, the events of 9-11-01 make it even more disturbing now. Remember, when we believe these acts to be the acts of individuals, acting alone, it only helps us to regain our sense of security; the truth may be more than we can bear.
B00000JTB2|5.0|My only regret in writing this review lies in the fact that I cannot give this anything higher than 5 stars.  When I learned that this album existed, I found it and of course, came home and listened to it.  Immediately, I was in awe.  I had planned to listen to it while cleaning up my room, and doing a few other activities that don't require much thought (so I can be productive and concentrate on the music). But, as it turned out, I just stood there in front of the CD player for some time, and then sat down in front of it.  In what seemed like minutes, the hour was over, and the CD was done playing.  Wow.  Only other complaint:  So...what took you record companies so long to release this?  And got any more of these sort of things hiding around somewhere?
B00005JKYS|4.0|Due to the length of my review I've divided it to two : one discusses primarily the significance of this motion picture , the other one summarizes the plot extensively .<br />*At first , a warning - this movie is , in part , a terrible visual experience and one of the hardest I have ever seen . Prepare yourself .<br /><br />Part one : Reasons to see/ significance .<br />-------------------------------------------<br />A question you might ask could be : \\"why should I take my time to see another Vietnam War movie ?\\"<br />My answer would be : \\" because I don't recall they have ever done such a movie about that war \\" .<br />\\"We were Soldiers\\" deals with the Vietnam War like no other movie I have seen . I suppose the distance of time and the proclivities of today's producers allow perspectives and purposes that were unpopular in the following decades after the war .<br />First and foremost , I agree with the director that the main purpose of the film is to heal the veterans . There were so many wounded casualties of the public's opinion that suffered just as much - and  more - after they returned home , than they had suffered throughout the Vietnam ordeal itself . We have read about it and seen it in numerous films . We have also seen many critic views about the war from Hollywood that apparently hurt the veterans as well .<br />It's time it's stopped .<br />The filmmakers say : \\"Let others ask the questions about why they were where they were and why they did that they did , it does no good anymore , anyway\\" .<br />The realization of the main goal is given form with a firm and harsh view at how one of the first real engagements of warfare looked like from the infantryman's eyes (see veterans reviews for confirmation). That done , without intending to judge the men who were sent by their country to serve . In other words , the film recognizes the tribulations the soldiers went through and the immense sacrifices they had to make . By doing so , it helps those men if just to feel a little better regarding their personal history and actions . In that it assists the healing process of the old wounds they carry deep inside .<br />In a way , I think it does well with the Vietcong's vets too . In here the enemy is given one of the fairest and balanced trials I've seen . More than ever we acknowledge and identify with his aims , missions , struggles and pain . Perhaps when coming from the American point of view it means something to them and makes them feel better too .<br />The movie also shows the angle of the wives back home , scenes that are familiar here in Israel , but are always important at showing how the lives of the close ones that are left behind continue , or more accurately stand still in the face of a war .<br />Part two : The plot and the cast .<br />--------------------------------<br />\\"We Were Soldiers\\" is divided into two parts - the preface to the fight that is to come , and the battle itself .<br />The exposition presents most of the heroes of our story : Colonel Hal Moore (Gibson) , his wife Julie (Madeline Stowe ) , the sergeant major (Sam Elliot) and Jack Geoghegan (Chris Klein) to name a few . Here the movie concentrates mainly on Gibson and his family plus the forming and training of his battalion . The focal point is the fear of Gibson from the hell he knows he is going to face in the Ia Drang Valley in Vietnam . This part is rather bearable (tension wise) owning to number of scenes about the ideal family (Moore's) and the forming of campaign leaders , but at the same time uneasy knowing what is to come .<br />The body of the film is the incarnation of hell when Moore and his men set their feet on the Vietcong's turf . The shootings , bombing and body count begin immediately and are almost unbearable . I've never seen such concentrated sights of death , slaughter and destruction . In this region \\"We were Soldiers\\" sets a new record ; it's a long step forward in the presentation of war realism that easily surpasses the bloodiest sights of Gibson's \\"BraveHeart\\" and \\"the Patriot\\" together .<br />The stardom of Gibson is set-aside a bit in the wake of the ongoing battle , as different men and their actions for good or ill are highlighted . Gibson shines again in portraying the agony and pain his character suffers from ; this happens on account of the speeding number of the dead bodies of his men , while holding the leader-commander position and being in charge of everything . Throughout the movie this sense of personal lose and great responsibility is evident in Gibson's performance and in many ways it's a continuance of his stature appearances in previous films .<br />In the heat of the battle a young reporter (Barry Pepper) joins the film's staff and fighting men to cover the combat . For a while , he takes on a leading roll as the story concentrates in his experiences and reactions to the horrible trials surrounding him . To me , he represents the common viewer's reactions if dropped , at this point , into the fire : shocked , terrified and disbelieving he is witnessing such reality . In fulfilling that goal he is successful and does a great job .<br />Madeline Stowe is the leading actress at the U.S. , where the women are waiting in awe for news from the front . She delivers a commendable appearance portraying the wife of Hal Moore , who takes hold of the difficult duty of telling the bad news about the husbands to the family at the home base .<br />==============================================================<br />I've waited for a long time to see this movie , was shocked by the sights , and after I've digested its important aspects , I think I can see the importance and significance of this movie .<br />In the end , I hope I have helped you to see them too .oodiest sights of Gibson's \\"BraveHeart\\" and \\"the Patriot\\" together .<br />The stardom of Gibson is set-aside a bit in the wake of the ongoing battle , as different men and their actions for good or ill are highlighted .

B00005QK3W|4.0|It's hard to believe this guy is sixty years old.  He can still rock and roll with the best of them!  There are a lot of wonderful treats on \\"Driving Rain,\\" not the least of which is seeing his new sprightliness and cheer following the upswing of his lovelife.  The very first track, \\"Lonely Road,\\" stoutly declares that he's not ready to \\"walk that lonely road again,\\" and while in someone else's hands we might think that it referred to simply, well, being alone, in McCartney's able hands it carries both overt and subtle references to the 1998 death of Linda, to whom he'd been married for twenty-nine years (an astonishing length of time by any standards, but especially by the standards of rock and roll).  With this song, McCartney declares his willingness to go on with his own life.<br />\\"From a Lover to a Friend\\" carries McCartney's signature piano work to new heights and has echoes of so many old McCartney tunes.  It's a treat musically, and showcases McCartney's usual ear for delicately revealing lyrics.  It's difficult to tell if he's talking to both Linda and Heather here, but that's what seems to be going on.  Most revealing, not to mention a fine tune.<br />On \\"Tiny Bubble,\\" McCartney almost seems at the beginning of the song to be channeling a Barry White/Stevie Wonder/Funkadelic kind of groove, complete with Hammond organ.   Then \\"Your Way\\" could easily pass for a Grateful Dead effort in terms of its harmonies and laid-back ease.  McCartney is all over the map here and it's exhilarating!<br />Heather Mills has done something good for Paul McCartney--we'll never know exactly all the details, but good for her for being the inspiration for the lovely \\"Heather,\\" a gorgeous blend of calmness and joy that is mostly all about piano with just a subtle drum rhythm in the background.  It's truly a pretty song, something it's hard to say about most songs these days.  Then on \\"Your Loving Flame,\\" piano comes to the fore again, this time with an almost prayerful intensity.  The song is thoughtful, complex, and bears lyrics of an almost naked intensity.  Here is a Paul McCartney in the throes of young love, no matter what his age, and it's a splendid thing to hear.
B00006690G|5.0|It's here!!  The newest Marshall Mathers LP, The Eminem Show, is finally complete and I know that I wasn't the only one waiting in line to buy it.  Out of his last four CD's; The Eminem Show is the one album to have.  Any fan knows, that it's only satisfaction guaranteed when it comes to Eminem.  Today, how many other artists can give you that same feeling?  No more than a few come to my mind.<BR> On a scale out of five stars, I give The Eminem Show a straight five!  I have rated this album on the song lyrics, artist's style, and total number of album copies sold.  Eminem, being one of my favorite artists, also helps to increase my star rating.  In my opinion, The Eminem Show rates high above any other top-selling artist's album.  <BR> To start, his lyrics are original, and yet so deep as he displays his emotional side through most of his songs.  In this album, Marshall Mathers uses his unique skill and unbelievable talent to produce some of the best rap lyrics I have ever heard.  From the first song, \\"White America\\", which gives the audience a preview of what Eminem is all about, to the last song, \\"My Dad's Gone Crazy\\", which features his own three year old daughter, Hailie, the album never slows down to a song that you'd want to skip on by.  Not to mention, his hit single \\"Without Me\\" is placed right smack in the middle of this great masterpiece.  Though his songs aren't for everyone, Eminem himself advises young children not to listen to his music.<BR> Eminem's style is not the typical rappers, but it is his own and that's why people love him.  He is one of the most popular artists to embrace the rap scene in a long time.  He has also created an album that will have you hooked after listening to just one of his amazing songs.  And over all the critics, protesters, and uptight politicians he continues to rise to the top.<BR> In the end, The Eminem Show proves to be Eminem's most personal and honest work.  In my opinion, listeners like his songs a lot more and theover-all album is a lot better structured than the previous ones.  Marshall Mathers really is a true genius at work once again.
B00005JKJA|3.0|Watch this film purely for the beauty of &quot;Rita&quot; and the steamy love scenes between Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harring. Other than these pleasures, this film is a mind-bending vortex that becomes more work than entertainment to follow. The end of the movie left me feeling sad and betrayed for the heartbroken lover... until I realized these two women may have never met?!<BR>A little creepy.
B000060P79|5.0|I saw Simple Plan at the &quot;Pop Disaster Tour&quot; in Chicago and I fell in love with their music.  They have a very New Found Glory kind of sound which I love. It's fast and punchy. I love it.  My favorite song is probably &quot;I'd Do Anything&quot; and the fact that my favorite member of my favorite band, Mark Hoppus from Blink-182, sings back up vocals on that track makes it that much better.  I also love &quot;I'm Just a Kid,&quot; &quot;The Worst Day Ever,&quot; and &quot;Perfect.&quot;  Actually there aren't any songs on the cd that I don't like.  I would love to see them live again!
B0000009UX|5.0|Seems Elvis really had fun with this album. I like musicians who have serious sensibilities and yet are capable of maintaining a sense of humor.
B00003CXTG|2.0|If you loved the movie on the big screen, you'll love the movie on DVD. The BIG problem is that the movie is split-up on TWO discs! <br />You have to get up, about three-quarters through the movie, and change discs!!<br /> With 6 hours of space available on one disc, I'm amazed at this &quot;Laser-Disc-esque&quot; format. They made a great movie a SUB-PAR DVD experience. I would rather watch something else than have to get up and change discs in the middle of a movie. I would buy it again in two seconds if the movie was available on one DVD, with the bonus materials on a second disc.
0140185232|4.0|Unfortunately I was somewhat distracted from the unique aspects of the book by the film version starring Bill Murray in one of his few (if at all) serious roles. Murray was excellent as Larry, the main character of the book and his life story attracted me very much being somewhat akin to Maugham's own story eg. he served in World War I as an ambulance driver on the front, as in the film, rather than as an airman, as in the book. I speak of the movie since it had a strong effect on me while reading the book, all of the characters of the book were influenced by the corresponding ones of the film. there were some differences such as I mentioned already and some others such as the character of Gray was played by a man quite different from the one in the film and Elliot's demise financially in the film is completely different from the book. However Isabel was very similar in character as was her friend Sophie. Larry's trips all over the world such as India were also different as well as his eventual gain of independence from his books as he burnt them in the film whereas he continued to rely on them in the book. I do believe that it is the film in fact which better portrays what would really have happened in such a journey from Larry's trip into the Himalayas and his meeting of the Guru who says &quot;I've been waiting for you&quot; which is very profound and his curing of the psychological illness of his friend Gray on his return and the obvious detachment of Larry from the world. I always felt that Larry's own development is better portrayed in the film rather than the book, even near the end of the story Larry is still somewhat dependent on his study/books whereas he has relinquished their hold on him in the film and becomes a completely independent soul, just living, in the film. <br />Like an earlier reviewer noted the book is written in a formal way probably a result of the time it was written in, early 20th Century, and not a result of the author's personality. Maugham's stay in Paris also influenced his style heavily capturing his feelings of living in Paris of the time. Isabel is well portrayed although her character has more depth in the book than the film. Elliot leads more of an empty life in both film and book. Altogether the book displays how people can live their lives and how very different those lives can eg. be the need for the security of money of Isabel, the social acceptance needed by Elliot, Gray's simple devotion to Isabel all fascinating and good in depth portraits.
B000002J1S|4.0|I'm sure die-hard Peter-Gabriel-era Genesis fans will think I'm the Antichrist for saying this, but I wish \\"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\\" was released as one long, single album.  For an album touted as one of the greatest prog-rock masterpieces ever, it should be better.  And the only thing that really needed to be done was to trim the fat.  <BR>     On the positive side, the stuff that is good here is some of the best Genesis ever did with Peter Gabriel.  If a rock opera is what they had in mind,  the top of the opening title track is the lights going down, the orchestra starting the overture, and the layers of curtains opening and lifting in grand fashion.  The words of the album's title are the first lyrics you hear, and they're sung with so much pomp and circumstance, that all it takes is one listen and you will never forget the hook.  <BR>     The mood then goes from the fanfare of the title track, to dark imagery on \\"Fly on a Windshield\\" and \\"Broadway Melody of 1975\\", to the ray-of-sunshine relief of the pretty guitar and piano melodies of \\"Cuckoo Cocoon\\", before wandering into the dark and dangerous alley of the album's highlight, the desperate, complex, and rocking \\"In the Cage.\\" It's a shame the best and most climactic song on the album (especially a double album) comes within the first fourth of the record. Side 1 is topped off with the ultimately quasi-cataclysmic \\"Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging.\\"<BR>     The next 5 tracks (side 2 of album 1) start out promising with \\"Back in NYC\\", a keyboard-driven song that shifts between rhythms in 7/8, 6/8, 4/8, and 3/8, but somehow never sounds forced or awkward.  And for all those who only know Phil Collins as love song cheese ball, it's so cool to hear him pounding out time signatures worthy of Neil Peart and Bill Bruford.   But then, the album starts to show signs of losing focus.  \\"Counting out Time\\" has a catchy melody, and shows that prog rock can still have a sense of humor.  But that warbly horn-synth \\"solo\\" right after Gabriel says something like, \\"Zip-a-zip, zip, a-zip, zipppy zip WHOO-HOO!\\"... oh my God.  That's one of those moments that fans should cringe at, b/c it supports the notions that prog is completely silly.  This is followed by apparent fan favorite \\"The Carpet Crawlers,\\"  although I am one Genesis fan who will never understand why this particular song has been included on a live album, and was redone for a best-of compilation.  It isn't awful, but it's just kind of boring.  <BR>     This brings us to side 3.  After a rare (in those days) Phil Collins lead vocal on \\"Lillywhite Lilith\\", the psycho noise-fest \\"The Waiting Room\\", the King Crimson-ish \\"Anyway\\", and a promising opening riff on \\"The Supernatural Anaenesthetist\\", side 3 falls apart into boring, ultimately forgettable piano ballads.  The last 2 tracks sound like they were written just because they needed to tell more story, so they threw some chords together, and let Gabriel basically explain what happens next. It's not so horrible that there are duds on this album; but if you're going to make a listener sit through an album this long, what you do include on the record had better be strong material.<BR>     By side 4, the listener starts to feel like you probably do right now reading this long review -- \\"Is this almost over yet?\\"  Thankfully, \\"The Colony of Slippermen\\" includes some Tony Banks keyboard licks that are so melodic, they sound like a musical version of spoken dialogue between the Slippermen themselves.  After \\"Ravine\\", we get \\"The Light Dies Down on Broadway.\\"  Aurally exhausted by this point, it is a solid emotional payoff that there is finally a feeling of some closure in sight.  It's a quieter, mellower variation of the original theme, possibly to suggest the weariness of the main character as his long journey (and ours as well) is coming to an end.<BR>     But it's STILL not the end.  There are still THREE SONGS LEFT.  And they're pretty good, although \\"It\\" sounds like the theme of a mid-'70's TV action show. (\\"Starring Peter Gabriel as Johnny Slipperman.\\")  \\"Riding the Scree\\" is a near-rocking tune, with more great keyboards from Banks, that on a shorter album (or at an earlier point in this one) would be a standout.  But by this point, we're too tired to care.  We're led to believe that \\"Dies Down\\" is the finale of \\"Lies Down\\", and lying down for a nap sounds pretty good by this point -- and then we hear still more music.  And it's pretty good music, but even the most delicious dessert isn't appetizing when you've just stuffed yourself with 3 other huge, rich, and very filling courses.<BR>     If they kept this album a few tracks shorter, and cut to the chase sooner on a few others, it would live up to the legendary status it has achieved in the eyes of Genesis fans.  There would be a feeling of excitement to pull out this album for a spin again, without the feeling of, \\"Oh boy, do I want to get into something this big right now?\\" <BR>     As far as interpretations to the story's meaning... oh come on, who really cares?  Do concept albums really make much sense anyway?  As far as I know, \\"In the Cage\\" is about monkees at the zoo.  And that'd be just fine with me.
0805047905|5.0|This is a great introduction to colors and animals. At age 2 and a half, my daughter had this book memorized, and she would \\"read\\" it to me (sometimes while the book was still tucked away in a diaper bag).<br />The text is simple and pleasant. The rhymes are easy for little ones to remember, and there is a nice flow to the text that hides the lack of a traditional story line.<br />If you own an earlier printing of this book, you may be pleasantly surprised by the re-illustration and a subtle change in the text.
B00005J9M3|5.0|Laid back, &quot;organic&quot; PSB.  Airy arrangements, for them, give Johnny Marr's subtle guitar just enough space to drive many of the strong songs here.  Some criticized this record for being the &quot;adult contemporary&quot; PSB record, and in many ways it is, but you can't spend every waking hour in a dance club.  Pick up their next release, 'Very', for the more familiar sweeping verses and bombastic choruses that are vintage PSB.  For now, relax and let some of their best songs (Being Boring, My October Symphony) deservedly become some of your favorite songs.
B00000JLWW|3.0|When i first watched this in the cinema i thought it was good, but we had to watch it with a fifteen minute interval so that spoiled it for me a bit. But i recently bought a copy on VHS and watching it at home is a totally different experience, the title music takes you into the film, (it is so haunting) and from then on you are on a roller coaster ride (sort of). The only thing that James Cameron did wrong was casting Leo as Jack, he looked to young and baby faced to play \\"a man of the world\\".<BR>I also rufuse to buy this on DVD untill there are more extras !!

B00005JKNF|4.0|True I did rent this DVD thinking it would be like the classic \\"CLUE\\" movie, but it wasn't. Like someone mentioned earlier the murder doesn't happen until the latter part of the film and I still am not sure who is who in the movie, but I enjoyed it enough to say I will have to rent it again and maybe put on the sub-titles so I can understand more.<br />They don't make movies like this anymore the wrap-up of the murder at the end happened without a build-up, In My Opinion and the rest of the movie just flows from there. That left me feeling like I missed something. Hmph bottom line is it was a good flick worth the time and money, good performances by all. Loved Emily Watson, Maggie Smith and Jeremy Northam.<br />Is it me or does Ryan Phillippe remind me of his character in \\"Cruel Intentions\\" in every movie he does now???
0767827716|5.0|Arnie Cunningham's high school career is not going well. His parents are overbearing, his classmates are bullies, his best friend has become a jock, and he has no love life whatsoever. Things soon change however, when Arnie meets the car of his dreams, Christine. The 1958 Plymouth  Fury sits in a yard, decaying, as Arnie and Dennis drive by one day. Despite its horrid appearance, Arnie falls instantly in love with the wreck. He buys it off a loony old man, against Dennis's advice, and right away takes it home to meet his parents. They are disgusted by the very idea of Arnie owning ANY car, let alone a wreck, so Arnie is forced to rent a space in a local car garage.<br />  In seemingly no time, Arnie has restored Christine to her original appearance! Arnie's appearance is taking on a change however. He is becoming more and more like a 50's greaser, and less and less of a nice guy, and Arnie doesn't let ANYONE talk bad about Christine. Arnie's bad attitude and deadly car with a mind of its own, soon cause him to lose his new girlfriend, the most sought after girl in school, almost as soon as he gets her. His best friend Dennis, though confined to a hospital room most of the time due to a football accident, is starting to notice the negative change in Arnie also. Soon Dennis and Arnie's girlfriend Leigh team-up to take on the car, but it`ll be no easy task. Christine is determined to keep her love with Arnie intact, and no one gets between Christine and her man.<br />  Christine is a great horror classic, despite differences from the book. I'm starting to think I should recommend people stop reading books, since it only seems to give them a bad attitude towards movies if they are even the slightest bit different. You have to take a film completely on its own merit. This is a great film, with fun and exciting scenes. Oh, I doubt it'll give you nightmares or anything, I mean, c'mon, it's a car, though you may develop an even stronger fear of choking. Christine may not be terrifying, but it's tons of fun! From the intense moments when Arnie goes up against his overly controlling parents, to the school jocks pursuit of the high school sweetheart, to the scenes when Christine runs down the school bullies. The entire film is extremely entertaining and well done, and I especially love the way Christine communicates through old 50's rock songs.  Perhaps the only thing I DIDN'T like in the movie was Leigh's line at the end, \\"We didn't do so hot.\\" Ha. It doesn't seem that big a deal now, but listen for it during the end of the movie...it just kinda ruins everything. Ha ha. But regardless, Christine is a must own DVD.t be terrifying, but it's tons of fun!

B00003CWL6|1.0|To begin with i had absolutely no expectations - or knowledge of this film prior to viewing it. At the end of my first viewing [in Australia] my favourite aspect of the movie was nothing to do with the screen, but the housewives and their childrens comments sitting behind me...\\"Well maybe that's what goes on in America\\". I have since seen the film again to silence my peer critics that insist that the film is brilliant...Maybe i was in a bad mood or something, only to find the second viewing more tedious and flawed.<br />My problem with this film is somewhat by comparison but primarily by my unamusement. I am by no means religious or a \\"prude\\" or adversed to films with alternate messages.<br />1. What didnt impress me primarily about the film was its complete lack of subtlety. To compare it with another 'suburban indictment', \\"Happiness\\" from 1998 dealt with the catalystic themes of \\"AB\\" and far much more and through its impressive direction was able to retain an incredible amount of subtlety throughout, no matter how explicit the theme was. I also felt that use of nudity in the film was cheap, and completely avoidable...which in my opinion is probably the corporate influence ala the major theme of Godard's \\"Contempt\\". Perhaps this lack of subtlety can be traced directly to Sam Mendes, whose past productions have been theatrical performances and therefore overstated.<br />2. The acting was terrible, in fact i believe that only Annette Benning put in a worthy show. Spacey [a sometimes brilliant actor] mailed in another typical performance fusing both sarcastic and ironic charm [which can be directly found in Orson Welles' portrayal of Charles Foster Kane] but this time came out loser...and of course Thora Birch whose vacant prescence has led her to such 'classics' as \\"Dungeons and Drangons\\" and \\"Ghost World\\".<br />3. Predictability seems to be the operative term that buzzes around inside your head when viewing. The 'experienced' cheerleader, the angry militant fatherwhose lifestyle cannot accomodate anything for his ailing son, until he reinterprets his machismo in order to in some way understand his offspring [you mean he kisses a man? wow, how brave]. The executive wife whose life is too busy for a husband. The two outcast socially inept characters who just happen to be  boy/girl and become a couple...etc etc. [thumbs down]<br />4. The Hollywood Acceptance of this film as 'the indictment of american suburban social values' or something like that...oh no, we'd better accomodate this one and show some sort of conscious/conscience thinking...we are people too.<br />In conslusion I do not see this film as the sign of the times. i find it petty, misguided, bleedingly obvious/predictable and generally a snoozefest. For all its glossy surface and attractive reputation, it amounts to nothing and only climbs the ladder that films like \\"Blue Velvet\\", \\"Welcome to the Dollhouse\\", \\"Happiness\\", \\"Rain\\" and \\"Bliss\\" have created.<br />Don't believe the hype.
0792844890|5.0|My God, I love this movie. I own two Mel Brooks movies. They are The Producers and Spaceballs. Spaceballs is one of Mel Brooks' finest. It's got Jewish humor, it's got toilet humor, and it mainly mocks Star Wars with two moments in the movie regarding the movies, Alien and Planet of the Apes. If there ever was a sequel, I bet they would have characters like Count Dookie (a spoof of Count Dooku from Attack of the Clones and at the end, he would rescue President Skroob, Dark Helmet, and Colonel Sandurz from the Planet of the Apes. The DVD features are few but brilliant. The commentary is hilarious with lines such as, \\"I gotta get more Jews. This is not working out.\\" There is also a moment where you can hear Ronny Graham (God rest his soul.) speaking. In fact, in the last scene of the movie, he makes his own little commentary. I think it's about him playing the Space Priest. You know, the one who says, \\"We are gathered here today to witness Princess Vespa, daughter of Roland, running right past the altar, heading down the ramp, and out the door!\\" This movie is hilarious. The actors are hilarious. In case nobody knows who are the characters Mel Brooks is mocking, first of all, most of these characters are from Star Wars. Lone Starr is a mixture of Luke Skywalker and Han Solo, Princess Vespa is a spoof of Princess Leia, Dot Matrix is a spoof of the droid C-3PO (the difference is that Threepio is a man and Dot is a woman, Barf is a spoof of Han Solo's first mate, Chewbacca, who belongs to a race called Wookies and talks in grunts and roars, Dark Helmet is a spoof of Darth Vader, Colonel Sandurz might be a spoof of the lesser known Star Wars character known as Admiral Piett from The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, Comanderette Zircon might be a spoof of a male character named Governor Tarkin from the first Star Wars movie, President Skroob is a spoof of Emperor Palpatine, Yogurt is a spoof of Yoda (who doesn't talk exactly like Yogurt does),  the Dinks are spoofs of a race called Jawas, and Marlene and Charlene (Skroob's twin girlfriends) might be spoofs of two twin ladies seen in the cantina in the first movie. Those characters are minor. See the movie and review the Star Wars trilogy. You'll see what I mean
B00005JKQZ|5.0|This performance deserved the Oscar.  Russell Crowe is one of the most diverse actors I have ever seen. He is right in there with Tom Hanks for me.  This movie was good and sad in so many ways. It is an incredible story. I cried with the Professor.  Anyone who hasn't seen this one should.  Ron Howard is to be commended for his directing and as I said Russell Crowe gives just a breathtakingly incredible performance.
B000053VAF|5.0|Some of the funniest lines in recent movies were written by Kevin Smith.  He manages to demonstrate the image and commercial obsessions of our society without being preachy, while endorsing, not rejecting faith.  However, he does question the legitimacy of religious dogma run amok, and what it does to the message.<br />Matt and Ben are awesome in this movie.  Aside from the very few projects (i.e. Rounders, Bounce) they do their best work when they share the screen with each other.  In addition, this movie is full of great cameos by some very talented people.
B00002E23E|1.0|First of all, The Song Remains The Same is a cool film, with great music.  If you have never seen it, check out all of the other reviews here.  \\"No Quater\\" and \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" are, in my opinion, superior to the LP versions.<BR>BUT!<BR>This is one of the (worst) DVD trasfers I have ever seen.<BR>Except for the original trailer, there are no special features.  And the sound is HORRIBLE!  I REPEAT, HORRIBLE!  Anyone familar with the film knows that some of the editing is dubious at best.  Jump cutting around different performances within the same song.  After decades of watching the film you kinda got used to it.  Well, whenever there is an edit between performace footage in a song, the sound goes completly out of phase, and you're left with a thin, \\"flangy\\" sounding audio track.  It gets very annoying, and very mich in the way of the music.<BR>I guess Jimmy Page wasn't consulted on this DVD reissue, much like he wasn't for the original CD reissues of the Zep catalouge.  The band hass always seemed keen to wash their hands of this project anyway.<BR>My advice: Stick with the VHS.
B000063DFW|5.0|Ok, first of all, Hybird Theory is great. The only thing is, why would you pay ... extra ... to get the same CD with 2 bonus tracks that you can find anywhere on the internet? Besides that, it's a great CD. I would also suggest looking for Esual, and Vertical Limit on the internet. These are two songs that were made before the songs that they became (Esual= A place for my head with all different lyrics.) (Vertical Limit= Points of Authority with a different begining \\"Forfeit the game, stop the talk show+Product the one,your intaught to know+Forfeit the game, 'cause tommorow+When it's all done, you reap what you sow.\\" Both songs are amazing :) Try to get them as soon as possible, oh let me not forget Super Xero, a song that is slightly different from By Myself. I hope this helped ya!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Whoa, How do I describe this movie? Well for starters, Donnie Darko isn't like most movies, infact the closest one I know off the top of my head has to be 'Harvey'. Why do you ask its like 'Harvey'? Well, Donnie see's an imaginary bunny named Frank, but Frank isn't an average bunny. Infact he is Donnie's sister's boyfriend in a costume.<br /> Anyways, the story starts out showing Donnie Darko (Who is played by the wonderful actor Jake Gyllenhaal), laying on top of a hill (Which is called 'Carpathian Ridge'). Apparently Donnie, who is sixteen years old, sleep walks, and has gotten into trouble before, but really wants to be a good kid. He goes back home and that night, he is awoken by 'Frank', who tells him the world will end in 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes, and 12 seconds. Donnie is skeptical about this warning, but believes it, cause when he comes home, he sees that a jet engine crashes in his room, which would have killed him if Frank hadn't come. He believes and does everything Frank tells him to do. Next Gretchen a new girl at school, is Donnie's love interest, soon they hook-up. Meanwhile, Donnie who goes to a therapist named Doctor Therma learns about Frank and hypnotises Donnie to tell him things about Frank. Dr. Therma starts to wonder whats wrong with Donnie and ups his medication. Then Donnie finds out that Roberta Sparrow who is an old lady who lives alone and checks the mail box obsessively, wrote a book called 'The Philosophy of Time Travel', Donnie studies it and understands what is happening to him. <br />IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE, STOP HERE.<BR> An inspiration speaker named Jim Cunningham who believes that there are only two things in life, Fear and Love is called 'the anti-christ' by Donnie at an assembly at school. And Donnie burns down his house to reveal that Jim is a children's pornographer. Donnie's little sister, Samantha is in a dance squad called Sparkle Motion who make it to Los Angeles for a competition, but their leader Kitty cannottake them for she is fighting for Jim's right, so she asks Mrs. Darko to take them for her, Mrs. Darko says yes, and leaves Donnie and his sister Elizabeth home alone for a weekend. They have a party, and soon Donnie's days are up, Frank tells him to go to the Cellar Door by Roberta Sparrow's house which was mentioned to Donnie by his teacher, and Gretchen gets run over by Frank, and Donnie shoots him, and take Gretchen back home, that night Donnie goes to bed, thinking its all a dream, and is killed that night, by the recurring jet engine.<br /> On the DVD it reveals how Donnie's medication is really placebos, and much more. The DVD is wonderful, it has deleted scenes, the web site gallery, and TONS more! I love this movie and you should too! I hope this helps everyone.

B00005OAIE|5.0|Mr. Wright obviously needs a good nap. When he's woken up he can proceed to dictate the way others should sing and write their music. John Mayer's Room for Squares is probably one of the best c.d.'s I have bought in a while. Besides offering lyrics that are completely personal and introspective, the talent this guy[Mayer] shows he has for instruments is impeccable. The only things that link him to DMB in my opinion is maybe their voices,(Mayer's is better) and their producer Jon Algaia.Besides that I believe Meyer sets himself apart by simply writing lyrics that are coherent to every human mind. Oftentimes I find DMB to be overly metaphoric and in many ways succeeding in creating confusion rather than clarity. I like DMB for many other reasons but, I consider Mayer to be an improvement because he makes sense. What can I say? I guess I just like to understand what I listen to.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Truly deserving of the first ever academy award for animated film.  This state of the art movie is both enjoyable for kids as well as adults.  Mike Meyers and Eddie Murphy have great comedic chemistry.  CGI is becoming a very popular form of animation and it is really nice to see DreamWorks step up and compete with Pixar.
B00005JL3A|5.0|Its about time. This movie is true to the game with which it was based and true to the fans who made the game what it is today. All I can really say is wow. Watching the movie I felt like I was watching one of the games. Its a different story but has key plot points from number of the games. I highly reccomend this movie.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|20 years ago I saw a film that would become one of the best family films of all times.  Considering technology of the time, this movie was cutting edge and still would make some would be directors wish they had half the talent that Spielberg had way back then.  This new release has an enhanced soundtrack and visual effects that weren't necessary, but make for a better viewing experience.  With it's re-release in the theaters, I was able to share with my children a little piece of my childhood.  Seeing a film like this, it is no wonder we have seen such great things from this director.  A must have for any film enthusiast.
B00005ALP6|5.0|I thought the music was wonderful.  I thought Audrey Hepburn was just adorable and so full of energy and grace and just fascinating to watch.  Rex Harrison was an absolutely perfect Professor Higgins and never wavered or changed character.  My problem (a minor one) is with the ending and with the dubbing.<br />The story is brilliant of course, taken from George Bernard Shaw's acclaimed play Pygmalion, although materially altered to fit the requirements of a musical comedy.  The contrast of the unschooled street urchin Liza Doolittle and the stuffy, self-possessed confirmed bachelor, a kind of nineteenth century British man of science, wonderfully accomplished in his profession, but blind to himself when it comes to relationships with other people, made for a most interesting match.  And the delusive dream of a man forming his own perfect woman (which is the basis of the Pygmalion legend) works so very well with a conceited linguist tutoring a cockney girl.  The entire concept is a work of genius with the drunken father and the objectifying Col. Pickering and the very right Mrs. Pierce.<br />But there are some problems.  Freddy is needed of course as another &quot;objectifying&quot; character to make it clear just how desirable Eliza really is and how foolish and blind Professor Higgins is in not seeing this--in theory, of course, because in practice with Audrey Hepburn or Julie Andrews as Eliza, this would seem entirely unnecessary.  And indeed without Freddy we do not have the beautiful &quot;On the Street Where You Live.&quot;  But even with him Prof. Higgins does not see, and indeed even at the resolution of the story, he still does not see, as he asks for his slippers.  If this were presented to current London and Broadway audiences it would never play the way it was written.  Professor Higgins would need to see the light and he would have to get his own slippers!<br />The dubbing and the need for it is curious.  There is no doubt that Marni Nixon, who did the singing, has a beautiful and commanding voice, and we are the better for having heard her, but why is the dubbing so obvious?  It's almost as if Miss Hepburn is saying to the audience: they said it would be better if Miss Nixon sings instead of me because her voice is stronger and so very well trained.  And so Hepburn does not completely lip-sync some of the opening words of songs as though to remind us that she is not singing.  And the contrast between her delicate voice and then the sudden power of Marni Nixon's is obvious.  Beyond this is the question of why Julie Andrews, who has a voice to match that of Miss Nixon, and charisma and charm at least in the same ballpark as Miss Hepburn, wasn't asked to play the part that she knew so very well from her experience on the stage.  Still, as another reviewer has so acutely noted, if she had been asked, we would have missed her in Mary Poppins, which was made the same year.  I should also note that Hepburn was 33 or 34 years old when this was made (although she looked almost ten years younger).  Nonetheless she was playing the part of &quot;a good girl, I am,&quot; whom Pickering identifies in his call to Scotland Yard as being 21 years old.<br />Curious.  But all is forgiven because Audrey Hepburn is just so beautiful, so elegant and so delightful in the part.  I especially loved her in the opening scene in her soiled clothes and hat and her sour voice.  By the way, I have heard Julie Andrews sing the part, although I never saw her on the stage, and the way she &quot;meow's&quot; Eliza's accent, like a cat's claw on a chalk board, is really amazing.  (Get the CD.)<br />This is one of the best movie musicals ever made, a sheer delight highlighted not only by Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn, but by Stanley Holloway as the Liza's lovable rascal father and Wilfrid Hyde-White as the very understanding and very properly British Col. Pickering with opulent direction by the great George Cukor.  The sets and production numbers are gorgeous.  But see it for Audrey Hepburn, one of the great stars of the silver screen in one of her most memorable roles.re gorgeous.  But see it for Audrey Hepburn, one of the great stars of the silver screen in one of her most memorable roles.
6305892806|1.0|I had just finished reading Mansfield park, and was very excited that a movie had been made.  I was so disappointed!  The only thing that follows the book are the names of the people and that Maria and Crawford take off together, but even that is portrayed differently than the book.  In my opinion, Jane Austen portrayed, and desired, Fanny Price's character to be very gentle and respectful.  This movie does it great injustice.  I could write many more things that I disliked about the movie, but it is not worth my time.  It is not worth the money to rent it, let alone buy it.  What a shame they had to mess up such a sweet book!  Shame on the people who wrote this pathetic storyline!!!
B00000IRED|4.0|The first time I watched \\"The Truman Show\\" I had a tough time getting past the reverential critical reaction hyping the film.  Nary a discouraging word was said by those honoured scribes, and until I saw the movie, I believed them.  Sadly, no film could live up to such lofty praise, and \\"The Truman Show\\" was no exception.  I felt disappointed by its imperfection.  Until I saw the film again recently, that is, clear of the hype.  My reaction to it was much different this time.  It's a very good -- thought not great -- film.<br />The major problem I have with \\"The Truman Show\\" is that it gives up its secret too early.  A much more suspenseful movie could have been made if the audience, along with the protagonist, were kept in the dark longer.  The sense of discovery these two entities could have shared would be staggering, the ultimate revelation of the man behind the curtain.  I understand why the movie didn't go this way.  I understand why director Peter Weir, a sensible sort, didn't want his movie to be about a gimmick (oh what a gimmick it would have been!).  He was aiming for a bigger metaphor, and I think he hit it just perfectly.<br />The town/studio that the filmmakers have created is a wonder to behold.  Self-contained, it's designed to both steer Truman along his daily path, so that the camera can catch the product placements which are the sole source of the show's revenue, and to psychologically torment him, so that he'll never ever think of leaving.  It's a town filled with little flourishes that only the discerning viewer will catch.  Did you notice that the garbage can his neighbour is always carrying has an eyehole?  It's just one touch, unexplained throughout that film's first half that contributed to the flawless tapestry of the town.<br />The film is structured wonderfully.  Except for an expository prologue (which cheekily replaces the film's credits with what appears to be the TV-show-within-the-film's credits), the audience is allowed to slowly follow Truman's discovery that the world he thought was real is not all it appears to be.  A studio light falls from the sky; confusing, until a radio report later that day reveals that an airplane inexplicably dropped some equipment.  Truman's long lost father, dressed in ratty clothing, attempts to make contact with him; later, a newspaper headline bemoans town's homeless problem.  Most effectively, Truman longs to be reunited with the true love of his life in a way that's at first hinted at, then, in a stunning revelatory moment, becomes bold and emotional.<br />With all this good stuff to behold, this is one of the few times when a film's running time feels too short.  \\"The Truman Show\\", possibly because it is ostensibly a movie about a popular TV show, sells itself short.  It needn't have wrapped itself up too quickly.  I could have stood another thirty or forty minutes tacked on to its already hundred minute running time, the better to enjoy the richness of the world that has been created, to more effectively delve into the past that has come to inform the present story, and to allow the fine cast to further explore and flesh-out the characters they've been given.<br />Jim Carrey got a lot of credit for taking a role that would seem to be miles away from manic buffoon he usually plays.  Well, that assessment is only half right.  For most of the film's first half, Truman is a boisterous fellow, amiable and friendly to all.  He isn't yet suspicious that something is amiss, and thus he gives as much joy as he gets.  The joy he gets doesn't come from real people, though.  It comes from actors.  Truman, a grotesque anthropological experiment, has never encountered sincerity.  The insipid greeting he repeats every morning (\\"Good morning... and if I don't see you later, good afternoon, good evening, and good night\\") is little more than a catchphrase, delivered with a full fake smile and a mock-warm head tilt.  These scenes have Carrey smack dab in his element, playingover the top and phony.  But there's a purpose to his phoniness; it contrasts with the realization that Truman has to make in the film's second half, and the change that Carrey has to enact to go along with it.  He becomes a quieter man, in moments.  And when his mania bursts out, it comes in the form of a cunning schemer, intent on breaking down the walls that he just discovered are fencing him in.  Carrey pulls off both of these sides of Truman very well, and although you can sometimes see though the seams and tell he's Oscar-fishing, it never detracts from the performance. <br />As for the grand metaphor that Weir, in conjunction with screenwriter Andrew Niccol, is looking for, well, it's certainly not an attack on the reality TV craze.  That's a not-so-sacred cow that gets tagged in the crossfire, but certainly not the target the film is aiming at.  It's really trying to make a point about loneliness.  More specifically, the loneliness of the authentic man.  In a world ravaged by greed and self-preservation, Truman is the only sincere person, and it's slowly eating him up inside.  He thinks he lives in a town that's friendly and caring.  He doesn't know that they're all paid to be there, and that he has no real friends or real family to call his own.  His final choice, whether to stay in his comfortable yet hollow existence or forage forth into the great unknown, is a moment played with suspense and, ultimately, grace.  Should he stay or should he go?  That's the moral issue the film lays at the audience's feet.  And as it keeps reminding us, the most important question, the one that none of us ever find the answer to in our real lives, is this: How is it all going to end?
0345448898|5.0|This is probably one of the best series I've ever read. This trilogoy has adventure, romance, comedy, and tragidy tide in together. It took about a week to read, which is long for me, but it was worth the wait. When I arrived on the last page of the Amber Spyglass, I was very disapointed it was over. I'm now a very big fan of Philip Pullman and I wish he would write more to this series. I still haven't got over how much these books affected me. Literaly, I never thought that I would actually like any other book series as much as the Harry Potter ones. Way to go, Pullman!
0783225970|5.0|I love this movie i've only seen it one time and am going crazy looking for it. I guess it's because i'm from Brooklyn New York but Al Pacino was great and the shooting was so cool you must see this movie beware see it  one time and you will be hooked if you don't like it you can go watch some sissy movie because this one is (one of a kind).
B00004RFFI|1.0|I had probably forgotten the story line of this movie before reaching the parking lot of the theater where I watched it.  What I can still recall are the Hollywood-ized, utterly fake encounters with the \\"tornadoes\\".  Absolutely everything about the storms themselves and the science of storm chasing was grossly inaccurate.  From the Kenmore ice cube tray hailstorm to the \\"green sky\\" nowhere near an active thunderstorm, to the individual plucking of fence posts (how does wind impinge such an upward force on a paralell-aligned object fixed to the ground?) to the moment-by-moment predictions that the tornado is going to turn left or right, to the chasers riding alongside a tornado in an effort to have intercourse with it, etc., etc., etc., etc., etc. Nothing was even close to reality.<br />Tornadoes are a fascinating subject.  There are plenty of videos featuring REAL storm chases.  Start (and end) your search with those types of videos.
B00004YYDI|5.0|What a beautifully acted film noir, what a lovely macabre plot and what a touching almost taboo love story. Jean Reno, not the Hollywood defined leading man type is brilliant and touching in this action thriller in slow motion DVD and Gary Oldham is to villain what the coyote was to the roadrunner. The symbolism so common in art films appears in the form of a potted plant Leon cannot separate himself from, whether in solitude or climbing through apartment building windows to get to his destination. The final scene is a tribute to never ending romance. Fifty to one odds the little girl grows up to be Angelina Jolie in &quot;Girl Interrupted&quot;.
0380820846|3.0|Julia Quinn is one of my favorite authors.  I always enjoy the passionate innocence of her stories.  Penelope was one of her best main characters-- a lot less exaggerated in personalities.  However, I just couldn't laugh or blush as much as I did with the first books.  You know the moments when you could die right along with the characters.
0060934913|4.0|I'm a cook.  I like cookbooks, find food interesting, and buy cookbooks just to think about how the recipes taste.  I found this book on the best seller list and enjoyed reading it immensely.  It is the story of a now-famous foodtv critique who, in very easy to read, fast reading style makes the life of a chef much less glamorous than those who appear on the shows.  While there are plenty of conflicts, hyjinx with the staff and a career spanning at least a dozen restaurants, there is also some interesting information that might just change your order the next time you go into a restaurant.
B000062TU1|5.0|This movie was superb, but obviously not as good as the book.  The best thing about this movie is that it cannot even begin to show its excellent standard without the other movies, just like Sorceror's Stone sets the basis and tone of all the other books.  As the other movies are created we will see the simple beauty of the story as it naturaly evolves.  I cannot wait!
0385503954|2.0|Atonement was highly recommended from a review I saw on TV- I was surprised at how slow the story moves --- it was in slo-mo for the first half -- then the war part dragged along. The ending is Ok, but not worthy of the high praise it had received.
B0000039PW|1.0|Before anything else, Biggie was a crack dealer, plain and simple.  Yes siree, this is a good example of how an \\"artist's\\" drug dealing... er, um \\"life's work\\" comes before his \\"art\\", and his fans.  And maybe I just don't get the sordid, corrupt concept of \\"Gangsta Rap\\", but how can this man who made a profit off literally destroying peoples' lives have hold a \\"legacy\\" to leave his fans?  It boggles the mind!  I read a small bio on him at the IMDB saying that he was \\"surviving\\" the streets (in other words, profiting off the people he was killing with the drugs he was supplying them) the only way he knew how.  Why'd Biggie continue to sell crack even AFTER he became famous?  Or, how about a more important question: Why'd he even start selling in the first place when there were plenty of job openings at McDonald's and Burger King for him to apply to?  Anyway, this leads into my review... OK, about the lyrics: I don't know what these other reviewers were listening to when they rated this trash five stars, but from what I heard in this album, \\"Ready to Die\\" is nothing but hate and oppression.  I'm sure Biggie would like to say otherwise (but he can't since he was shot)... um yet there's no denying lyrics like 'You should be glad I MADE you MY wife' are VERY degrading in the context he uses them in.  Oh, and by the way, the song that contains those lyrics is actually called \\"Me & My B**ch\\" (that's what it's called, please do not edit that), so there's no denying Biggie was a hate-filled misogamist.  Geez, people, what is it with rappers constantly claiming ownership of \\"their\\" \\"women\\"?  You can't own people, and you'd think these types of \\"Gangstas\\" would be against ownership of other human life, but they're not.     <BR> <BR>Just remember, rappers: You are what you are, NOT what you own.<br />There ya go... Thanks for reading!

B000003S0B|5.0|Until now (07/2002), I own three King Crimson records: In The Court Of The Crimson King, In The Wake Of Poseidon and Starless & Bible Black. I prefer the Red era line-up, with John Wetton singing. But, regardless he isn't here In The Wake Of Poseidon, I must say that Greg Lake does a really great job too. This is my favourite one yet. It doesn't compare either to the classical In The Court.., but it has something more, be it in the lyrics or in the melodies, offering something new. It includes the awesome \\"Pictures of a City\\", who mixes guitar combined with a good portion of sax and Lake's psychedelic manner of singing. Besides that, the album offers a rock song in the way Crimso play at \\"Cat Food\\" (Also released as a single) and the frightening instrumental \\"The Devil Triangle\\" (Foremost known as \\"Mars\\"), whom instruments are some mellotron and drums only. <BR>Gordon Haskell surprises singing in \\"Cadence And Cascade\\", not to mention that he would follow singing in the whole Islands album too. <br />It's really tough to classify this as King Crimson's best, but if not possible, all I can say is that it is a great piece of a work from the best band of all times. And I really mean it.
B00005B36H|5.0|This is the third Tool Album I have bought.  It is as good as (if not better) than Aenima.  The reason I take slight preference to Later Alus is because of the theme &quot;Enlightenment&quot; that I hear in almost all of it's songs (and on the cover).  In a way, this CD acts not like 12 songs, but as one song.  If you listen to every song in order, then it is as though you are listening to one song or story.  After listening to Aenima for the first time, I had to get on Quake 3 and frag someone before I tore up my room; it filled me with a sort of rage that I couldn't suppress.  Later Alus does the opposite.  After listening to it, I felt as though my mind had just come out of one of those health spas.  It felt refreshed, focused, and full of vigor.  I am keen on this theme of &quot;enlightenment&quot; simply because I am a Unitarian.  Enlightenment is sort of the whole theme behind Unitarianism, and Later Alus is sort of like a CD that puts enlightenment into 50 minutes of euphoric music that no music fan should be without.  If you like music, and don't mind electric guitar music, then please do yourself a favor and BUY THIS CD.  If you are a Tool fan, but are unsure wether to get this CD, I urge you to get it.  For approximately the first month, I thought I had wasted my money.  But then I listened to it more, and suddenly it started clicking in my brain.  Since then it has become my favorite.  Listen to it from front to back, you will see what I mean :)
B000066AXC|4.0|Oh my goodness! A lovely movie right from the very beginning! The amazing soundtrack to the film seems to suck you straight into the plot, which begins with young Mathematician John Nash (Russel Crowe)on his first day at Princeton University. Everything starts when he meets his room mate. This is strange because Nash specifically said that he didn't want one. However, that turns out to be no matter because Nash and his roomie (Paul Bettany, who does a great job, only wish there could have been more of him) get on very well.<br />Nash saves his spiraling Princeton career with a mathematical theory which he applies to picking up girls in the bar with his friends. As a result, he is secured a job at a government office along with two of his pals from college.<br />While at a class that he is unwillingly teaching, Nash meets his future wife. (Jennifer Connelly, who'd only been mostly popping up in supporting roles until this film)Everything seems perfect until a zealous, and perhaps crazy, government worker gives him an undercover job breaking \\"Soviet Codes\\". Here you begin to wonder. Can we trust that all of this is real? It turns out that we cannot. Nash has an incident giving a lecture, and his wife commits him to a mental hospital, where he is diagnosed with schizophrenia. The rest of the film chronicles how Nash overcomes his problem and goes on to win the Nobel Prize.<br />About the only complaint that I have about this movie is Crowe's West Virginia accent that he dons when playing Nash. There are several points during the film where the lines are garbled just a tad, and makes it hard to understand. The other thing that I have is that when the older Alicia is shown, well, she doesn't look like an older version of her character. She looks...like Jennifer Connely with Gray hair. A bit of a dissapointment, considering that the rest of the makeup in the film is wonderfully done. But, other than that, this film is great. It is beautiful, it is amazing, and, most importantly, it is interesting. If you're up for an intellectual film, this is the one to watch.

I had already learned most of what was in here in my years of exploring MANY spiritual traditions while I was trying to find a faith that answered my spiritual questions.<br />If you have not walked down the many far eastern paths (as I have), you will probably find this book VERY enlightening, and help you live your life in a conscious manner.<br />Personaly; I believe a study of Zazen from Zen Buddhism will assist more than this book about living in the present; Two Bears.<br />Wah doh Ogedoda (We give thanks Great Spirit)
B00003CXI1|1.0|I was disappointed with the movie. Granted the movie wasn't made for adults, but a good movie should be able to hold the interest of both adults and children. My first problem with the movie was the stiff acting by the three leads. I especially wanted to hit the fast forward button everytime the read-headed kid tried to emote. My second problem was the direction, or lack thereof. When I heard that Chris Columbus was chosen as the director, I was skeptical that the movie would be any good. I was right. The directions had no sense of excitement to them. Given the high publicity that the movie received during the pre-production process, it was disappointing that the producers didn't come up with more talented director, screen writer and actors.
6305622930|5.0|This cinematic character study benefitted from the perfect casting of George C. Scott in the title role.  There has seldom been a more remarkable marriage of an actor with a role.  For most people, George C. Scott is George S. Patton, and George S. Patton is George C. Scott.  The result is a great film.  AFI ranks it at number 89 on their list of the top 100 American films, but that is a gross injustice.  The film deserves to be in the top 50, at least.<br />Viewing this again, I noticed an interesting fact: Dwight D. Eisenhower is never on the screen, despite the fact that in real life Ike and Patton were good friends, met frequently and occasionally stayed up all night talking things out.  In the movie, Ike's thoughts are communicated by letter, or through Gen. Omar Bradley (Karl Malden) or Ike's chief of staff, Gen. Bedell Smith.  This was a clever tactic, however.  Since Ike and Douglas MacArthur were arguably the only two American generals who emerged from the war more famous than Patton, having Ike onscreen might have been distracting.  There is one star in this show, and it is Patton.<br />This movie tells the story of how Patton, an authentic military genius--perhaps the only one to emerge from U.S. military during the war--was not utilized as well as he should have been, because he was a miserable politician.  It makes you wonder, as did a previous reviewer, whether a man like Patton, a \\"pure warrior\\" as the Germans so correctly labeled him, could even be promoted very high in today's bureaucratic, politically correct army.  As Patton himself wrote, \\"Men, even so called great men, are wonderfully weak and timid.  They are too damned polite.  War is very simple, direct, and ruthless.  It takes a simple, direct, and ruthless man to wage war.\\"  If timid, weak, and polite men were a problem in WWII, and this film shows that they were, think how bad the problem is today.  Thank God we're the only superpower left, and that we're so much stronger than all the other nations that we'll never again need a man of Patton's calibur.<br />On the technical side, this disc looks great.  The movie was one of only two movies shot in Dimension 150, a camera that actually captured 150 degrees, an enormously wide angle, and even the edges are perfectly focused.  The letterbox, widescreen format is the only acceptable version, and the larger the screen the better.  The sound is a bit spotty, with dialogue difficult to hear without being blown out of the room by sound effects accompanying tanks and planes.  Best to watch with the remote in hand.  I noticed that the 5.1 soundtrack worked alot better on my system than the dolby surroundsound.<br />There is a second disk with the excellent Jerry Goldsmith sound track and a \\"making of\\" documentary.  The documentary is very weak.  We hear audio clips from George C. Scott and director Franklin J. Schaffner, but they are not interviewed onscreen.  If it was going to be a tribute to Schaffner, as it purported to be, he should have had plenty of screen time, and they should have mentioned (and shown clips of) his other works, such as Planet of the Apes.  Worst of all, we are treated to Oliver Stone's lunatic ravings about how \\"Patton\\" indirectly caused the Cambodian genocide.  Good grief! If you have only 45 minutes of material, make a 45 minute documentary.  It wouldn't surprise me if this is why future editions of this DVD have dropped the second disc altogether.

B00003CXI1|5.0|Chris Columbus has made a masterpiece its not just harry potter that makes the movie the movie makes harry potter. This is a very good movie even for people that don't like the harry potter books because it offers everything action, suspence, writing, charcter devolpment, cienmatography, music, this movie has everything a fantasy is suppose to have. Its a brillent film and its been campared by some to be the  wizard of oz of or time in my opinion its better than wizard of oz it has more depth than what wizard oz had. Its a great film for the whole family and is one of the best movies I have seen in the last few years.

B000063DS1|5.0|God..I can only imagine the feeling of being at the Winterland that night!  I would have rather been at The Last Waltz than Woodstock, Monterey, and Isle of Wight combined.  The heart and emotion that comes through in these four discs is absolutely unequaled anywhere else.<br />  The Band's solo performances sparkle, especially on the DVD, where the sound is breathtakingly astounding.  They put so much heart in to every performance here.  \\"Cripple Creek\\", a song they no doubt had become sick of performing after nearly 10 years gets beefed up with a little [snap] and vinegar with Levon giving it everything he has got.  \\"The Night/Old Dixie\\" also gets that wonderful horn treatment and gets turned from the somber tale of the album to a huge emotional release.  The Band's readings of their fabled catalog have never sounded better...and that is just the tip of the iceberg!<br />   The guest appearance are every bit as exciting.  Where else could you hear Robbie Robertson hold his own against ol' slowhand Eric Clapton on \\"Farther on Up The Road\\".  Dr. John's \\"Such A Night\\" is also a treat.  I am torn by who is the best as far as guests, Van Morrison's fevered preacher reading of his classic \\"Caravan\\" or Dylan playing with his boys one last time on a string of tunes. Dylan's set seems to have alot more meaning, he actually seems excited by playing with these fellasm and on the DVD, he actually smiles!!!<br />     This, along with the DVD is essential american rock music.  Not a sluggish moment in either, hell...even Neil Diamonds performance is exquisite!

6305327041|3.0|I have only watched it once, maybe I should see it again to be fair.  But I kept waiting for something to tie everything together, but with the exception of Roth and one actress who appears in more than one segment, these are stand-alone pieces.  The first one was just stupid and really had no pay-off (there should have been some kind of ironic twist on this one - be careful what you wish for!).  The second one was mildly entertaining.  THE THIRD ONE WAS EXCELENT with the two kids stealing the entire movie! QTs segment was OK as it built a nice tension that was missing from the rest of the movie.  If nothing else, rent it for the third story!
B000002LK1|5.0|I hate comparing DM albums, as I feel that every one has its own unique appeal, but I must say that Violator is one of the most powerful DM albums that I've ever had the pleasure of listening to.  It is some of Martin Gore's absolute best songwriting in my opinion.  It's a very dark album yes; but not in a silly, artificial, teenage angst sort of way.  Instead, it's disturbingly real, piercing, and at the same time strangely uplifting.  Not one song on the entire album comes anywhere near \\"filler,\\" and each melds seemlessly into the next.  Both Gahan's and Gore's vocal are superb as usual (Gahan's voice on 'Clean' is especially gut-wrenching).  And if you've never heard DM before, don't rush to judgement!  Listen through multiple times, allowing yourself to be enveloped in the sound.  I could go on ad nauseum...so just buy the CD!  You'll never regret it.  :-)   Viva Depeche Mode!
B00005T30L|5.0|This film is simply stunning, and I want to emphasize the word simply. There is not a movie in recent memory that I have seen that has packed such a dramatic punch without being as simple as Ghost World. No pretensiously complicated storyline, just an excellent film. The amazingly beautiful and talented Thora Birch gives her best performance as Enid in this movie. Yes, I loved her in this movie even more than in American Beauty. Steve Buscemi also puts on his best performance as the reclusive, yet likeable Seymour. This movie really makes you care about the people you are seeing on the screen. Terry Zwigoff really captured true suburban life for many characters - an eccentric art teacher, a troubled father, a class full of mundane art students, a phony high school friend, a waiter nicknamed &quot;Weird Al&quot; - all people of which you wish you could know more of in this movie. Going back to the simplicity of this film, Ghost World tells you a whole lot without showing you everything. A tip: watch it with a friend, you might feel lonely after the movie if you're by yourself.
B000066NW0|5.0|This was such an amazing CD. Avril writes, plays, and sings her own music, at the age of 17! She's not afraid to say what she wants to, not willing to simpfy her thoughts just for the sake of the common mass, and its these qualities that make this CD a hit! Her music isn't exactly punk...with the exception of maybe the [flavor of the weak-ish] &quot;Sk8ter Boi,&quot; but all of it rocks!! Anyone growing up in a small town will have no trouble comprehending the message she's trying to get across in &quot;My World,&quot; and teens will realize, as they jam to her music, that her lyrics ring true and this will score a massive touch-down for Avril Lavigne. True, her lyrics are a bit awkward at times, but this awkwardness truely makes her CD unique, and gives it something extra, in times of interesting-ness. In my opinion, awkward lyrics suits the moods of a teen, and definitely suits this CD.
B00005NTNM|4.0|In this third chapter from the Book of Dirty Harry Callahan, there's plenty of action as Harry breaks in a new partner and goes after a ruthless bunch, some self-proclaimed revolutionaries who are nothing more than common criminals, in \\"The Enforcer,\\" directed by James Fargo, and starring Clint Eastwood and Tyne Daly.  And beyond the action, it's a film that manages to make a valid statement about bureaucratic nonsense, as well as the lack of common sense employed by those ensconced in the budding agenda of \\"political correctness,\\" who put an emphasis on image over purpose and results.  Mostly, though, it gives the audience a chance to share vicariously in the triumph of good over evil, as Harry once again metes out justice in his own inimitable way.<br />After taking charge and cleaning up a hostage situation in a way that only \\"Dirty Harry\\" can, Harry (Eastwood) is assigned to a desk job in personnel.  But when his partner, Frank DiGiorgio (John Mitchum) goes down on the job during the robbery of a munitions warehouse, Harry is back on the street, but with a new partner, Kate Moore (Daly), one of the first female inspectors in the country.  And Harry puts her through her paces as they attempt to track down this particularly volatile gang, who seemingly put little value on human life as they cut their swath through the city of San Francisco and pursue their own \\"for the people\\" agenda, which in reality means they want to get their hands on as much cash as possible, and plan to hold the city hostage to do it.  But they had better think again; because when they took down Frank, they inadvertently provoked the ire of Inspector Callahan himself, who does not take kindly to their sort to begin with.  <br />James Fargo is in the director's chair for this one, and he comports himself well, recapturing all of the attitudes and elements that made the first two \\"Dirty Harry\\" films so successful.  Fargo sets a good pace and keeps the story on at least an equal footing with the action, which keeps this one involving.  Giving Harry a female partner puts some added interest into the mix as well, in light of the fact that this film was made in an era in which women were just beginning to emerge in such positions, on the screen or otherwise.  \\"Cagney and Lacey,\\" for instance, was still some five or six years away, and Kathleen Turner's \\"V.I. Warshawski\\" wouldn't make an appearance until 1991.  Initially,  the film takes something of a patronizing attitude toward her, but Harry treats her as an equal from the beginning, and in the end, Inspector Moore emerges as a strong character, gender aside.  Most importantly, that is not the focus of the filmmakers here, and the fact that Moore is a woman is little more in the overall scheme of things than a footnote in cinematic history; Moore is just another character in the \\"Dirty Harry\\" saga, and she's a good one (especially when compared to Harry's partner, Al Quan-- played by Evan C. Kim-- in \\"The Dead Pool\\").  And credit Fargo with insuring that it all blends together naturally within the context of the story, as well as the fact that he keeps the relationship between Callahan and Moore on task, and allows it to develop quite credibly.  All in all, it's a good, collaborative effort from all concerned.<br />What really gives this one that ring of authenticity, however, is that Clint Eastwood is in top form, and even in his third outing as Harry seems more immersed in the character than ever.  And, in the final analysis, story aside, it's the \\"Dirty Harry\\" character that makes these films so popular and successful.  Creating a cinematic icon is no easy task, and that's precisely what Eastwood has done with Harry; and it's gratifying to see that he is willing to give that 110% at this stage of the game, in order to maintain the credibility of the character and the films, as well.  A lesser actor would have taken this kind of success to the bank by now, while possibly allowing the character to slip into caricature rather than being concerned with keeping it real and convincing.  It demonstrates what a pro Eastwood is, and why he commands the kind of respect afforded him within the industry.<br />Taking on the role of Kate Moore had to be a challenge for Tyne Daly, and happily, she succeeds quite well with it.  She makes her character convincing by allowing her to develop in a \\"real time\\" manner; she doesn't just jump in there, full blown and ready to take on hardened criminals.  Initially, she displays some intimidation in Harry's presence, which gives their relationship some realism from the beginning.  After all, Harry IS an intimidating guy; add to that the fact that this is a new job for Moore, which in reality would create a level of discomfort for anyone, anywhere.  And Daly has tapped into all of that with her portrayal of Moore, making her a very believable character, and one of the most memorable from among the five \\"Dirty Harry\\" films.<br />The supporting cast includes Harry Guardino (Lt. Bressler), Bradford Dillman (Capt. McKay), DeVeren Bookwalter (Bobby Maxwell), John Crawford (The Mayor), Samantha Doane (Wanda) and Albert Popwell as \\"Big\\" Ed Mustapha (look for Popwell in the original \\"Dirty Harry\\" as the Bank Robber; in \\"Magnum Force\\" as pimp J.J. Wilson; and again in \\"Sudden Impact\\" as one of Harry's partners, Horace).  A well made and entertaining film, \\"The Enforcer\\" keeps the \\"Dirty Harry\\" series alive, well and on solid ground; in retrospect, it seems a shame now that Eastwood waited seven years to make the next installment, \\"Sudden Impact,\\" as with the dreadful \\"The Dead Pool\\" in 1988, it all ended with barely a whimper.  The first four, however, more than make up for it-- and that's the magic of the movies.

I started to grow fond of her but nothing until this album came out.  The hit single blew up the charts here and gave Kylies album a rank of number 3 on the billboard charts.  This was a shocker but it was expected with a smash hit.  Needless to say the album is great.  It has some really fast paced dance songs like more more more, in your eyes, and the second single love at first sight.  This is a must get for your dance collection.

1559408898|5.0|The first Robocop is definitely the best and the Criterion Edition only makes it better. Yeah it's a little on the expensive side for only a couple more minutes of features. But if you're a fan of this movie it's worth the money.<br />Peter Weller makes the perfect cop turned perfect robotic cop in this science fiction thriller. The gore factor is typical of Verhoven and can detract from the film if visions of blood get you queasy easily. But if not the film has some interesting deep seeded messages brought out through the commentary. Who would know that Robocop is actually a Christ figure? I thought those literary images only popped up in high school novels.<br />Anyways, classic action sci-fi film, a must for any true action collection.

B00000JMOJ|5.0|Words cannot express my feelings about this film. One of the first rated R films that I saw it got me started on my Schwarzenneger run and solidified him as a classic action hero in my eyes.<br />Set in the future of a society controlled by television. An American Gladiators gone to death match TV show dominates the ratings. Using criminals as their contestents an audience is able to watch justice carried out on live television. That is until Schwarzenegger, Ben Richards, is falsely accused and put on the TV show.<br />If you like the movie then I would also reccomend that you read the book that it is based on by Richard Bachman. It expands on the ideas of the movie and has a great ending.

B000065U1N|5.0|Having not read the book, I watched the movie in hopes to learn more about this conflict and the ensuing nightmare for the U.S. forces engaged in the operation.<br />Wether you agree or disagree as to the U.S. involvement in this struggle, the loss of 300,000+ lives due to starvation would make any red blooded American's blood boil and demand U.S. assistance in this ordeal.  A lot of people say that we (U.S.) gets involved in issues that aren't any of our business, but I differ in this regard.  If we (Americans) sat silent while a country is obliterated so violently then we would not be the America that our soul foundation is based upon.<br />I view this movie from two fronts (1) its a movie about the U.S involvement in Mogadishu and (2) the tale of the heroic soldiers of Delta Force and the Rangers.  These men go into the most dangerous conflicts in the world without question, they defend our (U.S.) interets and do it with honor.  <br />This movie delivers in both regards, it justifies our involvement at a high level and then depicts the heroisim of Delta and the Rangers in \\"arguably\\" the most intense fire fight since the vietnam war.<br /><spoiler coming up, don't read if you don't want to><BR>This movie provides a very emotional roller coaster. I had a lump in my throat the size of a baseball when two Delta Force Snipers MSGT Gary I. Gordon and SFC Randall D. Shughart injected themselves at the second Black Hawk crash site to provide protection to the wounded in what was surley a no win situation.  They gave their lives defending their brothers in what has to be a most selfless act I have witnessed.  They both received the medal of honor posthumeously.<br />I am now going go read the book which I hope goes into greater detail than that movie could.<br />I would suggest watching this movie with your children (appropriate age) because of the graphic nature.  But our children need to understand how important our country is and why men and women defend our country.

0451169514|5.0|I have read every book Stephen King has ever written, and this is probably my favorite.  It has everything you could possibly want in a book -- it is filled with characters that move you (good and bad), the story is phenomenal, and it scares the [daylights] out of you. All in all, this is one of the most captivating stories I have ever read -- it is long, but in a good way.  You don't want the book to end.  In addition, unlike many long, excellently written stories, the ending to this book does not disappoint.  After all the build-up, you wonder whether the end of this book will really deliver, but it does.  The book is truly amazing.  If you are a Stephen King fan, this is King at his absolute best.  But don't watch the movie -- it does not hold a candle to the book.
0805062971|5.0|Books that take no prisoners are the kind that are likely to upset people in search of a happy ending. Shakespeare specialized in the tragedy and killed hundreds with the stroke of a pen. Rarely in Shakespeare to you find a happy ending, or even any type of real catharsis. Welcome to the mindset of Chuck Palahniuk, and his first novel, a book that was made for the manic imagination of director David Fincher, &quot;Fight Club&quot;. First and foremost, this is thought-provoking stuff that doesn't even come out of left field--we aren't even in the same sport. Palahniuk's emphasis on raw violence and healing qualities contained within the wounds inflicted on our persons, as well as brilliance in dialogue, character study, and wonderfully sneaky foreshadowing (&quot;How much can you really know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?&quot; Took me a long time to understand the real slyness in these words.) make &quot;Fight Club&quot; one of the most original books I've ever read.<br />The entire novel, written in first person, focuses around an insomniac, unhappy in his life, his job; material comfort means absolutely nothing, despite how much time he's meticulously devoted to furnishing his apartment. The narrator finds comfort in the most unlikely of places: Support groups for various diseases he doesn't even have. This lasts for years until someone else develops the same kind of addiction: The chain-smoking Marla Singer. His support group comfort ruined, he finds solace in the presence of a stranger named Tyler Durden, and together, using the healing properties of violence, form Fight Club. They establish the rules, organize the place and time, and let the blood flow. The problem comes, of course, when Fight Club comes out of the basement and becomes an underground pseudo-political movement called Project Mayhem. Run solely under the direction of Tyler, who is now banging Marla on a regular basis, Project Mayhem's plans continue to spiral out of control, inflicting damage on a near global scale.<br />There's not much more to say about &quot;Fight Club&quot; without giving away a great deal, other than to say it's extraordinarily original thinking put down on paper in almost poetically-crafted sentences. Palahniuk's vision not only translates well in print, it was converted even more wildly on the big screen, in David Fincher's outstanding adaptation of a terrific first novel from one of the more interesting authors I've ever read. This is one for your own collection.icting damage on a near global scale.<br />There's not much more to say about &quot;Fight Club&quot; without giving away a great deal, other than to say it's extraordinarily original thinking put down on paper in almost poetically-crafted sentences.

B00005JKJA|5.0|The most complicated film of 2001, Lynch's Mulholland Dr. is brilliant, surreal, and hypnotically gripping. <br />Mulholland Dr. is one of the few movies that won't let you just sit down and ignore it. It involves you so utterly, and requires your attention all the way...similar to 2001's second most complicated film, Memento. Like Memento, Mulholland Dr. is a movie that assumes from the beginning that the audience is intelligent enough to get what happens. The difference between Memento and Mulholland Dr.? In Memento's case, everything is explained at the end. In Mulholland Dr., you don't get the luxury of an explanation. <br />The majority of the movie plays out much like a film noir. The movie is set up at the beginning with the car accident, and proceeds to play out eerily, set off by an old couple who seem so happy, it's almost chilling. The characters all seem to be somewhat cliche'd, but there is a reason for this. Then, suddenly, the movie takes an unexpected turn close to two hours into the movie, a point in the movie in which many may sit in their seats and utter one word collectively. &quot;HUH?&quot; <br />In fact, for this last thirty minutes or so, things just seem utterly confusing. The director tries to help with some small clues (whenever he zooms in on an object, that should be a hint that that is a clue), but the majority will not figure out the brilliance of the movie, even after the credits are finished rolling. Unfortunately, there will be those that just walk out, and won't even bother thinking about it. That is a large percentage of the audience, and these people will unfortunately walk away from this movie hating it, and never knowing the utter genius of this piece of art. There will be another percentage of the audience that will love it, but never understand it. And finally, there will be that audience that will hopefully try to figure out the answers, and will get the full impact of the movie. As well, for some this movie may just simplybe too weird to like - which is perfectly understandable. Like Moulin Rouge, this is an acquired taste. <br />Don't be afraid to check the internet after this movie. If you don't get the movie right after, remember this: YOU ARE NOT ALONE. A famous example would be Roger Ebert, who in his review hinted that he thought the entire movie was just a bunch of random images thrown together (it is not, everything fits together), yet he still loved it all the same. <br />Beautiful performances enhance this haunting puzzle. Laura Elena Harring has this quality to her that just seems to engross the viewer...it's hard to explain, but when she talks, it feels like she's one of those classic movie stars you see in the brilliant old film noirs. And Naomi Watts...she was just amazing. There is one part in the film when she auditions for a part in a movie, and her entire demeanor transforms, and she is suddenly an entirely different person...sure to become a classic scene. <br />This is a movie that requires you to rack your brain afterwards to figure out just what the hell happened in the last two and a half hours. It's even more of a mystery than Memento, because the movie won't tell you the answers. Hell, it took me forever, and I figured out some of the puzzle, but it took a trip onto the computer and the internet, before I fully understood what happened in the movie. <br />And when I did understand what happened in the movie, I was in awe. It's probably not going to hit you as hard as Memento, but it is equally as complex as Memento in some ways. Many have accused Memento of having no heart, and of being a movie that shows no emotion. Even though I disagree with those accusations, Mulholland Dr. is like Memento with a heart. David Lynch shows us in this movie the very heart of the human soul, and could almost be labelled a character examination, as it reveals to us the hopes, losses, and dreams of one woman in a truly gripping experience. <br />Reviewer's note: By the way, asa sidenote, Deep River, Ontario is a real place, and in fact, I lived there for about ten years.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Everyone thinks that they know what music is.  Everyone thinks that there idea is the right way.  Critics of the strokes say that they ripped off the pixies, and half a dozen other bands.  How dare they say that when all we have to listen to today is Brittany Spears and Creed nock offs.  You say, \\"Well they think they are the saviors of Rock and Roll.\\"  No, rock and roll died about 30 yeasr ago.  The Strokes, Oasis, and The Black Crowes were just born in the wrong generation.  One thing is for certain though, The Strokes are very refreshing and you can't hear that anywhere else.  They might not be the best musicians out there but its a lot better than the pop b.s. of MTV.
B00005YXZH|2.0|As with The Strokes &quot;Is This It?&quot; in 2001, Wilco has been blessed as the magazines' &quot;Critics Darling of 2002&quot; award thus far this year.  In an era of younger music fans who are constantly force-fed corporate-bred McMusic, it's no wonder that so many listeners simply accept something different as their gold.  The music and vocals on this album are sub-par.  If you want to hear a good &quot;alt-country-rock album,&quot; try Crosby Stills Nash and Young's &quot;Deja Vu.&quot;  Save your money on this garbage.  If you want something similar to this in a much better ingredient form, try &quot;Harvest&quot; by Neil Young, &quot;Dry&quot; by PJ Harvey, or Pavements &quot;Slanted and Enchanted.&quot;<br />Over and out ...
B000067CPX|5.0|This CD is incredible. It blew me away the first time I heard it. I liked Californication, but this is at least twice as good. I can see some die-hard RHCP fans being dissapointed at first with this CD because it represents a big change for the band. It is more mellow than anything they've done before, but still contains some of that signature funk sound. Even in the catchy songs they still maintain that RHCP punk-funk attitude which keeps them from sounding too \\"poppish\\". They experiment with new sounds and melodies and somehow manage to create something as good and relevant as anything they've done in the past 20 years. The way the arrange the vocal melodies is a breakthrough, borrowing from the Beach Boys and Mamas and the Papas at their best.  On several numbers they sound a bit like the Beatles in their experimental years. This CD is so consistently good, that I'd say about 14 of the 16 tracks are very good, quite a few are excellent. Upon first listen I could tell this was something special, easily one of the year's best rock albums.
B000063DS1|5.0|As an owner of the original LW CD, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this collection. Well worth it, even if you have the first release. <br />However...<BR>Be very careful with the lousy way the CD's rest in the &quot;box&quot;. ONE day after purchase, I dropped three CD's out of the box while carrying it on a sidewalk. They are now worthless. I pleaded my situation to the distributor's online customer service thingy. The kind folks at Rhino Records were then very helpful to point out the simple process of replacing them via credit card through their online store.
B000067CPX|5.0|If you would have played a track from this album ten years ago and told me the Chili Peppers would one day sound like this, I would laugh in your face. By the Way is like no album the Chili Peppers have put out. It is deeply mellotic, and there isnt a pure funky or \\"rap-rock\\" song on the album. This may seem bad, but its not, its just different. Different doesnt mean worse, but it doesnt mean \\"better\\" either. Different means the Chili Peppers have take another huge step forward.<br />By the Way shows how the band has grown, and changed. A first listen to the album may leave the listener craving something, for they're used to the old Peppers. You may crave a bad ... bass line from Flea, or Anthony rapping to a funk beat.  But this album seems to grow on you. Kiedis hardly raps the whole time, its purely singing, and its wonderful. The mellotic sound of the album shows off John's top-notch guitar work.<br />All in all, By the Way gets just about as far away from Blood Sugar ... Magik as the Peppers can. And altough its almost impossible to compare it with their best work, By the Way is as good as Blood Sugar in its own way.
B00006690G|5.0|Eminem's back, with also the same attitude and style from his previous albums, but I didn't imagine that he would have more sensitive side with the track, \\"Hailie's Song\\" than \\"Stan\\" from his previous album. \\"Hailie's Song\\" is a song that should be a single in near future.  He sings and he says that \\"he can't sing\\", but this guy can sing well.  When I heard this track in a form of mp3, it touched my heart and actually few drops of tears came down from my eyes.  As a kid lover, I have one six year old girl that I love and cherish and adore just like Eminem loves his daughter to death.  The girl I love means so much to my life, and listening to this song brightens my day when I come back home from my camp job everyday.  Recommend this CD and track to people who listens to Eminem, or even people who love songs that is meaningful and full of emotions.
0380820846|5.0|I don't consider myself an expert on literary matters, but I read A LOT of romance novels (mostly regencies), and I LOVED this book.  Books in a series do not always live up to the anticipation, but Colin and Penelope's story surpassed my expectations.  <br />Colin is just the sweetest thing!  I love how different from his brothers he is.  It is obvious that Julia Quinn becomes immersed in her characters and story lines because this book, the fourth Bridgerton story, shows that the entire series was thought out to perfection.   <br />Julia Quinn's Bridgerton series is now at the TOP of my list with Stephanie Lauren's Cynsters and Johanna Lindsey's Malorys.  I will eagerly await Eloise's story in early 2003, because I know that I won't be disappointed...
B000065U1N|1.0|Two hours of shooting, killing and blood squirting. Not suitable for family viewing. Even though this movie may have some factual background, the storyline flatlined.
B000067CPX|5.0|So I heard the song By the Way about 2 months ago. and was totally happy about it. So when i bought the album, i thought it would compare to Californication. Maybe even rival it. Now, listening to it, its completely different than anything the Peppers have ever done in their career. Yes, it still has the signature RHCP sound, but its a lot deeper musically and lyrically than any of their previous work. with Californication they brushed only the surface of what they could really be. but with By the Way, i think they are coming into a deeper realization of what they can become. I think they are the Beatles of our era.<br />Now, i doubt everyone is going to like this, but i think that a lot of old school peppers fans will like and im sure that they will be gaining a whole slough of fans that havent liked them before. <br />So to sum up this album in a few words:<br />This is the embodiment of the career of the Red Hot Chili Peppers summed up in 16 great songs. Think California, deserts, driving with the windows open along with your best friends,<br />and you get By the Way
B000065U1N|5.0|Everything positive about this movie has been stated repeatedly. Having read the book and the online articles from the Philadelphia Enquirer, I was disappointed that some things that happen in war were not shown. This was probably a result of the U.S. Armed Forces involvement. What I am referring to is women getting shot, and children getting shot. The enemy hiding behind women while shooting, and children sitting on the shooters. I am sure with special effects, the results of being hit by a .50 calibre machine gun could be shown. The purpose is not that I am blood thirsty, but the devastating effects of the bullets would be very illuminating. The closest I have seen any of these factors illustrated was Rules of Engagement with Samuel Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones. I know that Delta Force is not supposed to exist, but I think that the movie should have shown the differences between the younger Rangers and older Delta Force. Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie. I am just waiting to buy the director's edition.
0446677450|5.0|This is one of the best series I have ever read! I am 17 and saw my dad reading this book and had no clue what something titled &quot;Rich Dad Poor Dad&quot; would be about and really didn't care about finding out. He encouraged me to read it after he finished and I am so glad that I did! I have so much time ahead of me and have already questioned whether or not I want to work for someone else. I now plan to &quot;mind my own business&quot;, which is a concept discussed in this book. <br />I am not getting my mom, who has zero financial literacy or interest to read this book. The great thing about it is that it is written as a story. It doesn't bore you with P/E ratios, or allocation numbers like some financial books. <BR>This book, along with the others in the series will truly change the way you look at money and working for it. I know it did that for me!
B00003CX5P|5.0|There's not much to say, its a great movie with action and adventure. Its got some awesome special features you  should see. buy it
B00003CXI1|2.0|This movie is very good if you haven't read the book. While staying somewhat true to the book i was disappointed.i felt it left out or changed some of the best parts of the book and leaves out some major details from the book.
1559408855|1.0|...would human beings actually sit in their living rooms and watch this, claiming that it has merit simply because it falls under our catch-all notions of \\"art\\" and \\"freedom of speech.\\"<br />Here's a thought experiment...imagine you are watching this flick (with your bowl of popcorn, soda pop, feet up on the coffee table) and an Aborigine walks in. He has never heard political speeches about \\"free speech,\\" never heard the endless spinning about \\"art\\" being a \\"mirror,\\" never bought into the notion that our minds are \\"expanded\\" by subjecting ourselves to such images. All he knows is that you are sitting there, looking at a man forcing a boy to eat feces and sexually molesting him. <br />I would argue that his reaction (completely free of political/intellectual bias) would be astonishment and disgust, and he would probably hope never to run into you again!!! He would wonder why it was portrayed and filmed, why you spent money to buy/rent it, and why you were actually watching it. He would not consider you \\"sophisticated\\"...he'd consider you sick.<br />Healthy cultures have an \\"ethos,\\" an unspoken communal sense of what is \\"okay\\" and what isn't. It has nothing to do with legality or law...nothing to do with censorship...it has everything to do psychology and human nature. Our culture is entirely DEVOID of an ethos...we base what we do and think on whether it's legal or not. Our attitudes have been so skewed and bogged down by ethical relativism that we refuse to be offended by ANYTHING, as we feed our own prurient fascinations and then legitimize it by calling it \\"art,\\" or by referring to it as some sort of existential exercise in repulsion therapy.<br />No doubt my views will be unpopular, but in a world of \\"Salo\\" apologists, why should that bother me?
B00005JKED|1.0|I have a hard time believing that people actually thought that this was a great movie. The story was terrible. I dont think that the acting was great. Finally the ending was completly stupid. Overall this movie is completly overrated. I am still mad i wasted 4 dollars on the rental of this dvd.
B00005QDW1|1.0|On the edge of disposable? If it were any more so the cd would come with a mission impossible-esque self destructive fuse. The world's worst soup (a lil' bit of everything without a mastery of any one part) that is spoiled by too many cooks. Toss in an obnoxious singer with a paper thin voice and you get No Doubt! Wake me when it's over...
B000056V73|1.0|The only thing good about this movie was it promoted drugs,and songs from Elton John, The Who, Led Zepplin, and many more. Other than that it was a waste of time. I've seen better plots than this on V-H1. It is just same old story from other rock and roll movies. (A loser boy that's into rock and roll lands a job with a rock and roll magazine and interviews Led Zepplin wanabes. Plus he meets this sterotypical wild girl that has sex with him plus with a few other girls in the room.) Doesn't that story sound very familar? BORING! Been there. Done that. If anyone is a fan of Rock and Roll, then don't watch this because it makes Rock and Roll sound boring.
B0000028RR|1.0|Since it's still only July 2002 (and this came out Nov.1992),I still have time to call this the most over rated album of the last 10 years. In a few months it will become one of the most over rated albums of the last 15 years. Whew! Thank god I got in under the wire...
0385720920|5.0|Just finished reading this and my jaw is still hanging. SUBVERSIVE, AUDACIOUS, PORNOGRAPHIC, DEEP, POETIC, and down right HILARIOUS. And for those who can see it, extremely ZEN. This is so ZEN!!<br /><br />I got into Chuck like a lot of people did, by seeing FIGHT CLUB and then reading the book. That book was amazing, and this book is a coagulated continuation of the SICK POP CULTURE MIND and America's JUNKED, ADDICTED, AND WARPED CONSUMERIST MENTALITY. I can't wait to read SURVIVOR. My God, this man is quite simply the greatest SATIRIST and POP PSYCHOLOGIST of our time. Or maybe CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST? A Mark Twain for the new millennium? America may be empty and dying psychologically and Chuck Palahniuk spells it all out in horrifically surreal detail. In a very shocking and sadistic manner, is he telling us WHY most of us are disturbed or addicted Americans? Is this a WARNING or the mind of a MADMAN? I'd love to have dinner with this guy, sometime, and find out what makes him tick. \\"Have you studied Zen, Chuck?\\"<br /><br />At this point I don't care. Next to Thomas Pynchon this man could be the greatest living genius writing in America today. Put this man's books in a Time Capsule and people in the 22nd Century may end up saying, \\"No wonder Western Civilization crumbled.\\"<br /><br />What I want to know is, when is the movie coming out? And who's going to direct? David Fincher? Or Ron Jeremy?<br /><br />(...)
0486227073|5.0|After purchasing too many sub-par reference books on anatomy for artists, I highly recommend the Bridgeman books. This one stresses the hinges and joints of the body and how their bending and twisting movements affect the external shape of a figure. Nobody has studied the figure as long or as intensely as George Bridgeman and it shows in the superb illustrations, many apparantly constructed from memory. For economy of line and accurate sence of under-structure, the illustrations can't be beat. Incidently, &quot;Bridgman's Complete Guide to Drawing From Life&quot; incorperates much of the above book, along with several others, and is a better buy. (It's also a larger format book!) <br />I also recommend &quot;The Human Figure: An Anatomy for Artists&quot; by David K. Rubins.
1573225517|1.0|The novel High Fidelity by NIck Hornby is about the protagonist Rob Fleming, a strange man, who tries to figure out why he was left by all of his girlfriends and why esspecially Laura, his last girlfriend, dumped him. Rob also tries to come together with Laura again.<BR>One gets an insight into his everyday life for example about his record - shop or very often also about his weird thoughts.<BR>Rob Fleming has a really strange character:<BR>He is immature although he is already 35 years old and through the whole book one cannot see any maturation. That is why he still behaves like a child.<BR>He is not able to understand his girlfriends at all and one could say that he is a macho.<BR>But I think he fits into the content of the novel, because all the characters in this book are somehow strange and have their special problems.<BR>All in all I have to say that I do not really like the novel High Fidelity, because I just cannot figure out the main plot.<BR>There are a lot of weird thoughts described which Rob has and some passages are funny, but there is not any action at all. The book is just boring. <BR>I do not want to say that everybody has to find it boring, but people who like to read books with a lot of content and action will probably not like High Fidelity.
0806930152|5.0|After purchasing too many sub-par reference books on anatomy for artists, I highly recommend any of the Bridgman books. However, this one is the best of the bunch, as it combines the illustrations of the others in a larger format. Hey, you can spend triple the price of this book on newer books with poorer illustrations on better quality paper, (a.k.a: &quot;Drawing the Human Body&quot; by<BR>Giovanni Civardi -blech!), but for my money, Bridgeman has yet to be beat. An absolute must have for any serious illustrator or figurative painter. <br />I also recomend &quot;The Human Figure: An Anatomy for Artists&quot; by David K. Rubins as a no-nonsence, highly useful anatomy reference. <BR>-CDK
0425107469|5.0|This book is a must read for any Dean Koontz fan. If you like animals (dogs in paticular) you will love this! It captured my imagination like no other book I've read. It will make you scared but also make you laugh and most of all cry!
0871137380|5.0|I picked this book up after reading the Philly newspaper series on the Nightstalkers' website. The book started out when one of the soldiers (Matt Eversmann) touched down on the streets of Mogadishu and found that one of his men was already down, and from that point on I didn't want to put it down. <br />If you see the back cover that mentions hundreds of local people killed by these people, you may think that this is just another glorified US soldier story.. but not so. The soldiers were being what they were, soldiers. They do what they were told, and they had to kill because their own lives were at risk.<br />In an age of individualism, the brotherhood that these men show really stood up. I thought that they would only fight when their own lives are in danger, but their reliance and trust in each other beat the odds (not to mention, the help of the Nightstalker pilots from above). <br />Pick this one up, and see for yourself. And you cannot help but admire the qualities these people show.<br />Nightstalkers, Rangers, Seals, and Delta Force of TFR.. I salute you.

B000067CPX|4.0|The last few years seem to have been the most stable in the turbulent career of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. This seems to be reflected in the vast majority of tracks on this monster  16 track, 68 minute c.d. If I was to try and describe the sound of this c.d. in very brief terms I'd say that many of the tracks on this c.d. remind me of the type of single that came off Californication. It's by far their most accessible c.d. yet. I've listened to it 3/4 times by now and I'm already pretty familiar with most of the tracks. It may come across that I'm finding fault with this album-I'm not it's an excellent c.d., it's just that it's not as funky or hard hitting, cutting edge as some of their previous work. It seems to be more dominated by John Frusicante's amazing versatility as a guitarist then Flea's funky slap bass lines. In fact if your looking for strong bass lines they only really feature on tracks like the excellent debut single 'By The Way', track 7 'Can't Stop' with Kiedis own unique half rap, half singing. 'Throw Away Your Television' which features a dominant bassline, tremendous beat and guitar effects drifting in and out of a terrific song.<br /> One of the things that really comes to the fore on this c.d. is their use of harmony. I mean plenty of Chili songs in the past have featured some glorious harmonies but they occur on nearly every song on this c.d.. They are now the absolute masters of harmonised vocals. The harmonies on By The Way are reminiscent of 'Other Side' from the last album. The most remarkable harmonies occur on the incredible Beach Boy type track 'Tear'. It's a real homage to those sounds of the 60's-harmonies,harpsicord and gentle keyboard a really catchy and memorable  chorus and my favourite moment 2 minutes in when you expect to hear the chorus until it's hijacked by an amazing brief guitar solo. There are just so many potential singles from this album-they could nearly get 6/7 sinlges from it. Many of these tracks are slow to mid tempoones. Tracks like 'Dosed' have a wonderful melancholy beauty about them which seems sort of apt when you see the photo on the back of the album which seems to be a grainy photo of a group in mourning. The vocals on the chorus at times sound quite unlike the Chili's. Track 5 'Don't Forget Me' has a slow rumbling rhythm and builds up to a loud chorus-it's full of wonderful guitar moments and features plenty of Kiedis' unique, brief off key vocals. Track 14 'Minor Thing' is also excellent and the grandiose ending is almost more Alan Parson's then Red Hot Chili Peppers-which I know may sound horrible but I think it really works wells on this track.<br /> There are quite a few newer aspects to the groups sound on this c.d. Firstly lyrically it's all pretty calm stuff and I'd be amazed if it carries one of those Parental Advisory stickers on it. Some tracks are very different. 'Cabron' has a real Mexican flavour to it. 'On Mercury' has a really infectious ska flavour to it. 'Midnight' starts off with the most gentle string section before drifting off into a bluesy late night moody track. Personally I prefer them when they're playing a funkier more cutting edge sound. But it's hard to find a bad song on this c.d.. It has the potential to be their biggest c.d. yet as I think this one will reach to a far wider audience. Well bigger then Californication, that may take some beating.
B00005JKLZ|2.0|This movie is an adaptation of the original 1960 movie.  I watched it in the theater a few months ago.  Guy Pearce plays a time traveler who must go back in time in order to prevent the death of his fiancee.  She was killed the first time by a robber and the second time she was ran over by an automobile.  This segment of the movie somehow was badly made that instead of engrossing the audience with a sense sadness and despair, it turned the movie into a semi-comedy.  The rest of the movie was then the Guy character went into the far future where he must save a docile tribe from a group of carnivores (evolved humans).  Some segments of the movie are confusing.  I think it could have been done a lot better.  Sorry, only two stars for this one.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a hilarious movie.  However, most people consider the movie to be either a classic or crap.  So, although you will probably consider this movie to be a classic, you may not like it at all.  However, if you have seen this movie previously or have seen other work by Monty Python, and you are considering whether to buy the DVD or the video, buy the DVD.  You not only get to watch the movie, but the extras are the best, funniest,and most plentiful of any DVD I have ever seen.  The most notable extras are the theatrical trailer, the Lego \\"Camelot\\" scene, and the educational video on how to use coconuts.  Without a doubt, it is worth the extra money.
1577311523|5.0|Until his thirtieth year, the author writes, he was plagued by anxiety and periods of suicidal depression. Then, in the early hours of a pivotal morning, an inward process occurred that led Tolle into what might be termed a mystical experience, or a series of such experiences, and a profound spiritual transformation, that freed him completely from his suffering. Tolle began to fully understand and live the reality that the unhappy and deeply fearful self that we perceive ourselves to be is \\"ultimately a fiction of the mind.\\"<br />This book is concerned with how to connect and identify with, and to live as, that portion of our consciousness that is beyond our minds or thinking processes, and is the source of bliss, joy, love, peace, and creativity.<br />Tolle asserts that thinking has become a disease. Rather than being merely a useful tool, a person's mind comes to \\"possess\\" him. One beomces convinced that he *is* his mind - a thoroughly destructive delusion.<br />Happily, Tolle explains how to disidentify from the mind, and end the delusion of psychological time, that results in living in the past and the future, rather than the Now, which is the only time that actually exists.<br />This is a very \\"deep\\" book, that attempts to use words and the reader's mind to open doorways to freedom from wordful, mindful thinking, to a perspective and approach to life has obvious appeal and advantages - but that may be very difficult to implement, because it calls for a radical transformation of one's self-concept, curing addictive behaviors, and eliminating habits that have been established for decades.<br />Tolle's work is having a positive impact on individual lives, and seems to have the potential to transform relationships, society, and the world, for the better.<br />Please do not read this book unless you are prepared for the possibility that it will become a \\"bible\\" to you, at least until its work in your life is complete. You may find yourself wanting your own copy, tobe read repeatedly, highlighted, annotated, meditated on, etc. I do urge you to read it - but not without this happy caveat.
0679745203|5.0|This is one of my favorite books!  Ondaatje writes beautifully, and is able to convey so much through just a few carefully chosen words.  The characters in this book are very richly drawn.  It is really a wonderful novel about the human condition.  I just wish Ondaatje would write more often!!!
B000001FFJ|5.0|I heard the gravelly voice and incredible lyrics of Tom Waits for the first time two years ago on a friend's copy of \\"Mule Variations.\\" While my exposure to the wide breadth of his past material and musical evolution has been gradual, I became a fast and devoted fan. \\"Rain Dogs\\" is the third of his albums that I bought, and what a piece of work it is. <br />There's such a variety of sounds on this album - \\"Rain Dogs\\" truly showcases Waits's ability to take any musical style and call it his own. The album starts out with versions of Waits's classic junket band, a sound that first entranced me with the much later \\"Cold Water\\". The first three tracks (\\"Singapore,\\" \\"Clap Hands,\\" and the weird \\"Cemetary Polka\\") are a ramble down the bizzare and dark. The title track lies in the middle of the album, and begins with a melancholy accordian solo, then becomes a delightful romp in the life of the \\"Rain Dogs,\\" who \\"...danced and swallowed the night / For it was so ripe for dreaming.\\" A more country sound is present in the earthy \\"Gun Street Girl\\" and the twangy melancholy of \\"Blind Love.\\" It's an incredibly varied album, yet Waits still fuses it all together somehow.<br />The Uptown Horns, a brash and boisterous quartet of sax, trumpet and trombone players, contributed their talents to most of this album, much to the delight of the listener. There is the instrumental entitled \\"Midtown\\" - an explosion of brass that sounds like it's setting the scene for a private eye flick. For other songs, one or two of the horn players often accompany Waits's vocals. The trombone player of the band contributes to my favorite song on the album, \\"Tango Till They're Sore.\\" This is a delightful piano-and-trombone croon that evokes wee-hour gatherings with friends after a long, staggering night out: \\"Let me fall out of the window with confetti in my hair / Deal out jacks or better on a blanket by the stairs / I tell you all my secrets but I lie about my past / Send me off to bed forevermore...\\"<br/>Waits is an outstanding songwriter and poet, and the lyrics for all the songs on \\"Rain Dogs\\" never fail to be vivid and poignant. Whimsical (\\"Diamonds and Gold\\") or cruel (\\"Ninth &amp; Hennepin\\"), all evoke clear, unusual, and very human images that are unmatched by other songwriters -- no wonder Tom Waits is one of the most covered artists of our time.<br />\\"Anywhere I Lay my Head\\" is last on the list. With the Uptown Horns playing a slow, taps-like accompaniment, Waits croons with his signature voice, \\"I don't need anybody / Because I learned to be alone / And anywhere, anywhere I lay my head, boys / I will call my home.\\" The horn quartet caps it off with a boistrous oom-pahing coda, you can almost see them strutting away down Bourbon Street. Undoubtedly one of the best finishes to an album I've ever heard.
B000067CPX|5.0|I've had this CD for one day...and I've listened to it over and over and I can't find a flaw...from the title track to the last song, it is absolutley the BEST ALBUM RHCP HAS EVER MADE...this is music folks...the band has grown into a solid music machine complete with rock rythms, mixed with R&B, rap, funk, topped by jazz chords and soul melodies...each musician is on top of their game...let's see JLo and Nelly do that, or even come close...<br />Kudos to Warner Brothers & Rick Rubin for recognizing and maximizing this kind of talent. <br />Long live the Chili Peppers. Long live real music. <br />Thanks to the band for inspired, beautiful, pure music.
B00005OWEG|5.0|THIS IS A MUCH BETTER VERSION OF THE CLASSIC MOVIE.  IT IS MORE REALISTIC AND THE STORY IS BETTER TOLD WITH THIS ADDED MATERIAL.
0783225733|5.0|I've stood in the training facility at NASA's Johnson Space Center and had a veteran astronaut tell me that this film is very realistic.  I really enjoyed the way Ron Howard used the C-130 \\"vomit comet\\" aircraft, normally used for weightless training, to simulate the weightless environment astronauts live in.  Well done.  This movie is a must-see.  Also, ... see \\"Astronauts & Other Exciting Careers in Space,\\" a film we made to take young people through an entire space shuttle mission.  We filmed at the Johnson & Kennedy Space Centers and NASA filmed the orbital part of the mission for us.
B00004WG2X|5.0|Agreeing with someone else's review, this is the version for Austen fans. It is the truest to the book, and the overall feeling of Austen's time. After seeing this, the A&amp;E version seems more like lurid soap opera, rather than the subtle satire Austen in fact wrote. I have enjoyed all three film versions, but this one retains my heart. While Austen might have laughed at the notion that Darcy would one day appear in a wet shirt contest, I strongly doubt she ever would have thought to include it.
B000002TQV|5.0|I thought I had taste in music, which I obviously couldn't prove until now, with The Bends. The CD is a masterpiece, which not even Radiohead have been able to replicate since. This music will not appeal to people who enjoy loud rock music or Tool, but for those who enjoy good song-writing and originality.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Baz Luhrman and Craig Pearce co-write a masterful script about truth, beauty, freedom, love, about the Moulin Rouge! Christian, a young poet, played by Ewan McGregor, writes about love, but yet never once has experienced it himself. A group of Bohemian actors plead with him to become their new writer and director. They show him that his words are words of love. In order to put the play, Spectacular! Spectacular!, into production they need to convince Harold Zidler, the impresario of the Moulin Rouge, that it will a hit. That night they take Christian to the underworld of the Moulin Rouge where he meets the courtesan, the Sparkling Diamond, Satine, played by Nicole Kidman. When Zidler organizes a private meeting for Satine and the young poet that is when they fall in love. A jealous duke provides the budget for the play but only if he is promised Satine as his own. A true love story made into a musical with wonderful song and dance truly deserves a category of it's own. With nineteenth century Paris as it's backdrop and familiar twentieth century music, Baz Luhrman finds a way of adding his own special touch as he did in Romeo and Juliet.<BR>Co-starring along side Nicole Kidman (The Others, Eyes Wide Shut, Far and Away) Ewan McGregor (Black Hawk Down, Trainspotting, Shallow Grave) shows his sensitive side in the greatest love story of the year. Luhrman (Rent, Strictly Ballroom) and Pearce (The Seventh Floor, Mad Bomber in Love, Vicious!) make it a comfortable environment for Kidman and McGregor to show there stuff in one of their first singing roles.<BR>Moulin Rouge took time to develop characters but at the same time kept the movie going with a constant rhythm. Using a collage of modern music made this anything but an ordinary musical. Turning simple phrases into beautiful lyrics is how the actors made their on-screen love seem so real. Endless amounts of dance sequences and wonderfully detailed sets and props make this movie a feast for the eyes alone.<BR>Moulin Rouge can make your emotions reach a level they have never been and could touch anyone's soul. For adult and teens looking for an epic love story and just a good movie to watch this would be the one for you.
B000060P79|5.0|I'm a huge music lover... Any music that has a guitar in it is what I listen to. I was surfin' the net a few months back and I saw their video for &quot;I'm Just A Kid&quot; and I loved it... So I got their CD and loved the whole thing. I can relate to the lyrics and the guitar riffs are great. I recently saw them in Portland at &quot;Little Stink 2&quot; and they rocked the joint... I talked to alot of people and they had gone to the concert not even knowing who Simple Plan was and left as big fans and most of them bought their CDs. I highly recommend you get this album if you are into emo/punk or just any kind of punk.
0553260111|4.0|First, let me say right off that if you've seen the movie, you do NOT know the plot of \\"The Bourne Identity\\". The only two things that were taken from Ludlum's book were that the protagonist is an amnesiac who apparently is a living lethal weapon, with all sorts of people trying to kill him; and that the name of the woman he kidnaps and who eventually falls in love with him is named Marie.<br />Beyond that, the plot of the movie is nothing like the plot of the book.<br />I had gotten bored with Ludlum over the last few years, because most of his stories followed the same basic formula - innocent foil uncovers global conspiracy, which then sets out to silence him. Along the way, he picks up an incredibly gorgeous woman; they fall in love and reveal the conspiracy to an astonished world, which rewards him with the life he's always wanted. The guy is always incredibly good-looking, and the woman could pass for Pamela Anderson Lee's twin sister. And both happen to have the exact skills and knowledge required to foil the conspiracy.<br />Maybe the reason I liked \\"The Bourne Identity\\" so much is because I hadn't read any of Ludlum's books in several years, and I'd forgotten how he writes his stories. Whatever the reason, the fact remains that I did like it. Despite the formulaic writing, the story's sequencing is seamless - you don't turn a page and suddenly come on a plot twist straight out of left field. Ludlum also doesn't bother with the hokey secret agent mumbo-jumbo you see in some other spy/action novels.<br />But he doesn't do a good job at all of getting his main characters to talk about their feelings for each other. When it comes to love talk, Ludlum's writing isn't any better than what you'll find in your average Harlequin romance.<br />With all that, though, I'm glad I picked up this book. I even went out and bought the next book in the \\"Bourne\\" sequence - but I think I'll wait a few years to read it.
0345298349|4.0|When GORKY PARK was published in 1981, the Soviet Union was still going on strong. Now with the passage of time the USSR is nothing but a distant memory and the former republics are fighting hard to keep their independence. Reading Martin Cruz Smith's novel now gives a unique perspective to life in this foreign land.<br />We are introduced to Russian Homicide Detective Arkady Renko who is investigating a triple homicide in Gorky Park. All of the victims were shot and they were intentionally disfigured in order to prevent identification. The only clue left on the scene were a pair of ice skates worn by one of the victims that belonged to actress Irina Asanova. Renko must deal with petty bureaucrats, crooked politicians, the KGB as well as his own personal problems with his own wife.<br />Irina knows more than she is telling the detective. Renko is smitten with her and he is not confident about his feelings. The other major player in this novel is an American furrier named John Osbourne. This businessman has strong connections with Soviet officials and it is believed that he is also a KGB informant. Several Russian officials are protecting him but Renko is not to be dissuaded. He will do what he needs to do in order to get to the bottom of this mystery.<br />Cruz's work is very powerful and strong in character development. Each one of the three major characters has a story to tell and the author does a great job in developing each one. It is a story of heartbreak and broken dreams and definitely one of the best novels ever written about Russia.
B00000ILBK|5.0|I've read and heard many people say that &quot;Insurrection&quot; was nothing more than a television episode on the big screen.  I can see and understand how people would think that.  I do not share that opinion.  I believe &quot;Insurrection&quot; was exactly the story and movie that it's creator's wanted it to be.  Patrick Stewart and everybody else involved said from the beginning that &quot;Insurrection&quot; wasn't going to be another &quot;First Contact.&quot;  They wanted to create a movie that had a lot of heart in it with a smaller amount of the action and they did that.<BR>While missing a lot of the heavy duty special effects and action of the previous films, I really enjoyed and continue to enjoy this movie on DVD.  That being said, I can't wait until &quot;Star Trek Nemesis&quot; lands in the theaters on Dec 13th, 2002.
0066620996|5.0|I borrowed this from my public library thinking I'd take a look even though I'd read so much about it already including the Executive Summary!  (I noticed upon returning the book that our library director immediately checked it out.)  This book is well worth the complete read and referring back to; I copied at least a half dozen pages for future reference.  Each chapter ends with its summary points and I really enjoyed the vignettes throughout.  There are pages of real life business experiences that prove the good to great theory; this engaging consolidation of 5 years of research holds many lessons for those willing to learn.
B000065U1N|4.0|I really liked this movie. Well, maybe not liked it, it was heart-wrenching and emotional, and a little painful to watch, just because the film does an exquisite job of painting a picture of strife and shows the stupidity of battle (well, at least that's how the whole atrocity came off to me). Plus it features a really talented actor (Orlando Bloom- more famous as Legolas, the blond archer in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy). It is true that I am a teenage girl and vehement &quot;Orli&quot; enthusiast but this is a very good movie. I recommend it. Also watch for the talented Jason Isaacs. He's just one cool dude, dude.
1878424319|4.0|It is amazing how much better we could feel and those around us, if we could really live by Sr. Ruiz's &quot;simple principles&quot;, but it is easier read than done.  There is nothing new in the knowledge of the power of words, but what is new is the realization of how we fail to see and do what should be common sense to all of us.  After all, if we grasped it all, why are we searching for help to achieve a better, more fulfilled life?  His book is like a good recipe, and although we all have the ingredients required for enlightenment, we don't all have the sight to put it together into actions/words as he has done with his book.  It takes courage to see ourselves in his words and to realize it only takes us to feel better and start a new life.
B00005OCMR|5.0|Twenty years ago I enjoyed Tron in VHS, I didn´t understand many concepts, but the movie had something special. Today, when I´m a computing engineer, all those concepts come clear. This movie is one of the best I´ve ever seen, its magic is still alive, I´m proud to say this is my first DVD. Regards to the Tron Generation.<br />Linuxfan
014028009X|5.0|I read this book in about two days.  The characters are addicting and so incredibly human.  Bridget seems like a great, datable person who just doesn't have much luck.<br />She obsesses over all the things other women obsess about: weight, alcohol and cigarette intake, men; but the way Fielding verbalizes her thoughts are what make this book so amusing.  The way she keeps track of her weight and other information is a laugh too.  You can tell when she's had a bad day because sometimes she won't even list her weight or calories or she'll list the ungodly amount of negative thoughts she's had.<br />Some of the situations seem a bit absurd, but Fielding makes them real and the reader really feels for Bridget and experiences the embarassment with her.<br />I really enjoyed this book and highly recommend it.  It is basically a chick flick in a book, but if you enjoyed the movie, you'll definitely love the book.
B000068QY7|5.0|This is Oasis' best recording since What's the Story (Morning Glory).  The album is a great mixture of rock songs and ballads.  What's better is the fact that Liam, Gem Archer, and Andy Bell also wrote songs for the album.  Noel however writes the best songs which include &quot;Hindu Times&quot; &quot;Force of Nature&quot; and &quot;Stop Crying Your Heart Out.&quot;<BR>   Now many critics have accused the band of constantly ripping off The Beatles and being nothing more than a tribute band.  It's true that they are one of Oasis' biggest influences, but this belief is ridiculous now.  First of all, bands can't help but sound a little like their influences.  Secondly, Oasis could not of written five original albums that have sold well by copying another band.  My suggestion is to take the album for what it is, great music and heartfelt lyrics.
1573225517|5.0|This book was enjoyable from start to finish. The main character Rob, a record store owner and a music freak tells about his relationships to girls and why everyone of them left him. He has a tendency to rate everything in top-five lists. Rob also lists the top-five of most dramatic relationships in his life in the introduction of the book, and then briefly tells about them. He compares his top-five list of girls with his last girlfriend Laura, while he tries to work out his future, and by doing so he shows the reality of growing up, finally, in his thirties. Rob reveals a universal personality allowing everyone to read and to enjoy the book and to be able to compare his own life with Rob's complicated lifestyle.
B00005MP58|5.0|I had to get the DVD because I wore out my VHS copy.  I loved the story when I first read it in the 11th grade and have been hooked since, all the while searching for the quintessential transfer to film.  I found it!  Colin Firth brings so much life to the Darcy character.  I like his interpretation.<br />So if you loved the book I highly recommend this video.
0380820846|4.0|I enjoyed reading ROMANCING MISTER BRIDGERTON; I even laughed aloud at times, but, and it's a big but, there's something missing.  I think that it's depth of characterization and plot.<br />There's not enough meat there to sustain the story.  It's just not a keeper for me.
B000063K2W|5.0|This DVD is a great example of how a classic can shine again with modern technology!  Warner Brothers is to be commended for the great job they did in putting this DVD together.<br />The Women is very crisp and clear with the fashion show glowing in color more beautiful than ever.  The extras are amazing.  There are two MGM shorts that talk about the current fashions and show movie trailers from the biggest MGM movies such as The Maisy movies, The Thin Man Movies and more!  There is a soundtrack listening station that's set up with a chapter list, but instead of going to the scene, it plays the music from that scene. Now how many DVD's do that?  You own the soundtrack right on the DVD! The trailers are also beautiful, and include the even better remake of The Women called The Opposite Sex.<br />The work that Warner Brothers did on this film gives the other companies no excuse for bringing films out on DVD with NOTHING on them, and charging so much.  This DVD is VERY reasonably priced, and a treasure to any film buff. I hope we can see it's remake, The Opposite Sex released soon in the very same fashion.<br />I highly recommend you see this film on DVD, even if you've seen it before hundreds of times.  Seeing it this time is like seeing it your first!
B000067CPX|5.0|This album is amazing, i just bought it at 10 o'clock this morning, and i bet i will not be able to stop listening forever....the chili peppers are the best, i don't give 5 stars often but this album definantely deserves it, you can tell the chili peppers put so much effort into making this album enjoyable...my favorite reviews are the ones that go through all the songs, so here's the tracks one by one and what i think of them:<BR>1.) By the Way:  You've probably heard this one by now, but this songs cannot be overplayed, john's funk guitar, and flea's nice slap bassline complete the song over anthony's rapping and soul singing<BR>2.) Universally Speaking:  A nice little ballad with smooth vocals and rythamic guitar and bass<BR>3.) This is the Place:...an awesome output by the chili peppers, as flea plays one bass line through the whole song, all the other peppers are playing off it with sweet effect and smooth backround vocals by john, a masterpiece<BR>4.) Dosed:  Nice double guitar work here, a very catchy tune that will be stuck in your head (in a good way) <BR>5.) Don't Forget Me: Beautiful chords, great vocals, and a nice job done on the rythem side by chad and flea, i love the drums in this song!<BR>6.) The Zephyr Song: I love how diverse the chili's can get, this almost has a latin hip hop flavor to it..but then it changes and john's vocals come in, and it's amazing!<BR>7.) Can't Stop:  My absolute favorite song on this cd, john's playing a bass line!, or it sounds like that, then flea takes over with it later in the song, and how do they make john's ohhhhh ahhhh's sound good over funk?, i don't get it, but it's great, and then the chorus comes in, unexpected, and it's amazing, i hope they release this song, because everyone deserves to listen to this song<BR>8.) I Could die for you:...A nice intro in this song, and then it starts up, and a nice, a very full sound for a slow song, which makes it very enjoyable<BR>9.) Midnight:  As the orchestra starts, you think...wait?, what happened, but it works with the song, who ever's idea this was...i like it, and another wonderful song comes out of it...rock on chili's<BR>10.) Thrown Away Your Television:  You hear the bass line and you say....\\"yeahhhhhhhhhhh\\" and the chili's go tribal style, but stay themselves, a foot tapping song that you can't just stop playing, very very very very catchy<BR>11.) Cabron:  We go latin again, as kiedes roll's his r's on cabrrron, and john's guitar is awesome, nice 1-5-8, bass line, but there are play-off on it which is nice, and chad bangs away on a samba style drum beat<BR>12.) Tear:  My second favorite song on the cd, pretty close to can't stop, it's a complete masterpiece, so many things happen in this song, you wonder what happened in the begginnging, when it started, and beautiful backround vocals too<BR>13.) On Mercury: Wow, what a change from the last song, you're all sad after 'tear' then a ska sort of song, it's great, too great, it's sooooo awesome, omg, this song it up there with can't stop, haha, i can't decide<BR>14.) Minor Thing:  Good song, nice bridge in this song, with oohhhhhh goin on in the backround which completes it, wow,,, too many good songs here. haha<BR>15.) Warm Tape:  Interesting intro in this song, but i love it still....haha, and then it goes into the acoustic chorus which perfects it<BR>16.) Venice Queen:  How could the cd end any better?  A beautifully arranged song, everything is perfect, the balance, the riffs, it's so complete<br />Buy this cd, or you will be deprived, this cd is worth 100 bucks, every song is awesome, just take my word for it, from the first reviewer, amazing!
B00000JCB2|1.0|Limp Bizkit is a joke. Although I am mostly into underground metal, I will admit there are a few decent rap-metal bands out there. Rage Against the Machine are my fave and a very small handful of others have made decent rap-metal. Not Limp Bizkit. Some hate this album just because it's rap-metal, but I hate it just for its absolute lack of songwriting depth. The music really isn't true metal, rather it is simply a mix of pop and rap with moderately heavy guitars added on top. The riffs are simple and uninteresting after just a couple of listens. The song structures are dull and typical of pop. The lyrics are dumb and Fred Durst has to be the most annoying and obnoxious vocalist I have ever heard. (Well, Johnny Rotten may have been more so, but in a good way. Hail the Sex Pistols!) Yes the album is listenable at first but like most pop music its lack of depth completely kills its lasting value.  As much as this band rants about pop bands like the Backstreet Boys, they are just as pop and just as depthless.  The ending rant is unbelievably ironic considering this band will likely last about as long as the Backstreet Boys, if that long. Rearranged is really the only worthwhile song here and I wouldn't waste my money on this quasi-metal pop [junk]. Limp Bizkit lovers surely think I'm a total idiot and will continue to worship the band thinking they're the greatest thing in the world, but most of them will eventually agree with me even if they don't see that possibility now. Rate it five stars, but in a few years it will be thrown into the corner with your Vanilla Ice and Menudo CD's. And don't say I didn't tell you so...
B00003CX5P|5.0|So says Obi-Wan Kenobi to a young Luke Skywalker in what is considered by most to be the best movie of the Star Wars saga, The Empire Strikes Back.  Yet so many have disregarded the Jedi Master's advice when forming an opinion about this movie.  The fact of the matter is, 80% of the people polled after having seen The Phantom Menace said they loved the movie and more people listed Jar Jar as their favorite character than any other character.  So why did a movie that went on to gross an unprecedented 430 million dollars get such negative press?  Who knows?  This is a great movie and a very welcomed addition to one of the greatest sagas to ever hit the big screen and the DVD is every bit as impressive as the movie itself.  You'd literally have to set aside an entire day just to get through all of the special features that are packed into this two-disc set.  If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for?  And if you haven't seen it in awhile, what are you waiting for?  You'd amazed at how good a movie this is when you watch it with an open mind.
B00004Z459|5.0|This CD is the most listened to CD in my collection.  Every song on this CD is hardcore, full-on thasher music.  Everytime I listen to it I feel the need to start moshing.  I think that it is one of the CD's on the market that you can listen to at anytiime, weather you may be upset, sad, or even broken hearted.  Linkin Park gets my vote for the best CD ever produced.  I'll bet if you like rock you'll like this hands down.
B000062XMI|3.0|At the start of the film, I would have given it five stars.  It told a story I'd never heard before and it gave background information about &quot;Isabella.&quot;  The movie was funny and had a certain fairy tale nature.  There's only one problem with this tale.  There's no Prince Charming.  I didn't want &quot;Isabella&quot; to end up with either of these selfish men.  It's really frustrating to watch her work really hard to get over a man only to return to him in the end.
1573225517|1.0|High Fidelity by Nick Hornby is a boring book and not very interesting because it doesnt have much suspense and there are long passages in his shop or long descriptions which are very unintersting.<BR>The main plot is that Rob Fleming was dumped by all his girlfriends and wants to see them again. Rob is a &quot;macho&quot; because he is egocentric and doesnt think about the emotions and feelings of other people.<BR>Laura, his last split-up, dumped him because he didnt develop and she wants to think about her life and what she wants. Rob still loves her and tries to get her back, even if she has a new boyfriend.<BR>The language is very colloquial because Rob speaks and behaves like a teenager. This language is typical of him and shows his emotions, because he is impolite and insolent. Rob doesnt speak respectfully nor in a mature way, he still has a young-boy-image.<BR>All in all, I think that this book has quite a boring plot with a few funny passages in it. Its intersting for readers who like stories about relationships and dont need much action.
0312265859|3.0|It's hard not to like this series. Altho the storyline was a bit different,I liked it. Ranger and Joe were merely passing thru. I did not like that. I dont want this tension to ever end but it seems they ran fleetingly thru the book and Steph's life.  Lula is always a hoot. Grandma Mazur is wonderful but I could do without Steph's sister and her kids. Extraneous. Waiting for the next.
B000065U1N|3.0|While the Black Hawk Down movie is compelling, I am upset that the DVD contains no real special features. There is no directors track, no interview from the military, etc. There is a 30 minute 'making of' type of feature, but for me it provided little added value.<br />My guess is that after waiting for a significant number of people to purchase this first release, they will turn around and release some 'collectors' or 'limited' edition. I think these 'Disney' like marketing tactics are sleazy, so I will not but this DVD. Save your money and go rent it.

B00005IC2H|5.0|This is the soundtrack to the dream you only have once in your life: a free-floating shamanic fantasy in which you swim underground through icy tunnels and emerge as another human being on the other side of reality. The frosty, melancholy tunes are just drenched with a brittle, liquid electricity and velvetine moodiness that would make even the Lushest, most Radioheaded, Ultra Vivified Scene, or <innovatively engineered band name here> sound like hallmark cardboard. The lyricism, melody, and episodic quality is more high art than rock and roll, but there is a naturalness that is anything but pretentious.  The integrity of the band and of their work is strong enough to sustain and even endear the listener to the strangeness and allow the dark, crystalline emotion to come through despite the language barrier.  Sigur Ros is admirable in their (thus far) insistence on never singing in any other language than Icelandic.  I've heard that among their up-and-coming projects is recording an old Icelandic farmer reciting verse - will it be with our without the arctic blast of guitars?  Anyhow, I found the album outstanding - not the best ever made, but certainly good enough for your average tunnel swimming seal-incarnation trip, next time you book one.
B00003CXXI|5.0|I am 20 years old and I absolutely loved this movie.  I have seen this video over a dozen times and can nearly quote every line in the movie.  Mike Meyers place this sweet but sometimes scary ogar Shrek who falls in love with a the beautiful princess Fiona.  It is a hillarious comedy that makes even adults laugh.  The computer generated animation is great and all of the characters are extremely funny. The movie adds a little mystery and a lot of comedy to the fairy tale love story.  Shrek is not your average fairy tale character, and Princess Fiona turns out to be not your average Princess.  Princess Fiona is played by the charming Cameron Diaz, who does a super job portaying this character.  Donkey who is played by the hillarious Eddie Murphey plays this fat little talking donkey who never stops running his mouth.  This movie is a must see for the whole family.  It will leave you and your children laughing at the edge of your seats.

B000002H2H|5.0|I still remember that day of curiosity, when I just happened to come across my brother's CD case, and happened to see a familiar CD by a band called 'Metallica.' Well, like I said, I was curious, so I popped it into my CD player. I must admit, back then at the ignorant age of 9, I didn't care much for the classical opening of 'Fight fire with Fire', so I skipped on to the next track. The next thing I heard changed my life forever. This huge crunchy sound flew through my speakers, hitting me like a hail storm of giant boulders over and over again. That hail storm was dubbed 'Ride The Lightning', and for some odd reason, I was instantly hooked. I could NOT stop listen to this CD. I remember the days when me and my good friend were very new to metal, and we just kept listening to this album for weeks, trying to figure out 'How do they play that?!' (I had just started on the guitar as well). The lyrics, the riffs, the bass... everythings just incredible. This album (and Slipknot's s/t a few months after this) introduced me to the HUGE genre of heavy metal. And I haven't stopped listening to metal ever since (which I know isn't a long time, since I'm only 13, but hey, it's seemed like a long time!). Anyways, This album rules, and while I agree with everyone that MoP is the better disc, this album just has a giant, special place in my heart.<BR>The Band:<BR>   James, rhythm guitar and vocals- The dual guitar work of James and Kirk on this album on songs such as 'Fade to Black' and 'For Whom the Bell Tolls' is rivaled only by MoP. Period. No other album has ever, and probably WILL never, match the guitar work of this album. And I tip my hat tremendously to James for managing to write such beautiful, heavy riffs and mind-boggling lyrics (whenever I get tired of this gore and satan babble, I just take a look at these lyrics). And, it's amazing how James plays this stuff and sings live. Truly one of metal finest musicians ever.<BR>   Kirk, lead guitar-......Um. Uh, heh, wordsCANNOT describe the majesty of Kirk's solos on this album. Yes, like I said, MoP is the better album, but you hear ANYTHING like the solo to 'Fade..' on MoP (or any other album for that matter, 'cept Pink Floyd's 'The Wall')? Kirk's solo in that song is probably the best ever written, rivaled by many probably but mostly by David Gilmour's solo on 'Confortably Numb.' That is all I can say about this man. If Metallica pulls of anything like this with their new album, metal shall truly reign supreme yet again.<BR>   Cliff, bass- This guy is the reason I play the bass. I didn't believe anyone when they told me that that beginning solo on 'For..' was the bassist. Who's ever heard a BASS solo in a metal band?! I am completely blown away, to say the least, by Cliff's bass work on every M album he was on.<BR>   Lars, drums- Thrash, thrash, thrash is the only way to describe Lars' drumming on this. His drum lines fit the music like a velvet glove. Due to production (which isn't stellar, but hey it brings out an element in Metallica that isn't heard on any other record), Lars' drums sound awesome. Check out the title track for more explanation.<br />There you have it folks. RtL in a nutshell. ... This album is PERFECT for any new metal head too.
B00000DGUG|5.0|It's not Jagged Little Pill, not very inspiring, not very helpful, doesn't really have the lyrics that help you. But still it's Alanis! That's good enough! A major change of tone to a sweet new age type album, this is another great Alanis Morissette multi-platinum album! The album's track \\"Thank you\\" is probably the hit of the album. A very catchy single that should have also been included in her \\"Unplugged\\" album. Other very popular hits from the album include \\"unsent\\" and \\"so pure\\" the other two hits from the album! It's no helpful pill but it's still not junk!         Head over feet fans and true Alanis fans (like me) will still love this album. However as for \\"you oughta know\\" fans, there isn't much here for you. \\"Are you still mad\\" may satisfy your tastes! Another good track is \\"Joining you\\" with it's guitar music and another good vocal performance. Also \\"One\\" is something that \\"you learn\\" and \\"hand in my pocket\\" fans will enjoy. The album is great! It's not as good as JLP and URS (under rug swept)-but it's better than a lot of albums you'd here these days! It's another feature where Alanis's great voice can be heard. I really love it!

B00005LOLD|5.0|Marlon Brando plays a Korean War pilot who has been ordered to rest in Japan, because his fiance's father is the commanding general.  There he becomes pals with James Garner and the two of them meet Japanese dancers. Socializing with the locals is strictly forbidden, but Brando gradually falls in love with the star dancer. Their relationship must be kept secret, but Brando finds this impossible when one of his men, played by Red Buttons, marries a Japanese woman and is subjected to harsh army prejudice.<br />Brando is very good as the southern charmer, but Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki steal the show as the married couple who face tragedy in an unforgettable scene. The beauty of cherry blossoms and kimonos and the cruelty of biogtry combine to make a lovely film you'll want to see again and again.
B00005JKG9|5.0|This film made me completely forget my troubles when I saw it for the first time in a theater years ago.  I came out of it feeling like someone had ground me across a cheese grater, but it was a good feeling.  The only caveat and perhaps someone in the industry or at Amazon.com can look into this is - why in blazes can you get this on DVD in England, but not here?!?  I would order it from the British branch of Amazon.com, except that it won't work in my DVD player.  The injustice of it all!

B00005JKLZ|4.0|This isn't a remake, exactly. It's clear that Simon Wells was attempting an update on his great-grandfather's original story. Retaining just the original skeleton of the plot (and making a witty reference to both the novel and the first film), Wells has fashioned a decidedly different parable about the modern world.<br />Beyond his need to experiment,The Time Traveler (as he was referred to in the original story)finally has a compelling personal reason to try his machine.  It's also clear why he goes forward vs. backward--the despair of his character and his hopes of understanding the paradox that prevents him from changing the past prompts him to lose himself in the future.<br />Guy Pearce gives a nice multilayered performance. Jeremy Irons is deliciously wicked as the leader of the Morlocks. It's finally clear not only how such a situation could have occurred but why it thrived in the first place. Wells' self assured direction sometimes can work to his disadvantage; there are a number of minor plot threads that aren't well developed and the second half has a couple of minor plot flaws that unravel if you examine them too closely.<br />The CGI effects are impressive particularly when compared to the top drawer stop motion effects from the original film. Again, the effects aren't perfect (and could have been a bit more developed) but work well within the context of the story. The sequence set in New York when the (spoiler alert folks!)moon crumbles with chunks of it destorying the city is an impressive, powerful set piece and counter balances the main theme. It's clear that, despite the Time Traveler's gifts, he can't undo the past or change significant portions of the future. So he choses to make a change on a personal level and save those he can.<br />The dialog is a bit clunky at times and it's clear that the script passed through many different hands before the final draft. Writing by committee has been the undoing of many a great film (Blade Runner is a fine example or Tim Burton's \\"reimagining\\" of Planet of the Apes).<br />On the whole, though, The Time Machine is still a powerful, political commentary on mankind and the dark desires that drive us as a species. I'm a huge fan of the original George Pal directed film and feel that Wells managed to develop a film that pays hommage to the past while bravely charting its own course towards the future.It's clear that Wells is technically gifted as a director and this first live action effort promises much from him.

0671027573|5.0|This book is really great. Presently, I'm re-reading it (my 3rd time) while looking for another Linda Howard book. Jaine &amp; Sam are so witty, funny &amp; lovable. I enjoyed their exhange of repartee. As the story unfolds, I was kept on the edge wondering who the killer is &amp; who among the other girls will be the next, while awaiting for a moment when Jaine &amp; Sam reveal their feelings for each other. Only Linda can create that kind of mixture of humour, suspense, romance &amp; excitement. You'll never go wrong when you choose a Linda Howard book. I'm looking forward to reading another one.
B000002KXO|5.0|By 1982, when MIRAGE was released Fleetwood Mac was already one of the biggest, if not THE biggest Rock bands in music. Stevie Nicks had released her HUGELY POPULAR first solo album, \\"Bella Donna,\\" a year before, spawning MANY hits for her...<BR>-<BR>After TUSK's experimental approach Fleetwood Mac found itself again, with MIRAGE. Although the album is almost TOO SAFE, there are many songs that make it incredible.<BR>-<BR>Stevie Nicks cut her BELLA DONNA TOUR short, to come back and record this album with Fleetwood Mac, in 1981, a tour that couldve gone on for months and months.<BR>-<BR>Before TUSK was released Stevie lost someone very important in her life, he very best friend of all time Robin Anderson. For awhile she thought she may not be able to cope, or even return to music. She never enjoyed the success of her huge album BELLA DONNA, a success she deserved to enjoy, because of her hard work and determination.<BR>-<BR>Stevie wrote the classic hit \\"Gypsy,\\" a song inspired by her life and the death of her friend Robin. The song served as MIRAGE's BIGGEST hit single....a song fan easily connected with. The video, which shows Stevie off like a fairy princess, was a huge MTV hit, and Fleetwood Mac was back on top of the game.<BR>-<BR>While GYSPSY is obviously the most memorable moment on MIRAGE other songs like Christine McVie's LOVE IN STORE, make it also a special album.<BR>-A RARE Duet with Stevie and Christine on \\"Straight Back,\\" brings Fleetwood Mac back to their old rock roots...while Stevie sings a VERY country-filled track \\"That's Alright.\\"<BR>-It's a great record..and again if you love Christine McVie and Stevie Nicks you will love. I again, found myself skipping over the Lindsey Buckingham tracks, USUALLY!
0786867973|5.0|Nigella is so easy to use is that she doesn't use pompous vocabulary to describe each process in each recipe unlike Martha Stewart or Delia Smith. I wish that the American readers would realise that this book was written by a Brit and therefore they should think about the ounce/metric conversion thing. This so easy!..it just takes a bit of thought. All the baked good aren't horrifically sweet and have subtle flavours unlike much of the the cakes/bakery foods devised by North American food writers. Plus you don't need to go grocery shopping if you want to make something on the spur of the moment since the ingredients required are usually in one's larder. What a refreshing change from Delia Smith or Martha Stewart where one has to go shopping just to make something that takes an inordinate amount of time and doesn't always taste very good!
B000002KLZ|5.0|There are few bands that can truly pull off being an OUTSTANDING live act, but Fleetwood Mac is definetely one. Now this CD was released in 1980, and that shows somewhat in the quality of the recordings, but not enough to affect the overall quality of the CD. It's a Double-CD set, full of Fleetwood Mac classics from the 79-80 mammoth Tusk Tour.<BR>-<BR>The Cd's feature each song from a different stop on the tour, which was very unique thing to do. <BR>-<BR>On the first disk, you get to hear Stevie Nicks sing &quot;Dreams&quot; beautifully from a live sound check...which is something rare.<BR>-<BR>On the first disk, you also get to experience the mega-hit from their album &quot;Tusk,&quot; &quot;Sara&quot;- a song Nicks wrote about her relationship with Don Henley, and also Mick Fleetwood.<BR>- <BR>On Disk 2 you get the full-fledged rock version of Stevie's classic tune &quot;Rhiannon.&quot; The intensity of this version is incredible, and truly displays to listeners how it was back then, and the whole aura of Stevie Nicks.<br />-<BR>Lindsey Buckingham shines his light on &quot;Go Your Own Way,&quot; originally from &quot;Rumours.&quot;<BR>-<BR>You get to hear an unreleased live tune by Nicks on Disc 2, called &quot;Fireflies.&quot; (and incredible song!)<BR>-The whole band unites at the end, especially portraying the great voice of Christine McVie, in this number, for &quot;The Farmers Daughter,&quot; which could almost be considered an acapella tune. The was written for Fleetwood Mac by The Beach Boys (which is very rare, for Fleetwood Mac to take a song written by someone else.)<BR>-If you love great rock n' roll, or if you love Fleetwood Mac you should definetely invest your money in this truly amazing 2-CD Set!
B000002JSR|4.0|First off, it's interesting to notice the years that each of these eight songs were released -- spanning from 1969 to 1978. Like all past Led Zeppelin albums, \\"Coda\\" contains its share of varied styles and highly memorable jam sessions by each talented musician. It opens with the fun and highly energetic \\"We're Gonna Groove,\\" done originally by Ben E. King and James Bethea. \\"Coda\\" boasts plenty of energy, and the songs are nowhere near as lame as many have claimed they are over the years. The Page/Plant team did a wonderful job on \\"Poor Tom,\\" a folksy, high-energy ditty with great background drumming, some notable harmonica, a cool bass line and a nice bridge where Plant gently sings and the guitars gently chime.<br /><br />Though Led Zeppelin influenced every hard rock band under the sun, they themselves also blatantly played their own influences on record, and one such song is the popular Willie Dixon blues track, \\"I Can't Quit You Baby,\\" a song also heard on Zeppelin's debut album, [[ASIN:B000002J01 Led Zeppelin 1]], where it expertly melds blues and rock together. Though it was written in 1972, \\"Walter's Walk\\" sounds vaguely like an 1980s-era Plant song, with its sharp sound and raring-to-go vocals.  Likewise, \\"Ozone Baby\\" is a fairly rocking, almost danceable track that displays a band still very much in top form when they recorded it in 1978. In fact, it's unfortunate that some of these late 70s \\"Coda\\" songs didn't find their way on Zeppelin's last studio album, [[ASIN:B000002JSP In Through the Out Door]].<br /><br />Clicking on all cyclinders throughout \\"Coda\\" was the legendary drummer John Bonham. His own song, which truly pays homage to his unbelievable talent, \\"Bonzo's Montreux,\\" in some ways steals the album. Bonham is a one-man orchestra on the all-drum song, and you simply have to hear it to believe it. \\"Darlene\\" feautures great instrumentation by John Paul Jones, who plays a rollicking piano. Finally, the closing song, \\"Wearing and Tearing,\\" is appropriately titled. The rocking song shows a great band on its way out with a fast riff to speed the song along and wild-fire vocals. Interestingly, it's the sort of style Zeppelin didn't always attempt during their massive heyday, preferring instead a slower pace and long solos by Page.<br /><br />In my opinion, every song in the Zeppelin catalog is to be treasured, and the songs on \\"Coda\\" are no exception. Those that say this record is nearly a complete throwaway are mistaken. Zep were cool because they never over-produced themselves, and they played like a bar band and stadium rockers all at once. Zeppelin always sounded natural together, and that's one of the reasons I like \\"Coda\\" so much.ed.

B00006690G|5.0|I think this CD is Eminem's best work so far. He has really grown as a songwriter, as well as a rapper. His honesty really shines on this CD. I do really believe \\"The Eminem Show\\" will surpass the success of both his first albums..<BR>===<BR>\\"Cleaning out my closet\\"- this track finds Eminem being especially honest with his feelings about his mother...<BR>--<BR>\\"Haile's Song\\"- A man, often known for his strong anger and bad-mouthing really shows his love for his daughter... It's catchy, and Eminem ACTUALLY sings on it, and he sounds good!<BR>--------------------------<BR> \\"Without Me,\\" - The current hit single finds Eminem in touch with the controversy that surrounds him when he says \\"this looks like a time for me, so everybody just follow me, cause we need a little controversy, cause it feels so empty without me!\\"<BR>---------------<BR>This is an incredible CD, and I think you should all buy it!
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I just recieved my director's cut DVD and experienced \\"Requiem\\" for the first time and to say I have not been moved by this film is a lie.  I felt the highs and even morseo felt the lows of the four doomed characters in this film.  This isn't a film that will brighten your spirits, however watching \\"Requiem\\" is a rewarding one.  The performances by Jared Leto, Jennifer Connely, and a surprise Marlyn Wayans blew me out of my chair.  But Ellen Burstyn blew me out of my chair the most, her performance broke my heart and I found the most profound and moving.<br />Someone said that this should be required viewing in high schools, I definitely agree.  After seeing this film I definitely have no plans whatsoever to use illegal drugs and even perscription drugs that I receive I will get information on first.<br />Unbelievable, if you can stomach this bleak film, it's a must buy and an essential part of your DVD collection.  But be warned before hand...  the contents aren't pretty.<br />A++++ film.
B000002KKC|4.0|Hmm what can you say about this album?<BR>Well it is a 2-CD set, which gives it some room for definete potential.<BR>-<BR>It's hard to critise a great rock band like Fleetwood Mac. Lindsey Buckingham, after the success with the Mac's &quot;Rumours&quot; (one of the best selling albums of all time), found himself stuck in a position where he felt he needed to grow. His songs on TUSK are definetely experimental. He has stated many times that he refused to try to make a RUMOURS PART II. What he did do, was record many of his songs from TUSK on his own, at his home.<BR>-<BR>Many say that what Lindsey Buckingham did on TUSK was a poor business decision, because TUSK failed to reach the success of Rumours, or the Fleetwood Mac - Fleetwood Mac album, although in today's standards TUSK is still a successful album.<BR>-<BR>Of course everyone knew there would never be another RUMOURS, and Lindsey made a point not to make one.<BR>-<BR>What does make this album shine, outside of Lindsey Buckingham's pop/new-wave tunes on TUSK, are Nicks' classic songs. Some of the best songs she has ever written appear on this album.<BR>-<BR>The very haunting and bewitching &quot;Sisters of the Moon,&quot; is probably the Heaviest song Stevie Nicks has ever recorded.<BR>-<BR>Sara, the mega-hit single from TUSK, finds Nicks ever-changing voice in pure and top form.<BR>-<BR>Christine McVie's &quot;Think About Me,&quot; is a pure classic...<BR>- <BR>Stevie's song &quot;Storms,&quot; is my favorite song on the album. Her poetic lyrics shine here, as she tells the story of her life. &quot;Never have I been a blue calm sea, I have always been a storm.&quot;<BR>-<BR>Another song listeners will find especially touching is &quot;Beautiful Child,&quot; by Stevie Nicks, which is pretty much a piano, Stevie, and many spirits.<BR>-<BR>If you like Fleetwood Mac you will like this album, especially if you like Stevie Nicks or Christine McVie. If you LOVE Lindsey's songs on Rumours , then most likely you skipover his MANY songs on TUSK. I could only give it 4-stars because I do not ever listen to the Lindsey Buckingham tracks, and a 5-star album has to have me loving the whole thing.
B00005RFAI|5.0|If i could i would give it 7 stars. I just love the cd. I was surprised when i found myself loving the cd because i was expecting to hear sounds more like her single &quot;get the party started&quot; which i liked when it first came out but quickly grew sick of it. the cd's sound is much different from that. only 2 other songs i would consider to be in the same relm as that song. its so great and really has a song on there for everyone to connect to. pink is wonderful and hopefully she will be around for a long time.
B000063S6Z|2.0|I was a fan of moby back before &quot;Play&quot; was popular.  I thought moby was my secret artist that no one else knew about.  A couple years later he wins some grammies and even my most mainstream-listening friends have his album.  It looks as if on this album instead of using his eclectic/genius mind to create something out of this world and futuristic, he goes with the exact same forumla as he did for &quot;play&quot;.  Old gospel recordings with boring piano riffs accompanied by drum beats.  It was great to do that on &quot;play&quot; because no one had done it before, but it looks like now moby has REALLY sold out to his stardom.  This album is like a sequel to Play, and not near as good.  His first single, &quot;we are all made of stars&quot; i thought was a terrible song from the get-go, and hoped the rest of the album would be better.  Well, after many repeated listenings, i can say that this album isnt any better.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Baz Luhrman and Guy Pearce co-write a masterful script about truth, beauty, freedom, love, about the Moulin Rouge! Christian, a young poet, played by Ewan McGregor, writes abut love, but yet never once has experienced it himself. A group of Bohemian actors plead with him to become their new writer and director. They show him that his words are words of love. In order to put the play, Spectacular! Spectacular!, into production they need to convince Harold Zidler, the impresario of the Moulin Rouge, that it will be a hit. That night they take the young poet to the underworld of the Moulin Rouge where he meets the courtesan, the Sparkling Diamond, Satine, played by Nicole Kidman. When Zidler organizes a private meeting for Satine and Christian that is when they fall in love. A jealous duke provides the budget for the play but only if he is promised Satine as his own. A true love story made into a musical with wonderful song and dance truly deserves a category of it's own. With nineteenth century Paris as it's backdrop and familiar twentieth century music, Baz Luhrman finds a way of adding his own special touch as he did in Romeo and Juliet.<BR>Co-starring along side Nicole Kidman (The Others, Eyes Wide Shut, Far and Away) Ewan McGregor (Black Hawk Down, Trainspotting, Shallow Grave) shows his sensitive side in the greatest love story of the year. Luhrman (Rent, Stritcly Ballroom) and Pearce (The Seventh Floor, Mad Bomber in Love, Vicious!) made a comfortable environment for Kidman and McGregor in one of their first singing roles.<BR>Moulin Rouge took time to develop characters but at the same time kept the movie going with a constant rhythm. Using a collage of modern music made this anything but an ordinary musical. Turning simple phrases into beautiful lyrics is how the actors made their on-screen love seem so real. Endless amounts of dance sequences and wonderfully detailed sets and props make this movie a feast for the eyes alone.<BR>Moulin Rouge can make your emotions reach a level they have never been and could touch anyone's soul. For adults and teens looking for an epic love story and just a good movie to watch this would be the one for you.
B000067CPX|4.0|The new peppers album will disappoint those who funked out to freaky styley and the earlier work of RHCP, but those faithful to the band's ethos and with understanding that change may come will not be disappointed.  All the songs are done with punk rock edginess and intensity but the maturity and coherence of the gorup make for mellower song structures.  Frusciante is at the top of his game, his riffing and strumming is finger licking good, solidified by the electricity of flea's bass work.  Kiedis continues in the vein of californication's 'around the world' and 'scar tissue' with his voice seeped in bittersweet.  The mix is strengthened by double tracking of guitars and extensive use of keys time checked by solid percussion backing.  By The Way is ambiguous and hard to define, but a beautifully intense and honest piece of work.  The peppers maintain their relevance and poise in a music world dominated by emptiness. <BR>Fill up on RHCP!...
0316666343|3.0|I finished this book last night and have to say it is worth finishing.  But I found it to be by turns both gruesome and sentimental.  The grief of Susie's family lingers, but the scenes from her heaven wander into a too sweet sitcom version of a 14-year-old girl's feelings.
B000063S6Z|5.0|Just a few thoughts.... I bought the last Cd &quot;Play&quot;,<br />thought it very cool the way he uses all these<br />sounds and vocals together to make such interesting<br />music. I feel this new &quot;18&quot; exceeds the last collection, its<br />not as &quot;lively&quot; as Play but it has more emotion to<br />me and I can put this on  or mix it with other<br />cds and it fits for me. I'm not surprised all the<br />negative reviews, it takes time to grow up and that<br />I believe holds true with your musical tastes, I<br />just like building mine like a library, its an interesting<br />world of music out there, explore it! stop bashing it!

B000065V1V|5.0|I'm a long time fan of Bowie and I've been waiting<br />ages for a collection of songs like &quot;Heathen&quot;.<br />I enjoyed many cuts from &quot;Outside&quot; but like many reviewers<br />has stated, its been quite awhile (since the early<br />80's for me), that I've really got into a  whole Bowie<br />cd. This takes some time to sink in  but its pretty<br />close to a masterpiece in my mind. I will be enjoying<br />this for along time to come and look forward to more<br />BOWIE! You don't have to be a kid to know how to rock!
B000002UTY|5.0|Well... what could I say? An extraordinary album, a fantastic mayhem of scorching, crunching guitars and a powerful, precise rhythm section. The live renditions of 'Who do you Love', a multi-layered suite of sonic guitar assault, and 'Mona', are the highlights of &quot;Happy Trails&quot;, but 'Maiden of the Cancer Moon' and 'Calvary', the originals by QSM on that record, are also great songs, very trippy acid stuff from 'psychedelic warriors' Cippolina &amp; Duncan. The spaced-out interplay by the psych/freaky duelling guitars is really something to be heard!
0380820846|5.0|I just want to let readers know how great this book is. i laughed so much my stomach hurt. That is a great feeling.  If you want to boost your self esteem or get away from your world for a night this is the book to get.
0446608955|5.0|A Walk to Remember is of course, a love story, but the novel's characters, unlike other love stories, develop with eachother. The author describes each character the most when the two are together, all the more pulling in the concept that their unexpected love is the only thing that makes them complete.<BR>Wonderful, heart wrenching ending, unexpected, beautiful story.
B000067CPX|4.0|There's no denying, in my opinion, that &quot;Californication&quot; was a wonderful album by RHCP.  Basically all of the songs were all excellent and there really were no bad songs.  &quot;By the Way&quot; is also a wonderful album by RHCP's Anthony Kiedis, Flea, John Frusciante, and Chad Smith.  While &quot;By the Way&quot; sounds like typical RHCP, I think Kiedis and crew sound better than normal, which isn't to say that they didn't sound good before.  Also, RHCP have taken advantage of some interesting audio effects and string/orchestral backgrounds on some of the songs.  As always, the drums, guitars, and lyrics are all played/written beautifully.  My favorites on this album are &quot;By the Way,&quot; &quot;This is the Place,&quot; &quot;Dosed,&quot; &quot;The Zephyr Song,&quot; and &quot;Throw Away Your Television.&quot;  Overall, it's an awesome RHCP album.

B00006690F|5.0|First thing, sorry if I make some wrongs, I'm belgian so I speak french. Usually, I listen to hard rock, metal, and I hate rap music, but I changed my mind listening to this album and the previous. I think Eminem is the only rapper that has really something to say, and doesn't makes cds only to get money as a lot of other rappers(I'm talking about rappers but it's the same for commercials groups such as limp bizkit and all the neo-metal, britney spears,backstreet boys ect.) Besides, he talks about himself and his own life , and it's very rare. I think Eminem is a misendurstood man and french people that don't understand english can't really appreciate him on his true value. In my opinion, \\"the eminem show\\" is his best album, more sentimental than the others,  with a beautiful sung song dedicated to his daughter, Hailie,some provocative songs(as usual) that laught at the \\"white america\\", the \\"business\\", the real tv, the label parental advisory explicit lyrics,ect in \\"without me\\",and a lot of others very good songs!...

0553381709|5.0|Well, I was looking for new authors to explore and am I glad I read the rave reviews of this and the other 2 books in the series. I picked up the first one and kept reading until I'd finished all 3 books in the series.<br />There is plenty to recommend, the kingdom is believable, lots on in faction fighting and the downfall of one of the most noble houses at a time it's needed the most. The Author is not afraid to kill off key characters and loosing them is hard but keeps everything realistic - you can't count on any character if some of the strongest fall ! Keep you on the edge of your chair and you occasionally might even fall off once or twice. <br />Great read - check the amazon sample chapter.
B000001F7R|5.0|Why do so many reviewers who applaud this album have to do so at the expense of later albums?  These guys have always been great (with the possible exception of the too-different &quot;Slang&quot; in 1996).  To me, this album is a classic that is the start (not the end) of a remarkable career.<br />As others have stated, this is not glossy, produced, pop-ladden Def Leppard.  This is the band at their raw, earliest roots.  Listening to this, it is clear to see that they always had talent.  Clearly the songs &quot;Rock Brigade&quot; and &quot;Hello America&quot;, both of which were released but obviously did not become big hits, reprents the rawness of this band in their earliest form.<br />There are no ballads here--a far cry from later Def Leppard.  (Note:  no criticism intended here; this is pure observation.)  Songs like &quot;Sorrow Is A Woman&quot;, &quot;Satellite&quot;, &quot;Wasted&quot;, and &quot;It Don't Matter&quot; all showcase the Leps at their early rocking best.  Minimal &quot;layers of guitars&quot;, and while Joe Elliot's voice is quite apparent, his singing is much rougher and less melodic than future efforts.  It still sounds fantastic, though; that's for sure.<br />This is more than an album for completists, in my book.  Strongly recommended for fans of hard rock and classic rock.  Not an album to be overlooked by any means.  Any fan of this band who is familiar with &quot;High And Dry&quot; up through the later stuff should fine this an entertaining and enjoyable listen.
B000067CPX|3.0|Just got the CD - don't be fooled by the A$$-Kicking first track - &quot;By the Way&quot;.  The rest of the album is NOTHING like it.  I'm not saying it's bad - it's just the song &quot;By the Way&quot; is classic RHCP jam and the rest is new territory for them.  Excellent harmonies and great use of some new instrementals... needs more FLEA though - jurry is still out.
B000002LEM|4.0|Let me start by saying that I don't understand the criticisms of both \\"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge\\" and \\"Balance\\", as to me those are both somewhat better Van Hagar albums than this one.  Nonetheless, this is still a very worthy VH album overall.<br />\\"Mine All Mine\\" gets the album off to a catchy, thought-provoking start, and \\"When It's Love\\" is a typical but strong ballad that was the biggest hit of the album.  \\"A.F.U.\\" and \\"Cabo Wabo\\" are fine rockers, the later an epic 7-minute track.  I also like the bluesy, different \\"Finish What Ya Started\\" (a pretty big hit in its day) and the rocking, heavy \\"Sucker In A 3 Piece\\".  \\"A Apolitical Blues\\" is okay.<br />To the negatives--not that I hate any of these tracks, but they simply aren't VH's best.  Sammy screams too much and without real purpose on \\"Source Of Infection\\".  \\"Feels So Good\\" (a minor hit) is pretty meek--not as strong as most VH ballads.  \\"Black And Blue\\" is a bit inane--both in terms of the lyrical content and the too-dragging guitar riff.  (Hard to believe this was the lead single off this album.)  Don't get me wrong--I still can enjoy listening to these tracks; they just aren't as good as most VH and/or Sammy songs.<br />All in all, this album is still definitely worth a listen.  The band still rocks in plenty of places, and Eddie's guitar work is still top-notch.  It's just not quite to the level of most of this band's work in their prime (i.e., 1978-1996).
B00003CXZ1|5.0|Angelina Jolie is just incredible in this movie, she is just perfect for the role !!! I hope they come up with new Tomb Raider movie !!!!
0312265859|4.0|When her parents' next-door neighbor asks Stephanie Plum to look for her missing granddaughter, Stephanie figures that it can't be too serious. Evelyn was probably just running from an abusive ex-husband. A quick look, though, turns up Eddie Abruzzi, a mob leader with a distinctly insane side to him. Stephanie knows that she should lay low, but laying low is not in her character. And in-your-face is exactly what Eddie needs to push him over the edge.<br />Stephanie tries to get on with her life--hanging around with ex-Ho Lulu, failing to bring in bond jumpers, and trying to reconcile her attraction to the two men in her life (Ranger and Joe) with her perpetual datelessness. Still, Abruzzi won't let her go and starts to escalate the violence against her.<br />Author Janet Evanovich has delivered another side-splitting, car destroying, and semi-sexy novel in HARD EIGHT. All the familiar characters are back, along with Stephanie's endearing combination of incompetence and stick-to-it-ness. Fans of the series will be intrigued and maybe even surprised to see the latest in the ongoing love triangle.<br />For me, the Stephanie Plum series continues to be enjoyable--I'm certainly looking forward to the next volume. Evanovich is doing her best to deal with a fundamental problem in the series--that Stephanie's incompetence is a little less convincing in the eighth novel in the series than it was in the first. That she is able to pull it off is a credit to her abilities as a writer. That it becomes a little more strained with each book is unfortunate but, perhaps, inescapable.<br />Stephanie Plum is a treat and HARD EIGHT is a fine addition to the series.
B000065U1N|5.0|This has to be the most powerful, touching, outstanding, and emotionally-packed war movie I have ever seen. Everything about this movie is fantastic. This is A REALITY. THIS IS WAR.<br />People saying this movie is hard to watch: Yeah, it is. But I cannot stand when people say that it's too violent. It's war! That's how war is. And the events in the movie are supposed to be true, so it's not like they can change anything just to please people.<br />The direction and cinematography is really outstanding and breathtaking. You really feel like you're there with those men at the time they were attacked. And the reason why this movie lacked character development is because this is A REAL EVENT. In war, there is no time to figure out who the dreamer is, or the romantic, or the writer, and so on and so on. We were given all of the info we needed.<br />Why did I like this better than \\"Saving Private Ryan?\\" Because, this is a true story. And it just seems more powerful. Don't get me wrong, I loved \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" but I liked this a lot more.<br />For those of you who like special features, there are a few. I haven't had the chance to check them out yet, though. But, they are there.<br />I think \\"Black Hawk Down,\\" is something EVERYONE needs to see at least once. It is a very important film that shows us how courageous human beings can be. \\"No one gets left behind.\\" Remember those words.
B000002IGV|5.0|When I was in the U.S. as a foreign exchange student this was the first CD I bought. Because it's just excellent music. You will find every style of rock music on this album, from the soft ballad to hard guitar riffs. My favourites are &quot;We're not gonna take it&quot; and &quot;I wanna rock&quot;. These two songs are often played in movies (&quot;Iron Eagle&quot; and &quot;Road Trip&quot;). After &quot;You can't stop Rock'n'Roll&quot; this is the second great album of the Twisted Sisters. Every Rock Fan should own al least one of them!
0790731002|1.0|What can I say.  This movie is HORRIBLE.  It completley loses the darkness, the danger, and the creepiness that were found in the first two movies.  Val Kilmer just wasn't a good enough Batman.  Gotham is now a disco inferno other than a dark and pest-infested city where true evil lurks.  This failed attempt to build on to the series is a joke.  Plain and simple.<br />However, I DID like Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones.  They were great, but that still didn't help the movie any.<br />Thought this series couldn't get any worse after this one was made, until...............
B000002BBY|5.0|&quot;What's the Story, Morning Glory&quot; was the very first Oasis cd I ever owned. After seeing &quot;Wonderwall&quot; on Vh1, I'm like &quot;well, there's a cd I'd like to own.&quot; After listening to it once, I'm like alright... But then after a second listen, I got it. I suddenly understood how great, classic and infectious that cd was and still is to this day. I think it's not really fair to say what the &quot;good&quot; songs are and what the &quot;bad&quot; songs are because everyone has a favorite song on here, it is that kind of album. The good ol' rock n' roll feeling is evident on tracks like 1, 2, 7 and 10. The catchy pop songs are evident on 3, 4, 5, 9, and 12. The love songs are 3, 4, 8, and 12. THe sing-alongs are 1-12. and of course everyones favorites- 3, 4 and 12
B00005OCMR|5.0|This is such an excellent purchase!! A great edition of Disneys 1982s sci-fi adventure when CGI was on its first development, but its ingeniuity is just in its way to create an excellent atmosphere for forthcoming computer generated films. More than 5 hours of entertainment in its best. 20 years from its birth I still remember the first (of 7 times) I saw it on the movie theatre and is still great, not only the computer graphics but the story is a very good one. A masterpiece from Disney Studios!.
B000069HK2|5.0|YES IT IS.<br />Words cant describe it. Beautiful song writing, melodies, harmonies, etc. With Finch-like vocals, glassjaw-like screams you cant go wrong!<br />FIVE FIVE FIVE!
630027179X|5.0|Not only is \\"Excalibur's\\" director from Ireland, the film is shot in Ireland! Erin Go Bragh!<br />I first watched this movie at the age of 14, and 12 1/2 years later it remains one of my all-time faves.  This film got royally [cheated] by the Oscars, IMHO.  Why it did not receive at least a nomination for Best Picture, and Best Supporting Actor for Nicol Williamson, is beyond me.  <br />The biggest travesty of justice was the failure of the Academy to nominate Trevor Jones' superb score as Best Musical Score.  His use of \\"O Fortuna\\", et al, was the first-ever piece of operatic music I ever took a liking to.  At the risk of sounding sacriligeous and disloyal to my faith, Jones' treatment of \\"Kyrie Eleison\\" during the Arhur/Guenevere wedding is the best rendition I've heard anywhere, better than any Mass I've personally attended.  (Fellow Catholics, please don't excommunicate me for that one!)<br />Furthermore, without giving away too much of the ending, the combination of background  music and visual imagery when Sir Perceval casts the sword back to the Lady of the Lake is simply stunning. \\"Down scope!\\" (:<br />Without a doubt, the scene in which Arthur is conceived is one of the wierdest sex scenes ever done on film.  I mean, Uther getting his jollies in a full suit of armor?  I guess they had a different concept of \\"safe sex\\" back then! HA!  One cannot help but wonder about John Boorman's decision to cast his own daughter for such a scene!<br />It's too bad that Nigel Terry didn't get more filmic exposure after this film (then again, Mark Hamill never really went anywhere after \\"Star Wars\\" either), but as I understand, he does more theater than film anyway.  It's ironic that none of the main characters were played by \\"big-name\\" actors; besides Terry (Arthur) and Williamson (Merlin), the late Nicolas Clay--rest in peace--(Lancelot), Cherie Lunghi (Guenevere), and Helen Mirren (Morganna) aren't exactly household names with the present-day movie-going public either, which is a shame as they are/were all extremely taltented performers. <br />Conversely, it's pleasantly ironic that somewhat smaller characters like Uther, Leondegrance, and Gawain are portrayed by folks who *do* become big-name stars, namely Gabriel Byrne, Patrick Stewart, and Liam Neeson (another great Irishman)!  It's also interesting to see young Byrne play the ...role of Uther Pendragon, as he's played rather wimpy characters in many of his other films.<br />The actions scenes are exciting and delightfully gory.  Granted, they're a tad unrealistic: mere swords defeat steel plate armor way too easily, when in fact even the chain mail armor the knights wore beneath the plate could withstand most sword blows.  But what the heck, this is fantasy and escapism, after all, so sit back and enjoy the ride!<br />Having read and mostly enjoyed Malory's \\"LeMorte Darthur,\\" I note two significant omissions in \\"Excalibur\\" which nonetheless do not detract from the overall quality of the film: (1) we never see or hear of Sir Galahad, and (2) Sir Tristram of Lyoness is skipped over, for which I'm actually thankful as I found it to be the most excessively long, dragged-out and least enjoyable section of the book.  Oh well, there's only so much of the legend you can cover in 140 minutes!
B00005R23X|2.0|What was coppola thinking when he cast Reeves, you can see that his british accent is artificial everytime he opens his mouth.<BR>The most annnoying thing about the movie was the sets, it would make one think this was a B-movie or something.<BR>The one thing i didn't get was that part where 2 women start kissing for no reason!!!
0385503954|5.0|I enjoyed &quot;Amsterdam&quot; well enough and &quot;Enduring Love&quot; very much (great opener), but this is better by far.  It is a wonderful page turner and the ending is so good that I only read 10 pages of the last chapter a night to savor it.  I think this novel can attract wide readership, but that doesn't mean you want to run off and read his other works, which may be much too dark for the typical reader.  I also would avoid reading plot summaries or all the stuff they put on the cover flaps...&quot;Atonement&quot; is more fun to read cold, since the plot is so ingenius and unexpected. And the writing is gorgeous. In short, this is a superb book and even my 75 year old Mom is raving about it.
B000063CPL|1.0|After attending several iron maiden concerts, which were pretty cool.  I decided to borrow Rock in Rio from a friend.  I listened to it for several weeks before making a final decision.  These guys do in fact [stink].  They may have tons of energy on stage with an incredibly large and fancy stage show.  Why does one need a large stage show?  Because these guys know that they stink.  <BR>Yanick is the worst guitarist ever, and the other two cool guys don't play very much of the solos.  When they do it is smothered with reverb and delay.  <BR>Bruce Dickinson has to be one of the worst vocalists of all time.  He could have come straight out of an amature punk rock band.  He is constantly off key, nasal, goofy sounding, feminine and a tad fruity.  Is that what us metal fans want to hear?  I don't think so.
B000003CMB|5.0|I'm a big big fan of the early Allmans but their super-long jams, breathtaking though they are, can be tedious even for me. That said, this is still one magnificent live album. As usual, the set kicks off with their take on 'Statesboro Blues', featuring  Duane's outrageously beautiful yet ferocious slide tone. 'You Don't Love Me' may be the best of the long tunes (in their case meaning more than 15 minutes!) they ever did, and this take of 'Elizabeth Reed' is even better than the studio version. Despite the extra length, there is not a wasted note anywhere, and the guitar solos are particularly fine. I feel the opposite way about 'Whipping Post'. Whereas the LP version boasts Gregg's incredible vocals on the chorus, here he strains to get to the notes. Perfectly understandable, of course, since it's virtually impossible to sing. The studio version also has the advantage of being MUCH shorter.<br />There are various CD versions of these performances now (including a cobbled together version of 'Liz Reed' which I have not heard), but my compilation would lose the 22-minute 'Whipping Post' for the searing live versions (found elsewhere) of 'Trouble No More' (is there a better Muddy Waters cover anywhere?), 'One Way Out' and Gregg's 'Don't Keep Me Wonderin'. The latter gem showcases Duane's unequalled slide technique in tandem with a howling harp riff -- it's a killer and it's only three minutes long! Check the various CDs available before you buy, but if you like the Allmans you really can't go wrong.
B00004TH7Z|1.0|Iron Maiden, never a popular or radio friendly band,  have declined in musicianship since the excellent Somewhere in time cd.  Everything after Somewhere in time ranged from fair to [poor].  Maiden's cds before Somewhere in time ranged from fair to good.   <BR>  Brave New World features terrible mix, aweful singing, miserable and meandering guitar solos, and amature production.  Listen guys, Bruce Dickinson has lost his voice.  The man couldn't sing good or on key if his life depended on it.  He is no Ronnie James Dio, Klaus Maine, or a Ripper Owens.  Bruce's vocal ability ranges somewhere below Blackie Lawless.    <BR>Why would you want to buy a cd that is such [stuff]?  Maybe because you've been a fan for years or you like their stage shows.  What ever the case, don't buy this [item].  Iron maiden spent millions on promotion and advertisement.  You will only be subjecting yourself to dissappointment and control.   You must make the decision yourself and realize that sometimes your favorite bands make terrible cds.  <BR> Do not buy this [item]! It is a waste of money!
B00003CXI0|2.0|The movie of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was, without a doubt, quite overrated. The book allowed one to reach into their minds and imagine the school and the setting, but the movie showed it to you and made you think less of the great excitement and more of the \\"cool special effects.\\" This is a problem because in the book there were no special effects- just excitement, creativity, and MAGIC. <br />On the other hand, that's how movies are. If they didn't come out and show you the setting they may as well have photocopied the book and recorded it. The movie can't be really blamed for that. Although it seemed like the movie creators were showing off at some parts (like when Harry, the main character, was so modestly lost and how poor he was at his old home) the special effects and ideas of the story were pretty good.<br />They could have chosen a wider variety of music- it got a little annoying, and, as many of our young viewers would point out, \\"corny.\\" But it was nice music- there isn't really much more to say. Anyway, if you were thinking about getting this movie, you'd be better off waiting for Star Wars: Episode 2 or The Lord of the Rings to come out. Or you could read the books- they are much better than the movie.
B00005Q3TZ|5.0|Well It finally came out! After being pushed back sevral times the vista edition of Pearl Harbor has finally been released. The package itself is a great deal and the extras can take hours to sort through. A highlight for me being the interactive attack feature which lets you view the film, on the set, and a cgi animated storyboard of the film. while the film is quite long and in some places dowright boring the attention to detail rivals that other monster Titanic (tho I enjoyed pearl harbor much more). if you're a fan of miltary films, liked pearl harbor, or just interested in the movie making process definitely pick up this copy of the movie. but be warned the added footage of the attack is in some spots quite graphic (think saving pvt ryan but scaled down) it's a great film and should be added to any collection. also if you've purchased the older dvd there's a coupon to get five dollars back from buena vista video!;)
B000001FY9|5.0|This is the best cd of all time. This is a great collection from Bob Marley. It really expresses his beleifs in peace and love. His music continues to touch peoples' lives even after his death. I would highly recommend this cd to anyone.
B000065V1V|5.0|Hmmm...as a card-carrying, record-buying Bowie fan of some 30 years, I'm going to try and write down my initial impressions of this important opus without holding it up to the super-nova light of Bowie's past numerous works of genius. \\"Heathen\\" is a fine record, relatively accessible upon first listen, but no doubt a work that the listener will gain further appreciation of upon repeated listenings. In many ways this record sounds like it could be the logical progression from his excellent \\"hours..\\" album of two years ago, more cohesive and aged like a fine port. Nice to have long-time Bowie producer and occasional bass guitarist Tony Visconti back in the fold (hey Tony, don't be afraid to take credit for those superb early 70's Strawbs recordings you produced...they never seem to surface on your list of credits). Together, Bowie and Visconti succeed in creating a fresh new sound, strangely (by today's musical standards) & wonderfully filled with analogue synths, some neat rockin' strings, & Mellotron (and so what if it might be a sample...I always loved Bowie's use of this classic keyboard...go listen to \\"Big Brother\\"). Bowie even dusted-off his Stylophone from the \\"Space Oddity\\" sessions! There is a thread of sadness - no, that's not accurate - more like a feeling of wistful reflectiveness - that permeates this record. Yet, in inimitable Bowie fashion, there seems to be a great deal of freshness and optimism bubbling just below the surface of this recording when considered as a whole. Any long-time fan of Bowie's will immediately recognize \\"Slip Away\\" as pure, unadulterated Bowie at his finest - this time immortalizing the great-lost comedic genius of Uncle Floyd, whose cable-only TV \\"vaudeville\\" show flickered boldly here in the NY/NJ area in the early 80's (for me, the feel here is very reminiscent of \\"The Bewley Brothers\\", where, in fact, we first heard David's reference to \\"slip away\\"); \\"I'm Afraid\\" is perhaps the best tip of the hat to the vintage rock n rollsound here, augmented by what has to be one of the finest, most driving string arrangements ever captured on plastic (!), and David's bold assertion (at least in today's mainstream mucky music markets) of \\"I believe in Beatles\\"?...Yee-hay! Casting-off those chains of industrial, techno, gloom & doom perhaps? You won't be able to get the catchy pop hooks of \\"Everyone Says Hi\\" out of your head; and try driving into a fiery sunset blasting \\"I Took A Ride On A Gemini Space Ship\\" and tell me you don't feel as though you could be riding the star-stream on the cusp of a new dawn...a brave new world...glittery, golden...filled with hope for a better future, as per Bowie's demands (pausing for meds...'scuse me...ok...but seriously...try the sunset suggestion...you'll see). Sometimes I think that Bowie, being the chameleon that he is, and ever-so-delicately plucking out the best of others and adapting them to his own style, might be spinning some Morrissey & Captain Sensible discs in his free time (well, we know he always had a special place in his heart for Syd's Pink Floyd...it's in here, believe me). This record captures Bowie refining his vital place in the future of rock; dusting-off his throne, if you will, as the space-invading crooner perhaps: refined, mature, but just as passionate and surreal as ever...doing the music he wants to do, with nary a care for a video! Now how's that for attitude? And let's face it, \\"Heathen\\" has got to be one of Bowie's greatest album covers ever. The upside-down printing of the title almost reads like Martian hieroglyphs...my only complaint with the packaging is the nearly microscopic spiraling lyrics, tiny enough to read, without the strikethroughs to boot! But hey, it makes you more determined to actually read 'em, I guess (though most are audible..half the fun of any new Bowie disc is reading the lyrics). Can we get CD's packaged in 12\\" vinyl sleeves? Anybody out there takin' notes? In conclusion, all I can say is...after I listen to\\"Heathen\\", I thank the Gods that Bowie's still breathin' (oops...hope I didn't traumatize anyone by using \\"Gods\\" in a sentence)! PS - I would just like to go on record as asserting that, despite all the seemingly negative press Tin Machine seems to get in hindsight, I think Bowie has progressed wonderfully onward and upward ever since he did that gig - and the material on both those records should NOT be written-off as trivial - for Bowie, at the time, it was ground-breaking, and it proved to be the kick in the [butt] he really needed to resurrect himself and not only cast-off what had become an almost floundering, directionless and insipid writing style, but more importantly, a slumping self-image as an artist too; there's lots of excellent material on those records...go re-discover them, and then spin \\"Heathen\\". Go...run along now...don't look back...
B000068TPN|3.0|We Were Soldiers suffers from some of the same problems as Mel Gibson's previous \\"epic\\" war film, The Patriot, namely corny drama.  Here's an example, when one of the wive's of the soldiers going off to battle believes that a \\"no whites\\" sign on a store is referring to clothing.  That's the perfect eye-roller.  Gibson's character is a little too hard to swallow, the fact that he's almost completely perfect.  He's a loving family man and a courageous leader who never ducks or even flinches in the heat of combat.  <br />But as far as combat goes, which makes up the majority of the film's last seventy minutes (making it about as action-packed as Black Hawk Down), this movie does succeed.  The combat scenes are probably the best ever filmed for a film set in the Vietnam era and while they don't mirror the shaky grit of what Ridley Scott accomplished, they're effective and bloody convincing (and I do mean bloody, this is a nasty, ultra-violent film).  In fact, those who didn't like Scott's \\"in your face\\" style (and yes, you know who you are) will probably find Randall Wallace's more \\"basic\\" choreography to their tastes.  <br />The Zulu-style plot (the \\"good guys\\" being heavily outnumbered by the enemy) will also hold a lot of appeal, as there always seems to be a certain appeal to rooting for the underdog (again, Black Hawk Down featured the same elements, to an even more extreme degree, as that event featured 100 American Rangers and Delta Force against possible tens of thousands of Somalis in the heart of the country's capital city).  <br />The performances are mostly top-notch, with Mel Gibson and Barry Pepper coming across the best.  Yes, Gibson's role really isn't well-written from a certain point-of-view, but there's no denying he does great work.  Pepper might just be a big star in the future, so long as he chooses works that show off his abilities.

B00005J6SZ|3.0|This is Madonnas Worst album. One Word. Her first selfitled LP was good and her third True Blue was excellent. Between those two albums she released Like A Virgin one of her most sucesful album and the album that made what she is to day. Why. This album has some catchy tunes and of course the singels Like A Virgin (her 2nd og third biggest US single). and Material Girl and other songs the songs are all right most of them are medicore or too poppish and sometimes very very annoying. But what makes them annoying. Well her voice. She used to live on the baby voice but hearing and entire 40 minute long album with the baby voice is not good for your ears and I got headache while listening to it. The album sounds also a lot like Kylies first albums. If you are a fan this is a must have and if you are going to be a fan this is also a must have but if you are trying to find anything with Madonna just because you want to hear anything by her dont by this.
B00004Z459|5.0|I bought this CD only liking a few songs that I knew of from the radio, etc., then I listened to it all the way through and I've come to find that there isn't a song on the CD that I don't like. I like this type of music because it actually has a beat and you can understand what Chester's saying RATHER than some guy who can't sing that just screams into the mic with a guitar in the background. If you like music you can actually understand the lyrics to that has rap/rock, I'd definately suggest you buy this CD.
0060926317|1.0|I am not fully aware of the controversy surrouning this book, but if anyone says that this account is true, those people are simply wrong.  The ideas that this goup of Aborigines could communicate telepathically, or sense when a vegetable in the ground was ripe by some sixth sense, are simply impossible.  And this says nothing of the endless cleches about how terrible people in advanced civilization are, and the fact that this book has a poor writing style, with errors spinkled throughout.  If we decide to follow what Marlo Morgan says, we should all strip down, get rid of anything we own that may or may not be helpful, and go walking in a boiling hot desert.  The talk of these Aborigines understanding all of life's problems and having \\"oneness\\" is bascally garbage,because it seems that their lifestyle is not exactly as great as Ms. Morgan tells us.  It is apparently very stylish to downgrade western civilization in comparison to basically ANYTHING, and Marlo Morgan sinks to a new low in this category.  Avoid this book at all costs, unless you'd like a good laugh from a very fictional tale.
B0000667J7|5.0|For all those Star Wars fans...this is the perfect gift. I got this for my daughter (who loves JarJar) and it's well worth the price!  Highly recommended!
0393317552|4.0|I picked this up sometime ago, after it was recommended to aspiring authors by Orson Scott Card in his book \\"Shadow of the Hegemon\\".<br />I found Diamond's thoughts and logic to be very insightful and intelligent. He makes a point and then backs it up with several detailed examples in history to support his thesis. <br />His writing also makes for fairly easy reading. It is clear and logical, with a natural progression leading from point to point as he traces the development of peoples from cave to modern man.... <br />After reading \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\", I think I have a much better understanding of human history. That in itself, is as high a compliment as I can pay any book.
B0000028RR|5.0|This is, and always will be, considered Rage Against the Machine's most important work.  Rage's signature sound, featuring Tom Morello's belligerent, aggressive guitar riffs and turntable-esque noise, Tim Bob's funky bass, and Zack de la Rocha's vitriolic raps, is fully defined on this album.  Their two subsequent albums, although excellent in their own right, do little to improve upon their debut's formula.  Unlike most great bands, Rage was fully grown even in its infancy, and was signed after doing only 10 power-packed shows in Los Angeles.  Although they presented fresh, worthy material, there was little room for improvement to the band's style, and very little experimentation would have been possible without fundamentally altering the band's sound.  This album, therefore, not only has the advantage of being their first album, but it also has the most start to finish quality.  Every tune is a highly explosive ball of energy, none of which is clearly superior to any of the others. <br />Rage Against the Machine also plays the most successful rock-rap fusion ever put on tape.  In the current rap-metal feeding frenzy, most bands have opted to mimic Korn (the other band whose work is often referred to as the most representative rap-rock fusion), who rarely sounds anything like rap, although their massive beats are infused with a rap-inspired appreciation for the visceral primacy of rhythm and sound.  Also, unlike bands like Limp Bizkit and Incubus, Rage Against the Machine do not cop-out by including a DJ.  You may not believe it when you listen to it, but all of the turntable-esque noises that accompany Zack's raps are created by Tom Morello's deft manipulation of his instrument (this information is prominently displayed in all of their albums).  Also, Zack almost always raps and very rarely sings, and his street-smart and politically aware lyrics come closer to convincing hip-hop subject matter than anything other bands have written.  Other bands have missed the fact that rhymes, lyrics, and credibility are more fundamental to rap than its sonics (although rap's &quot;beat&quot; is arguably more important to its white audience - the primary demographic for rap-rock).  Limp Bizkit have incorporated mainstream rap's overconfident swagger, and this may sell albums, but its flaky, commerical character makes its impact on rap-rock's legitimacy as a subgenre marginal compared to Rage's. Therefore, Rage have successfully fused what is essential about both rock and rap into a unique form that is worthy of the title &quot;fusion,&quot; and their work is probably respected by musicians of both genres more equally than any other band who has attempted this risky enterprise.  That Rage organized a tour with Wu-Tang for a brief period is suggestive of this (note: Durst's guest appearances on his albums were probably more indicative of the size of his band's pocket book than genuine artistic respect.  And Korn's alliance with Ice Cube. . . let's not even go there).  <BR>Unfortunately, this incarnation of Rage only made 3 albums, due to Zack's departure from the band.  Whether this was motivated by egoistic hubris, a desire to leave no trace of &quot;sell-out&quot; on his band's legacy (a label that was becoming more and more appropriate by the juxtaposition of the band's huge commercial success with its anti-capitalist and anti-establishment lyrics), or something quite else, we probably won't ever know.  What we do know is that Mr. de la Rocha was upset about the fact that his lyrics (the band's most important element to him) will never have as much impact as the stylistic and formal achievements this band makes on this album.  Unquestionably a classic album - 5 stars, and one of the finer albums of the 90's.  Future bands who successfully fuse rap and rock elements will cite this band, and this album particularly, as a primary influence.
B000002MP2|5.0|I got this C.D. back in the second grade and I have loved Green Day ever scince. This is not their first C.D., but it was the reason for their huge popularity.<br />  Burnout- 5/5- Great way to start off the album. Great guitar and lyrics.<BR>  Having a Blast-5/5- Another terrific song that will always be great.<BR>  Chump-4/5- Another great song but not as good as the first two.<BR>  Longveiw-5/5- Green Day's first single and one of their all time best songs. I love the bass.<BR>  Welcome to Paradise-5/5- Much better then the original song on Kurplunk, it was their second single.<BR>  Pulling Teeth-4/5- A great song with good lyrics, but it's too slow.<BR>  Basket Case-5/5- Green Day's third single and probably their greatest song, I love it!<BR>  She-4/5- Their 4th single of the album, She is a great song, but Basket Case is better.<BR>  Sassafras Roots-5/5- a great song to follow up She. It has nice lyrics and guitar.<BR>  When I Come Around-5/5- Their 5th and final single of the album, WICA is one of their finest pecies of music.<BR>  Coming Clean-4/5- Great start but gets a little worse throughout the song.<BR>  Emenius Sleepus-5/5- Most of the songs a written by guitarest Bille Joe Armstrong, but this song is written by bassest Mike Dirnt. Great song about an old friend who changed.<BR>  In The End-5/5- Second best song on the album, it is probably the fastest song, and thats what I like.<BR>  F.O.D.-4/5-Yes, F.O.D. does stand for ... off and die, and i really don't like the lyrics at all, but the music is really good.<BR>  All By Myself(Hidden Track)-4/5- again, the song is not written By Bille Joe Armstrong, but it is written by drummer Tre Cool and is sung by him. this would have gotten a 3/5 if it were not for the funny lyrics. Nice Way to close off the album.
B000068QVN|5.0|This live CD by Grand Funk Railroad is a must-have for any classic rock or Grand Funk Railroad fan. Mark, Don and Mel reach way down to their toes to belt the songs out, and it's all here--blistering guitar playing, bass lines that will rattle your entire house--even at low volumes, and downright primal drum solos, especially on T.N.U.C. The Shea medley is great--check out the beginning of I'm Your Captain/Closer to Home. <BR>Get this CD and remember some of the best music from the summer of 1971, or experience it for the first time. It was good then, and it's still good now.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Is an amazing artist and she rocked the charts and still is!!when she was new she just jumped right in with Eminem and Nelly. She stands out from all the other artists because she is soooooooooo good and her CD is too! There is not one bad song!! TRUST ME THERE ISN'T! She topped the charts with her CD and her hit single \\"Complicated\\"!  I can not go a day with out listening to her CD! And when I do listen to her CD I can't take it out of CD player. Out of all her 12 songs there isn't one don't want to listen to!<BR>  Her songs are thing relate to in some way. And since she wrote them its cool because its like I can relate to my faveorite singer AVRIL LEVIGNE! SHe rocks and so does her CD. Her next single I am positive is gonna be a huge hit because there is not one bad song! Her songs are all great and she really rocks! and she will not ever stop rocking CD players around the USA and CAN!<BR>It's really cool knowing that she wrote her song because that shows how involved she is with her CD and Her music. She just like everyone else and isn't stuck up like some other artists (.....BRITNEY!) she is spontaneous and like to have fun (like me!!)lol. The first day I got her CD I was like totally hiped becasue I have never in my whole life heard or seen such a great artist I got it the first day it was released and have listened to it ever since!<BR>   She rocks and her CD it the best!! Avril is a great and inspiring young artist and I think mostly everyone can relate to (and that makes it even better!) And thats why her and her CD ROCKs!!! ROCK ON SK8TER GIRL AND KEEP THE HITS COMING . GOOD LUCK AVRIL!!
B00005BIIP|5.0|For hardcore fans of Marillion, this line will strike a chord. It is indeed borrowed from the band's &quot;Brave&quot; liner notes. The reason? This album (of B-Sides by Porcupine Tree) is the closest thing to &quot;Brave&quot; that you as a fan of progressive rock will ever get in the near future. And only PT could do it... The matter of the fact is that there are certain magical albums that have that special night thing to them: it is at night when you can relate to them in the way they were conceived by the artist. And this is one of them, just like &quot;Brave&quot; did for Marillion.<br />I am sure that if you are a follower of the works of PT or if you are a prog rock fan you will enjoy this album, but as a reference, my favorite tracks were those that happened to exceed the 6-minute-long mark, namely &quot;Buying New Soul,&quot; &quot;Untitled,&quot; &quot;Cure for optimism&quot; and &quot;Ambulance Chasing&quot; for they are the tracks where Steven Wilson is able to take the listener through a musical trip... so, sit back, and play it loud and with the lights off!
B00005JKEC|4.0|I watched this video and first thing I want to say is; The Academy passed up Denzel playing Malcolm X and Rueben \\"Hurricane\\"Carter for this?It just goes to show you how the powers that be in Hollywood think. Don't get me wrong, he played the role and all, but I didn't like the character. You got this cop who \\"trains\\" this rookie cop who don't know nothing about nothing and gets caught up in this we. When he was coerced to take the drugs, he should have walked and asked for a transfer. But when he gets a beat down from the Latinos,all bets was off then. Basically,this guy wanted to be a good cop, and hooked up with a seasoned cop handling his own personal business on company time and got more than he bargained for in the process. This is one gritty film folks.
B0000214F3|5.0|We have watched this repeatedly!  Only the reruns of 'The Wizard of Oz' and 'The Godfather' have been accorded this honor in our house.  The haunting rendition of &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; at the close of this movie stays playing in my head.   Now I have ordered IZ CDs to keep that going on and on too!!
B00003CXDZ|5.0|I think that there is a while I haven't seen a movie as good as this one. Though there are some things that bugs me in this movie, i really liked it! In two weeks, i have seen it like 6 times!<BR>What bugs me in this movie is that they often repeat their words... Like, the one who sing \\"The Show Must Go On\\" must have had said like 5 times this sentence before he sings it and 3 times after he sang it... But otherweise it was great! I like the medleys in this movie! there are so great! they used the good songs!<BR>Just buy it! It's the best movie for those who like music and love.
B00005K3NY|1.0|I'm not going to comment on the story line.  Others have done that well.  This review concerns the DVD release.<br />Despite that the film has mono sound, it still appears fine...until chapter 12.  About 2/3 of the way into the film, you can tell they did voice overs for the rest of the movie, and poorly.  The voices are so out of sync with the lip movements, that I was unable to enjoy the rest of the film.<br />I have the video tape as well (purchased when it first came out many years ago) and although being pan and scan, it is clearly superior.  Not only are the voices original and therefore in sync, but the background sounds are noticeable too.  For example when the characters are talking and a door is closed, you can't hear the door shut on the DVD because the voice overs muffle all other noises.  On the video tape, it is as clear as day.<br />I recommend watching the video tape until they come out with a better DVD.
B000066NW0|5.0|For one thing in my whole life I haven't heard or seen such an great artist. Also, the popular Avril was new when she started but she jumped right into the charts with Eminem and Nelly! She topped the charts with her super cd \\"Let Go\\", and she still is. Avril also managed to go to #1 and TRL and stay with in the top three vidios with her hit single  \\"Complicated\\". She will definately do it again with her next signle no matter which song it it because all of her song off her CD are great!<BR>   Her CD is more than just music it's meaningful. Her CD can put you in the mood for anything! Her song\\"Anything but Ordinary\\" is one of my faveorites because I can really relate to it and it is just a great song like her whole CD. Also, I think the fact that she wrote her song is cool because it shows that she get involved with her music and dousn't just sing it because she like the beat or the song (thats not a bad thing though) she does that and she can relate to it because she wrote the songs! Pluse when I can relate to her songs it's cool because its like I am relating not to just the song but to my faveorite singer Avril Levigne!!<BR>   Avril is a is a great inspiring young signer that I think many canrelate to her songs on her GREAT CD and her. Her CD is a great way to show who you are as a person, and it brings out a fun side. And when you get board aor when ever you can pop the CD in and listen . And when I do that I can't seem to stop listening!!! Her CD is really really really really great and it deserves every award out there!! Avril Levigne ROCKS!!!!!
6305897786|2.0|OK as far as im concerned there are two types of DVDs out there:<BR>DVDs that you purchase to watch over and over again cos the movie or content is really THAT good, and DVDs you only RENT because you missed out on the movie's release on the big screen.<br />Now Nineth Gate is an entertaining movie dont get me wrong...i enjoyed it...a bit. But are you really willing to purchase a flick on DVD that you;re only going to watch once. Believe me once is more than enough. Unless youre like me; slow and have this urge to watch a movie a second time sometimes to pick bits of the story i missed out on the first time around.<br />Nineth Gate falls under the &quot;Rent Only DVD&quot; category as far as i'm concerned. Its good to watch once...perhaps a second time out of boredom. Really not worth spending the money on this. And unless youre a HUGE Johnny Depp (and we're talking competely and absolutely fanatical and obssessed by him) and MUST have every single one of his movies both on VHS and DVD, then i would recommend that you either buy this flick second hand or just rent it from  your nearest Blockbusters Video or somewhere like that.
0316666343|5.0|Forget THE CORRECTIONS - Here is the first literary classic of the 21st century.  This is a book which should be read by and enjoyed by readers of most ages - 9-90!!!! The story's subject sounds horrific and I admit, when I first read the summary I didn't think it was the kind of book I would want to read.  But then I began to hear more and more buzz about it and gave it a second look.  Thank goodness I did!  This is one of the best novels I have read in a long time - And to think, this is Alice Sebold's first novel (her first book was an autobiography).  The story begins with - without the gruesome details - the brutal rape, murder and dismemberment of young Susie Salmon (like the fish!).  From the second chapter forward you will begin to see life on Earth as Susie sees it from \\"her heaven\\" - Susie follows her friends and family around for the next 10 years and witnesses, as the reader does, the heartaches, joys, successes, failures, mistakes and progress they all make as a result of Susie's death.  It seems ridiculous at first when Susie talks about her intake counselor in heaven - but as the reader reads on, you begin to see Susie's heaven and imagine that perhaps, heaven is whatever you want it to be - whatever our hearts and minds make it.  According to this book, each person's heaven is what they want and/or need it to be.  It's actually a very comforting thought.  As the reader goes through each chapter and learns how each character grows and changes, you witness how Susie's death affected each of the characters and made them into the people the people that they become.  In other words, each character goes through changes and grows in ways that wouldn't have otherwise been possible if Susie had not died when she was 13 years old.  There are some parts when the reader may question the reality of the situation and may think that Ms. Sebold has gone too far - as when a \\"Ghost\\"- like experience places Susie back on Earth in her friend's Ruth's body and how the dastardly Mr. Harvey meets his maker  (believe me, you can't imagine it - you have to read it to believe it!).  But other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and can easily see how it could become the first real classic of the 21st century.  It should be require reading for High School English classes, Creative Writing classes and anyone who wants to enjoy a really, really good, thought-provoking book.  I'd give it 10 stars if I could!!
0312265859|3.0|Okay, I am reviewing this book for the die hard fans of Steph.  Out of all the books, this was the least entertaining.  I liked it better than many other books I have read, but in comparison to the others, it was just not up to par.  It seems like Evanovich felt like she had to turn it out and really didn't put enough time and thought into it.  Steph just isn't as out there as she usually is.  Evanovich uses lots of outs and doesn't develop it nearly enough.  If you are a major fan, read it.  It's still a good book.  It's just not what I expected or wanted.  When I finished it, I had a bittersweet feeling all through me.  I expected much better, but was throughly disappointed.
B00005YU1O|5.0|This movie is extremely strange, and certainly catches one off guard with the unorthodox animation. Shot on equipment many people have in their own homes, the many vignettes were then animated by artists who colored over the original live footage. The animation pulses (not the cold ueber-realistic 3D kind, nor the flat expressionless cartoon kind), deeply individualistic--and sometimes borders on the weird, as when a chimpanzee gives a lecture. <br />Deeply thoughtful, often shocking, this movie is eerily reminiscent of a half-conscious five A.M. dream--the main character wanders (and sometimes floats) around speaking to decidely strange characters who spout off about life, music, the dream state. This is a brilliant movie--but only if one allows it to be. Some of the intense philosophical discussion can be wearing (even boring) if one doesn't pay attention and get into the spirit of the thing.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This is a Top Ten Film.  Any movie that can make my head spin tends to be a great one.  The unfortunate fact is that movies like Requiem, Memento, Seven, and American History X do not come around all that often.  I guess that is what makes them so great.  I did not get to catch this jewel on the big screen but the DVD did it justice.  I would make the complaint that the sound is not 5.1 but hey, can't have it all.  <BR>The sick story here was done in the most beautiful way.  the camera work was incredible, probably some of the most interesting angles that I have seen(without annoying me).  The speed was also incredible,  I will guarantee that at the end of the movie you will have to sit for a few to gather yourself.  you will feel like a part of something big here because this movie, as gritty and small as it may have seemed said something that no other movie has about human weakness and suceptability.  Fact of the matter is, we are all addicts we have no choice in any matter, free will is an imaginary thing that is totally dependant on our addictions.  Think about yourself or your neighbor, and then watch this movie.  Then take another look.<BR>We are all fortunate to have films like this, that are so full of truth.  Happy endings in the real world are rare, so when a movie does not have a happy ending it wins a place in my heart.  A happ ending would have been an insult to the serious moviegoer who believes in what they are watching.  Life does not occur without sadness, this film proves it.
B000002U82|4.0|I was never a big pink floyd fan, but someone introduced me to it when I went to college this year, and I just have to say &quot;Time&quot; is one of the most amazing songs ever compilated.  Many a day was spent just kicking back and listening in my dorm. This song, complete with ringing alarm clocks, really does wake one up to the pure genius that is pink floyd.
B00005JKQZ|3.0|This is a very well-acted film purportedly about John Nash the brilliant, highly eccentric and mentally ill mathematician. It is all rather predictable, and disappointingly is really about schizophrenia rather than academia and mathematics. I had rather hoped this book would be more about science and mathematics - as that would be really so much more interesting and much more novel. Instead we do get a rather typical Hollywood tale of genius (why are all geniuses portrayed as &quot;weird&quot; in the movies?) and madness (see &quot;Shine&quot; for a more powerful account). Nash's schizophrenia is interestingly (and a little surprisingly) dramatized. Jennifer Connolly was endearingly supportive for reasons that are not all that clear - I guess Russell Crowe-as-Nash is just so hunky? Who knows? It is not really explored. Perhaps she, as a mathematician herself, was and is able to appreciate his genius?<br />Anyway - pick any Hollywood movie about mental illness and you have essentially seen this film. It  is well filmed, well-acted and I think rather a slightly tired retread of a familiar theme. The make up job was remarkable as Crowe ages superbly during the film - Jennifer Connolly not so well. If you have not seen a film like this then you will enjoy it, but for those of us who have it is all rather safe and predictable. One day I would like to see a film about a more typical scientist or mathematician - but maybe it would be too dull to show?
0451191153|3.0|When I first read this book in my younger years, I thought that it was magnificient.<br />Looking back, I realize that it has taught me that it is indeed possible to say a great deal and simultaneously assert nothing. If you want a first class example of that, here it is.

1881273156|5.0|My husband and I read this book when we were first dating.  To this day what we learned about each other as a result of reading this book is still true.  We have been together for 6 years now.  It is good to know what is important to the person you love. The word love means so many things to so many people.  This book helps you see the order of importance that acts of kindness, talking with eachother, giving gifts etc are for you and your spouse.  Over and over my husband and I have been able to draw on the knowledge we gained from reading this book together.  It helps me understand where my husband comes from and why he reacts as he does in different situations.  It was a valuable tool for dating and marriage.
0446608955|5.0|I really enjoyed A Walk to Remember.  I have to say this book is my favorite. This story takes the reader through stages of love, laughter, illness, health and youth.<BR>     The story will touch anyone who has a heart.  Reading this book has helped me understand more about leukemia, and the affects it has on it's victims.  My aunt recommended that I should read this book.  I read the book and loved it!  It is very rare for me to experience the emotions I had while reading this book.  <BR>    I myself am not a big reader, but this book I could not put down.  In my own opinion this is the best book I've read by Nicholas Sparks.  After reading A Walk to Remember, I plan to read more books by Sparks.  <BR>    This book was very easy for me to relate to, since I have had a family member die with leukemia.  If you are trying to decide on a book to read, I recommended A Walk to Remember to anyone with a heart.  I promise Sparks will not disappoint anyone who reads this book.  Do yourself a favor and read it!
B000068QY7|3.0|\\"Heathen Chemistry\\", the first Oasis album in roughly two years sees chief songwriter Noel Gallagher sharing his duties with the entire band (minus Alan White.)<br />\\"The Hindu Times\\" is a great opening track. Featuring a rocking eastern style guitar riff (how often do you hear that?) and a chorus that you just want to shout along with. <BR>\\"Force of Nature\\" debuted a few years ago in the British film \\"Love, Honour and Obey\\". It's looped drum beat reminds you of Iggy Pop's \\"Nightclubbing\\". It's ...swagger with a little guitar distortion and I love it. Noel's vocals suit it just fine.<BR>Gem Archer's only contribution to the album is the surprisingly strong \\"Hung In A Bad Place\\". I really didn't know what to expect from Gem but this is a great rock song. I've never been a big fan of Liam Gallagher's style of singing but he really matches up quite nicely to this track, I especially like how he sings the title, I know that sounds like a simple thing to say but it's what makes the song catchy.<BR>Wow, I don't know how to approach \\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\\". Easily the best song on the album. It begins with a melancholy piano followed by Liam's plaintive wail...sounding full of knowing sadness yet an underlying positive feeling. Noel's writing on this track brings back that wonderful vibe from 1995's \\"Don't Look Back In Anger\\". One of the biggest compliments I can give a song is that it made me cry and that's exactly what happened when I first heard this track (ironic considering the title eh?) Beautiful.<BR>Liam's first self-penned track for the album is \\"Songbird\\". A fairly simple accoustic song and I must say, I've never heard Liam sing like this. He usually has a sneering, whine but he actually sings this time and makes me wish he'd go this route more often. \\"Songbird\\" makes for pleasant listening.<BR>Another Noel track is \\"Little By Little\\" (he sings this one as well.) It comes across as a sure single release with a chorus that's easy to sing along with. While Noel handles the vocals with confidence, the song certainly breaks very little new ground. The song seems to copy off of several of Noel's older tracks, the ending is reminiscent of \\"Champagne Supernova\\" for example. A decent song but eerily familar.<BR>The lone Andy Bell track comes in the form of an instrumental called \\"A Quick Peep\\". Honestly, it's a waste of space...a true album filler. Unlike \\"The Swamp Song\\", \\"A Quick Peep\\" meanders along, going nowhere.<BR>Noel's \\"(Probably) All In the Mind\\" is an easily forgettable composistion and likely should've been relegated to B-side status. \\"Idler's Dream\\" (the B-side to \\"The Hindu Times\\" single) should be on the album instead. Unfortunately....two poor songs in a row and can be skipped past as you won't be missing anything worthwhile. Unremarkable.<BR>\\"She Is Love\\", a rather sappy title for a rock band. Noel sings this one but even that cannot save it from mediocrity. This is one of those songs you see in a romantic comedy, playing along to a montage of a couple in love on a date. However it's a listenable misfire.<BR>When people claim Oasis rip-off the Beatles, I usually scoff but when you hear Liam's \\"Born On A Different Cloud\\" you have to stop and remind yourself it isn't John Lennon singing. I'm not saying that's a bad thing mind you, just a bit jarring. The song has great atmosphere with subtle vocal distortion and a mid-tempo beat. Probably the \\"coolest\\" offering from this album.<BR>Liam gets to end the album with \\"Better Man\\", which comes off as an unreleased Kula Shaker piece. It's a bit of a disappointment considering some of the epics that capped off previous Oasis albums like \\"Champagne Supernova\\" and \\"The Masterplan\\". I'm not saying I don't like it, I'm just saying it would've been more fitting to place it somewhere in the middle. \\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\\" would've ended the album on a huge high note.<BR>There is a \\"hidden\\" track roughly 28 minutes after \\"Better Man\\" ends. Of course it's untitled and deservedly so as it serves no point, it's just there. It's simply another instrumental track and I must say, two instrumentals on one album smacks of laziness.<br />Minus a few so-so tracks, this is a fairly strong album with several high notes struck. Liam's songwriting is much better than \\"Little James\\" (off the previous studio album) seemed to indicate. Gem added a kicking song and Noel (mostly) delivered the goods. However, if Andy Bell's \\"A Quick Peep\\" (and his B-side to the \\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\\" single - \\"Thank You For the Good Times\\") represents the best he can give Oasis, I'd rather he just stick to playing bass. Regardless of that minor quibble, \\"Heathen Chemistry\\" is a good album but just short of great.
1573225517|3.0|\\"High Fidelity\\"is a novel written by Nick Hornby. The protagonist is Rob Fleming, he is left by his girlfriend Laura and because of that he thinks about his other relationships that ended, too. He starts to meet his ex-girlfriends only to understand why they have left him. The novel has got a first person narrator to show the reader Rob's feelings, his behaviour and his way of life. <BR>In my opinion \\"High Fidelity\\" is an interesting novel. It's written in a colloquial way and the stereotypes of men are shown and confirmed.

0151008116|5.0|Yann Martel's Life of Pi is a wondrous novel, a marvelous novel--there is much to wonder and marvel at.  The story is simple, yet complex at the same time and can be read on many levels.  On the surface, this is the story of a young man who grows up in India and at sixteen, en route to Canada with his family, finds himself the sole human survivor of a shipwreck, afloat on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger.  The story is divided into two sectins.  The first occurs before he gets on the boat and tells of his life as a young zookeeper's son.  As a boy, he decides to become a practicing Catholic, Muslim and Hindu, all at once. His ruminations on zookeeping and religion lay the groundwork for how he could possibly survive on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger.  Beyond the story, however, is an examination of religion and of writing, of how to write about religion and the religious experience.  It is an examination on the strengths (and weaknesses) of religious belief.  The novel also ends with a philisophical bang, which I won't give away, but which did blow me away.  It wasn't until I got to that point that I became truly impressed with what Martel has done here.  Before that, I thought it was a very well done novel, but with the ending, it becomes much more.  Life of Pi is not a typical novel.  The story, its charming main character and his narrative style are all different than most everything else you can get today.  That uniqueness makes it that much more special.  I highly recommend Life of Pi.  Enjoy.
0451203933|5.0|What an amazing request our country can make on the youngest Americans with the brightest futures.  This is an excellent book that is hard to put down.  While I am no expert on what occurred in Somalia, Bowden offers what appears to be a fair and in-depth look into a most unfortunate event in American history.  Rather than blame Clinton, the generals, the soldiers, or any specific actor or set of actors, the author walks us through a nightmare of a mission-gone-wrong.  He offers concluding comments that points fingers at MANY people involved.  And in effect, aren't we all really somewhat involved and somewhat worthy of blame?

0515125024|4.0|Jack Reacher is an interesting character. He's an ex-military policeman, wandering the country as a sort of modern-day knight errant, not really doing much of anything, when he stumbles into the kidnapping of a young female F.B.I. agent who has some interesting family connections. The kidnappers aren't very good at what they do, so we soon find out who they are, though their designs are somewhat obscure, mainly because they're crazy, and their plot doesn't make a lot of sense. Reacher is kidnapped too, and they're taken west into the heartland, journeying to who-knows-where, where the climax of the novel occurs.<br />As I said, Reacher's an interesting character. He's in control of the situation almost the whole time, and very controlled himself. He's an excellent shot (and uses this a great deal in the latter part of the book) and a real tough guy. There are, however, some enigmatic parts to his character. He seems to wander the planet without rhyme or reason, just cause he feels like it. There's no hint why he left the army (he apparently was very good at what he did, and didn't stick around for his twenty, which guarantees a pension) or why he does what he does. There's almost a sense of apathy about him at times, which suddenly transforms into concern for the lives of people he doesn't even know. Frankly, this makes me want to read more in the series, to find out what's up. <br />This is a hard book to review. It's a suspense story, but I didn't feel there was a lot of suspense. That didn't mean I didn't like it, though, mainly because I enjoyed the main character, Jack Reacher. I think I will look for other books in the series.
0871137380|5.0|This is an excellent book.<br />Working from hundreds of interviews, the author has captured a soldier's view of the Battle in Mogadishu, Somalia.  This two day fire fight cost a dozen and a half American soldiers their lives -- and sent our country packing from the god-forsaken mess of a non-functioning entity that was early 1990's Somalia.<br />This is a ground level, violent, confused battle book.  The book hardly mentions the larger mission and dwells not on why we were there.  It is a group biography of young Americans who made up the Ranger, Delta Force and helicopter fighters stationed on the east coast of Africa in support of a United Nations feeding and pacification exercise.<br />What started off as a mission to grab the chief lieutenants of a local strongman disintegrated into a bloody mess after thousands of Somali's rose in opposition and defiance.  The American team was pinned to their urban location after two Black Hawk helicopters went down from enemy fire.  What was supposed to be an hour hit and run strike drag out over two days by the need to get to and secure the crash sites and the surviving crew and passengers.<br />The book is fast paced and cuts quickly between several dozen characters.  It can be confusing and hard to follow at times, but this has the effect of illustrating well how confused and disoriented our soldiers were (and probably how most battles are).  The tremendous amount of time and effort that went into the hundreds of interviews conducted by the author produce a vivid first person account of battle.  It illustrates well the point made by one veteran in the book that &quot;young soldiers can't wait to get into their first war.  Veteran soldiers can't wait to get away from war.&quot;<br />First rate, exciting and a tremendous tribute to our fighting men, if not to the political decisions that put them there.
1573225517|4.0|When i started reading the novel \\"high fidelity\\" by Nick Hornby, i was immediately caught by the style it is written in.For me as a german student in the upper grade, it was a bit difficult, to understand the whole content of the book, because almost the whole book is written in colloquial englisch.I couldn't understand every ironically written sentence, but when i watched the film in english, it was easier to understand.I was hardly impressed by the main character, Rob, who behaved like an idiot and didn't really care about other peoples' feelings.He is such an  egocentric man and when i read the book, i often wondered why he did things the way he did.I wasn't angry about his behaviour(i often have problems, when the main character doesn't act the way i want him to act...)when the women disappeared, because these experiences were necessary for him to change. All in all i liked the book, but i'm sure that not every kind of person is able to understand it.
B000065U1N|5.0|This movie not only provides a Great overview of the situation that took place in Somalia and Bosnia but it also really makes you feel like you were there in the fight with the people. After watching this movie I now appriciate the men and women that protect our great land. I highly recomend this movie for the older members of the family, due to some graphic injury scenes.
B000066NW0|5.0|If u are expecting this CD to be a punk CD, then sorry, this ain't it.  Perhaps 'Skater Boi' may be classified as a bit of punk, and there are a few rock songs such as `Losing Grip' and `Unwanted.'  For the most part, most songs are better described as alternative rock or rock ballad.<br />Avril's music reminds me a bit of the The Cranberries, which is certainly a complement to the 17 years old singer.  Her style can also be described as a mix of Alanis Morisette and Natalie Imbruglia.  Avril's biggest talent, however, lie in the beautiful and mesmerizing voice of hers.  This is especially evident in 'Anything but Ordinary', which is another insanely catchy song with good lyrical message in not wanting to be just another ordinary person.  'My world' is a autobiographical ballad, describing Avril's life in her home town, Nepanese.<br /> Both are incredibly catchy songs that's unlike any other which I could think of.
B00005QFE5|5.0|I just watched this movie because of the great reviews it received here, and I must say they are correct.  A very well produced and moving story.
B000001EMW|5.0|Take Metallica. Mix in four cellos. Shake well. If you enjoy the metal stylings of Metallica, then this CD is a must buy. From the second you pick up the CD in the store (or take it out of the mail box) to the end of Welcome Home (Sanitarium) you will not stop laughing. The concept of four cellos playing metal is an strange one, but Apocaliptica does it masterfully. Bravo.
0446608955|5.0|After seeing the movie, I knew that I must get the book.  I only managed to get my hands on it and I was blown away. <BR>    A Walk to Remember is a story of Landon, a 17 year old in his last year of High School.  Through a twist of fait, he falls in love with Jamie, the preacher's daughter and the girl that touched his heart.  Throughout the book, Sparks keeps you on a journey of true love and faith. <BR>     Never  have I read a book so deep and bittersweet.  And the challenge that overcomes them both in the end will have you in tears and never forgeting this book which is truley &quot;A Walk to Remember.&quot;
630575067X|4.0|Overall this movie was awsome. It sets the beginning of the Star Wars saga. It may not be like the original but remember that the original was made 16 years before. However the special effects are way better like the underwater city in the beginning, the podrace sequence, and the final battle between the Gungans and the droid army at the end. The acting isn't the best as it was in the original. The queen's costumes where beautiful and you can see by watching this film that Lucas put a lot of time and effort into making it. This is the first movie in which a character is completly digitalized. I do agree that Jar Jar was very annoying at times but the newer ones like Attack of the Clones will not have him as much and for me it was kind of entertaining to watch him on screen. I also would have liked to see some more of Darth Maul as he only appeared in several scenes. Natalie Portman is fantastic and is even better in Episode 2 as she is able to play and show two sides to the queen and portray her as a negotiator and a fighter. If you don't like this one the other ones will be much better as the plot will enhance eventualy causing Anakin to become the evil Darth Vader and give birth to Luke and Leia.
B000007MVX|5.0|Ian Anderson's lyrics really shine in this cryptic but beautiful concept album, which is woven through with both religious imagery and bits of pop culture.<br />A caution to the collector, however: the description above lists this edition of the album (regular Chrysalis CD release) as having 16 tracks, like the original LP. The CD is actually divided into only two tracks: sides A and B of the original LP. Thus, if you want to listen to just a single movement of this rock pseudo-symphony, you'll have to spring for the gold release.
B000002UAU|5.0|In December 1977, my only exposure to the Beatles to that point, was &quot;Abbey Road&quot; which I had heard in the car that summer (and which I coveted for my own record player) and &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; which I had acquired that autumn because the local record store (actually, the record department at Korvettes) was out of &quot;Abbey Road&quot;.  When Chanukah came around that year, Korvettes was still out of my heart's desire, so my parents got me &quot;Sgt. Pepper's&quot; instead...<br />I was disappointed until I slipped this gem of an album onto my turntable and was carried away by the wonderful, catchy, sometimes mysterious, sometimes funny songs.  To this (then) 8 year old's ears, this was pure magic...Spooky songs about circuses and meter maids, sad songs about a teen-age girl running away from home (who I imagined to be my cousin Leah...), a happy song about growing old which reminded me then and still does of my grandpa.  A mysterious, exotic number which reminded me of the middle-east (I didn't know from Indian music then...)  Everything flowed together to weave a picture of a little world created by the Beatles, culminating in an ominous and mysterious picture of the real world.  This was an album my friends and I could sit with and lose ourselves in conversation...actually taking us away from our daily wiffle-ball games in the backyard in Staten Island...Most of all, this album was just pure fun.<br />And that's the great thing about &quot;Sgt. Pepper's&quot;...It works on a level simple enough to be accessible to an 8-year old, but it also invites the type of analysis and discussion found in the hundreds of reviews found below...There aren't many albums that this can be said about and that in itself makes &quot;Sgt. Pepper's&quot; special.<br />Now to my favorite songs...Well, they're almost all favorites, but I love &quot;Getting Better&quot; with its great driving guitar beat and sitar inflections here and there; &quot;Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite&quot; is just a whacked-out freewheeling carnival of a song which is about as ominous a sound as I can think of; &quot;Within You, Without You&quot; is George Harrison's second best Indian-toned song (&quot;The Inner Light&quot; is his best, in my opinion&quot;); &quot;Lovely Rita&quot;, &quot;Good Morning, Good Morning&quot; and &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Reprise&quot; just rock out, and &quot;A Day In The Life&quot; is a gem of a song which brings us crashing back to the real world, after being taken for a musical journey in the rest of the album...These, of course, are my favorites but there are only excellent songs on this album.<br />In sum, this is a masterpiece of an album which has appeal for all ages, kids and adults...This is an ESSENTIAL ALBUM FOR ANY SERIOUS POPULAR MUSIC COLLECTOR.
B000065V1V|5.0|During the whole of the nineties Bowie has devoted himself to restoring his artistic creativity which had been shambled in the dreary commercial eighties (and he was not the only one who suffered from that period of sleazy mtv wallpaper rock). The results were in effect experimental but mostly unstable, in evidence of the identity crisis he was in: where in the seventies he invented strange and new identities, he was now groping to find himself, most beautifully reflected in his portrait of the modern artist at loss, the difficult and hazy record Outside. Now, at last he offers us the synthesis of all those trials in the mature record Heathen. All comes together. His strangeness and multiple personalities of the seventies merge into a heartfelt representation of his new found true face that is diverse but also one. The fact that he uses a lot of the old synths sounds but with an analogue feel (the music was also recorded anologue) and a distinct modern style says enough. Not to mention the personal tone of the well crafted, immediately classic songs (even the covers bear that special Bowie mark , as if they belong to no one but himself). But there is more, it is also a piece of art you can love. The athmosphere is one of alienation and warmth at the same time, much as was the case with Low. His singing is superb, combining the intense and breakable voice of Hunky Dory with the crooning of Station to Station. And the overall sound is open, which you could not say of the all too urgent Earthling. This could not have been made in the seventies, yet it would have been heralded then as a masterpiece and a logical follow up of his famous trilogy with its appendix (namely Scary Monsters). In retrospect it sheds an approving light over his uneasy work in the nineties. He has come at ease with his own strangeness again, and what a joy, because despite the gloominess there is humour in this shining pearl.
B000067CPX|1.0|I am a huge fan of the chili peppers.  I like almost all of their music.  I only like 3 songs on this cd, the rest are terrible.  The tracks are all lifeless and sorry attemps for singles.  Compared to Britney Spears, Britney spears tops em.  Do not waste you're money. Trust me.
048640658X|5.0|First off, let's clarify one thing: when rating Shakespeare, I'm rating it as opposed to other Shakespeare. Otherwise, the consistent \\"5 stars\\" wouldn't tell you much. So when I rate this play five stars, I'm saying it's one of Shakespeare's absolute best.<br />It's a real shame that the language has changed so much since Shakespeare wrote that his plays are no longer accessable to the masses, because that's who Shakespeare was writing for, largely. (Especially in his comedies.) Granted, there is enough serious philosophizing to satisfy the intelligensia, but the action and bawdy humor would surely satisfy any connouiseur of modern hit movies, if only they understood it. Unfortunately, while the plots are good enough to be lifted and reworked into modern movies (and they frequently are, sometimes more subtly than others) once you change the language, it's no longer Shakespeare, until and unless the rewriter can be found who has as much genius for the modern language as Shakespeare had for his own. So far, that hasn't happened, and I don't expect it to any time soon.<br />As Shakespearean plays go, \\"The Tempest\\" is a fairly easy read. There are a few places where the footnotes are absolutely essential, and a few others where the main thrust can be grasped without them, but a double-entendre might be missed. But by and large, the play is readable for the literate modern reader. Granted, the romance element is as shallow as it usually is in Shakespeare, and there really isn't much drama: there's never any real doubt that Prospero and Ariel have matters well in hand. Still, it's an amusing comic romp, and that's all it was ever really intended to be. Don't try to read too many levels of symbolism and allegory into this play (or any other of Shakespeare's comedies, for that matter). You might as well do serious, in-depth analysis of the deeper meaning of \\"Men In Black II\\".
6300248550|5.0|In my opinion, this Jane Eyre is the best dramatization of all. I have seen all the versions since the 1944 movie with Orson Wells. <br />Timothy Dalton is superb as Mr. Rochester and Zelah Clarke IS Jane Eyre. A friend of mine said that Timothy was good but too handsome for Mr. Rochester. I don't agree. Did all men at that period HAVE to be homely? Actually, one forgets about Timothy handsome appearance when he becomes the brooding, sarcastic, and even hostile, Mr. Rochester.<br />I have the book, and this version showcases more details from the book than other versions. The period details and cinematography are wonderful. A 'must have' for those who love the classics!
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Diverse is the word springs to mind when listening to this. It's a burlesque show, with humour, sentiment, satire, nostalgia and flashes of personal heartfelt confession, all brought with a fervour seldom heard in these days of poses and distraction. Maybe overall it goes a little less deep than Time out of Mind (it compares to it like Desire to Blood on the Tracks or Basement Tapes to Blonde on Blonde), but it's much more direct, less abstract and musically infected with more genius, while sounding like an authentic Sun recording, clear and agile, a cutting edge on even the softest moments. Gone is the self pitying pessimism. Here's a man with a dark view on the world, but ready to fight and live, even able to feel pleasure and celebrating the old times before technocrats ruled the world, while bringing its  bluesy fruits into the modern time. Mayby he had something like this in mind when he recorded the severely flawed Self Portrait, showing the spirit of America and its various influences on him, but only now, ripened and without the need to shed of his troublesome fans, he is capable of giving of this engaging beautiful introduction to his own heritage and teritory of the mind and soul. It's as if you hear the ghosts of Muddy Waters and Shakespeare in unison. When he performed live in the Netherlands last spring he sent a shiver through the crowds, sounding better than ever, in fact, almost everybody, even in the press, said they had seldom/never heard anything as good as this, and it's reflected in this gem.
B000065V1V|4.0|I've listened to this one just over a week and I must say that I am turning in to a Bowie-maton.  Walking around like a moron singing \\"Everyone Says Hi\\".  But I can't help it. It's infectuous.  The words are resonating with me.  Change we must.  Move on.  But don't forget the \\"girl next door\\", \\"the guy upstairs\\" or \\"your big fat dog\\".  Come to think of it, is Bowie talking about getting to Heaven and seeing all your friends, etc?  Hmmmm.  Ditto \\"A Better Future\\".  I DO demand a better future.  Been doing it for friggin' years.  I'm thinking of printing a t-shirt with this slogan.  Hear me out!  The fathoming of all these bleeps, bloops and searing synth sounds coupled with catchy melodies and soulful stirrings is invigorating me. I am waking in the dead of night uttering \\"took a trip in a Gemini Spacecraft\\".  And \\"Slip Away\\".  And \\"I Would Be Your Slave\\".  To quote our man of the hour: \\"Something good is happening and I don't know what it is\\".
B00005YW4H|3.0|There are a couple of cuts on this CD that stand out as wonderful, but in the main it is slow and a bit dreary.  Jones doesn't have the best voice in the world but her styling is fine, and the supporting musicians are good.  When you feel like relaxing background music, you can put this on the player, but don't expect to start dancing, singing along, or tapping your toes.

B000067CPX|5.0|Coming 3 years off the heels of 1999's smash comeback hit, Californication, the Red Hot Chili Peppers' new album, By the Way, fails to dissapoint both longtime fans and casual listeners.  The best thing about the Chili Peppers, perhaps, is that their sentiments are never faked or forced.  They've done what they wanted to their whole nearly 2 decades long career and done it well, whatever road they've taken.  From their funk-metal-rap hybrid roots, they've been the forebearers of everything beat-driven and angsty that has topped the charts, be it Limp Bizkit, Papa Roach, Alien Ant Farm and the like, they all owe much to Kedis, Flea, Smith, and Frusciante.  With seminal hit Blood Sugar Sex Magik, the Chili Peppers broke out from the barriers of this new-found \\"rap-rock\\" genre with the melodia of Under the Bridge, their chart-topper of 1992.  But then, as I'm sure we've all seen their Behind the Music episode, they went through some personal troubles and replaced Frusciante with Dave Navarro.  They released One Hot Minute but it was poorly recieved by both critics and fans alike, spawning only minor hits with Warped and Aeroplane.  But the Chili Peppers would not be defeated, only to return with their best album, perhaps ever, Californication.  With Frusciante back on board, they had no less than 4 hits off the album, with Scar Tissue, Around the World, Otherside and the title track.  So now, at this creative high point, the Chili Peppers release By the Way.  The title track is the first single off the album, and it flawlessly executes both the dreamy pop-rock that was discovered early but perfected with many tracks on Californication, and the crazy wacky funk that has been their signature for so, so long.  But the rest of the album is mighty surprising, as it almost abandons their old sound completely, with only flashes of said funk roots at times.  While looking past the changes may be a daunting task for some, once you get there, you realize that this is perhaps their best album to date, and while the funk is all but disappeared, they're as ecletic as ever, mixing in many other different styles.  Kedis' lyrics are still at their best, and he can still actually sing, which was surprisingly uncovered on Californication.  Flea and Frusciante have an amazing musical kinship, neither dominates the other but they support each other flawlessly, and Chad Smith more than adequately rounds out the quartet, making By the Way perhaps their finest album to date.
B000001ED1|5.0|When I first listened to this album it didn't strike me as something I'd like.  I loved the single &quot;One Of Us&quot; and bought it anyway.  Turns out I couldn't have been more wrong!  It was unlike anything in my collection.  Joans voice is so raw and soulful.  The mixture of blues and rock is reminiscent of Janis Joplin.  The way she wails and moans throughout the album is what really makes this one of my favorites.  She brings the best out of all the songs on the album.  &quot;St. Teresa&quot; is awesome, giving the album a great jump start.  Following is  &quot;Man in the Long Black Coat,&quot; one of the best tracks on the album, it can really take you there if you just close your eyes, relax, and listen.  It was penned by legendary Bob Dylan.  &quot;Right Hand Man&quot; is the fastest track, dripping with sensuality, it's a great song to get the blood pumping!  &quot;Pensacola&quot;  is a good song to sing along to (great lyrics)!  &quot;Dracula Moon,&quot; also one of my favorites, is probably the best example of the bluesy rock on this album.  &quot;One Of Us&quot; speaks for itself.  It's controversial  and it makes you think.  This song actually brings me closer to God.  And then there's &quot;Ladder&quot; and &quot;Spider Web.&quot;  These are probably my two favorite cuts from the album.  I just cant help from turning them up real loud and rockin out!  The last four tracks are also great, especially &quot;Crazy Baby,&quot; it's a real mood setter and shows a little of Joans softer side.  The last track &quot;lumina&quot; is my least favorite.  Overall, this is one of the best albums out there.
6304711875|4.0|Wes Craven who brought us &quot;A Nightmare On Elm Street&quot; (Freddy Kruegar movie)brings us a great horror teen movie about a phsycopath killing off teens.  When a serial killer starts to his first murders, the whole town is shocked(Mainly because these deaths happened so horribly).  But all though this maniac may be on the verge of killing lots of people, his main target is a neighborhood girl named Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell).  At first it looks like the person who is responsible is her boyfriend Billy (Skeet Ulrich) but it did not take long for the police to prove it's not him.  But it drives Sid crazy knowing that someone is after her and a reporter (FRIEND's Courtney Cox)tries to do whatever she can to get a story out of her and has an eye for a debuty (David Arquette)who is asighned to protect Sidney.  What also seems wierd is that all this happening a year after her mom was killed.  Could this have something to do with the murders?  That is something you have to do find out for yourself but your gonna have to but this.  I really reccomend this.
B000067CPX|3.0|This album is easily the worst Chili Peppers album in at least a while.  That in mind, the music is decent, and some songs are memorable.  But it's not the awesome follow up to the fresh and beautiful Californication of 1999, or the pop-rock-funk-punk fantasticness of Blood Sugar Sex Magic, or Mother's Milk.  Some cool songs are \\"The Zephyr Song\\" (very emoesque), \\"Cabron\\" (viva california!),\\"On Mercury\\" (ska and tha peppas!), \\"Tear\\" is ok.   \\"Minor Thing\\" and \\"By the Way\\" are listenable to as well.  Some other songs have more rapping with some decent lyrics, but the melodies fall by the wayside. The conviction and depth to the subjects of californication are gone here, as well as the concept of memorable songs.  My advice:  Come on peppers, don't become a crap band, release ONLY GOOD material on your next album, and dont rush it, I don't care if it takes another 8 years.  This album is about as good as \\"One Hot Minute.\\"

0316666343|2.0|Alice Sebold writes beautifully. Also one saving grace in this book is the delightful grandmother who pops up from time to time. That character alone convinced me that Sebold really does have talent and may be capable of writing a decent novel, some day. Other than that--ugh. What an awful book. I can't believe I read an entire novel about a little raped/murdered girl who watches her family from \\"heaven.\\" And then when she briefly body-snatches her old friend and hangs out with her old boyfriend for a few hours. Good lord! Like another reviewer on this page, I groaned out loud several times, too. The full-page ad in the New York Times has Anna Quindlan urging, \\"If you read only one book this summer, read Lovely Bones.\\" So let me urge you--PLEASE. If you read only one book this summer, make it something decent--NOT THIS. Read Rohinton Mistry or Andrew Miller or Tessa Hadley or \\"Spies\\" by Michael Frayn.
B0000067X1|5.0|For a long time I'd heard mention of Can as this influential force on all that is good in modern music but it is only this year that I've been fortunate enough to delve into it due to unavailabilty, expensiveness etc. I heard an mp3 of Mushroom & was hooked, those beats! something about the vox & keyboard & the total aura. As soon as I saw the cd in the hip city store I picked it up & took it home to experience the full journey that is Tago Mago. Paperhouse sounds vaguely of its time, a little bit hippyish but far beyond what the typical practitioners could ever dream of concocting. Over a double album it unfolds [I later forked out for the vinyl & it was so worth it] w/ the 1st certainly more accessible & legitimately funky while most of disc 2 is studio paranoia nightmare sounds best experienced on headphones [true of most outer things like Interstellar Space & Metal Machine Music, to avoid the derision of philistines & understand what you're hearing better yrself], Aumgn & Peking O initially seem to impenetrable weirdness but repeated listenings show the supreme drum workouts, unique inventiveness & aura of it all. Bring Me Coffee Or Tea is the relaxing comedown. Next album EGE BAMYASI is just as good, perhaps more consistent though of course shorter & whilst predecessor MONSTER MOVIE [featuring Malcolm Mooney instead of Damo Suzuki] is less of a revolution it's still worthwhile & legendary. Here is perhaps the best place to start though. Astounding!

B00004VW35|4.0|I believe this is the closest Neil has come to doing a whole album of straight country. He has always dabbled in it, but this goes all the way - there's unabashed cornpone in \\"Get Back to the Country\\", unabashed nostalgia in \\"Are There Any More Real Cowboys?\\" (with Willie Nelson), unabashed honky-tonk in \\"Once An Angel\\", unabashed sentiment in \\"My Boy\\", and so forth. \\"Bound For Glory\\" is as beautiful a song as he's ever written, echoing Waylon and Willie's \\"Good-Hearted Woman\\". Fittingly, Waylon joins him with a lovely, understated vocal.<br />A special treat is his cover of \\"The Wayward Wind\\", a classic cowboy ballad that was previously recorded by the likes of Tex Ritter, Eddy Arnold, and Gogi Grant. I respectfully disagree with a previous reviewer's complaint about Neil sounding raw and off-key on this tune - this is Neil Young, not Perry Como. You have to expect a bit of an edge.<br />The only departure on the album is \\"Misfits\\", a rather lackluster fantasy piece.<br />Fine as they may be, I enjoy this album more than \\"Comes A Time\\" or \\"Harvest Moon\\", his most comparable. I think the songs are more fully realized overall, and Waylon and Willie's vocals add depth. But then, I like classic country - I find it frustrating that so many folk and rock fans disdain it even though their biggest heroes have been so heavily influenced by it. Highly recommended.
B000000H5J|4.0|The spot light reviewer was wrong. Christian played bass on Obsolete and Digimortal. Dino played bass on both Soul of a new Machine and Demanufacture. This album is a step down in intensity from its predecessor but its still brutal. It is their &quot;ultimate&quot; album. It rules

6302800897|5.0|Based on the famous Traver novel, ANATOMY OF A MURDER is an extremely complex film that defeats easy definition.  In some respects it is a social document of the era in which it was made; primarily, however, it is a detailed portrait of the law at work and the machinizations and motivations of the individuals involved in a seemingly straight-forward case--and in the process it raises certain ethical issues re attorney behavior and the lengths to which an attorney might go to win a case.<br /><br />Paul Biegler (James Stewart) is a small-town lawyer who has recently lost a re-election for the position of District Attorney and who is down on his luck--when a headline-making case involving assault, alleged rape, and murder drops into his lap.  As the case evolves, there is no question about the identity of the killer.  But a smart lawyer might be able to get him off just the same and redeem his own career in the process, and with the aid of an old friend (Arthur O'Connell) and his formidable secretary (Eve Arden), Biegler sets out to do precisely that.  Opposing him in the courtroom is Claude Dancer (George C. Scott), a high powered prosecutor who is equally determined to get a conviction... and who is no more adverse to coaching a witness than Biegler himself.  The two square off in a constantly shifting battle for the jury, a battle that often consists of underhanded tactics on both sides.<br /><br />The performances are impressive, with James Stewart ideally cast as the attorney for the defense, Ben Gazzara as his unsavory client, and a truly brilliant Lee Remick as the sexy and disreputable wife who screams rape where just possibly none occurred; O'Connell, Arden, and Scott also offer superior performances.  The script is sharp, cool, and meticulous, the direction and cinematography both effective and completely unobtrusive, and the famous jazz score adds quite a bit to the film as a whole.  Although we can't help rooting for Stewart, as the film progresses it seems more and more likely that Remick is lying through her teeth and Gazzara is as guilty as sin--but the film balances its elements in such a way as to achieve a disturbing ambiguity that continues right through to the end.  If you expect a courtroom thriller with sudden revelations and twists you'll likely be disappointed in ANATOMY OF A MURDER, but if you want a thought-provoking take on the law you'd be hard pressed to find one better.

B000067CPX|5.0|\\"By the Way\\" is, undeniably, a stellar album, representing yet another tremendous offering from the Red Hot Chili Peppers. It easily equates its predecessor, \\"Californication\\", in terms of its accessibility and the consistency with which it displays quality musicianship and meaningful lyrics. As always, Anthony Keidis' wonderfully unique vocals are complemented expertly by Flea's mastery of the bass guitar, Fruisciante's great guitar performances and Chad Smith's rhythmic drum beats.  It is understandable, then, that, in a similar vein to \\"Californication\\", all 16 of the album's tracks are excellent, and are not let down by any pointless `filler' tracks. <BR>    However, the Chili Peppers appear to have significantly stretched their musical boundaries since \\"Californication\\", as \\"By the Way\\" manages to encapsulate an earnestness and emotiveness that the band has rarely revealed to its legion of fans. While the album retains the band's raw edge, especially through hard-hitting songs such as catchy first single \\"By the Way\\" and the bittersweet funk tune \\"Can't Stop\\", it also introduces a wealth of songs based around beautiful vocal harmonies and soaring melodies. Moving ballad \\"I Could Die For You\\" illustrates this point perfectly, as it stands as among the most beautiful three minutes in the Chili Peppers' recording history. Thankfully, the band has definitely not transformed into a soppy, dull, Train-esque rock act. Even the album's most tender moments either maintain a degree of intensity or are balanced out by more unrefined moments, such as those involving rapping and chanting. For instance, the juxtaposition of Keidis' aggressive rapping with moving vocal harmonies in \\"Minor Thing\\" culminates in an aurally appealing contrast. <BR>     All in all, after careful consideration of the album's 16 superb songs, I would have to say that \\"Midnight\\" is my personal favourite. It is a rocking, lyrically-rich, orchestral monster of a song that is home to one of the Chili Peppers' most powerful, uplifting choruses to date. The album attains five stars from me for this song alone; its fellow 15 stand-out tracks make this album worthy of much more than just five stars.
076783819X|3.0|WOW, this movie is really good! It was one of the best I've seen! It was very well made and the effects were fabulous. I was really into it, when it just ended. It left you hanging and the bad guy won the battle. I have to say, I would have rated this with 5 stars and account it for one of my favorite movies, but the ending was horrible. I don't think it deserves to be a movie!
B00005A1PR|5.0|India Arie provides us with a much-needed view of women.  She is who she is, makes no apologies for being who she is, and as a result, projects an image of an intelligent, sensual woman.  She is powerful because of her confidence in her own person, and in her own abilities.<br />This was the first CD I brought with me to my new dwelling -- I listened to it often, and now that I have the rest of my collection with me, it remains a top pick.
B00005JKCF|1.0|This film is very bad.<BR>1.There is about 50 mistakes in the film<BR>2.very boring<BR>3.the fighting is bad, some one needs to tell Toby how to fight<BR>4.special effects are bad<BR>5.the green gobil looks bad<BR>6.spider man fancies Mary and when she finally asks him out, he turns her away, this is very bad<BR>7.the acting is bad, Toby Maguire and Kirstin Dunst, need I say more.<BR>8.Basically this film is bad and should be thrown in the bin and never watched again, Why? cus its bad.
0743201140|5.0|Great position, inspiring on the area of the self-development. If you waste a lot your time in order to learn some things you are not able to learn instead of focusing on you strngths points this is a book for you.<BR>The basic concept is very simple. The key element is talent. Or you have it or not. You may learn somethink, you may gather the experience but you will never reach the top level in some area.<br />Great really great,..., even you do not agree with the concept, the book is presenting many very practicall examples and cases you may use in you managerial practice.
B00006690F|5.0|This is possibly Eminem's best album to date. It is a very personal album with issues ranging from the controversy over his lyrics, to his ex-wife and an amusing cut featuring his six year old daughter...Oh yeah, this is also a cute little ditty called DRIPS which everybody's Grandma will adore and of course he makes fun of Moby the Spaceboy. Personally I think Moby is just jealous of Em's success.That's his problem, not mine. So pick up a copy of THE EMINEM SHOW for dear old Granny. Like his previous solo album this will reach a wide audience, he samples Aerosmith's classic DREAM ON on the track SING FOR THE MOMENT . So if you're interested go out and buy a copy. The DVD is good value too. It includes the video for JUST DON'T GIVE A F**K, several live songs, interview footage and an amusing animated sequence from the animated SLIM SHADY SHOW DVD.

B000067CPX|5.0|The RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS have done it again! Another amazing CD!!! Don't second guess buying \\"By The Way\\" any longer. It definitely lives up to what one would expect from this great band. Every song has its own unique flavor, yet they are all genuine RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS, which is always good. Don't waste any more time without this CD in your collection!!!
B000067CPX|5.0|This is by far one of the greatest follow-ups to date.  Just when you thought it wasn't possible to top Californication, &quot;By the Way&quot; delivers!  I'm a big fan of the Peppers and I must say that this album has everything we've come to expect from the band and more.  From catchy guitar riffs to fun lyrics and vocals to match, this album is one of the year's must haves for sure.  My personal favorite is #7 (Can't Stop).  Support this great band and put up the bucks to buy this great CD!
B0000057C5|5.0|Of the three albums, &quot;Sehnsucht&quot; is Rammstein at their most experimental and eclectic. Less conventionally heavy-metal than &quot;Herzeleid&quot;, less aurally-cogent than &quot;Mutter&quot;, it nevertheless makes up for that with a breathtaking palette of innovative rhythmic beats and snappy guitar riffs. Indeed, every track here is soaked with such surefooted rhythmic verve and snap --- making this Rammstein's most toe-tapping and &quot;catchy&quot; album to date. <br />Augmenting this strength are the memorable, rib-tickling lyrics. Yes, rib-tickling. Some of the lyrics (like &quot;Kuss Mich Fellerfrosch&quot; and &quot;Bueck dich&quot; for instance) really get my funny bone. I do humbly consider myself to be a member of Sane Society, and do not reckon the lyrics in this album to be the product of malevolently sick or pathological minds (as some of the unsympathetic media/critics have suggested). Rather, there is definitely a wry, sardonic humor at work behind the band's lyric-werk. Lyrically, Sehnsucht is Rammstein's most innovative album!<br />And even if you don't understand German or have the lyric-translations at hand, you can still enjoy the album solely on the strengths of the music alone. Like I'd said: great beats, great guitarwerk, and great singing too. This is one rock album whose appeal transcends its genre. (I'm a classical music &amp; Sade fan normally.) <br />So I can't imagine anyone not liking this great album. <BR>Probably only Fellerfrosches!
B00005QZ7U|3.0|The most risky film of the year is sensational, gutsy, shamelessly self-indulgent, and nearly too big for its own good--it practically pulls itself off.  Moulin Rouge has its roots in silent melodrama, flashy musicals, rock videos, and vaudeville theater, but Luhrmann synthesizes them into his own child.  It's a film that scarily defiant in its assurance.  The film is in bold, vibrant colors, but it's black and white:  you either gobble it down or you spit it out.  <br />Unlike a movie like A Beautiful Mind, which is tailor-made for an audience greedy for noble, meaningful pap, Moulin Rouge realizes how silly it is and flaunts its own ridiculousness.  It's glorious trash and it knows it; it's a proud [specimen] of a movie, eager to service everyone and try anything, but determined to keep its dignity in the process.  And yet, Moulin Rouge never seems to really kick as hard as it promises to.  It's a furious stunt, all right, and the first time around it hits you good.  Even when it fails, though, it's more accomplished and provocative than most anything else out there at the moment.  It's the kind of film, however, that I can respect, but never really love.
0880794968|4.0|I spent one year using the Rider-Waite decks and the following three years demagnetizing my mind from their tired old limited imageries (i.e. the pictured pips).<br />This oldie is certainly the top-seller in the American market, and not without good reason: the pictured pips take all the hassle out of your efforts at intuitive reading, and there are innumerable tarot books which adopt it as their illustrator. Hurrah. :-/ Still, I would implore all potential users to give the Marseilles-styled decks a try. They can be more rewarding, in fact.<br />...
B00003CXWV|2.0|A good old boy with high hopes of getting into a life of crime rises to the top and lives the good life before experiencing marital problems, doing some jail time, and eventually becoming a paranoid cocaine addict as the walls of his decadent lifestyle come tumbling down around him.  Anyone familiar with Scorsese's GoodFellas will recognize the similarities and do themselves a favor by watching it again instead of this copycat.  Blow is a fair enough film for those who aren't too choosy about what they watch--it seems unfortunate, though, to waste time watching it when you could instead be seeing the highly superior films that it borrows from (GoodFellas, Boogie Nights).
B00005R87Q|4.0|The only part of this movie I enjoyed was the fact that Vin Disel was the &quot;bad guy&quot;, oh but soooo good at it. The special effects were very unrealistic and and there were technicalities that could have been cleaned up, but the fast that there were some sweet cars, and Paul Walker and Vin Disel are absolutly gorgous!
B00005JKNF|5.0|Robert Altman still has life in him yet--Gosford Park, his lastest movie-party, is the best thing he's done in many years.  The film is set in an enormous English mansion on a rainy November weekend in 1932; a slew of Brits arrive for a shooting party, dragging with them all of their servants, and by the time they traipse back out a murder has been committed.  Altman divides the action between the wealthy guests \\"above stairs\\" and the crew of servants below--the result is largely comical, and Altman is right to see it all as one big circus, despite the adultery and the murder and the secrets.  Altman's genius, here as in his best films, has always been working the room to catch the silliness, the great stupid irony of it all.  The assembly of characters are delightful caricatures, and they provide the film with rich, savory details.  The film is lighter than air, but we're thinking all the time.  It's a delightful rush, and I smiled all the way through it.
B000067CPX|5.0|Another great album from the Red Hot Chili Peppers...<BR>There is a lot to enjoy in this album, especially if you haven't heard any of the tracks.  Although it is far different from previous releases, most notably Blood Sugar Sex Magik, it is still a great album.  It has gone more the way of radio friendly songs such as Californication and Scar Tissue, but I personally enjoy that.  The first track, By the Way, starts the album off with an explosion, but is misleading to the general tone and mood of the album.  Overall the songs tend to be more mellow and melancholic.  Songs such as the Zephyr Song and Cabron give this album some more cheerful tunes which nicely contrasts the slow, sad tone of songs like Dosed and Tear.  I have been a Chili Pepper fan for quite some time and own all the albums.  Each one provides a unique style of music, which makes them a very interesting band.  This album, although hardcore fans might view it as too soft, is still a great one.  Just be sure to listen with an open mind
B00005JKJA|5.0|After all he's done, each with its own varying degree of weirdness, Lynch has finally nailed it right.  With Mulholland Drive, he says everything he's been saying for the past twenty years, but he says it better than ever before, and of all his films it is the biggest and the fullest--his epic.  It's the best thing he's ever made, better even than Blue Velvet.  Mulholland Drive is teeming with all of his familiar touches, and for the first time ever in his body of work he pulls them off as well as he intends to.  In comparison, all of his previous films look like sketches and riffs, as though he were dutifully getting us ready to launch this one at us.  Lynch pulls out all of the stops as never before, and the effect is intoxicating; you don't know where you are, but you love every minute that you're there.  Even when the plot &quot;collapses&quot; (i.e., when it really starts to feel like a Lynch film), the collapse doesn't bring about an avalanche.  Technically, the film looks and feels superbly controlled, from Lynch's gorgeous direction to Angelo Badalamenti's ethereal music to the saturated, mesmerizing cinematography.  Naomi Watts, who plays the film's perky blonde heroine, gives one of the best performances in any Lynch film--in any film this year, in fact--and she her &quot;audition scene&quot; with the lecherous Chad Everett is purely breathtaking.  The eerie, hilarious film, which is some sort of film noir wet nightmare, reaches its apex at a dreamy theater/club called Silencio; it's the most electric moment in the movie.  The film costars Laura Elena Harring as an amnesiac brunet; Justin Theroux as an obsessive, nerdy filmmaker; Ann Miller as a kooky landlady; Chad Everett as a lecherous actor; and Lee Grant, in a hilarious cameo as some sort of psychic.
0345448898|5.0|I have a collection of nieces that read these books before me.  Like the Harry Potter series, they read and loved His Dark Materials.  And, like Harry Potter, I set out to read these books to have some common ground with the kids.  To my delight and surprise, I was entranced.  <br />Plot and theme you can get from other reviews.  I must say simply this:  read these books.  They are a wonderful trip down that grey early morning period of the soul between youth and adulthood.  More than that, though, they navigate these tough times with skill, intelligence and heart.<br />Read these books.
B00005T30L|5.0|Just as the recent trend of sardonic-teen movies are threatening to grow as stale as the clichs they mock, Ghost World comes as a welcome curveball that smashes through everything in its path; it delivers something fresh.  It's not a \\"teen movie\\"--it's a movie that happens to have teenagers as its main characters, and for once they're played and written to be as intelligent as many are in real life.  Enid (the extraordinary Thora Birch) is an aimless high school graduate adrift in the world with no plans or goals for the future; when she meets Seymour (Steve Buscemi, looking like R. Crumb), a scrawny loser in his forties obsessed with old music, she becomes exactly the kind of lovesick romantic that she once laughed at.  It's only the first film Zwigoff has ever made that's not been a documentary, but he shows sheer, undeniable skill (his Crumb was the best film of 1995) and a natural directorial ability to let loose on his own, to create something original with his fingerprints all over it.  Zwigoff gets a little more inventive here than with his documentaries (which were as formal and restrained as they should have been) and the result is lovely.  Ghost World is brilliantly funny and strangely uplifting in the purest sense; the result is lovely and hilarious.  Illeanna Douglas is delicious as a loony art teacher meant to be a hysterical send-up of phony new-age intellectualism at its most fervent.
B00000JCB3|1.0|This album is horrible, don't even bother listening to Limp Bizkit, because everything they make sounds teh same, and it's HORRIBLE!  I suggest getting something like \\"Hotel California\\" or<BR>some Bob Marley.  Limp Bizkit is just another fabricated popular band who just cuss and make snide remarks thinking people will like it.  That's where music has gone, it's turned from actual music to this techno [junk] with all its glamor and profanity.  Limp Bizkit is another band we can do without.
B00005JKQZ|1.0|A Beautiful Mind plays like a roller-coaster ride:  it starts out shaky, and by the time it's over you're begging to get off before you vomit all over yourself.  It's exactly the kind of film I dislike.  At first I tried to see around its weak moments, until they strengthened and grew into a weak film.  <br />Direcor Ron Howard (who, somehow, managed to beat out Peter Jackson, Robert Altman, AND David Lynch at the Oscars) tries to go for a sweeping, uplifting-saga approach and winds up delivering a mess of episodes that feel either pretentious, anticlimactic, or artificially sweetened.  He looks for sweep and scope in his sets instead of his screenplays.  The film doesn't even have the energy or the bravura to be good camp--it's listless and maddeningly safe.  It's a sure sign of desperation when the characters get progressively older through the use of (bad) makeup effects, the final scene involves an awards ceremony accompanied by the usual teary acceptance speech, and the end titles are proceeded little bits telling us where the real people are today and what they're up to (I groaned to lean that &quot;John Nash still walks to work every day.&quot;)  This wisp of fluff is second only to an earlier moment when, as Nash battles his schizophrenia, Alicia sits him down and says something to the effect of &quot;This is real [indicates his head] but this is what matters [indicated his heart].&quot;  Forgive me for paraphrasing.  This is the film that won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay over GHOST WORLD?<br />It's a pity that the film is so dreadful, because Nash is worthy of a film that takes him seriously and doesn't turn him into a cardboard cutout--a film that addresses his bisexuality, the child he had out of wedlock and refused to support, and his anti-Semitism.  Nash deserves a biopic that's as complicated as he is, a cubist painting instead of a Hallmark card.  <br />The film also seems to suggest that the patience and affection of a loved one coupled withself-determination is an effective cure for mental illness--that because Nash is so brilliant, that he will be able to conquer his disease by sheer brain power (oh, and let`s not forget love).  <br />This film is like a child's toy with differently shaped holes for differently shaped blocks--put the appropriate block into the according hole, and, to quote REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, you've got a winner.  Those willing to buy into A BEAUTIFUL MIND will be sure to gobble it up as greedily as a hamhock.
B00005JKNF|3.0|IF you can get through the first half - the 2nd section - after the 'murder' is excellent! THEN see it again straight through - and then sit back and digest [with a small glass of non-poisonous port!]<br />What a superb vision of ANY TIME! It's all very contemporary - somewhat along the lines of \\"Being There\\" and \\"Remains of the Day\\". Robert Altman's vision of life 'above and below' stairs is seen through many eyes and ever revaling.<br />EXCELLENT DVD with superb backgound details, re the accuracy, manner and manor, etc. etc. and destined to become quite a collector's piece - especially the 'missing scenes'.<br />Performances? Oh, one could go on and on and on - Stellar cast to say the least - TRY to do this on this side of the pond - Not!<br />Maggie Smith is the epitome of the post-Victorian lady [perhaps circa Oscar Wilde] One who deliberately chooses her words and insults you without your being aware of it [the 'green-dress' comment, the 'don't encourage him' line, etc. brilliant dialogue]. Others? Well, Helen Mirren naturally [what a way she's come since \\"Savage Messiah\\"], Eileen Atkins, Jeremy Northham {Ivor Novello - \\"The Lodger\\"}, Clive Owens - a new face well-worth watching, and Mr Ryan Philippe - excellent [and should kiss the ground Altman walks on for getting this break], Emily Watson, endless list ..... with the great ALAN BATES, quite, quite superb!  [Observe neophyte! - and learn from this Master's 'drunk-scene']<br />Pitch perfect music by Patrick Doyle - underrated, but well worth a nod!<br />A Classic Absolute!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|The antsy, short attention span buzz thriller of the year is a perfect one for the digital age of shuffling and rearranging, of scrambling.  I would say that it's easily the most frustrating and imaginative film I have seen this year, but nothing about it is easy.  For all its complications, it's only fair to say that Memento is also unnervingly clever, possibly the best thriller in a long time.  It has an old noir feeling, altered for our modern time.  The intelligence and freshness behind its tightly constructed plot make it meaty and genuine, and prevent it from turning into the innards of a fancy vehicle.  It is superficially absorbing, compelling on a level of sheer entertainment.  It's ahead of its time and behind the times.  Those who have a tireless mind for jigsaw puzzles, cryptograms, and crosswords will, I imagine, gleefully work at deconstructing its tangled web.  Others who are less concerned with logic but like a solid two hours of good, shallow entertainment will also find themselves pleased.
B000001OAA|5.0|This has got to be the coolest band in the music industry today.<br />They are orginal, there sound is so much fun and they never go out of style.  Especially the lead singer, Shirley Manson.<br />Her voice is raw and refined at the same time.<br />This a truly great album becuase it was their first and every song on all of there albums are amazing, not just one or two singles..that goes for every other album of theirs.<br />This is real music made by real artists. I recommend this to anyone.
B00003CXUM|4.0|In the Mood for Love tells of a smoldering romance set in a confined world; neighbors in a boisterous rooming house whose spouses are having an affair with one another find themselves falling in love, but are too shy to do anything about it.  On the surface the film appears to be boring, made up mostly of brief, minute-long vignettes that mesh together to form a more complete fabric.  Director Wong Kar-Wai knows things about the rules of effective on-screen eroticism, and while sex is altogether absent from the film it nonetheless seethes with sexuality.  In certain ways, it shares similarities with The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and also Last Tango in Paris.  The direction, music, and cinematography here are especially luminous.  It plays like a dream.
B000002LND|5.0|This album is a truly A must have for any music fan. It's a compilation of all of madonnas greatest songs from the 80's.<br />It also has 2 bonus trax, JUSTIFY MY LOVE and RESCUE ME..they were both released as singles and you all know the controversy that she started w/ the Justify My Love video.  It was a sign of things yet to come.<br />Buy this and you wont be disapointed.<br />Buy this and you just might have a little bit more respect for a woman that has accomplished so much and yet has not gotten the recognition that she deserves.<br />Madonna at her best.<br />Her music just keeps getting better as an artist but this compilation truly defined an era where
B00003CXXP|1.0|The much-anticipated hybridization of an idea by the late Stanley Kubrick as actualized by Spielberg starts out as a noble failure and ends up a disgraceful mess.  With it, Kubrick has made his first terrible movie since passing away two years ago.  The final result is too schmaltzy for Stanley and too depressing for Steven.  The plot concerns little David (Haley Joel Osment), a mechanical boy programmed to love his adoptive parents unconditionally.  The film is wrong to expect our sympathy for David, since his feelings are nothing more than pieces of programmed information; this is where A.I. makes its first wrong step, but things get worse.  (Oh, do they ever.)  It's all an indulgent orgy of spectacle, as one set piece is heaped onto yet another like so many syrupy pancakes, proving that Spielberg should stay wrapped up in the past (a la SCHINDLER and PRIVATE RYAN) rather than venturing out into the future.  I confess that I don't really understand A.I., but I don't want an explanation because then I would have to like it, and making fun of it is so much more enjoyable.

B00005YU1O|4.0|A philosophical young man (Wiley Wiggins) wanders through a dream state of animated types who ramble on about life and other abstract topics.  The speakers range from average women chatting in a cafe about time and aging to spaced-out wizards and nice, cultured professors in their dens.  Some of the topics discussed are dreadfully boring; many are plain ridiculous, and some are casually intriguing.  Much of the film is wildly funny in a comic, absurdist way.  It's intended as a grab bag of ideas and concepts to try out and take on or throw back into the bin--all the same, we're interested.  It's Linklater's most irritatingly brainy and frustrating film as well as his most risky; like his others, it's alive and pulsing with thoughts--everyone is constantly thinking.  At times the whole thing feels like intellectual psychobabble pushed to the extreme, a psychobabble casserole, if you will, and I thought of Woody Allen's quote from Annie Hall about mental masturbation.  Ten years from now, however, I have the feeling it will feel like those old, dated underground films from the 1960's that were once so visionary and are now so very boring.  If nothing else, though, the sheer visual look of Waking Life is unbelievably interesting, which is helpful since it allows us to get lost in the pictures whenever we get bored with the dialogue.
0140072187|5.0|This is a book written by a very brave man.  Not because he flew over 1,000 missions during the Vietnam war.  Not because he could have bought the farm on any one of those missions.  Not because he almost did buy the farm on some of those missions.  No, this guy is extremely brave because he wrote about all the prostitutes he banged while overseas, and then had to face his wife about the matter.  That is bravery. <br />Just a joke there, but I was looking for a new way to look at it.  Besides, based on the author's narrative style, I think he wouldn't have a problem with it.  This is a book that covers the true account of a helicopter pilot's tour of duty during the war.  It begins with how he learned how to fly, joined the army, was shipped overseas, and did his tour of duty.  And yes, he banged a lot of girls along the way.  <br />What makes the book so good is how it gives a no-holds-barred look at the life of a soldier during the war.  While it covers the serious topics, which I'll get to below, it also covers the everyday lives of those there.  We get to see that going without a shower for months was par for the course.  We see how many minor regulations (and some major ones) tend to get overlooked when you're dealing with people who might not be alive next week.  And we get to see that when there are now ladies around to cavort with, one has to resort to self-pleasure, risking the ridicule of one's companions who are probably doing the same things themselves.  It's these attempts not to sugar-coat that add realism to the story.<br />But on the serious side, it also covers many of the dark issues that surround the whole experience.  You experience the gradual realization that, despite seemingly successful missions, the \\"good guys\\" don't seem to be winning.  You see the love/hate relationship with the local people, who are caught in the middle of something they didn't choose, but also could be part of the enemy.  Also covered during the conflict are \\"friendly fire\\", atrocities committed on both sides, and the fact that no protection for the crew was available to those unfortunate enough to drop Agent Orange on the jungles. <br />And then there is coming home.  One of the darkest periods of American behavior was the hostility conveyed to soldiers returning home.  I read about it in the fictional \\"The Lords of Discipline\\", but this time we see the astonishment of the soldiers who are glad to get home, only to see that they are regarded as murderers.  <br />Finally, there is the personal adjustment of the author.  While most of that is covered in the sequel to this book, we see that it was a very rough time for many years for the author.  There are the nightmares, sleeplessness, and bad nerves that go on for years and years, eventually resulting in his being permanently grounded, and for the most part, deprived of his livlihood.  While one can see on his web page that he seems to have eventually worked it out, one has to think that without his wife, appropriately named Patience, that he would have long ago been dead.  <br />I am eager to further explore the life of Robert Mason based on this book.
0394492196|5.0|This is the best-constructed novel I have ever read, or ever hope to read. &quot;Smiley's People&quot; is more fun -- it's less Smiley-centered, for although he is our hero, he's not exactly colorful -- but &quot;Tinker, Tailor&quot; is brilliant and should be required reading for anyone who wants to call himself a novelist.
0790751305|5.0|You can tell right away that this is not going to be typical Hollywood fare from the beginning.  Please take that as a compliment.  The story is about a group of prostitutes in a small Western town in the 19th century.  A customer with not a lot under the hood overreacts to his rent-a-mate's comment on this and slices up her face with a knife.  After the sheriff shows up and gives less than a slap on the hand for this offense, the ladies get together, pool their money, and get the word out that they'll pay a reward to the party that brings a more \\"eye for and eye\\" to the cutter and his companion.  <br />Now it's not this original scene of violence that makes it special.  It's the portrayal of old Western life that does.  While the otherwise masterful \\"Lonesome Dove\\" has one of the most beautiful faces in movies in Diane Lane as it's prostitute, the ladies here are, for the most part, very ordinary looking.  More than that, they portray a weariness that shows that their life is not that easy.  In the hands of other Hollywood powers, the ladies would have been Charlie's Angels.<br />Cut to the existence of the movie's main character, played by Clint Eastwood.  He's a former outlaw and killer, reformed by his now dead wife, and faced with the responsibility of raising two children.  The only thing good that can be said of his home is that it's slightly better than the pen where he keeps the hogs he raises, and that's not saying much.  The Ponderosa it ain't.  <br />What Clint Eastwood seemed to want to do in his directorial masterpiece is to turn everything he represented in his previous years of acting and turn in on it's head.  In scene after scene you anticipate the old Clint rearing back and wiping out half a town just to get an appetite up for breakfast.  But time after time we are surprised to see a man who can't even mount his horse properly, and can't hit a target with a pistol from ten feet away.  We see that all his lifestyle has led to is wretched poverty.<br />The movie grows on you the more you watch it, and the memorable characters have stood the test of time.  Morgan Freeman, as always, brings a knowing weariness in his role as Eastwood's partner.  Richard Harris has a terrific role as an English gunfighter who hires a writer to build his own legend, but has it totally taken apart by the sheriff of the movie's central town.  And Gene Hackman deserves his Oscar as the sheriff who is somehow portrayed as the bad guy when most of the other lead male characters are in the plot for the sole purpose of committing murder.  It is this challenge to our sense of what is right and what is wrong, and if there is sometimes even a difference between the two that makes this a Hall of Fame movie.
B000068QY7|1.0|I had the privilege of hearing four tracks off this album courtesy of a certain sunday newspaper. \\"You're smoking all my stash while burning all my cash\\" wails Noel. Is the NME still going then? Tsk, those journalists. Lack of cash means the brothers can no longer afford boxer shorts, causing them to complain of being 'Hung In A Bad Place'. The pain in the vocals sounds all too real. The guitar twang opening this track prepares us for a news report that 'there's fighting in the streets' which doesn't materialize. No one's in the mood for a revolution or a Roger Daltrey perm, there are too many units to shift. Pink Floyd always works. Why not try that? They do, and 'Stop Crying Your Heart Out' sounds appropriately 'comfortably numb'. Difficult when you're out of stash, but there's always the pub. They're in desperate need of some 'Instant Kalma' which appears pretty sharpish on 'Force Of Nature'. The force in question being Liam, no doubt, but he has his soft side, as displayed on the self penned 'Songbird' in which a young lady comes to our bard of beatification to 'spread her wings'. Goodness, what can this mean? A little bird tells me he's not referring to personal growth. In any event, the lady in question pushes off pretty quickly thus depriving Liam of the opportunity to be a 'Jealous Guy' despite all the efforts of the music to convince us of the fact. The wistfulness of this ditty confuses all those who recall Liam proclaiming in an interview that he only ever had a quick one to give. It's time to get religion big time which the boys dutifully deliver in a trip east with 'The Hindu Times', the headlines no doubt saying 'Oasis gig cancelled due to impending nuclear conflict'. I would venture a guess that this eastern influence comes from Mr George Harrison. Surprisingly perhaps, as the Beatle never had a good word to say about the brother's band. But we mustn't speak ill of the dead. I'm talking about Oasis, here. Goodness, not only are all these artists sounding alike, they're even giving their albums the same titles (see David Bowie.) <BR>The cover of 'Heathen Chemistry' seems to be a tube drunk's view of the lads as they stand around by the escalators hoping to be recognised. Or maybe they're busking after burning all their cash. Not that that was their fault according to the lyrics, and I use the term loosely.<BR>There was a useful interview with the freebie in which the boys wax lyrical about the making of this album. Between the brothers Gallagher sat a chap called gem who I swear must have had plastic surgery to look just like John Lennon. If not, then he's definately in the right band. Noel tells us that the influences on this album are from all five members record collections. The cheeky inference being we are all therefore partners in crime and have no right to complain. He tells us that Liam sat in a corner strumming the same simple riff over and over again on his acoustic guitar for two hours. That'll be 'Songbird', then. It's shorter but not so you'd notice. The album is also self produced, a revelation made by Noel that causes Liam to give a barely disguised sickly grin. One imagines that the eventual bootleg of these sessions will make the notorious 'Troggs' effort seem like 'All You Need Is Love'. But one mustn't mock. The music industry is a democratic institution and all the dullards out there will no doubt be casting their votes once more to get the boys back in stash. I've got two of their singles so I know of whence I speak.
B000067CPX|5.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers take up where Californication left off, using their more downtempo tracks like &quot;under the bridge&quot; as inspiration for &quot;By The Way.&quot;  This is a stellar release by RHCP, meaning it's more of the same.  There is a slight change to be noted in their sound, and that is that it's evolving into a more experimental sound.  Don't worry fans, this is not &quot;Kid A&quot; for RHCP, but they are trying new things, opening a few songs with synths, and using them ever so rarely in choruses and verses.  This is another great release from the Chili's, most definately one to buy.
0140143505|5.0|This book was recommended highly and even so it exceeded my expectations. This epistolary chronicle of the growing friendship between the author and the folks at the bookstore in England is simply wonderful. It increased my already considerable appreciation for reading and for books. In spite of making me cry right before I had to leave for work, I carried the memory of it with me for several days after I finished it and it always made me smile. I immediately sent my copy on to someone else, who also loved it and it is awaiting its next fan.
B00005NWM3|1.0|I would never buy this album, because I occasionally listen to the radio and have heard Nickleback, but I have heard all of the songs on the Cd. I have a lot to say about &quot;dapeacedogg&quot;'s comments too. First he said the lead singe rsounds like &quot;a mix of Eddie Vedar and Chris Cornell, but posseses much more talent than those washed out has-beens&quot;. First of all, Nickleback sounding like Pearl Jam or Soundgarden (or Nirvana for that matter, as some of you noticed) is obviously not a mistake. For some reason, Nickleback has some fantsay in their head thinking that they can someday be as good as any of those grunge bands. Also, no one in this band has the music, or no where near the lyric writing ability of anyone from Soundgarden or Pearl Jam. Besides, the whole Seattle grunge scene was 10 years ago, do you think they JUST picked up on it? Then, dapeacedogg said &quot;if you dig grunge music, you're going to love this band&quot;. Ok, first, you insult grunge music, then you say that they are grunge? Contradicting yourself huh dapeacedogg? Nickleback is not, and never will be grunge. If you &quot;dig&quot; grunge (Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, etc) I suggest you go buy Ten (Pearl Jam), Badmototrfinger (Soundgarden), Nevermind (Nirvana), or a Temple of the Dog or Mother Love Bone record. If grunge is what you're lookin for, definitely DO NOT buy this record.
0780623134|5.0|As other reviewers have already pointed out, &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; is powerfully moving film, beautifully filmed with powerful performances in both the dual lead roles as well as the supporting roles.  Flawless.<br />Watch more carefully than some, and you'll see that the redemption is Red's, not Andy's.
B000002GJH|5.0|This Cd is in my opinion, a brilliant piece of art. Everyone in the band expressed their feelings in a beautiful way. They had excellent song writing, and the miscellaneous members of Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, and Mother Love Bone mixed very well. As others have said, anyone who is a fan of Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, or Mother Love Bone should enjoy and appreciate this record.
6303168507|5.0|In his boldest attempt to create a \\"cinematic masterpiece\\" and finally get noticed by a stubbornly disinterested Academy, Spielberg bypasses the heart and goes right for the jugular in this first ever big-budget Hollywood drama on the Holocaust. Undeniably driven by sincerity, Spielberg's Oscar-winning Best Picture is alternately impressive, maudlin, focused and well-acted. Filmed in black and white, the film deals with the Nazi extermination of Polish Jews and how one man, Oskar Schindler, transformed from a philandering opportunist (and Nazi profiteer) to a capitalist saviour to 1,200 imprisoned Jews. With fluid camerawork, Spielberg re-creates life for Krakow's Jews during Nazi occupation - from resettlements in the ghetto to their internment in the camps. Schindler is ably portrayed by Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley as an accountant who assists Schindler and Ralph Fiennes as camp commander Amon Goeth are especially effective. Spielberg's scenes of Nazi atrocities are definitely emotionally wretching.
B00005YUNY|5.0|I've seen Symphonic Tour in Boston, MA. It was awesome! They are still in a great shape and still play even such a complicated peaces like \\"Gates Of Delirium\\" and \\"Close To The Edge\\" with a real fire! Must for every good music funs, not only prog heads!<BR>Look, this DVD in Top 10 musical DVD in Amazon; in DVD's Top 10  (all DVDs! including Harry Potter, etc.) in Newberry Comics ( New England CD/DVD stores chain). Great success! Who said progressive rock is dead?...
B000056HRZ|5.0|As time goes by, no film equals the popularity of this indisputable classic.  In quintessential roles, Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are former lovers reunited in wartorn Casablanca... Rick's place is a rendezvous for every crook and refugee in Casablanca: Bogey is the cynical cafe owner who lives by his own moral code and sticks his neck out for &quot;no one&quot;.  Bergman, as the beautiful wife of Resistance leader Paul Henried, finds herself torn between two lovers when she reenters Bogey's life...The film's GREAT success lies in the inimitable pairing of its two stars, a thoroughly romantic story line, terrific humour and numerous moments of genuine suspence.  Of course, that great ending helps, too!  Studio filmmaking from the 1940's didn't come any better than this, and director Curtiz masterfully handled the action, comedy and romance.  Nearly stealing the picture is Claude Rains as a &quot;poor, corrupt officer&quot; who as a Nazi puppet soon discovers &quot;the beginning of a beautiful friendship&quot;.
B00004Z459|4.0|So Linkin Park is in the same genre as, say, Limp Bizkit and those types of artists. But their music is so very different. For one, they don't swear. Call me a prude, but I have more respect for an artist that can make an album without swearing. And unlike a lot of the &quot;music&quot; with little but screaming vocals and loud guitars, Linkin Park actually has a melody. You can hear it on all of their singles and on most of the tracks. They have their fair share of screaming vocals and loud guitars also, but it's more than that. <br />The album is good to blast when you're in a foul mood, but is also good for just plain listening. It's worth buying.
B0000062GK|5.0|After seeing G3 on DVD, I chose Satriani over Johnson and Vai to study guitar method(Johnson is too mellow, but knows thousands of chords. Vai's just too goofy.). I bought Crystal Planet as my first Satch album, and I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED. \\"Up In The Sky\\" Delivers sleek harmonics and a mind-blowing solo. \\"House Full Of Bullets\\" gives you a nice, bass-heavy blues piece.My favorite song, of all time, hands down, no contest, is \\"Crystal Planet\\". If, for some reason, I want to stop playing guitar, this song will keep me right where I belong. If you're lucky, and live in a big city like Miami, do this: Wait till midnight, and go downtown. Put the top down. Crank \\"Crystal Planet\\". People will offer to buy the cd from you. Anywho, back to reviewing. If you play guitar, play \\"Love Thing\\"  for your girl (or guy, ladies). The song brought tears to my eyes. The CD stays strong. \\"Raspberry Jam\\" could've been improved. \\"Lights of Heaven\\" is timeless, as is \\"Ceremony\\". \\"Secret Prayer\\" kicks serious ass. Things mellow out at the end with \\"Z.Z.'s Song\\", with just Joe and a very nice chorus pedal. All in all, Crystal Planet is his best to date, better even than Strange Beautiful Music, though SBM is a close second.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I can't believe anyone would not like the movie.  Granted I understand that it was not exactly like the book, but if it had been then it would be at least 4 hours long.  How many kids do you know tha tcan sit still for that long.  Anyways I thought it was pure magic and I enjoyed for the way it made me feel.
B000059HAI|5.0|Without the benefit of todays technology, the producers of this movie have created the perfect re-creation of this episode of American history.<br />The movie follows the book very faithfully.  The scenes are beautiflly recreated with some special effects that stand up under the micro-scope of todays tough standards.<br />I recomend this very highly, and now owning both the VHS and DVD versions have to confess that I have watched both many times with great pleasure.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I truly believe this movie to be perfect for all ages.
B00003CXI0|5.0|This movie was awesome! Not only did I love it my son also loved it! I could watch this movie over and over.
B00006690G|5.0|THE EMINEM SHOW IS THE BEST CD THIS YEAR!!! EVERY SONG IS THE BEST, ESPECIALLY CLEANING OUT MY CLOSET. IT'S JUST ONE SONG BUT IT SHOWS HOW MUCH HURT HE'S BEEN GOING THROUGH. YOU CAN RELATE TO HIM. HIS CD BEFORE THIS WAS GOOD BUT THE EMINEM SHOW WAS EVEN BETTER. THE ONLY SONG WHICH I AM NOT TO FOND OF IS DRIPS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT I JUST DON'T LIKE IT. EVERYONE SHOULD OWN A COPY OF THIS RECORD. THE BEATS ARE GOOD AND HIS LYRICS SPEAK THE TRUTH!!!
0345448898|1.0|In our home we read books together out loud as a family activity.  We selected Pullman's His Dark Materials as a good set to read because of all the awards it received and because we enjoy fantasy series.  Bad choice!  The books are poorly written -- the last volume was so boring that my youngest kept dozing off -- and worse than that, the final message is NOT appropriate to children.<br />I'm not a Christian, so I don't have a problem with Pullman's hatred of Catholicism.  [Though, I do wonder if he wasn't one of those poor young alter boys who was abused by his priest years ago. That would explain his near hysteric anti-religious tone.]  By the time he got around to killing God in the third volume, we were so tired of his bigotry that we all just laughed.<br />What bothers me most about His Dark Materials is that Pullman tells us that in addition to God, Good and Evil are also dead.  To prove this he turns his villians from the first volume (both of whom are child abusers and murderers) into semi-heroes by the third volume.  And then in a final (totally unexplained) triumph he saves the universe by having two thirteen year-olds have sex!<br />This man has serious problems.  He has my symphathy.  But, that doesn't mean we should expose children to his sick musings.
B000002O4S|5.0|I love the music and the movie both along with Alan Silvestri's other movie scores, but there's something unique about this one. It carries out the spontaneous and the adventureous feelings in the movie but also captured in his lines of music. I now feel like I'm in the movie as marty when I pop this in my cd player. <BR>This is a MUST for a BTTF fanatic's collection. Or if you just like Silvestri, this MUST be added to your collection, too.<BR>Feel the magic and excitement of not just BACK TO THE FUTURE, but the sequels as well. Alan Silvestri is one of the best film composers of our time, but the BTTF score is the GREATEST OF ALL TIME. <BR>Catcha l8ter, OUTATIME.....
B000067CPX|3.0|I have always loved red hot. I always tough BSSM was there best album... and I think I'm still right. BTW is really beautiful but when I listen to RHCP, i'm not looking for this kind of music. I'm looking for something a lot more funkier and rock...<BR>BTW has beautiful variations and cool songs such as Midnight and Dosed but still, I find it too ... well, not red hot. I like this album, but it's not the kind of sound I'm looking for when I listen to these guys.
0446607274|5.0|A wonderful book.  A compelling story of a tough LA detective, a great plot, a wonderfully clear and clean writing style, fully fleshed characters, and a thumping good read that just drives on from the first page.  This is an easy choice; read it.
B00005QG9J|2.0|Honestly, this album is nothing special. There are no real great songs on this album. Still I do respect that Incubus has continued writting &quot;different&quot; sounding songs. If you want good Incubus music, get S.C.I.E.N.C.E. or Make Yourself or Fungus Amoungus. This album is probably thier worst.
B00005QIPH|3.0|Is This It is a respectable album, but it has too many short comings to make it good. First the album is SHORT. We're talking 35 minutes here. And it's even shorter when you consider that only the first 9 songs are any good. Most of the songs on the album drone on and they all sound too familiar for me.<br />The next major weakness of this album is that it sounds like The Strokes recorded it in a tin can. Seriously, the audio quality on this album is horrible. The bad sound effect works to a great effect on some of the songs. After a while, though, I can't handle it anymore. I have to turn the album off or develop a massive headache.<br />On the other hand, the music, for the most part, is very good. When The Strokes are on, their music is great. It's just that too much of this album sounds the same and never really shows the full potential of The Strokes.
B000067CPX|4.0|This is a great album! It is a lot better then the sell out songs from Californication. The album has a flow of slower songs (Dosed, The Zephyr Song) and even faster beat songs (Throw Away Your Television, Can't Stop). If you liked Blood Sugar Sex Magic but thought that Californication was too mainstream pick this album up!
B000002KAT|5.0|MORRISON had a few hits under his belt with his group THEM,but it is with ASTRAL WEEKS that he firmly established his reputation.The importance of this disc has been discussed often;MORRISON with his powerful voice put his stamp on the soul world dominated at the time by MOTOWN and STAX.His mystic approach is the key to the understanding of the creation of his style.From the delightful rythym and blues THE WAY YOUNG LOVERS DO to the epic scale MADAME GEORGE,here is a classic that has stand the test of time.An essential entry from the troubled sixties, that contribued to elargate the forms of pop music.Enough said,buy it and enjoy.
079073639X|1.0|I just read the book, which I found impossible to put down.  It was no great piece of literature but a gripping page turner with enough scientific theory to give it credibility.  The film is such a disapointment.  It leaves out the most interesting and thought provoking material, provides little sense of the characters and or the mystery of the sphere.  Instead it showcases a series of action sequences and melodramatic confrontations between the three stars.  I guess this would be entertaining but the effects are second rate and nothing new.  I know nothing about film making but kept thinking that the producers' budget must have been too limited to do this the right way.  I don't see how anyone could have liked this movie.
B000001Y42|5.0|Yo, whaz up?<br />This record is too much.  It's got phat beats, good rhythms, and plus Mr. Durst is not yelping in a high-pitched fashion like he would on later albums.  <br />This record is phat, yo, unlike later albums that sound too contrived for my taste.  <br />Check it out, you may be surprised.<br />SEE U ON THE Q-T!!<br />OUT!!
