B004EPZ08E|5.0|This movie cracks me up, every time I watch it I can't stop laughing and it's tons of fun to watch with friends! Jennifer Aniston's character is the best!
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I must say I enjoy angry birds but it is more difficult compared to the original virsion which I thought was quite amusing other than this I hand no.other complaints I personally love the game
B005ZTFPFQ|1.0|I can't get rid of this app! It requires WiFi to install and I don't want to do that. I try to force close it, and it won't go away!
B004YM6JP0|5.0|This season has been awesome so far, it's gotten slightly more dark and bloody. Tons of action and drama to keep me completely in love with this show!
B00526ZKYS|2.0|I'd heard great reviews, but I found it disappointing. the idea is good, I think. insane, but I can see how it can happen, how people can get carried away by the idea of a world without pain.  but I just found Lena boring. She's too passive,maybe. the plot never seemed to move. and I hated that it seemed to be up to Alex to wake her up, to save her whenever she was in trouble, to always have to take her by the hand and all that.  it's not the kind of character  I want to read about.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Product arrived on time in great condition.  Movie was awesome.  Saw the movie in the theater and wanted a personal copy.  What more can you say?
B005K17RU0|4.0|this app was easy to install and just a touch away. I'm very happy w/ the results of up to date forecast.

B002ZG99TK|5.0|I caught this movie on cable. Didn't have much interest in it when it was released. But, I love this movie. Denzel Washington is great as always. And, I was never a Chris Pine fan but I rally enjoyed his performance as well. The action scenes were amazing. But, the acting from all of the players is what makes this movie great. And, as someone who teaches leadership classes, I think the best lesson is that, regardless of your psoition, you can always make a difference. You can always do the right thing.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|I was missing a good show to watch while Justified was off and then American Horror Story came along. I love this show. Such a very different show not your every day cookie cutter show.
B004LWZW42|5.0|Movies based on comic books either fall into two simple categories: those that work and those that don't.  The former, of which the latest installment falls, feature marvelous character development, good acting, and impressive special effects.<br /><br />As is commonly known about the 2011 film, the film offers an introduction into the origins of the X-Men's origins, played against the backdrop of the Cuban Missile Crisis,.  The cast is headed by James McAlvoy as Charles Xavier/Professor X and Michael Fassbender as Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto. Both actors excel in their roles, adding their own distinctive acting styles to characters originally played by Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellan in the previous X-men trilogy.  Fassbender is exceptionally good in the early scenes when he is attempting to discover the whereabouts of the film's supervillain, Sebastian Shaw, played with delicious wickedness by Kevin Bacon.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence makes for a very sympathetic Raven/Mystique while Rose Byrne is quite good as the CIA agent who assists Xavier and company in their attempt to thwart Shaw's plans.<br /><br />The special effects are visually stunning, especially during the climactic confrontation between U.S. and Russian ships.  The sequence involving Shaw's submarine is jaw-dropping.<br /><br />The director/producers of \\"X-Men: First Class\\" will really have to raise the bar to surpass this exemplary film.<br /><br />It gets an \\"A+\\".
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game work's great on my Kindle Fire. The program runs smooth and it has an auto complete once you get to the winning point. It allows you to choose which type of game you want - a winning deal or a random deal (which means you may not be able to win).
B0055SWM08|4.0|This isn't an amazing game or anything, but it's a decent way to pass time. Entertaining, but not terribly engaging.

B004GYY714|5.0|I use this app daily. It is much more than I expected. Stations are easy to find, and the menu is easy to organize. I can stream any NPR station, so if I miss a program, I can just listen to it in another time zone ( I usually pick up Morning Edition on the San Francisco station while I live in CST). Even the tiny college radio station I used to listen to was easy to find and brings me back home. The recommend feature is useful when looking for a particular genre. I was amazed at all the international channels available! When browsing by location, each continent pops up and then is sub-categorized by country and then location. My Presets acts as a favorites menu to easily access commonly streamed station. for a free app, I was very impressed.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|Love playing this game. Look forward to playing more games like this. I enjoy mystery type games. I don't get bored, with this game.
B005K2XWR6|4.0|I wasn't disappointed with this case at all. The outside is durable and protected my kindle fire from a heavy downpour when i didn't have my backpack for extra security. After a few weeks of use, no obvious signs of wear. Fits snug, but not difficult to quickly put your KF away. I wish it had some type of stand feature. In the frenzy to find a good case while waiting for my KF to arrive, I must have assumed it had this feature. Not a big deal. I'm not using my KF for movies/videos anyway. Good Case! Good Company!
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|I definitely recommend this movie! It was very funny and entertaining the entire time. There's a fun twist too that I wasn't expecting. Must see!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|As a frequent evernote user, this was an immediate download upon receiving my KF. It works great! Syncing is excellent and the app is user friendly. However, it does seem a little difficult to edit notes (as in notes that have been created on the computer) I must say I have only tried this once and my difficult is probably due to not using the KF long enough to be an expert. the cursor seems hard to locate when I edit that's all. Creating a new note is easy and the text cursor pops up with no issue.  A must have for Evernote lovers!  If you don't already use Evernote on your computer, I would suggest trying that out first. The app may seem confusing, or rather, the glory of Evernote isn't given due credit if you base your first impression off of the app first.

0553381695|2.0|First let me start off with the fact that the book is well written.  There are a couple unfortunate problems. One the author slows down the book for pages and pages of dialoge.  Second and more important his books are just too depresing.  People get raped it happens I get it. I am okay with a little bit of it in the book, but this author seems to believe that every twenty pages of the book someone has to be raped, and the other twenty someone is having sex with their brother.  Then there is the fact that Martin seems to think that no one can be faithful to their wives. I understand some are not but that is not a universal constant there are people out there who are loyal to their wives or husbands their whole life. Finally every character seems to be a bickering, petty child.  People may not be simply good or evil but not all people have a desire to conquer kill and rape like 95% of these characters did.

1439192812|4.0|In THE MAGIC OF REALITY, Dawkins quickly clarifies the definition of \\"magic\\" that we are dealing with.  There are, he points out, two types of \\"magic.\\"  One, the supernatural, is part of human mythology or simple circus charlatan trickery, while the second, science, is magical in the sense of the wonder and the beauty it can create in the mind of the learner.  His message is that the scientific explanation behind just about everything in the universe is so marvelous, so intriguing, and so wonderful that it overshadows even the most imaginative mythology and that supernatural explanations pale in the light of scientific fact.<br /><br />The contrast between these two definitions of \\"magic\\" is carried through chapter by chapter in that each is introduced with a brief survey of the mythology that has risen to explain whatever topic is dealt with in the chapter, followed by the scientific explanation of that phenomenon.  The short chapters are a smorgasbord of topics ranging from the first man to earthquakes and from the nature of matter to rainbows.  The intent of the book, therefore, is not to impart a great deal of knowledge about any singular topic but to impress upon the reader the fact that scientific inquiry is applicable to everything in the physical universe and is far more gratifying than is reliance upon mythological explanations and \\"miracles.\\"<br /><br />The book is aimed toward younger readers with the hope that it will motivate them to pursue factual, scientific explanations for the natural phenomena that they encounter in life.  This is a perfectly noble aim, and the repeated juxtaposing of myth and fact through the book is an interesting approach.  With those I find no quibble whatsoever.  However, I am not quite sure that the writing is of itself effectively geared toward maintaining the interest of a youthful reader.  Admittedly, many years have passed since I could have been considered \\"youthful,\\" and perhaps I am ill equipped to judge what today's youth find interesting in books,  but I really do not feel that a pre-teen reader will be motivated by the text to scamper through THE MAGIC OF REALITY from cover to cover although I do believe that is the age group for which the book is intended.<br /><br />As an adult reader, I was disappointed that the chapters do not go as deeply and thoroughly as I would wish into either the mythology or the science of the phenomena being considered.  Some of Dawkins' other books do delve quite deeply into the science underlying their topics, THE ANCESTOR'S TALE coming to mind as a truly marvelous examination of physical evolution, for instance.  Still, I wish that the author would undertake a book such as THE MAGIC OF REALITY for an adult audience, expanding the examination of both mythology and scientific reasoning relative to a selection of natural phenomena.  Obviously, such an endeavor would go far beyond the 265 heavily illustrated pages of MAGIC.  While we're waiting and hoping for that to happen, however, MAGIC may do just fine for a young reader whose interest tends toward science, especially biological or earth science, and I'd recommend giving it a try.g in books,  but I really do not feel that a pre-teen reader will be motivated by the text to scamper through THE MAGIC OF REALITY from cover to cover although I do believe that is the age group for which the book is intended.

B005OCFHHK|5.0|Ths review is for the Blu Ray version of the complete 8 disc set.<br />I will be brief and to the point.<br /><br />Extended Scenes - Yes. (Compared to the standard DVD collector's 1-5 set)<br /><br />Bonus Material - Yes. Each disc has bonus material.<br />In fact, all the bonus material is labeled right on the back cover of the set box.<br />Other reviews stated there were none or just the last 2 discs has some.<br />But the truth is, all of the discs have bonus material.<br />I think some reviewers tried to pull a \\"stupify!\\" on us.<br /><br />If the rumours are true that there will be no more sets released after the New Year<br />then you had better hurry and get this set now.<br />When compared to the standard DVD Years 1-5 collector set I am very happy<br />with the quality upgrade the Blu Ray discs offer along with extended scenes I have never seen before.<br /><br />So get on your Nimbus 2000 and grab a copy of this set before its gone forever.<br />(except on eBay for over bloated prices).

Beware, do not waste your $$.

I've got the next two books in the series on order, but may have to give in and download to Kindle also.  This from a 70-year old Gramma, who's recommending the books to my 13-year old grandson.  Can't wait to see the movie!
B002QW7ALM|5.0|One thing about buying movies from Amazon is you don't get to read about the movie as with other movie purchase sites. So to compensate for this I enter the title into another site - read about it - then go back to Amazon to buy it. Unfortunately what was written about this title didn't live up to the movie. Fortunately I didn't spend much on it
B006O5XYWG|4.0|Ok, unlike most of these \\"other\\" reviewers, I already own ALL the Planet of the Apes movies new and old. So, how's this one? Not bad, not bad at all. First off, if you dont like this \\"genre\\" of movies and / or you have not seen them ..... then please spare us all your opinion as it means \\"nothing\\". On a scale of 1-10 for P of A movies I rate this one about an 8. If you actualy watch the movie it has a rather complex plot and there are a couple of key parts that tie it in to the previous movies as well as what I assume will be the next. A little bit much on the CGI but that is a sign of the times. I wont give you any plot details because frankly I think it's rude to give away the plot in a review. You want to know what happens ... watch the movie. I did the $1.99 / 48 hour download and it worked great. I will also be picking up the hard copy to add to my video library. It's a good one folks!

A very touching movie. Certainly one you could watch over again. Pleased to have it in my collection and I'll be looking for mor of Zacs movies in future
B006G2ZEV6|3.0|The gameplay for this is new and refreshing. Challenging, even on Casual.  However, mission text and unit description are invisible on Honeycomb and Ice Cream Sandwich. You have to play the game with sound to know anything and can't get detailson units and orders.

B0042JIL2E|5.0|Lot's of praise for this release and rightly so.  This band and Imelda are true talents.  If you are a rockabilly/50's music fan don't miss this one and do yourself a favor and buy Jeff Beck's Rock and Roll Party to go with it.  Imelda steals the show. Great music.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|How can you go wrong with Ryan Phillipe and Matthew McConaughey. Great acting and lots of twists and turns. Fantastic movie
B0046MOV8U|5.0|I have seen many concert videos and this is the best sounding, high-energy, and most entertaining performances I have ever seen!  I'm not normally a fan, but Beyonce is simply having a fantastic time and she gives her all for her fans...as an entertainer should.  She's right on the pitch too while she's dancing, which in today's world of live performances is rare.  I actually saw this on DirecTV, but will be purchasing the BD.  I have incredible respect for her work ethic and devotion to fans.

B0025UHKNS|4.0|I could focus on the bezel interface in this review. But, I won't. Many others have complained about the bezel. And, yes, it could be annoying. But, realistically once the bezel is in the \\"locked\\" position, it won't randomly change modes. I've tried to mess with it while it was locked. I found nothing. While it is unlocked however, you will end-up in a random mode that came from a parallel universe, and all because your shirt touched the bezel. Lesson here: keep the bezel locked in the mode you want.  I'd totally love this watch so much more if there was a \\"real\\" instruction manual that came with it. There are a lot of accessories that will function with the watch, like, a speed/cadence sensor for bicycles. The question you run into when you add something like this is: How do I set-up the interface of the watch to show the display I want when I want it? It is for this reason that I give it only 4 stars. The instructions are a bit lacking.  The computer interface is seamless. The tracking programs are cool when you view your stats online and in real-time, plus the route you took. I love that feature. Overall, this is a good watch if you get it for a deal-price like I did.

B004H1V5RU|5.0|This is a very fun toy.  I would recommend it for kids and adults with a lot of patients.  I caution handing it over to a child unsupervised unless you want the toy broken in less than a week.  Just consider that you have a plastic sphere with small plastic parts inside and....  a steel ball inside!  Violent shaking or dropping will not help your Epic survive very long. I'm 43 and have it on my office desk.  Quite a conversation piece.  Everyone wants to play with it.  My brother is a science teacher and I am giving him one for Christmas.  Currently, I'm stuck at level 80 at the very top... Hope to solve it soon!

B004A8ZWVK|4.0|If I had world enough and time (especially time!), I'd be one of those people who--when it came to comparing a movie to its source novel--could always state authoritatively which was better. I imagine that nine times out of ten, it really would be the book, BUT according to the critics, there have been numerous, and very notable, exceptions (THE GODFATHER, JAWS, M*A*S*H, among other--probably arguable--examples).  Well, I like to read and am an avid movie goer, but how often can I (or anyone living in the real world) say that we're even in a position to compare the two?  For me, book vs. movie is usually an either/or proposition.  I either haven't read the book prior to taking in the movie OR I read it so far in the past, that I've forgotten the plot.  So it was really by almost the sheerest of coincidences that I recently saw not ONE but two films based on books I'd only just read: THE HELP and the abbreviatedly entitled HEDGEHOG (why they downplayed its elegance is a mystery to me).  And, yes, both were reasonably faithful to the original's plotline and were obviously done with great respect--and maybe even love--for the source material, neither really captured the essence of the literary work that inspired it.  And both seemed too hasty, too choppy and underdeveloped.  I came away from them with a certain respect for the filmmakers' chutzpah in trying to adapt serious, idea-rich literature to the big screen but wondering if it's really worth the effort.  When I read Kathryn Stockett's THE HELP, it really didn't seem all that sprawling a novel.  Stockett was able to juggle the various plotlines handily, and in truth, they all did interrelate to a large degree. (It's Skeeter's concern of the fate of her own family's maid, Constantine, that inspires to seek out the personal stories of Jackson's other \\"colored\\" maids and relate them to the rest of the world.  One storyline feeds off the other in a very real sense.  Even the Celia Foote sub-plot which might sound kindof schematic and obvious in outline form(girl from the wrong side of the tracks--or the town line--is as much an object of scorn as any of \\"the help\\"), but Celia is too loveable and vividly portrayed to be simply a plot device.  In general, the book's relatively leisurely pace gives us as much time as we need to get to know its numerous characters.  In all fairness, that's an almost insurmoutnable task to set before a filmmaker.  You can't tell EVERYONE's story in just over two hours.  You can hint at those stories, but almost all the characters are going to end up cheated on some level or other.  Everything about the film version of THE HELP seems too rushed, too obvious and a tad awkward. Every line seems rushe: every emotion telegraphed. Even Skeeter's unruly, frizzy hair seems fake.  It's like a bad perm.  (If actress Emma Stone really DOES have naturally curly hair, I'll eat my toupee.)  And, really, she's just too pert and petite and, yeah, PRETTY to effectively play the oft-times socially and physically awkward Skeeter.  When I heard that Jessica Chastain would be appearing in THE HELP, I thought that she would be ideal for the role of Skeeter and was surprised to learn that she would be portraying Celia.  Ms. Chastain is a skillful actress who seems to transform herself physically for her roles:  she's really quite attractive in a way that some might describe as \\"handsome,\\" she has that kind of coltish athleticism that the role of Skeeter would seem to require.  As it turns out, she's also quite good as the sexy, skittish Celia.  She is clearly a young actress to watch, in every sense of the word.  Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer bring real depth to what you could call their \\"title roles.\\"  Of course, Aibileen and Minny were co-narrators in the novel, so you would hope and expect their characters to be among the more developed ones in the film.  But Skeeter's role in the novel is just as significant, and the film really doesn't do justice by her.  Davis, especially, gets the screen time she needs to develop the character of Aibileen and establish her as the film's cornerstone.  It's understandable that the filmmakers give Aibileen the spotlight, I suppose.  She is the film's sole narrator, and that's a justifiable choice.  The novel's three different voices would have been impossible to convey cinematically. One of those voices HAS to become dominant, and in 2011 you can say it's pretty much high time that that dominant voice be the one offering the African American perspective.  That's one of many things that the film really does get right.  It's clear that the project was a labor of love on the part of director Tate Taylor.  I only learned recently that Taylor and Stockett are close friends and that the filmmaker had started development on the project even before the novel was finished.  In a way, that surprised me though, since even his \\"insider perspective\\" didn't seem to prevent him from taking apparent shortcuts that often don't work and sometime come a cropper, the botch of a job telling Constantine's story, for instance.   Taylor can count on his stellar cast to help him get over many of the awkward moments.  Bryce Dallas Howard somehow is able to inject a bit of humanity into the otherwise despicable character of Hilly.  In the book, Hilly was a devoted mother at least, and in her own way, something of a caring friend to Skeeter.  The script, by contrast, doesn't offer much insight into Hilly's inner workings. But Howard is somehow able to convey something of Hilly's human-ness, despite those limitations.  She makes Hilly a little less of a caricature than the role might otherwise have been.  Which is not to say that she doesn't DESERVE that pie...

There is nothing on the box which states this need and you do not find this out until you get home and the Christmas present will not work without it. I understand you should do some research on products before you buy them but reading the users guide may be a stretch. I am now stuck with a $100 paperweight until I get to a WiFi connection.     Books cannot be transferred except by WiFi, save yourself the hassle and buy the Kindle. Much more user friendly and easier to use/download books transfer books. Thought to give Barnes and Noble a try, wont do that again will be returning the Nook for a Kindle.
B003PIUBZS|1.0|I loved the Rome series and wanted to like this.  I rented the first episode of the first series and just did not enjoy it.  Other reviewers have mentioned the gore aspect. Imagine a sword cleaving human flesh and switch to slow motion as blood flies through the air. I didnt find it artistic - just bad taste and needless.  The story seemed like a soap opera set in a past time.  As the title of my review suggests, I would recommend paying 1.99 for the first episode and decide for yourself. I will not be buying any more of this.
B003PIUBZS|4.0|Great series (Spartacus) and good entertainment (not for children).  This is an adult package for viewing.  Hard to put down once you get watching and you have to be careful since you want to go from one CD to the next since you really get caught up in the action.
B005POK858|4.0|I &quot;beat&quot; the game, but I'm still playing it because there's more to do.  It's been a fun way to waste some time and relax.  I only wish the &quot;auto&quot; feature of battle made things go even faster than it does.  The only bad thing about the program is that if you don't quit throught the title screen, it locks up &amp; resets my Droid2.  Great game overall!
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|This is a good game, but after I played a few rounds it froze up so completely that I had to take off my phone case, take apart my phone, and take out the battery just to use my phone again.
B004U5WZG8|5.0|First, STOP, LISTEN (pretend these are original lyrics; I'd never heard some of them); Now what matters the most is, that we should thank her for sharing her voice and talent with us.  She's fresh and powerful. She's working towards the promise of a bright future.      OK, I don't know this young woman's story very well as I just came across her tonight. She won a national (UK) competition called Open Mic (I think, Wikipedia & Youtube her).      Anyways, I don't think her music has rights to be played over here in the States so I don't know if we'll be able to hear her on the radio.  So you'll have to buy her music online I assume.  This imported price is really high.  You can get the cd from the Amazon.UK for much cheaper; even after rate conversion or from the other Sellers here (they're UK based from what I saw).    Give her a shot, then maybe in the future we'll be ready for her next cd that might have more of her original works.      Well, that's it, had to give her a review since she wasn't reviewed yet.

B004JN1CW4|3.0|The Maze Runner-Good  The Scorch Trials-Average  The Death Cure-Really James?  The Death Cure didn't start off on a good note. Battle after battle. Fight after fight. It took a very long time to get into. It wasn't until the 200th page or so that I found it interesting. Dashner put in a post-apocalyptic/Dawn of the Dead style twist. Driving down abandoned roads with blood-thirsty Cranks? Classic. Everything else? Not so much.   Some questions on everyone's minds will be answered, however, too many are not. You get to the last page and read that last word, sit back, and just want to say, &#34;Now what?&#34; But, alas, that is one of the unanswered questions. Who knows what could happen next? But nobody ever will...
B005V4FJC4|3.0|And it's nothing to write home about. Some decent songs, some not so decent.... but why did they decide to sing \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside\\" way too fast? Nothing memorable here in a positive way, but other than \\"Baby\\", nothing really bad, either.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|We LOVE this movie! And we have made it a tradition to watch it (a few times even!) every December. Of course, throughout the year, we all spew quotes from the movie (\\"Smiling's my favorite!\\") The kids love the movie, the adults laugh at its silliness, an overall great experience!<br /><br />I personally am not a huge Will Ferrell fan, but this movie is fantastic! Very funny, and a good Christmas message to it as well.
0761129235|5.0|Out of the various personal development and business books filling the shelves of todays bookstores, this book in my opinion is a must read for anyone wanting to either make a slight improvement to their lives or trying to completely alter the direction of their lives.  Subsequently I honestly believe this book is able to enhance ones business from a small time paperstand into a global brand.  So what makes this book such a powerful book?  Well due to the simple fact that author completely changes our ideas about how to get something done to the point of completion. Most westerners (according to the author Dr Robert Maurer) tend to use the 'Innovation' approach to getting things done.  This concept works on the idea of throwing all our time and resources behind one single task and not stopping until the task in question is completed.    Yet Dr Maurer in his book shows how studies in science have shown that this is the least effective approach in getting things done.  The new approach?  Kaizen which he describes as the breaking of tasks down into small steps. On doing so, you'd than focus on each particular step and only that step until it is done, and celebrating the accomplishment of each of those steps.  By doing so, you will greatly enhance your motivation to undertake the subsequent steps until the task in question is completed.  Yet as well as the accomplishing of goals by series of small steps, Dr Maurer also goes on to show how thinking small thoughts and also asking small questions can give one the motivation and comfort to go on and achieve the big things in life.  I particularly like his chapter on Mindscultping, where he shows how slight change in our thinking can lead to tremendous improvements in our attitude.  A must read.

1451648537|5.0|Although quite technical and perhaps overly descriptive at points, this book is required reading for our times.  Regardless of where you fall on the Apple-Google-Microsoft fan continuum, or the hours you've devoted to arguing the merits of open vs. closed systems, this book provides an unrivaled look into the life and times of one of the greatest leaders of our time.  Balanced evenly in tone and survey of opinion, Steve Jobs emerges as not only the hard line, brash leader at the helm of Apples success, but also as an extremely complex man, passionate about music, design, control, and unfortunately to a lesser extent, about his family.  Anyone with even the most cursory interest in Apple or half of the brainpower that created it in their California garage, should definitely pick this book up and give it a chance.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Someday later down the road, when the kids are older, we will inevitably buy whatever special edition collection is out there. As it is, our kids are young. Accidents happen, discs get scratched, broken, etc. We wanted just the movies and we didn't own any of them yet.  We knew this was just the movies and no special features, again, that's fine. Great quality, nice packaging, the movies play well. Also we did not have a problem with any of the DVD's missing the cover art. Brand new, in perfect condition, and they all play great.  Just what we wanted!
B005HV6Y84|1.0|There is only one good song on here. It Will Rain by Bruno Mars. Save your money and just buy the one song on itunes. I don't understand why they keep putting this awful music to such a great movie. The only good soundtrack to this series was the first one.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I've been so disappointed with some of the other bargain Kindle books (I've since learned to always get a free sample first), that this book was a joyful surprise. Well-written, with both laughs and tears. I'll look for more of Ms. McKenna's books, and would be happy to pay more than 99 cents for one.
B005D0RDIE|5.0|I've been a fan of RUSH since their first vinyl release in 1974. I've had the pleasure of attending more than a few RUSH concerts in Chicago and in San Diego. This disc brings home the excitement of watching a top band perform flawlessly LIVE (without needing ear-protection) AND they played all my favorites. Other reviewers have successfully dissected the performance, song by song, so I'll skip that. The clever 'time machine' theme in the stage settings as well as the imaginitive vignettes(featuring the band members)add an element of humor that makes this performance by these 'old-guys' laugh-out-loud memorable. ANY fan of RUSH will completely enjoy this disc.

This is a band that even after this 25th anniversary continued producing new material, so also try the \\"Falling In Between\\" dvd also. Some different members but still first class. We all love Jeff but Simon Phillips never missed a beat...I have everything Toto ever put on film and this is probably the best overall quality picture, sound and show with the afore-mentioned running a close second. Can't beat the price either!
0307946711|4.0|This book wasn't exactly what I expected, though I did enjoy it. I thought it was going to be a huge fairytale/tragedy much like all of Nicholas Sparks' novels. It was a lot more real to life, though, in many ways. I really enjoyed seeing the changes in Emma throughout the course of time, growing up. Overall, it wasn't the most impressive thing I've read, but I enjoyed that it was fairly unique and I'm still looking forward to seeing the movie.
B000683VI4|5.0|Great movie, and arrived in great condition. This movie will be one of my top ten favorites of all time.
B00005JK8K|1.0|I caught this flick as a TV cable re-run. I had missed it when it was released in theaters and had always wanted to see it. I knew two of the real code talkers as old men and had gotten some factual background.  What a disappointment! This movie was bad on so many points, it's hard to know where to start. My main gripe is that it seemed more about Nicolas Cage personally, \\"the great and versatile actor,\\" than about the Navajo code talkers in WW2. The scenes seemed to be specially contrived more to exhibit Cage's acting skills than to tell a believable and riveting story about the code talkers.  The editing was disjointed and the battle scenes were actually comical in places because they went against what every combat soldier knows is believable behavior in combat if you don't want to get killed. The scenes were overly dramatic with fake blood spattering, obviously for audience impact. Stunt men were constantly being blown into the air, overly dramatic fiery explosions nearby, bunched-up marines calmly exposing themselves to ambush fire, etc.  The military advisors, if there were any, were completely ignored for the sake of unrealistically excessive special effects.   I could go on and on but will summarize by saying that this was nowhere near the cinematic achievement of Saving Private Ryan, Lost Battalion, or Band of Brothers. I can't comment on the ending because Windtalkers stunk so bad I was confused and lost interest about two thirds through and switched channels to a much better crafted old black and white detective movie on TCM.    Windtalker was really bad, unless maybe if you're a ten year old with a couple of school friends, plenty of popcorn, and nothing else to do on a Saturday afternoon. I'm just glad I didn't pay money to see it in a theater.
B004SBQAN8|5.0|I gave this film five stars because it was non-stop entertainment. I had put off watching this movie for a long time, expecting to be just another movie about an action hero with supernatural powers and found myself completely engrossed in the film. The acting is well done and characters roles are played perfectly. I'm not saying this movie will change your life or expand your mind, but if want a movie that has great directing and is fun. This is the one. Enjoy! I certainly did.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is great! This is my tried & true game to cure boredom! Its great to try & get 3 stars on every level!

B005UT29Z0|1.0|A movie on the financial crisis could be really interesting, educational and an overall good movie.  This movie certainly had all the right actors to make such a movie.  However, it fails in a big way.  Don't waste your money or time by renting it.  This movie was just boring--REALLY boring.  It didn't explain the financial crisis. Having read several books on the subject, I understand the crash (at least for a layman). I doubt that anyone who saw this movie would walk away enlightened or understanding the issues that led to it.  They never explain anything about the crash.  All you see is that a big wallstreet firm is overleveraged and is about to dump a bunch of stuff. They don't explain what's being dumped, why its being dumped, why the 'volatility' is happening...nothing. They made a movie on the crash and I'm not sure they ever even used the term 'subprime' in it.  That should tell you how little this movie explains the crash.    The entire thing is laced with a class warfare overtone via one character who's only purpose in the film is to say, 'how much do you think so-and-so makes?' throughout the film.  Ok..we got the point.  Wallstreeters earn a lot of money.  We knew that going into the film so why beat it to death?  In case that wasn't boring enough, half of the rest of the film is filled with silent panning scenes of everything from the NYC skyline to the streets to rooms of traders. The occasional silent, panning scene can be profound in a movie.  Silent panning scenes every 5 minutes in a film just suggests a lack of decent dialogue and space/time fillers.  If you removed all the silent scenes and all of the scenes of little discussions about how much wallstreeters make, it would make no impact on the story but there would only be about half-hour of film left.  Hopefully someone else will make a movie on this subject.  The book, The Big Short, would make a good movie.  It also made an excellent read and a good explanation of what led us to where we aretoday.  The Big Short was written by the author of The Blind Side and Money Ball.
B0001WTWCO|5.0|I suppose I should start off by saying I am a closet romantic if my wife new I was writing this review (not so much a review as we all know what its about but more what I take from the story) she would definitely have a good laugh. I will be the first to admit the tears rolled during the final scenes of this movie even though I new the ending had a foregone conclusion. The first time I saw it I couldn't bear to watch it again as the lovelorn Almasy asks to die to escape his grief. After more than a decade I gave it another go yes the same old punch in the stomach was there at the end but this time I was able to appreciate the story more.   The movie's principal theme has been routinely described as \\"romantic\\" but you can not fail to notice the style of a classical tragedy which centers around the relationship and ultimate deaths of the three characters involved in the ménage a trois (Almasy, Katherine and Geoffrey).  There have been many negative comments that it was nothing more than a tale of disgusting adultery by stereotypical upper class British aristocrats that centered on the lustful desires of the two utterly unlikable main characters. Personally I saw it differently. Was there adultery? Yes. Was it fair to the husband? No. Yet if they were weak in succumbing to their desires was he not as equally guilty in his murder/suicide bid. Which would be classified as the greater sin?  The two main characters have also been negatively reviewed as shallow and self centered and utterly unlikable and that they were never in love.   In one of the many dramatic scenes Katherine slaps Almasy hard in anger through sheer desperation at her own need for him, even as she comes to him for the first time, dressed in white, presenting herself as his true though not legal bride who needs him more than she can bear. She hates and loves him at the same time; is ecstatically happy and miserably unhappy at the same time as she confesses to him, fully aware of what is happening to her, yet unable and ultimately unwilling to resist it.  In the beginning Almasy treats Katherine with cool indifference yet behind this mask his eyes begin to give away the passion that is beginning to build within him. The penetrating stare he gives Katherine at Shepeards Hotel as they dance the foxtrot is loaded with sexual tension so much so that Katherine cannot hold it but looks away and demurely looks back a second time.  Many people ask did Katherine and Almasy love each other the answer is proven by Almasy's three day trek across the desert to save her which tragically fails, his return to the cave to fulfill his promise to take her home to be buried in England even though he knew she was dead. When he tells Katherine as they lie together in his room \\"that here you are a different wife\\" is obviously a guarded reference that he wishes to possess her even though he knows legally she cannot be his wife, yet he still claims a part of her as his own, foregoing his own abhorrence of ownership. One of the most painful moments of the movie is when he demands; \\"dance with me, I want to touch you, I want the things that are mine, that belong to me\\" you cannot fail to feel the anguish of their love for each other. The thimble he gives her at the Cairo market is a classical symbol of love and togetherness forever, yet tragically he never utters the words I love you that are symbolic of so many love stories. Yet in this story the need for such sentiments is dramatically unnecessary as Fiennes and Scott Thomas have an onscreen chemistry not seen since Rhett and Scarlet captured our hearts in another war/romance/epic.   Many viewers were also unable to understand the attraction between Almasy and Katherine which was blithely discounted as pure lust. To label it such shows a complete disregard by some viewers for the intricacies of the acting and the script.   Who was Almasy; this man who tells Madox \\"There is no God,\\" who states and enacts the fact he does not want to be owned by anyone that he wants to be in control of his own destiny and seems unwilling to believe that he can succumb to the greater force of love. That only insures that he will fall so much the harder for resisting and denying it.      By loving Almasy, Katherine also violates her own choice to stay, in effect, spiritually a virgin: by having married her best friend from childhood rather than anyone who would cause her pain, she had made a conscious decision to shun passion. We get an insightful glimpse of Katherine when Geoffrey states; \\"she was always crying on my shoulder about someone I finally convinced her to settle for my shoulder stroke of genius really\\". That was what Katherine did she settled she gave up on love as much as Almasy shunned it   Their need for each other, for love was eventually much greater than there ability to resist it which overshadowed for them all the other horrible consequences of their affair. As Amasy states; \\"The rest meant nothing to me\\" his reference that his promise to comeback was all the was important to him. Generally in life we do not choose who we love, I like to think love chooses us and in this respect Almasy and Katherine were doomed from the start.  This is a movie you will not fully appreciate on the first, second or even third viewing as there are so many; intricacies, facial expressions and symbolistic subjects intertwined into the story. eg ( Look for the shadow of a cross on Almasys face as they plan their liaison during the Christmas party symbolic of their sin on a religious festivity). (When in the cave with the injured Katherine he promises to come back for her that he will never leave her he leaves his Herodotus with her his only true possession to symbolize the fact he will return). Hope I have pushed you in the right direction.  Enjoy.
B005U3V7MC|5.0|If you know and like Jane Austen's novels you will love this book. The grande dame of contemporary British police procedurals does a follow-up to Pride and Prejudice six years after the marriage of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, and mixes it up with a murder mystery. Wonderfully written, filled with exactly the sly, deadpan humour and social satire for which Jane Austen is loved, and without falling into a faux-Regency style, perfectly captures both the spirit and slow intrigue of the great English Novelist.
B000M341QE|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I think it is Martin Scorcese's best movie ever, and he has made some extremely good movies.  This is a great movie about police corruption and the illicit activities of a band of criminals.  The directing, story telling, and ending are superb!
0143035711|5.0|Probably the best book you'll ever read.  I loved this book from the beginning till the very last page.  I had to force myself to put it down, so I would more to read the next day.  A spectacular, read, maybe only slightly better than \\"About Face,\\" but only because  the action is non-stop, and at the speed of a UH-1.  If you have never read anything on what exactly the Army did in Vietnam or how good they trained their Helo Pilots, you will know after reading this...  Being retired Military, but not from the Army, I have always heard that The Navy had the best jet pilots, and The Army had the best Helicopter pilots. And it is so true, even today.  I wish Robert Mason would write more of his Helo days with The Army, even second hand accounts, this real-life stuff is so much more interesting than fiction, and some of the things that happened over their will blow your mind.

B001LF347E|3.0|The show is great, which those looking at this DVD set probably already know.  The packaging of the discs is poor.  I just got this set today, opened it, and one of the discs was loose in the package, scratched on back.  The clips that hold in the discs are just half a circle, not a full circle like on a normal DVD case.  This is so they can save money and squeeze 5 discs into less space.  When I clip the damaged disc back in, it just falls out again.  The clip is broken.  I got Season 2 as well.  Those were ok from what I can tell.  But it has the same cheesy system to hold the discs in.  I'm having to send this set back and try to get a replacement that isn't damaged.  Amazon does try to make it as easy as they can to return something, which is a reason to buy only from Amazon and not other sellers.  It's a hassle.  But that's the risk you take buying something like this through mail order.  So 5 stars for the show, 1 star for the bad packaging = 3 stars.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I could rant on and on about the beauty of this series - the thrilling quality, the exceptional characterization, the breathtaking cinematography and score, the story, the emotions, the reality, the deftness. I could list scene after scene of masterful directing and acting. But here, I will revel in its themes and people, in its aspirations and history.<br /><br />Here are the men of Easy Company, 506th PIR, World War II. The characters are real persons in history; don't forget that. It what makes the series so special. They are real, this did happen. This is not just another war movie. Indeed, can it be called so generally a \\"war movie\\"? It defies such genre terms. This has such depth, such meaning. There is no music in the action scenes. No; such horrors are not something to from which to elicit orchestrated excitement. This is war, life and death. This is serious.<br /><br />Here is the brotherhood, the trauma, the delight, the pain of a select few of soldiers, a tried and true \\"band of brothers.\\" Nothing is held back. We see death and feel injustice. We are given the bare, unedited facts of cruelty and sorrow in the war. Yet we are also shown strength and honor, camaraderie and leadership, a certain beauty inherent in that same action. We see life's two sides and realize the terror was, yes, somehow worth it in the end.<br /><br />There are many themes; each show explores a different moving motion. There is quality beyond description. I can't even imagine that these are actors. No; these are such real people, down to the dirt on their fingernails and the quiet, fearful honesty that is portrayed on some level by each.<br /><br />I owe a great debt to this series. Its careful adherence to historical accuracy has broadened my knowledge immensely. Its beautiful rendition of character and orchestration has elevated my soul to heights of inspiration and delight. It has introduced me to people I will never forget. It has shown me reality; it has shown me beauty. I have been immersed in an experience worth knowing, in character worth emulating, and I will treasure the time I have spent in its presence.owing, in character worth emulating, and I will treasure the time I have spent in its presence.
1439102732|5.0|Warning: this review makes some slight references/hints to the endings of the book and of the book My Sister's Keeper. These references, however, are general and non-explicit. If you are super-sensitive about knowing even the type of tone of the ending, proceed with caution.  As someone familiar with Jodi Picoult's novels, I knew this book would at least be an *interesting* read. Picoult is known for taking on controversial subjects, and this one (gay rights--although why that should be controversial still eludes me--) is indeed an interesting one. I had been immensely moved by My Sister's Keeper. And when I looked in the middle of this book and read some of the pages, I was hooked instantly. I got the book and then read it. And she did it again.  Once again, Jodi Picoult has emotionally gutted me. I didn't think it possible. I didn't think she could repeat the enormously poignant, moving, touching, gripping, page-turning, wrenching, devastating story of My Sister's Keeper. But she did. Sing you Home is slower, with the same of Picoult's sometimes tangential style, but, my God, is it touching. All of the characters are portrayed with depth, and I really respect her for that. She makes Max, the evangelical father seeking the embryos, not an entirely brainwashed convert but someone who really holds onto his own independent conscience and realizes that the church might be advocating its own agenda and forgetting about the people--his ex-wife, Zoe-- involved. Max still cares about Zoe; they don't detest each other. I liked this; it kept it from being a conventional hatred-based custody battle: both Max and Zoe inquire after each other's health and care about each other, and, ultimately, do not want to see each other hurt. In fact, Max completely balks at several points because he knows that his actions will hurt Zoe, but is convinced by his priest otherwise.  Picoult understands the range and depth of human emotions, and she is particularly talented at being able to convey and articulate them when it comes to \\"controversial\\" issues like gay rights and organ donation. None of the principal characters in this novel are caricatures no one is a stereotypical evangelical or newly-realized lesbian or lesbian advocate. Each person is a person, and in the outcome of her book, Picoult ultimately shows us the greatest lesson of all: no politics, no discourse about who is morally right or morally wrong, but to rise above politics and rhetoric and construction and remember and rely on the truest compass and the truest moral guide we have inside---that of our own humanity.   Bravo, Jodi Picoult. You've done it again.  I cried when I read this book. I also have cried both times that I've read My Sister's Keeper.  Picoult is undoubtedly a good writer, and she's written many books, but I have to say, either she writes a completely unsatisfying book (Harvesting the Heart, The Tenth Circle) or she really hits the nail on the head.  This book, with all its subtlety, its complexities, its moral nuances, its social insight, its calm portrayal of dramatic twists and turns, should have won an award. It and My Sister's Keeper are Picoult's best works. She is a writer of humanity. She can capture and convey human emotions more directly and poignantly than any other popular modern writer I have read. This book is a tour-de-force. This tale is riveting (literally, once you get to one point, you cannot put it down), heart-wrenching, sometimes funny, and always gentle. There seems to be a general sense of optimism in the resolution of novels like My Sister's Keeper and Sing You Home, suggesting that Picoult believes most of all in the power of the human spirit and its capacity to love and empathize. That is, our humanity, not our politics, is the greatest force there is.  For once again tackling an ethically complicated issue (and with, once again, throwing in dramatic revelations that do indeed shock the reader as much as an unexpected twist in a Law and Order episode do), Picoult has achieved an emotionally perfect novel. It is both emotionally devastating and healing; my emotions were explored, twisted, turned, poked, prodded, stabbed, but also bathed in sweetness, covered in gentleness, and ultimately, given over to a sense of perfect and complete rightness. This book has a beautiful ending, less painful than My Sister's Keeper, but still painful in the journey.   Picoult was her own Solomon in this novel. In her judgment/fate of her characters, she decides and shows us the value that is most important, beyond politics or religion: humanity.  This book holds a special place in my heart. Brava, Jodi Picoult. And thank you.

0545265355|4.0|first off, i really like the books and i think the books are well-planned and authentic. unlike a lot of fantasy/sci fi books, the books actually show how terrible the original \\"empire\\" is. i love the idea of putting people together to kill off each other and i think it's a good way to show the ruthlessness of the bad guys and a strong enough motivation for the rebels to try to topple the gov't. the hunger games scenes were exceptionally well-written and i literally couldn't stop reading!! however, i do think the Peeta-Katniss romance thing is kind of typical. it's not that predictable like most romance novels but i don't really like the way Peeta and Katniss interact. it seems so one-sided and I really don't like how Katniss was so indecisive about which one she should choose-Gale or Peeta because it's like in Twilight where Bella was trying to choose between Edward and Jacob and that's just too typical. and the books made it sound like that Katniss was the most unfortunate person on earth and that what she was experiencing was the most painful thing ever while i think Peeta was much more miserable than Katniss. that doesn't make the books bad tho because it's seen from Katniss' POV but i just don't like Katniss. nevertheless, this is just a personal opinion and the books are still great despite the fact that the protagonist is annoying.   first, the plot was awesome. things fit together in the end and all problems/mysteries got solved and there wasn't any loose end (at least i didn't see any) the clock-like stadium in book 2 is simply ingenious and made the book a whole lot more exciting and interesting. and the traps in book 3 were very well-designed and intriguing. but the atmosphere was kind of too dull, compared to the other two. the first one was probably the easiest to get into as it felt less depressing and the game was still new to the reader and the way Collins wrote it made the story extremely captivating and made you want to read on. the second one wasabout the same. the game was riveting and the new characters made the story more interesting. but in the third one, there was no game and Katniss was on the brink of insanity so, since we read the books from her POV, the entire world seemed almost to explode with all the depression. i'm not saying that the plot wasn't good, in fact, the arrangement and transition of various events were very professional, but the whole thing just seemed SO dark that you got so grim after reading it.   so yeah, the story and most of the things in it are perfect except that it could be dull at times and some of the characters are not that likable (personal preference tho) anyways, i recommend the series to anyone who enjoys reading and also to those who haven't read a lot, it'll be a good start and make you fall in love with books, but some of the scenes are probably too violent and bloody for kids under 10. yeah, so ENJOY!!
0061906220|5.0|While substitute teaching for a kindergarten class, I played this CD and book as left in the teacher's instructions.  Kindergarteners love stories, but this one was like Elvis coming to town! We read the book three times and would have done more if the students had their way.  I had to obtain a copy of my own to take on my travels.  It is also an excellent gift for people with young children.  If you do decide to give it as a gift, make sure you also record the story and song off of the website listed on the book's cover.

B005I6EU48|5.0|I loved the look of this cover on this page, was somewhat worried by some of the negative reviews, but decided to see for myself.<br />I am so glad I did!<br />The look is great and, with KindleFire snugly inserted, the feel and heft is just like reading a good old book.<br />If you are worried about the naysaying reviews here, please go back up ^ and read the \\"product description\\" wherein the manufacturer (I presume) explains the \\"whys\\" and \\"break-in period.\\"<br />Then order one for yourself. I think you'll be glad you did!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Love this cover!  I had bought a leather cover that was just too big and bulky for carrying my fire everywhere (which I do).  I know some said it is flimsy but I don't think so- it is light, thin and serves its purpose perfectly.  For those familiar with the thin ipad covers, this cover is more like those, and I for one am very happy with mine!

B005OK725M|5.0|My first opinion is that who ever gave this movie a (1,2, or 3) does not like the kind of action movie that I do. But again. that is my opinion! Once this movie got started I became more and more engrossed with the characters and the plot. Forget about the action, there is non better! But again, this is just my opinion. To continue, Each time our leading lady got into a jam I  found myself cherring. I must of admit, that there were certain situations that I find it had to believe  that anyone could get out of. I could go on and on, but check out this movie. I think it will surprise you!

0439023521|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I would recommend it to anyone.  It had a great story line and it kept you interested.  It was very suspenseful and you wanted to keep reading to the end.  There were a lot of violent scenes which may dicourage some readers but overall I thought it was a wonderful book.

B003Y5H5HO|1.0|\\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is a series of scenes of sadomasochistic torture. The most graphic scene depicts a large adult male violating a female who has the body of a pubescent girl. There are other, less graphic scenes where males are subject to sadomasochistic torture. There is a series of still photographs of women who have been subjected to sadomasochistic torture. Audience members who are attracted to that activity, or fantasies of it, will very much want to see this film. They will be rewarded by it. The film will inspire some to pursue the opportunity to violate women and girls. The filmmakers will profit from others' pain.<br /><br />A flimsy, utterly vanilla murder plot - a plot out of a C-grade episode of \\"Columbo\\" - is the excuse for the exploitation scenes. A girl named Harriet disappeared forty years ago from a rich family's private island in Sweden. If you're at all curious as to what happened to Harriet, do yourself a favor and perform a google search of the film's title plus the word \\"spoiler.\\" You'll soon discover how vapid the plot is.<br /><br />The biggest mystery of the film is why all these people ostensibly living in Sweden speak English with variations on Scandinavian accents, accents that roll around unevenly between Helsinki and Vienna. Robin Wright's accent is best. Christopher Plummer's is worst. Daniel Craig doesn't even try (memories of his uneven Polish accent in \\"Defiance.\\")<br /><br />Harriet is being pursued by Daniel Craig, a reporter, and Lisbeth, the eponymous heroine. Lisbeth is strictly a male fantasy who could never exist in real life. She is less real than the blow-up doll Ryan Gosling fell in love with in \\"Lars and the Real Girl.\\" Lisbeth has superhero powers on a computer, with weapons, on a motorcycle, and in international finance, but she is helpless when men attempt to assault her. Make the woman powerful and then violate and humiliate her: a classic motif of misogynist porn. Lisbeth has the body of a pubescent girl, and you get to see every inch of it. For the gentlemen's club crowd, Lisbeth does girl-on-girl action, but, in the end, her job is to make the male lead, and viewer, happy.<br /><br />As part of the film's pretentious overlay, there are lots of interior shots of Swedish furniture and exterior shots of snow. Chair. Snow. Wind. Torture. Lather. Rinse. Repeat.<br /><br />The film is boring. The attempts to create tension are pathetic and hackneyed. A character is alone in an archive at night. Suddenly a door is heard closing. OOOO boogedy boogedy! I'm really scared now! Evidence is pieced together and suddenly one realizes who the villain is. And the villain is creeping up upon the hero even at that very moment! Be still my heart. A killer talks for a really long time before dispatching the victim, thus potentially giving a rescuer a chance to arrive. Wow, I've never seen THAT done before!<br /><br />There is a completely pointless series of scenes tacked on at the end relating to high finance. So much for narrative tension and drive. Trent Reznor's score is endlessly irritating in its neediness: \\"Listen to me! Listen to me! Listen to me! I'm doing something really edgy here!\\" I kept thinking of Bernard Herrmann's amazing shower scene music from \\"Psycho,\\" music that seemed to just be the natural sound that scene would make, music that was a seamless part of the terror. No such moments in \\"Tattoo.\\"<br /><br />What else. Rich people are bad. Nazis are really, really bad. Rich Nazis are really, really, really bad. Fat people are worst of all. The Bible causes people to become serial killers who hate women. Interestingly, boring, pretentious torture porn, apparently, does not cause people to become serial killers who hate women. Every other Swedish home has an extensively equipped torture chamber - you missed that at IKEA, didn't you? Well, the stores ARE really big. Torture is such a popular national pastime in Sweden that you have to wonder how they make time to prepare their famous meatballs, never mind Volvos. Tourists traveling to Sweden must learn to say, \\"Don't tase me, Bro,\\" in Swedish, and should never, ever drop the soap.ng to Sweden must learn to say, \\"Don't tase me, Bro,\\" in Swedish, and should never, ever drop the soap.

1451648537|4.0|I was one of the first Apple geeks, buying an Apple IIE as the first computer for myself and children.  I had worked on all types available, but Jobs definitely understood this computer would become \\"personal.\\"  Later, when opening a desktop publishing company with three others, we went with the Mac II and Apple Laserwriters.  I went from buying computers to buying Apple stock and hanging on to it even though everyone was telling me I was nuts to do so.  Apple Geeks have faith!  This book shows what a complex guy Steve Jobs was and the brilliance of his thinking for the development of personal gadgets, including the computer.  I'm not sure I would have liked the guy, but he was a fascinating personality.  In addition to learning about Jobs and Apple, I am finding the book so revealing as to the relationships between other computer industry giants, including Bill Gates.  I honestly never realized how much interaction existed between the various companies during these early days of development.  I also enjoyed seeing how NeXT became a part of the Mac system.  Having had the chance to work on one in a Purdue lab, I found it a great machine.  Thanks to the author for giving us a wonderful portrait of one of the greatest minds of our generation and for giving us a real timeline about computers and their development.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|Alright, look guys. This is a great thing for Star Wars. It's in full 1080p HD and remastered. I personally am a HUGE Star Wars fan and have the original VHS versions of them all. I don't have the DVDs but I just got the Blu Ray versions. They are amazing. Great sound. Great video. A huge step for star wars. Yeah it's not the original but it's something good! Great job Lucas Films!
B0056369RO|4.0|Let me start with the promo videos for the singles on this album, since they're what got me to buy the album.<br /><br />After hearing 'Party Rock Anthem' on the radio a few times, I decided to look up the video for it on youtube. The chorus \\"Everybody's shufflin'\\" got stuck in my head. The video was awesome!<br /><br />The video for 'Sexy and I know it' which I quickly found was likewise good. The artists don't take themselves seriously, and the videos are entertaining and fit the music well. This got me to buy the album. With two great songs on it, I knew I'd be satisfied.<br /><br />It turns out, two great songs is what I have to settle for. I don't know much about rap, but I like electronica, pop music, and (dating myself) rave music. The album is good, but a lot of the songs sound very similar to me, which makes it background instead of foreground music. 'Party Rock Anthem' and 'Sexy and I Know It' remain the stand-outs, though not as enjoyable without their video accompaniement. 'Take It To The Hole' and 'We Came Here to Party' also rise above the album's average, as does the second half of 'Rock the Beat II'. The rest I'm afraid I could take or leave.<br /><br />The beats are good, the singing is fine, and some of it reminds me of what I've heard of Snoop Dog on the radio, which I guess is a compliment. The rest of the album fades into the background, but at least none of it is bad.<br /><br />The style of the album overall is consistent, so if you like a few of their songs, you should like all of them. I'm happy to have this in my library, but there's no new gems on the album for me to linger over.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I love dropbox! makes my life much easier! One of the greatest innovations and best of all it's free! And with referrals I have more than enough space than I require.  The app is nice, however I would want the ability to download folders.
B004UXXVQS|4.0|I tend to listen to a lot of radio. 'These Days' has been getting a lot of airplay, so I got this album to own it, and hoping to find a few more songs I would love. In that regard, I'm disappointed. It's a solid album, but 'These Days' is the only stand-out for me.<br /><br />Rather than extolling 'These Days' virtues, I'll assume you've heard it on the radio a hundred times and know whether you like it.<br /><br />If you've enjoyed Foo Fighter's recent album's, you should get this one as well: it's consistent with their other work. If you enjoyed 'These Days' but don't know much about the Foo Fighters, take the time to preview some of the other tracks before springing for the album: 'These Days' is distinct from the other songs, which really is one of the great things about the Foo Fighters. They've got a LOT more depth and variety than some every-song-sounds-the-same songmill.
B003Y5H5C4|3.0|I'm going to presume everyone saw the advertising - because guess what - there's isn't some deep underlying thought process here, no plot twists, no 'Sixth Sense' surprises. What they advertised is exactly what they delivered. And you can't help yourself from laughing. I tried, I really tried. Not quite full-on belly laughs, but enough to make the time fly.<br /><br />These guys are stunning morons - and I don't mean the characters. I mean these people, these actors, are real-life dolts. There's a reason why some performers routinely find themselves in certain roles, because producers can see that they're naturals who fit the script. No skill required.<br /><br />Notice - I did not say 'no talent'. That's because some guys are naturally talented, like Michael Jordan. Basketball was his thing, baseball wasn't; he was a natural on the hardcourt but sucked on the diamond. Some actors can do one kind of role with skill and flourish and not others, it happens. Can you honestly see Aaron Eisenberg as a Navy SEAL in anything other than a farcical satire? It's not a knock against the young actor, but some artists have a wide demonstrable skillset, others don't.<br /><br />Eisenberg, Ansari, McBride and Swardson are natural idiots - it's the movie equivalent of tossing fish into water. No insult, just honest observation. And again, they're funny. :-D<br /><br />I'd also be remiss not to mention a pair of my favorite character actors: Fred Ward and the always enjoyable Michael P&eacute;na, who never ceases to amaze me with his ability to transform himself into an ever growing list of character types.<br /><br />Loved the old school props to Detroit. Hearing Glenn Fry doing 'The Heat Is On', cops chasing cars, guys making crazy moves - loved it. Only wish they had gotten Eddie Murphy & Paul Reiser in a cameo - that would've bleeping rocked! I would've given it a full star bump for that alone.<br /><br />Had decent fun watching these demented bleepers run around having a good time with their one-page script. It worked for the Marx Brothers - I say run with it and have a blast. No pun intended. &lt;g><br /><br />Again, a fun rental, but not for the kiddies. When a flick opens with a fellatio scene, you can pretty much write off any idea of family night at the movies. :-D<br /><br />One final note: I'd actually like to see these exact same actors get together for another movie. It's an old school technique, gathering the same group of actors only switching around roles - Eisenberg and Ansari as the bad guys, McBride and Swanson as their victims. Or just mix them up completely - three bad guys and a single good guy, or heck, all bad guys. Would love to see P&eacute;na as the by-the-book cop. [[ASIN:B005KPM0P8 He's done it before convincingly]] in other films and it would make the perfect contrasted foil to his excellent thug performance in '30 Minutes'.- I say run with it and have a blast.

B006O5Y0SS|3.0|I wouldn't consider myself a Woody Allen fan, but I enjoyed this movie.  There were times that the acting seemed forced (in fact, I think the American actors could have learned some lessons from the Parisian/French actors on authenticity).  But overall, I had fun with the film.  There were points where it seemed forced.  I like Owen Wilson, but he just didn't seem engaged in his role, or perhaps the right fit.  He's definitely intelligent, like the role needed, but his delivery wasn't believable. \\"Oh, you want me to do this right now? Okay.\\"  Perhaps a little too dry.  He just seemed along for the ride and even when he had his moments of clarity, it wasn't as if it was a big connect for him but... well, he was reading his lines.  No real emotional transparency, and that's what I enjoy about actors.  I was definitely entertained by the movie and have recommended it to friends.

0545265355|5.0|This trilogy was riveting from the very beginning.  I generally read non-fiction but had heard so much about the trilogy that I downloaded The Hunger Games on my Kindle to see what all the fuss was about.  I finished book one in a day and had finished the third book with 3 days.  Granted, when a book is interesting to me, I cannot set it down and I'm finding it much easier to fly through Kindle books than a physical book because you can see how much you are reading or have left in your hand and set a book down once you feel well read for the day.  Not with this trilogy!  I couldn't stop reading and everytime I saw someone with one of the books I would beg them to tell me where they were so we could talk about it and bounce ideas off one another.  I hope the movies are an accurate portrayal of Katniss and her spirit as well as all of the extremely well developed characters.  I would hate to see such a phenomenal set of books come to a horrific screenplay.  I think Jennifer Lawrence is a wonderful (AMAZING) actress to be cast as Katniss, and from the look of Peeta and Gale...I will thoroughly enjoy the feature.
B005K0HDGE|1.0|This was the worst book I have bought so far on my Kindle. I am so disappointed in  Stephen King. I think that this book needed a good editer because he rambled on with no point for far to much of the book. Do not buy this book. I want my money back.
B005EZJ3MW|4.0|I bought this cd because Im a huge Demi Lovato fan since her camp rock days. I loved her previews pop albums. When I fist heard this album I didn't like it. I didn't find any good songs except for skyscraper and unbroken. But as I kept listening, now I can say I actually like the album. I love all night long, whos that boy, lightweight, unbroken, fix a heart, give your heart a break, and skyscraper. I do like you're my only shorty , in real life, hold up, and my love is a like a star. However I do not like together or mistake. Overall this is a good album with 14 songs. But I did prefer it to be a little bit more pop than R&B and I would have wanted her to put the spanish version of skyscraper on it. I do recommend it!
B005OZ4EVW|5.0|I have been a Laura Pausini fan since I was about 7 years old when I first heard \\"Strani Amori/Amores Extra&ntilde;os\\".<br /><br />I even learned to speak Italian as a third language, when I was 12, thanks to her music.<br /><br />I'm not going into extensive details but I feel the Great Laura from the times of \\"Le Cose che vivi/Las Cosas que Vives\\" is back.<br /><br />This album is way better than the last ones she made, especially \\"Primavera Anticipada/Primavera in anticipo\\".<br /><br />Not only the music is great but the songs' lyrics are amazing.<br /><br />The first single of this album is \\"Benvenuto/Bienvenido\\" - What an amazing song to inspire you even if, like me, you're depressed.<br /><br />The second single is \\"Non ho smesso mai/Jam&aacute;s abandon&eacute;\\" - I thought, at first, It was just a ballad but this is one of those songs where you can really appreciate her wonderful voice.<br /><br />The third single will be \\"Bastava/Bastaba\\" - This is a song about two people who loved each other but they ended up hating each other. Lyrics are very good on this one and has a good rhythm. I have the feeling this song will be the biggest hit from this album<br /><br />Other songs I liked the most were:<br /><br />\\"Troppo Tempo/Hace Tiempo\\": This is a duet with a great Italian singer (Ivano Fossati) who wrote the lyrics and made the music too. One of the best songs from this album here, for me.<br /><br />\\"Celeste/As&iacute; Celeste\\": This song has an amazing rhythym and lyrics structure. It has a very powerful meaning in its chorus' It talks about Light blue skies and happiness. It seems she dedicated this song to the child she still doesn't have (Avrai gli occhi di tuo padre/Tendr&aacute;s los ojos de tu padre/You will have your father's eyes). It's just beautiful.<br /><br />\\"Nessuno sa/Qui&eacute;n lo sabr&aacute;\\": This song is a little bit of rock. Something different from most song from this CD. What I liked about this song is that it proves every song has a whole different sound and what happened with her last CD won't happen again (That all songs had a very similar sound and you couldn't recognize which song you were listening)<br /><br />\\"Ti dico ciao/Te digo Adi&oacute;s\\": This song was dedicated to a friend of her who died, very moving lyrics.<br /><br />\\"Mi Tengo/Me quedo\\": I ended my review with this song because when I first head this song I thought it was just Good but then I listened to it 3 or 4 times more and I have to admit that, for me, this is the best song from this album and one of the best songs ever of Laura Pausini. This song has an unusual structure among her songs because it does not have what we could call a chorus and what we could consider the \\"chorus\\" has a complete different rhythm than the rest of the song. It kind of talks about a relationship break-up but in a whole different way where she just let her hate go away (Mi tengo la tua rabbia .. se ti pare. La mia, ti giuro, l'ho lasciata andare!/I keep your anger if you're OK with it, I swear you I left mine go away) and the last 2 sentences of the Spanish version is just poetry (Si hemos sido parte de un error, a veces fuimos tambi&eacute;n algo mejor/If we have been part of a mistake, Sometimes we were also something better)<br /><br />In all, a great album. I'm so glad I was able to learn Italian because of her amazing music.<br /><br />Highly recommendedsong you were listening)  \\"Ti dico ciao/Te digo Adiós\\": This song was dedicated to a friend of her who died, very moving lyrics.  \\"Mi Tengo/Me quedo\\": I ended my review with this song because when I first head this song I thought it was just Good but then I listened to it 3 or 4 times more and I have to admit that, for me, this is the best song from this album and one of the best songs ever of Laura Pausini.

0765348276|5.0|I liked this book much better than Heinlein's \\"Starship Troopers\\" & that's coming from someone whose absolute all time favorite author is Robert A. Heinlein.<br /><br />Scalzi presents a much more vivid picture of the Starship Trooper without infringing on the masters work.<br />The action is better & the overall concept is better.<br /><br />Did I mention the fact that the guy can write too?<br />No typos - amazing for a Kindle book.<br /><br />I will definitely be reading the other books in the series!

B005K8QIS0|4.0|Love this quirky mystery series. Jason Isaacs is very good as Jackson Brodie. It's his performance and the soundtrack that made me want to buy the dvd. My only complaint is that they haven't included the same soundtrack on the dvd that was played in the original on Masterpiece Mystery. And what they substituted in place of those great artists and sad songs that Brodie listens too is horrible!
1439133948|4.0|Given the mixed reviews, I started this prepared to be disappointed, despite loving the series.  Admittedly, the first 1/3 or so was a bit slow, and lacked the pageant of likeable characters typical of the best books in the series.  But it picked up soon enough, and by mid book was the typical hard-to-put-down Vorkosigan tale.  And the ending (no spoilers here) is thought provoking and implies yet another major transition in Miles' life.  Looking forward to seeing where it leads in the next installment!
0679746048|4.0|In this provocative true story, Kaysen tells of her experience as an eighteen-year-old patient in a psychiatric hospital in the late 1960s. Four months after running away from her Princeton, NJ, home, Kaysen committed herself to McLean Hospital, a psychiatric hospital in an affluent suburb of Boston where many famous poets and musicians have been treated. There she was diagnosed as having a borderline personality, which is, as she describes as an adult, \\"a way station between neurosis and psychosis: a fractured but not disassembled psyche.\\" The doctor who referred Kaysen to McLean described her as profoundly depressed and leading an increasingly patternless life. Recent activities in her life had included: a relationship with her high school English teacher; attempted suicide; running away from her parent's home to live in a boarding house in Cambridge, MA; and taking up with a boyfriend she describes as troublesome.<br /><br />The doctor, who Kaysen met only once, told her she would be at McLean for a few weeks, but she spent close to two years there. During that time she developed close friendships with several of the other teenaged patients who had a wide range of problems including drug addiction, eating disorders, and a history of sexual abuse. The friendships they formed resemble the close ties that many teenage girls have with each other. You could forget for a few minutes that they were not in the dorm room of a prep school or college as they leisurely passed the time watching television and talking about boyfriends. But these girls were in a very different place with a complete lack of privacy. They were not allowed to leave the ward, open a window, or even shave their legs without supervision. It became apparent throughout the book, though, that many patients in the ward did not want to leave the safety of the hospital.<br /><br />Although the subject of the book is intense, Kaysen's sincerity and humor soften the tragedy of the situation. At other times,however, this same sincerity and humor seem to amplify the heartbreaking situation of Kaysen's interrupted girlhood. Her deep intelligent reflections of her experiences at McLean and the way they so dramatically differ from what her records indicate make the book difficult to put down.<br /><br />The book arrived on time, but was in HORRIBLE condition (It looked like someone dropped it in a puddle or something) though it was listed as being in good condition.
B0063IH60K|5.0|The best game programmers on the market for all your portable formats.  I always look for their games first and I've never been disappointed.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|This is a wonderful Bluray pack with 3 disc's. It goes deep inside Avatar world's with lot of special features, such as making of and deleted scenes! James Cameron made his own word in this movie change the way to make movies, making 3D something realy closer to us! Must buy and see of course
B0000029J5|5.0|This is a must have!  One of Keb Mo's best ever!  Great music! Even if you don't like the Blues....you'll love this CD!

0345529057|4.0|the 4 book boxed set they all fell apart while I was reading them.   An excellent series, poor quality books.
B0068AWQQ2|5.0|I will admit that when I first heard Fright Night was getting remade, I frowned and said \\"Well here goes another remake that will likely ruin a classic's name.\\" Fortunately, that was not the case here, I was amazed at how well this was made. Don't expect the same semi-erotic atmosphere as the original. However, do expect a great film that adds a new flavor to the story, one of the biggest changes was to Peter Vincent no longer being the old aged, late night tv host and is instead a younger and rather funny and dark Vegas magician with a past that is somewhat revealed to us.<br /><br />I encourage the fans of the original to go ahead and watch this, chances are you wont be disappointed.
B005YDLJ76|5.0|Love it!! She has taken a little something from all the greats before her including Tina Turner, The Chi-Lites and Michael Jackson... Then adds her own sass and sexy to it.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I have to say this is one of the coolest little gadgets to come along in a long time. I have a set of Beats by Dre ear buds which work great on their own but sometimes the output of the computer/mp3 player just doesn't cut it when you're trying to hear over something (like those long flights or mowing the yard for instance).<br /><br />Until now I didn't know something like this existed. I stand corrected. The amp is quite nice and provides a very nice quality boost in volume. It also has a bass boost which does infact do a pretty decent job.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Sleek design<br />- Simple interface<br />- Clear instructions<br />- Snap on clip<br />- Comes with two different sized male -> male 3.5mm speaker wires<br />- Increases volume without distortion.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Cheap paint (scuffed easily)<br />- On button is extremely easy (sometimes ends up getting turned on by accident)<br /><br />Other Thoughts:<br />Its a great buy if you're looking for that extra umph in your headphones. I Can't say it has a great lasting battery life as I haven't had a chance to test that part of it yet. I do have to say though, that it charges rather quickly.<br />Should you buy it: Yes, for 20$ this is something worth owning if you love listening to music. Not to mention its very handy on plane rides to drown out the guy snoring next to you.
0307891372|5.0|This book is very good and a lot of help, but it takes a little while to figure out how some of the stuff is put in the book.
0374275637|4.0|I am one who loves books, be it to read or have around. I often read several books at once, rarely finishing them all. You see I leave the finish line for the best ones! Not only am I ONLY READING THIS book, I know it is one I shall finish! Great insight and amazingly accurate detail. Guess it doesnt hurt it also re-enforces many traits I have acknowledged both in self and others.  Moreover it teaches me new methods of observation and adaptation, not to mention change!!! I and the world are much better with this book in it. Thanks DAN-O U da mane!!! ;op
B0015DROBO|1.0|It is of my opinion that the basic premise of this book is that a  world weary and jaded freelance detective/hitwoman sets outs to live her life whilst being a ward of state.  Her preferred abscence of social skills and self-derision leads you to believe that she's had a traumatic upbringing.  Her misfortune continues as her assigned caretaker falls ill and she is left in the mercy of a state caseworker. She is subsequently physically and abused by this caseworker, when she requested funds to continue supporting herself. Eventually, she retaliated in a fashion that is as repulsive, if not more so than what she had to endure.<br /><br />Amongst the trials the lead character is experiencing, a backstory is woven in about a guy who at some is hired to locate a missing person from a well to do family.  A family in which contains former Nazi soldiers (okay....). Now because of the leads' infamous skills, she is later brought in as his assistant. They discuss tactics, find clues, and then sleep together, riiiggghhht???  I fail to see how that tied into the story, not that it was unexpected, just unfitting for the storyline. Anyway, after saving the guy from a near death (by murder), the lead falls in lust with him. But at the end, she finds the guy in an amorous situation with his true lady lust (who is an adulterer by the way).<br /><br />Now, there are many things I opted not to mention; suffice it to say that the author threw in one to many things that lead you away from the true premise of this story. What made it worse is that they turned it into a movie. I do not discourage the purchase of this book, but I won't recommend it either.
B000067QMD|5.0|They serve their purpose. I pump directly to my PES wide neck, and I am able to store them in the ref if I will feed them to my baby that day. I can also use this to pump/store when I am out at work.
B006O5Y75Y|4.0|Let the Apes Rise... You, sit back and enjoy this one. While it's not exactly a classic, \\"Rise Of The Planet of the Apes\\" is a solid choice for movie night.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I had this game on another device and had to have it on my new one.  It is addicting and worth the money.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Does a great job of explaining the reasons behind the financial mess we're in (and I mean the globe).  Also explains how some have fought back, bringing lawsuits against those behind it.  Highly recommended.
B000ASATZ8|4.0|I've always had prompt service from Movie Mars, however, this is the first time I've received DVDs that had no identifying markings on the DVDs themselves. If I don't mark them it there will be no way to know, visually, what was on the DVDs.  Looking at them the way they are, these very easily look like could have been made in someone's home.
B004SBX112|5.0|My wife and I are playing this on Kindle Fires.<br /><br />While enjoyable, neither of us like this as well as the others (though my wife hasn't played Rio as of this review). I like that you can play from each of the seasons without having to work through all of the puzzles in order, but I guess we don't yet have the knack for this group of puzzles.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|i was expecting something damaged, o maybe blended; but i was well surprised by it's like new state. I'm happy to have bought it.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|My wife and I are playing this on Kindle Fires.<br /><br />Great fun for those of us of an age the doesn't interact well with games requiring fast reflexes. One of the advantages is that it is easy to play for a few minutes at a time.<br /><br />(My wife doesn't know that she is many, many levels ahead of me. I won't use the word \\"better\\" - at least not quite yet.)
B003INBNXO|5.0|This movie is good and amazingly theatrical. If you dont believe me just try it out and send it back or just ask one of your friends who saw it. The movie is great with all the action and how friendship,honor and the fight for your country really matters. Its not the style you use it how you fight
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I am playing this on a Kindle Fire.<br /><br />We have all three of the Angry Bird apps for the Fire. This is my favorite, but the only reason I can come up with is that I've been luckier at the levels I've played. It has nothing to do with my wife being better than I am at the other two and she hasn't played this one yet.<br /><br />Great for us old timers who can't handle the super fast games.
0380715430|5.0|I read this book about 20 years ago, about the time it first came out and again a week ago.  The same witty style and evidence of decent research greeted me one more time.  Lots of good history of the world's favorite language here in and don't miss the section on Spoonerisms and how they got started.  Dr. Knockemus

B004DLPXAO|5.0|I wanted to buy books off of Amazon and this app is that gateway. It works great on my device. Love the tools available like the dictionary and highlighting.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Great sequel to the original quell game.  These are the only 2 games I have actually paid for.  I've been waiting for this game for months,  can't wait for the next one.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|We purchased this for our 11 year old daughter and she absolutely loves it. Her brother, who is 9, is often taking turns. It is complex and hasn't been put down much since being received. After viewing the regular Perplexus, the Epic version seems more complicated and long-lasting. It will keep my two children active for quite some time. Neat product that I find fun as well.
0307949486|3.0|The pace picks up after the first 50 pages or so and then moves pretty quickly. Despite what I have heard some assume, the novel does not center around the narration of Salandar; the story  bounces back and forth between Blomkvist and Salandar's frame of reference pretty evenly. One could actually make a good argument that Blomkvist is the protagonist. Both characters are interesting enough to keep you engaged, and Salandar, especially, has some finer moments. Salandar comes from a difficult background and her life is in shambles, though her experiences have also given her an edginess and intelligence that makes anyone who crosses her regret it.<br /><br />It is a book thats selling point is the plot more than the characters. If you like suspense and a good mystery, it's worth checking out.<br /><br />As a caveat, there is more than one fairly graphic account of assault (physical and sexual) in the novel.
B005HSL626|5.0|this is a really great app. there is a lot of stuff to do. it is also free. I would tell u to get this app.
B005QUQP76|5.0|I've had six copies of the same mouse, [[ASIN:B000FEHVWG Creative Fatal1ty 2020 Laser Gaming Mouse ( 7300000000422 )]] since 2004 which attributed to my clawish fingertip grip of 3 fingers flat up top, wrist off the table, claw thumb and relaxed pinkie. Unfortunately the 2020 had a lot of issues with the switches and the LMB would go out after a couple of months of CS:S. I was on my last copy and got this mouse as a gift.    Even though it broke frequently, I've always been happy with my previous mouse. They just don't make it nowadays and I felt that needed a little higher DPI for running 5760x1080.   I like peripherals a lot and I've purchased too many other mice designs from Logitech, Razer, Microsoft, and most recently the [[ASIN:B003CP0BHW Cyborg Gaming Mouse for PC]]. Nothing fit right or their tracking was off or the buttons were too far forward. Until now, the old 2020 mouse just kept winning me over all other products.   Regardless of how many adjustments the Cyborg mouse had it did not have the odd grip that I was looking for. This mouse has no special moving parts. Nothing to worry about or lose other than the weights.   Physical properties and tracking are the two main things I look for in a mouse.   The Corsair M60 has about the same shape as my previous mouse, less the third mouse button on the right and the palm being a little farther back. It's still about the angle in how I hold the mouse. There is just enough comfortable space for my right ring finger to sit in the far right groove without impeding my right click.   Speaking of which, I'm very pleased about the definite and easy mouse clicks from high up on the mouse with solid but little effort. Middle mouse button is a little stiffer than LMB and RMB and it's wheel movement feels intentional.   The laser is great and tracks my arm and wrist physics precisely with zero travelling. It moves precisely where I want it to. 1 inch on my plain white tile turns my character the same every time I move across it. It doesn't get any better. I've experienced zero skips and lag. The cabling and plug are sturdy. The weights are can be adjusted very easily, however I wish there were more places to place them.   The sniper button is too far forward for my style and I've opted to use the back button (MOUSE4) as my fast weapon switch. It clicks very fast with a quick thumb swipe up. I do not use the sniper button's functionality to slow down dpi. I did not have any driver issues with this feature.   The software seems OK, nothing too great or too bad about it. Your standard features as in DPI setting, independent XY, polling rate, lift height and command assignment. The only thing I wish this software had was the ability to change the mouse angle... but that's 1% of what I look for in a mouse. The surface quality indicator is a nice touch.   This mouse feels very solid and the switches feel durable. I'd buy six of these in a heartbeat, but I doubt that I will need to.   Win 7 64 bit. Downloaded 12/22/11 drivers. Not a single hiccup and plays very well. Seemed just as good without the drivers/software.
B006NXIO0Q|1.0|Had I known this film was a Luc Besson production, I would never have rented it.  Besson's motto seems to be, \\"Who cares that it makes no sense?  Just throw in a lot of dumb action, some bad guys, a girl with big weapons and be done with it. Where's my check?\\"  The plot is absolutely absurd.  The characters are, if such a thing is possible, less than one dimensional.  The directing is beyond lazy.  The action sequences are boring.  And Zoe Saldana has all the charisma of a pool noodle.    The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it makes Dolph Lundgren's films look like classic cinema.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I really never write reviews but this got so many negative comments I almost didn't buy it. I think it is perfect. No problems at all. Fits like a glove and adds little bulk. Good hard back and soft inside and tough exteriorfor the front. If that is what you are looking for, you won't be disappointed! Seems very well made, might not have paid 40 but for 30 it can't. Be beat.
0307269752|1.0|This film takes a great story and wastes it by making you watch excessive sex scenes. It's a porn flick with a story
B002SAS26E|5.0|This is a wonderful little game to play with your spouse or significant other. It's a simple game of trading and selling different types of goods. You trade goods in your hand until you have a good amount to sell for different valued chips. There are also camel cards which are used for trading, but do not have a money value. The game has quite a bit of depth, despite it's simplicity (this has to do especially with the decisions you make each turn, whether trading, selling or taking camels). The person with the most money at the end of the round wins; best out of three wins the game.  The game has beautiful box art. The components are top quality: beautiful, simple, good quality cards; nice cardboard chips and small, sturdy box.   This is very recommended for a quick, fun, two-player game.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I found this game to be peaceful. entertaining. and challenging. The music tends to be very repetitive but somehow does not detract from the game. You can always shut it off.
B002QEXN8E|5.0|Excellent triple disc, Manu Chao rocksssss! Super-fast shipping, excellent packaging,as always, from Amazon. There is not a minute of boredom, all of it clicks and fits like it should. Highly recommended!!!
B00417HV14|5.0|I just got this Blu-Ray disk after some trepidation about the earlier sound quality reviews and must say that it is GREAT.  As a recent reviewer has mentioned, even tho' it is only labeled as DTS, both stereo and 5.1 audio show as DTS-HDMA while decoding by my new Oppo player, and sound like this is the reason I upgraded my player.
1451627289|5.0|I've never read a Stephen King novel (he's not an author I follow), but the premise of this book was one I couldn't pass up. It's something I've wondered myself, what if someone was able to travel back in time to try to stop the Kennedy assassination? That was a huge turning point in the history of the United States...  Any short story or novel dealing with time travel has to have it's \\"rules\\" worked out beforehand. King works his out as only he can, and they're pretty interesting. If you're a fan of time travel stories, I think you'll enjoy it. It's been one of the few novels that I had a hard time putting down (and I'm not exactly an avid reader). Other than that, I'd rather not say anything more at the risk of giving anything away. This was a great book and one I'd recommend to my friends.
B0034G4P94|3.0|THIS IS A OK/GOOD MOVIE & NOT NO 5 STAR MOVIE ! THIS MOVIE IS DEFINITELY NOT NO ROCKY AS SOME HAVE COMPARED IT TO ! IT IS A GOOD MOVIE JUST NOT A GREAT MOVIE ! I WOULD RENT & WATCH IT FIRST BEFORE YOU BUY IT !
B005RAO0GS|5.0|I have never heard their music before.  This was one of the mp3 downloads on the special today so I listened to the clips and bought it.  Totally not disappointed - music, voice and lyrics are great!
B0063IH60K|5.0|i like that this game has options and plays well. if you want a free solitaire game this is a good choice.
B0042U94UQ|4.0|My son loves this movie -- and so does my husband.  One of them will start a quote from the movie, and the two of them will just take off for the next 15 minutes or so of dialogue.  Snappy wit, good message, and not all fluffy unicorn stuff, I think this movie has something for everyone.
B004GHYCKW|5.0|This recording is so much more than a pop album - it is a profound work of art about the horrors of war. In the same way Pablo Picasso painted Guerica, about the Spanish Civil War, PJ Harvey with the help of the multi-instrumentalist Mick Harvey have created an exquisite tapestry of nationalism, defeat and death. There is no moralizing here - just observation and beautiful harmonics. It is not just about war - Cruel Nature Wins Again says it all. The best recording of 2011.
B000HWY5MK|2.0|Ordered new, got used.  Book was underlined and hilighted.  The book was also sent by another company instead of BestBookDepot.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|I rarely purchase an entire cd, but this cd is so good that if you like one song, chances are you will actually like them all.  Enough said.
B004WE01YA|5.0|this was a very good classic 3d movie.a great family movie that all will enjoy.the 3d was pretty good alot better than the 3d in some other movies.
B005URRCUY|5.0|Perhaps not as roots blues rock as Brothers, but this album rocks from first song to last. They definitely went for a more classic rock feel. The songs are more catchy and definitely feel like they tilted to a more main stream sound. Thats not a bad thing though when the musical minds of Patrick and Dan are driving the bus.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Like the title says, this free version of spider is great, and I haven't been bothered at all by the ads. Definitely worthy of adding to your device to pass the time. Works great on my kindle fire!

B0063IH60K|5.0|It is easy to navigate and fun to play. I have not had any problems. I also have other great apps from MobilityWare.
0440244412|4.0|I want to give this last book 3 1/2 stars, but I can't. This series will be in my top books and I believe no other author will be able to top this series. I love Karen Marie Monings writing. I'm HAPPY!! I started reading this series when all the books were done. I can't imagine waiting all those years for this sort of ending. I feel UNSATISFIED. The reason is....I feel there is still a lot of questions unanswered. I still don't know what Barrons is and why he is the way he is. I wish Karen Marie Moning would of made Mac the child of the Unsealie King and his Concubine. I'm still a bit lost on what Mac really is. I loved the character V'lane and was disapointed with his character at the end.  I agree with some people, the book could of been really good. For some reason I kind of wanted Barrons to be the King and her to be his Concubine. There was so much that could of been done for a more satisfied ending. No matter what, I will always buy and read a Karen Marie Moning book, she is a gifted story teller.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Fantastic series!!! I couldn't put this book down, read the first book in one day and couldn't wait to read the following two! I would highly recommend this series.
B005I6EU7U|4.0|Selected this one from several brands available, glad I did. Fits perfectly (very tight to install, but is NOT coming loose!), with non-slip coated corner elastic straps. Very secure once installed. Nicely stitched fake leather material (feels and looks like expensive glove leather) with black flocked inside lining and a single storage pocked inside the front cover. A nice bonus is that a Roocase stylus, which I like a lot for the KF, clips in perfectly and securely inside the edge binding, without touching the Fire in either the open or closed position. Makes for handy and secure storage of the stylus. As I said, it fits super-tight, but once it's installed, you can forget the Kindle popping out of there, probably even if you dropped the whole thing. Nice protection. But if you have a need to constantly install and remove the Kindle, this is not the one you want. If like me you put your Kindle Fire in and leave it there most (or all) of the time, it's a great choice. Stitching is very clean and neat, and the overall construction shows good quality.<br /><br />This is not a cheap cover, so I think to get five stars it would have to be made of real leather for this price instead of fake (but admittedly nice feeling and looking) vinyl. The handsome stamped-in embossing is fine, but they could dump the cheesy gold leaf trim, which will flake/wear off quickly anyway. Either that or keep the whole cover it as is and drop the price by a third or so!<br /><br />All in all, I'm very happy with this cover. It's very sturdy, the Kindle Fire fits in it tightly and securely and is NOT going to fall out no matter what. It looks nice, feels nice and \\"grippy\\" in the hand for secure carry, and provides a neat and unobtrusive place to store a stylus.
0439023513|3.0|As in the other books there were some interesting moments here.  But the author seemed to cover less original ground.  There were some seemingly-forced analogues to life in the arena; Katniss continues to vacillate between her loves, making an abrupt and perhaps too-little-explained decision at the end; her relationship with her sister and mother is badly underdeveloped, considering how much she's supposed to love them both.  Katniss also makes an inexplicable, cruel decision at the end of the book that leaves the reader nonplussed.  Overall, not too compelling a read.
B006O5XYWG|1.0|I thought that a $2 48-hour rental sounded like a good deal.  After all, I've purchased television episodes and movie rentals from Amazon for years now.  Now, of course, I see why it was so cheap: the quality of this movie is terrible.  That is, the way Amazon has compressed this movie makes it difficult to watch.  The image has thick letterboxing as well as pillarboxing.  Horizontal lines and busy backgrounds flicker and pulse.  And while I can't be certain, it looks like the number of frames per second has been reduced, resulting in a headache-inducing flicker across the whole screen.  I can't believe it, but I think this one experience may turn me off from risking Amazon content forever.
0439023491|3.0|There were some nice moments in the book, and overall it was a fun read, but it doesn't seem like a necessary continuation of the first book.  The protagonist focuses a lot on her confusion in choosing between two boys.  The action scenes are fun but not quite as hard-hitting as the first book.
B005HP2J66|4.0|The subject matter is the quite recent (1994) discovery of a long sealed cave in France with astonishing wall paintings untouched for 30,000 years. Due to Herzog's prestige as a doc film maker, he was allowed into this closely protected site. The cave paintings are amazing, and what we learn about human culture in those days, fascinating. One of the painters has a bent finger and his individual handprints can be identified on many separate drawings, allowing us to reach across the ages to a specific person living in a time when giant cave bears and rhinos, wolves and bison roamed central Europe. However, due to the limitations on filming, there is really not enough material here for a 90 minute movie; it was filled out (and screened in 3D) in order to market to movie theatres. As a result the same paintings are shown over and over. There are some interesting interviews with the key scientists at the site. But would have worked better as a 1 hour Nova or Discovery Channel or National Geographic special than a feature film. I appreciate Herzog's making such a film, which brings the Chauvet cave findings to a broader public, as he did earlier with Antarctica, etc. However, I find Herzog's voiceovers, speculations and the melodramatic music score just a bit unnecessary and distracting.<br /><br />Highly recommended for the cave paintings which speak to us across 30,000 years of humankind as if it were just yesterday.
0393338398|5.0|I'm not at all a baseball fan, and I loved this book.  In addition to being a true life underdog story, it shows how an underfunded team (the Yankees had three TIMES the budget of the As) achieved extraordinary success.  The strategy the As employed to purchase players was truly a revolution in the way the game was played, and general manager Billy Bean used psychology, negotiation, and a powerful understanding of statistics to make draft picks and trades that turned his team into a powerhouse.<br /><br />If you're interested in psychology, business, or how to stick it to the rich guys, you'll like this book.

B0055SWM08|5.0|The game is simple in concept, and beautifully done. Gorgeous graphics, zen-like sound track, and challenging gameplay have made this one of my favorite diversions - at work, at home, or while traveling.<br /><br />In my experience, the developer pays attention to feedback. Some minor (but annoying) graphics issues appeared when playing on the Kindle Fire. The developer responded immediately to my comments on their Facebook page, and again when I commented on the fix.  Look/feel, gameplay, and developer make this one a 10-star app. Too bad I can't rate it higher than 5.
B002XTBE6K|3.0|This is not one of the strongest versions of Emma I have ever seen.  Still, it is good.  There are other versions that I have enjoyed more.  One would not go wrong getting this version because it is enjoyable enough.  It is just lacking the substance other actresses have brought to the character of Emma.
B006C45MRE|2.0|Talky and slow without being interesting, funny, insightful or anything other than conventional and completely unsurprising. Ironic for a western/space alien mashup movie. Why is it sooooo boooring? Jon Favreau I'm so disappointed in you. I'm only giving it 2 stars rather than 1 because the actors are good.
B005FMZX9Q|2.0|Tastes vary, of course, (I've always thought the world would be rather dull if they didn't) but I'm going to have to come right out and say that this isn't the watch for me, nor is it one I would give as a gift.<br /><br />Why?<br />- The white hands over the white background make it rather difficult to read. For many people, a quick glance isn't going to be sufficient with this one.<br />- Difficulty in reading is exacerbated by the fact that the face is quite cluttered.<br />- Luminescence is dim and only lasts about 1/2 hour.<br />- Watch band has a strong plastic-y odor that has only dissipated slightly in the several days since I took it out of the box and placed it in an open room where there would be a lot of air circulation.<br />- Watch is huge. With the casing, the watch is more than 1.75 inches in diameter and nearly .5 inches deep. I can only imagine this scale looking good on a man or woman with a fairly large frame. On my wrist, it simply looked clunky which cheapened the overall appearance of the piece.<br /><br />Invicta may well make a quality product, but my disappointment with the size and appearance of this watch won't give me the chance to find that out for myself.<br /><br />Note: Stems on this watch are on the left hand side, making this watch one that would traditionally be marketed to left-handed people.
B004927I50|5.0|I won the Speak Now cd in a contest I entered. I wasn't really a Taylor Swift fan. I do no have any of her other cds but I did like some of her other songs. When I first listened to this cd I only found about 4 songs that I liked. I found the other ones too long. There are some songs in this cd that are like 6 minutes long. I've had this cd for almost a year no and I can truly say that I love this cd. After listening to the songs many times I started to like more of them. My favorites are sparks fly, mean, the story of us, better than revenge. But I actually like them all except Dear John and Last kiss=to boring and long. The rest of the songs are fabulous proving that Taylor Swift has writing skills. Thanks to this d I started to like Taylor Swift. Overall I love this cd even though I think some songs should be shorter.  I recommend this to all her fans and people who aren't.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|It is written for young adults or teens but as an adult that has read books my entire life of different genres, I Do NOT know what the hype is about! It was mediocre, and the same phrases are repeated throughout the book.   I could not finish the second book. But, I have a 38 year old girlfriend that likes this genre of books and likes this series, so I don't know what to say.
B005V4FJC4|1.0|We have an ugliest Christmas sweater party each year - it's become a timeless classic, and is good for a few laughs. This CD is neither. Well, except for the 'ugliest' part. Thank goodness I downloaded it on the cheap. I'm up for just about anyone signing anything Christmas. I have country, Melissa Etheridge, Celine Dion, Susan Boyle, Josh Groban, Trans-Siberian Orchestra, Anne Cochran, Celtic Woman, The Canadian Tenors, Martina McBride, even The Carpenters, and lots of compilations - all of which I recommend long before this. Lifeless & boring.

B005WMADYE|4.0|`Redline' is a rare film in today's Japanese animation film industry because it is wholly hand drawn (rather than CG) and the stunning visuals on screen justify this audacious decision.<br /><br />Redline is a racing tournament where anything goes as long as you reach the finishing line.  JP is one of the drivers who guides his classic Trans-Am through the pitfalls of the course and tries to avoid the guided weapons coming his way.  Sonoshee is another driver who JP is in love with and they both try to survive the onslaught coming from the leaders of Roboworld, where the final race is to take place.  With corrupt gambling and ruthless opponents the race (and film) is set up for thrills and spills.<br /><br />The animation is very impressive, although not as soft as the Ghibli films I particularly enjoy and this is an animation aimed squarely at an adult audience.  The racing scenes are particularly well animated and once you realise this is hand drawn the backgrounds and small details stand out all the more.<br /><br />There is also a `making of' documentary on the disc which sheds some light in the creative process.<br /><br />I have many, many Japanese anime films in my film collection and this is a worthy addition to that collection.  The attention to detail is staggering, the animation is very impressive, the story is pretty decent and the sound effects and dubbing are good as well.  All in all if you are a fan of Japanese animation then this is well worth a look, it may be grittier than some films you may have already seen, but it is just as accomplished and well produced.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This micro-shell case fits perfectly, provides a good amount of protection for your Kindle Fire, looks good, and provides a nice landscape stand.  They aren't kidding about the \\"lightweight\\" in the product name either. This cover adds minimal weight and bulk to your Kindle while giving you reasonable protection of the screen and quite adequate protection for the body of your device. I'm not willing to \\"test\\" the cover's ability to absorb the shock of falling onto concrete mind you, but it does wonderfully well at protecting the Kindle from the bumps and bruises of normal daily use (plus the packing for transport in my wife's somewhat cluttered handbag).  We much prefer the \\"snap on\\" style of this folio to the \\"corner tab\\" style we've seen in some other folios. This folio surrounds your Kindle with a bumper shell while cleverly providing cutout openings for the connectors and speakers. The thin cover is not padded but has a stiff inner membrane that should provide protection from accidental piercing while the soft material on the inside of the cover protects the screen surface from scuffs and abrasions (especially when knocking around inside a purse or backpack!).

B002BU0DPE|2.0|After two months from being used regularly the right headphone no longer worked due to poor wiring near the control's. Most of my friends told me after I got it that the right headphone broke for all of them. Would not recommend buying this due to unreliability of product life in a short time frame.<br /><br />Update: After 7 months from product purchase both headphones no longer work. There is wire crossing in the control module and this causes unavoidable echos while in chat if you are using the microphone from the headset. Finally if you have a slightly larger than average sized head it never breaks in. It will always hurt your ears after extended periods of use because of the pressure. I had a better experience with a generic $20 Logitech headset. Only thing I can give this a positive on is sound quality when it worked, but what good is that with poor production quality.
B00005614M|5.0|I bought this album after hearing about it from a Miles Davis-Tribute band.  Stunning musicality by Miles, Gerry Mulligan, and others in the group.  I am relatively new to jazz, and I do have other Miles Davis CD's, but this one immediately became one of my favorite CD's (Any genre). Highly recommended.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun game, ads are a little annoying...but for a free download I am very pleased with it!  Definately worth downloading!

B004SUWR2C|2.0|the game has good graphics but totally frustrating gameplay. it selects the wrong card, has a totally non intuitive gesture for browsing the cards in a hand, and locks up and freezes at times causing additional unintended gesture input.  wish I hadn't paid for it.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I am rather clumsy I guess you could say because I broke the plastic on the stock intel fan that shipped with my i7-2500.  Using Amazon I found this item read the reviews and figured this is exactly what I should use anyway.  I ended up buying it at a local retail chain and paid $38.  Mostly because I wanted to fix the problem that day and not wait for shipping.  Otherwise I would of bought off Amazon and waited a few days for the shipping.  Don't let the item and instructions confuse you, its very simple to install, epsecially if you watch a few different youtube videos and read the directions.  Do a dry-run mock install too, then put the grease on the fan, this will help from creating a mess if you find out you need to reverse the cross bars (as I did) before attaching.  Take your time and this think will dramatically serve its purpose of keeping the cpu very cool.  Also its very quiet!
B0063IH60K|4.0|the game loaded great and plays with no problems.  An add comes up before each game but is no distraction. plenty of free backgrounds and other options. it is a good game.
B003Y5H5C4|1.0|Eighty three minutes of expletives shouted by miserable creeps portrayed by talented actors haphazardly guided by a talented director. Another crappy movie about bank robbers that took 40+ million dollars from its audience.

0385737955|4.0|I finally read this book, after we put all three out on our shelves.  I like to read the YA series, that way I can find a good fit for my teenage readers.  (There are fewer and fewer these days!)  Despite the overwhelming amount of negative reviews, I actually liked this book.  Hunger Games good?  No, but the plot was fun.  The characters, in my opinion, were not over done and likable.  Yes, the Grievers were lame.  Yes, you wonder why these dang kids didn't realize 2 years ago about the maze.  Poor character development?  Yes, but HELLO!  YA book.  I've read far worse.  As far as the slang... I found it awesome.  Much better than the toilet language that you can now find in the latest PC Cast books.    The ending I thought was great, not what I was expecting.  Overall, it took me 4 hours to read and I don't regret reading it.
B00689ILQC|1.0|Not good songs, terrible presentation. Hate it. She's gone downhill since 'Good Girl Gone Bad' = Hopefully she makes a new album later on which has better songs.
B005V4X8JA|5.0|I can't really add too much to the other reviewers so far who have expressed the well-done nature of this reissue.  It is 5 stars and worth a buy.  I compared this 2011 reissue to 2 other CD versions I own, the 1994 reissue and the 2006 Rhino reissue and this AF disc comes out on top in all regards.  The sonics, the separation and the clarity of the music on this landmark album are finally heard in full glory on this CD.  Thank you Steve Hoffman and Audio Fidelity for finally getting this album done right.  Now if you could only get Deja Vu in the pipeline for remastering I would be happy.
B0067D7Y3U|5.0|I thought nothing could be the debut but I was wrong when Leave This Town came out, when I heard that Daughtry were releasing a new album, I thought the same again, Nothing could beat Leave This Town but I was wrong. Break the Spell has so many amazing songs, each song could be #1, buy the album, It is amazing. If you like Top 40 radio friendly songs...then Buy this album, you will not be disappointed.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|very well put together. The game could have been made a little bit more easier and fun. but all around a good game.

0316056863|5.0|Buy this book you won't be disappointed. I was laughing so hard through out the whole book. Tina Fey tells her story from childhood to becoming the first female writer of Saturday Night Live. I couldn't put this book down and I even bought a second book to give to my aunt as a gift. Not to give too much away; there is a hilarious letter penned to her daughter in the book !!
B005G4YEF2|5.0|After listening to Sutherland in this her second complete commercially recorded Lucia di Lammermoor, one simply can't imagine the title role being sung any better... but she actually in some ways did vocalize it better in her earlier efforts... However, there are trade-offs.  The earlier versions give us the voice pure, fresh, and bright in the first blossom of youth.  The coloratura is pristine and one is constantly impressed by the power of her vocalism.  By the time of her second effort the voice was more luxurious, and aptly more sensuous... this is not only a more \\"interesting\\" sounding voice, but also the voice of a more womanly Lucia... The sound is larger, fuller, and consequently rather more satisfying in the long run.  I heard Sutherland in this role in 1970 and this is the voice that I recall hearing in the theatre where her rich lower tones impressed almost as much as the stratospheric high notes.<br /><br />Regarding the supporting players, Pavarotti, Milnes, Ghiaurov and even Torrengeau in the small role of Alisa comprise a luminous cast with all being captured near the peak of their considerable careers.  Milnes has a nice snarl to his clarion baritone that enhances his characterization while Ghiaurov, in contrast, has a voice that personifies a rich, buttery, dark, yet flexible basso cantante.  Regarding the young Pavarotti, my only quibble concerns the fact that he tends to approach things in a rather nonchalant manner... but then again he is Pavarotti and his prodigious vocal resources speak for much.<br /><br />Now this brings us to the conducting.  Richard Bonynge was not really anyone's favorite conductor, but for the most part he conducts sensibly and while he captures the more passionate aspects of the score quite nicely (the Act I Duet and the Sextet) and often finds an appealing balletic lilt to some of the cabalettas (especially that of the Mad Scene), there are times where he selects tempi that are simply a trifle too fast for the music to be lovingly embraced. This of course adds brilliance to some scenes, but something is lost in the process as well.  Furthermore at the conclusion of several numbers (the Tower Scene and the Mad Scene) he has a tendency to drive the music too forcefully in an attempt to stir up excitement... excitement that is already written into the music.<br /><br />As for the version of the score employed, this edition is virtually complete save for the omission of the quiet flute solo that concludes the first section of the Mad Scene where a more traditional ending is employed after the cadenza.  Furthermore, the duet that opens the second act is performed a tone higher as in Donizetti's autograph score.  For the record, Lucia's opening aria and the Mad Scene are performed in the traditional keys rather than the higher keys of the original.  In addition, the flute is used in the Mad Scene as opposed to the current trend of substituting the glass harmonica that Donizetti initially intended to use, but ultimately rejected. Also, as if one needed to mention it, Sutherland performs her own extended flute accompanied cadenza in this scene... again a tradition that is slowly falling by the wayside.<br /><br />A word about the sound, as the 96/24 remastering is a significant improvement over the initial CD release.  All the voices, not to mention the orchestral contributions, sound much smoother and more natural as opposed to the artificially bright and strident sound of the initial CD incarnation. Actually the sound is in line with my recollection of the original LP's and during that era Decca was noted for the sonic primacy of its operatic recordings.<br /><br />In summation, in purely vocal terms the Sutherland/Bonynge Lucia is probably the best overall recording of Donizetti's masterpiece and while not absolutely perfect it comes tantalizingly close.  I would supplement it with one of the versions by the other supreme Lucia of the last century... Maria Callas.  I have a preferencefor Callas' 1959 stereo recording because of her many vocal nuances, her theatrical insights, and in spite of the fact that it was recorded a bit past her prime.  However, all Callas' recordings are severely cut, which precludes them from being an absolute first choice regardless of her prodigious vocal and dramatic abilities.  As a further supplement I would also consider the urtex based recording by Charles Mackerras simply for the fact that it presents Donizetti's score performed as originally conceived using period instruments, with all the numbers in their original keys, and  embellishments that supposedly derive from Donizetti's time.  Of course that means no extended cadenza in the Mad Scene, but again that was an addition from another era.  Furthermore the cast is reasonably competent, the conducting is more classically oriented, and one will hear certain details of orchestration that differ from the traditional score as well as some interesting vocal modifications.of her many vocal nuances, her theatrical insights, and in spite of the fact that it was recorded a bit past her prime.

0060873027|3.0|When you start reading this novel you can tell the premise came from the mind of Michael Crichton. You can also tell it is a work he did not complete. It is basically a rough draft without the character development I find in his completed work. The storyline has promise but it is not fulfilled. The identification of the \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" characters was too easy. The events were too contrived to bring the usual feelings I get reading his work. Crichton had the ability to make the complicated things simple and peak my interest in his subject. But being a fan of Crichton the results were pretty much what I expected with having another person complete his work. If you want a good read for a plane ride or sitting on the beach read this book. Otherwise save your money.

B006O5XYWG|4.0|Excellent CGI and a plot that makes reasonable sense help boost this reboot of the Planet of the Apes franchise to 4 stars. I hope there will be more made by the same creative team and with the same quality and attention to detail. The setup for future movies was very subtle. Bravo to the director for not forcing a bunch of inside jokes and goofy nods to the original (\\"get your paws off me\\" being the sole exception, which was actually worthy of inclusion), which allows this film to stand by itself. You need not ever have seen the originals to enjoy and understand this movie; and if you're a fan of the first PotA you can find a lot to like here.
0679731725|4.0|This is one I've revisited several times and always enjoy (four stars).  On the surface, it is simply a six-day journey to visit an old colleague, but there's much more underneath.  Stevens is a career butler in England who recently \\"came with the package\\" when an American purchased the house he has tended for decades.  Stevens prides himself on his \\"dignity\\" and spends a lot of time reflecting on the quality which, for him, often involved staying focused on his professional role despite any personal matters.  He asserts pride in having continued to serve impeccably on the day his father, a butler as well, passed, but there is some clear doubt about his choices.  He also reflects on his long-time employer.  Stevens had been proud to serve a man involved in international affairs who claimed to be hosting gatherings with global implications in the time between WWI and WWII.  However, even Stevens will admit that his employer made some poor choices in his loyalties, having been a clear Nazi sympathizer prior to the second war.  Stevens admits his employer was mistaken but argues strongly against anyone who demonizes the man, asserting (to himself as much as the reader) that the man was truly a decent person who just chose a wrong allegiance.  Again, this is a book of characters more than plot, even though there IS much more plot than just the roadtrip.  The trip serves as a chance for reflection since it is a rare time off-duty and so it does have the \\"action\\" of many years within the short trip.  It is more about character though and about concepts like dignity, class, and culture.  A key question left to the reader is whether the quality of a worker should be judged in relation to the nature of the employer.  Stevens clearly hopes his life of service has been worthwhile, but worries about it in hindsight.    I consider this a key piece of twentieth century fiction and recommend it to literary folks who want to be comprehensive in their reading as well as to those who like their books to provoke thought.  It is a treatise on moral reflection in the dressing of a novel and carried off well by a wonderfully talented writer (loved his more recent Never Let Me Go, 4.5 stars, and just ordered two more of his works).
0553381695|5.0|The book arrived well in advance of its \\"due date\\" and was in the appropriately described condition. The book has obviously been used, but never abused.

B003XF1XOQ|1.0|After completing this book, I was left with a deep feeling of dissatisfaction. After reading the first two books, I had thought that this third book would live up to my excpectations. I had read the reviews before buying just to make sure, and even though they warned me not to buy it, with reasons such as poor writing, loose ends,and lack of character development, I was so compelled to read the conclusion to the trilogy because I absolutely had to know what happened.  I realize now that I should have abstained. The book never lived up to my expectations.  For one,the complete lack of character development. Characters that had seemed so rich and moving in the first two books turned into flat, dull and shapeless things. We had no idea who characters that had seemed so familiar to us in the first two books have gone. It was as if Collins had decided that it would be up to the readers to make up their own kind of description, like some kind of childish fill-in-the-blanks game. It was disgusting.  Which leads me onto another point, the completely useless deaths of characters within the book. Character deaths within books are supposed to be emotional and thought-provoking, but within this book they were just glassed over and vague. Be this because of the above point of me not knowing these characters at all, or because of Collins' completely careless and random insertion of them (almost as if she didn't care about what she was writing), I felt no emotion at all of the deaths of multiple characters.  Thirdly is the snail's pace of plot develpoment. I can't even count the number of times groaned in frustration as I read page after page after page after page of absolutely nothing happened at all. It was as if  Collins tried to be as inconsice as she possibly could to make the book last longer.   Fourth, Katniss' complete degradation as a heroine. For long periods of the book she is seen crying in a corner. Where is the headstrong, forceful and awesome heroine I had read about in the other two books? She has completely dissapeared. We are left with a hollow shell who takes no initiative, makes no descisions, and has no control over herself.  And finally, the huge amount of loose ends. What happened to Gale? The styling team? Every single one of the previous inhabitants of District 12? No mention.  For all of you who rated four or five stars and see my review as whining over the conclusion to the novel and the trilogy, I have no quarrel with you. I understand that the ending was a portrayal of the horrors of war, but I just think that Collins did such a horrible job on portrayng it.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I'm not sure if the author got tired of writing this trilogy or what, but the third in the series was not at all up to par with the first two. Perhaps the details and development of the story got cut in the editing process to keep the book to a determined number of pages, but the feeling for the reader is that the story is rushed and heart-less. Even for this trilogy the body count seemed high. I didn't feel the author's passion for the story and characters and I did in the first two. The story ends well enough, but getting through the third novel to get to that ending felt lacking in heart and excitement. Love the entire trilogy, I just wish she would have given more time and heart to the grand finale.
0982743726|1.0|I hated this book. The writing was atrocious. The main character was repulsive and extremely prejudice against everyone he met. He thought he was better than everyone else and had no morals. I couldn't even finish the book because I disliked it so much.

0316286850|5.0|This book is awesome!! For a beginner who doesn't know ANYTHING about make-up, this can be a bit confusing at first, but definitely an eye-opener and solid guide to make-up heaven:) For someone looking to do make-up artistry who knows the basics, this is DEFINITELY a must read! Kevyn shares tricks and tips and techniques that make you go \\" Wow!! I didn't know that! Wow! I didn't know that either! Wow! How clever, how come I never thought of that before! Wow! It's THAT simple? Wow, wow, wow!\\" I'm sure you get the point. The formatting is so inspiring and well put together that you just want to suck everything in like a sponge and never put the book down. Be warned though, if you love make-up, this book will make you want to go empty out Sephora just to try out all the looks, lol!! I would DEF recommend this book for anyone who loves make-up/artistry, or someone who wants to learn to love make-up. Let's put it this way, if you never experienced playing in your mom's make-up drawer as a kid, and she never taught you how to do your make-up, the FUN of it, this book is about a close as it gets to that experience. You put the book down saying \\" Make-up is SO MUCH FUN!!\\"
B0036T31YY|4.0|Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the complexity and sophistication of this movie, and generally did enjoy it....but I remain troubled by one significant plot issue. Please feel free to share your personal, thoughtful insights via \\"Comments\\" at the end of this revue.  SPOILER ALERT: This is ONLY for those who have already seen the movie.  We repeatedly see physical evidence of the large number of times that Jess has gone through the loops and cycles of her alternate reality. We see piles of bodies,  lockets, and seagulls which are all either on the \\"ghost ship\\" or out of sight behind a seawall, and thus not evident to the general public. Apparently, in this movie, at the conclusion of each \\"loop\\" all evidence that accumulated during the loop remains intact; unlike, say, Groundhog Day, where the evidence of each loop is wiped clean, allowing the protagonist to start from scratch each day with only his/her memory of events to aid them in pursuing a better path.  Here is my problem. Apparently Jess and her son are killed in a car wreck at least once for every dead seagull, and there appear to be at least 35 or 40 dead seagulls. The dead seagulls may be out of sight, but 35 or 40 identical and dramatic car wrecks involving the same two fatalities in the same spot day after day would, to put it mildly, attract attention. You cannot have it both ways. Either all physical evidence is wiped clean after each cycle, or all of it persists, including the memories of the many bystanders and 40 identical, wrecked cars and semi tractors at the police impound lot. You cannot have a pile of dead seagulls and only one wreck. You cannot have 40 wrecks without the cycles becoming public knowledge. Indeed, you would probably have a huge crowd gather each day to witness them, and Jess's private hell would become a media event.   It may be a small point, but the writer/director consciously chose a path that is visually shocking (accumulated evidence); yet they either ignored or failed to consider that this accumulated evidence opens a hole in the plot you could drive a truck through.....literally.
0446581356|3.0|This book is clear and simple to understand, but toward the end of the book, she doesn't offer many pictures or really show how to do the different styles, it's just text. It's almost like she's rushing to get to the end of the book, when you hit the bridal makeup etc sections. This book also is definitely for beginners. I feel like even if I've never read any specific make-up book in my life, but have done make-up for years, the book explains basically everything I already know. But it's a good reminder for all the foundational stuff. If you're more on the creative side, try Kevyn Aucoin's \\"Making Faces\\". It's def a book that will make you go \\"Wow, how cool! I never knew that!\\"
B006OOHYIC|5.0|a place of gamepaying peace standing apart from the sea of explosions, guns and trivialized death into which most games float. refreshing in its simplicity and beauty. similar to Quell, also by fallen tree. An investment in some sanity so lacking in the field.
B0043URV5U|5.0|All of his greatest hits on 2 CDs!  Great recording, as if you were at one of his latest concerts.
0307477479|5.0|This book kicks ass. It's original, smart, moves along at an engrossing, pleasure-giving clip. Its formal experimentation is interesting, involving, rather than offputting or Serious. Finally, a middle-ager novel that feels young, hip, and not full of regretful domestic tableaux.  The title is weird and made me not pick this book up for a while. The Goon Squad, by the way, is Time.  I'm exaggerating with the stars -- five should belong only to the likes of Marilynne Robinson's Housekeeping and a few other contemporary novels -- but, because of the general star inflation that I encounter in Amazon reviews, I'm trying to push it up to people's attention.

B003KLGKAA|4.0|Doctor who is a great show. But for some reason BOTH Amazon and Netflix fail to list the last for episodes of season 4, including the finale which explains why **spoiler alert**  Matt Smith takes over as the Doctor in season 5.<br /><br />This information is **not** a spoiler<br />after episode 15 \\"The Next Doctor\\" comes:<br /><br />16 Planet of the Dead<br />17 Waters of Mars<br />18 The End of Time Part 1<br />19 The End of Time Part 2<br /><br />All great episodes and my god, missing the 2 part finale, crazy!

B0041TM3L0|4.0|This 4-disk offering from Real Gone Jazz contains eight albums from Trane. This review is of volume two; there's also another volume of eight earlier albums from RGJ.<br /><br />The eight albums are as follows:<br /><br />Disk 1<br />1. The Cats - with Tommy Flanagan & Kenny Burrell (1959)<br />2. Africa / Brass (1961)<br /><br />Disk 2<br />1. Bags & Trane, with Milt Jackson (1961)<br />2. Giants Steps (1960)<br /><br />Disk 3<br />1 Coltrane Jazz (1961)<br />2. My Favorite Things (1961)<br /><br />Disk 4<br />1. Mating Call (Trane with Tadd Dameron) (1957)<br />2 Cattin' with Coltrane & Quinichette (1959)<br /><br />So, a lot of work from the middle years including the seminal `Giant Steps' and `My Favorite Things' when Trane was getting into his stride as a band leader and gaining a reputation as a major style innovator.<br /><br />Few artists have left such a legacy, and this collection allows you to acquire some back catalogue Trane at a knockdown price. The sound is OK, though some will question whether RGJ's claim that the material is `digitally remastered and enhanced for superior quality' was really worth the effort; to me, the claim seems like a marketing ploy.<br /><br />You have to give this package 4 stars just for value-for-money, if nothing else.
0091939526|5.0|The author of this book is brilliant. There is so much to learn here that you will reread portions of this book and gain new insights wih each reading. Weight loss, works. Training for health, works.  Gain strength, works and a lot more. Good buy, dont miss it. Amazon does everything well also.

B004TI5N38|1.0|I have been a fan of David Baldacci for many years and have read all of his books. I have always enjoyed his story lines and characters and was excited to read this book.  Unfortunately The Zero Game is one worst books I have read in a long time. It is slow, the story line is all over the place and the main characters are one dimensional. I usually can read a book in two or three days, this book took me over a month and I had to force myself to finish it.  If you are interested in reading Mr. Baldacci's books there are plenty to choose from.  This one though should be skipped.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game is really fun. I play it all the time and it helps keep me busy and it keeps my mind engaged. love this app and I highly recommend it!!
1439192812|5.0|If you look at Richard Dawkins complete oeuvre, you'll notice an author who has consistantly improved his method of delivery. The content of his books is always exceptional, but his ability to explain complex and sometimes complicated scientific laws and ideas is never better than in the Magic of Reality. Here, he spells out scientific facts in such clarity that adolescents can understand. The author himself suggests that the book is written with 10 year olds in mind. Perhaps in Britain, Europe, Canada and Australia. With the war against science in the U.S., however, (where over 40% of the population believes in a young earth) I would say it is perfect for curious teenagers who are just beginning to question all the religious garbage they have been fed for so many years. Relgion doesn't explain or teach anything to children. The truth of evolution by natural selection is so much more beautiful than any relgious myth or fairtale ever told. The same stuff that makes up the universe is in each and every one of us. What can be more magnificent than that?
B0055SWM08|4.0|vrry good gameplay so far, but the transitions between lebels and stages are too drawn out. It's in the spirit of lolo from the NES.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I wasn't a big Stephen King fan until this year.  I gave Under the Dome a try and loved it, and this story was even better.  Fast-paced but not rushed, really no dull parts, and I lost too much sleep because I couldn't put it down.  So I guess I can now call myself a Stephen King fan.
1451648537|5.0|Steve Jobs, indulged by his adoptive parents and by others from birth through life, was simply a bad man most of the time. He wasn't simply ruthless, he was calculating, dishonest, manipulative, petulant, controlling, cruel and bitter. Life handed him chamgpagne but he wanted to drink the nectar of the gods, perhaps wanting to be God himself; he was a madman -- not clinically (although perhaps he should have been diagnosed), but in the sense that his reality was distorted. But that reality distortion was his genius because he sidestepped the laws of nature. In fact, he was his own force of nature.  This book is the guts of what made him so successful by most standards. Sometimes he was wrong, most of the time he was right, but his treatment of other people was horrific.   Reading this book is like watching scorpions battle to the death or watching a cobra about to strike. You know he's going to explode or manipulate, but you don't know how venomous it's going to be or if he will prevail in his many contretemps with his peers, his employees, his enemies, and even his friends.  This book details the geekery those of us who enjoy computers and technology will love. The tiniest details of how Jobs handled his ideas, what the ideas were, how others responded to his often unreasonable demands,and ultimately, what happened to those ideas are fascinating.    Isaacson's writing is wonderful. It's crisp and clear and moves along, revealing every wart Jobs had, and they were many.    I felt sorry for Jobs after reading this: His monumental material successes didn't exorcise his demons even though he knew he would change the world and lived to see it.   Buy this book if you are prepared to read quite a bit about the techological aspects of creative computer genius. And if you are not, skip over those parts to understand the mind of a mad genius.
0316056863|3.0|I liked this book because it was funny and she also added some good life tips.  However, I don't watch SNL or 30Rock so those chapters centered around those shows were downright boring.  I think if I did watch them I wouldn't have felt that way because her chapters on her impersonations of Sara Palin were awesome - and I DID watch those (who didn't??)  This was overall a great light read.  If you watch her shows, I highly recommend it for a laugh.
B00004SCX6|5.0|This is one of the better cd's that Britney put out during her reign as Pop princess. The songs have lots of energy and are put together very well. Often having a slightly playful tone to them. This is when Britney was at her best....less over processing with her voice. Back when Britney..was Britney
B003SWNRU2|5.0|I've always liked Accept. Their lyrics on this cd are very mature and the riffs are aggressive and the singing is great for this band. While overshadowed by a band such as Priest over the years in some ways botn is actually better than Priest's last two efforts. The future looks bright for Accept. Hopefully they will release more albums like this.
B0064T6LV8|3.0|This game looks like a nice pinball game.  I didn't like the controls for the flippers.  I thought they were too small to be really useful.
B0063IH60K|1.0|this is a fun and easy game to play. minor issues -had to reload the app while traveling but no big deal. very satisified overall.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Being from Georgia, which in the 50s and 60s had a lot of the same Jim Crowe laws as Mississippi, I find this fictitious novel brings to light a lot of cultural boundaries that were set in place back then. Now, as it is a film and I didn't take it as a martyrdom, Cicely Tyson's performance was very moving and emotional for me. Having grown up with films like \\"The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman\\", \\"Sounder\\", and \\"Fried Green Tomatoes\\" I recognized her instantly. Her deliverance of Constantine will live with me for the rest of my life. Viola Davis has also given a flawless performance and I smell Oscar in her future.  Octavia Spencer's character Minny had me in tears of happiness, sadness, and disbelief. It is a beautiful story without being too graphic about all the violence caused by racism during that time period. I think it would distract from the story of perserverance that the movie was trying to tell. The lesson I got from it was: The world may be falling down around you, but you have to be brave enough to rise above it and keep on going.  \\"Miss Hilly\\" will make you mad. There are moments when sitting in the theater I found myself wanting to slap the smug look off of her face. But that just means that Bryce Dallas Howard is an excellent convincing actress and she can make an audience believe what she is portraying. Skeeter is the voice of feminism during a time in the south where women were fighting each other to be the best housewife.  See this movie just for the performances alone if nothing else. This was a cast of a lifetime and I am so happy to have a copy of this to laugh and cry to.
0395389496|5.0|The movie is so wonderful that we have shown it to hundreds of kids yearly in Spanis, complete with bells, hot chocolate, tickets etc..  I can't find the book in Spanish though!  Anybody know if it has been translated???

B001GCUO52|1.0|i wish i could have that time back! i wish i could have gave this zero stars. this is by far the worst of the franchise. not only are the effects bogus and lame, the story is completely garbage. there is no connection to the characters,plot,or story as a whole. i feel as though i knew what was gonna happen long before it did. it should have followed with the franchise and tied things together with all the previous movies. the acting was HORRIBLE! even (Bubba) the guy from forrest gump was bad.feels like  maybe this was more of a film student class project with his friends as the cast.very unlikeable movie and hard to stay focused and keep attention. i hope this is not where they leave this beloved franchise, and someone else takes the reigns and does this some justice. this installment could have killed the whole series.  so do yourselves a favor and keep your money in your pocket and if you have to waste your time,watch it at friends house, so that you arent out any money. but make sure you bring a pillow and blanket, because this will put you to sleep.  i hope i could help in your decision on this movie. feel free to follow me on twitter @blupit30

B001NEK2GE|5.0|I play Battlefield 3 quite a bit, and the keyboard mouse combination on the PC is my preferred method.  However, my left hand was getting quite fatigued after a hours of play and I started looking for something more ergo to help with that.  I discovered the G13 and it seemed like a good choice.  I was correct.  This device is configured out of the box for standard keys, so I did not have to change anything in my BF3 keyboard bindings to get going.  I did have to adjust slightly to the more compact key layout and some of the more specialized key functions, but that took just a few round of play.  I now feel like I play better using this because my fingers are not reaching as much.  My hand feels much more comfortable and I now play longer with less trouble in my hand.<br /><br />The TeamSpeak 3 integration to the G13 LCD is great.  Shows you your channel and who is currently speaking.<br /><br />The only issues I have so far:<br /><br />1) No extra keys for the function keys, which are used for seat switches in game.  I'm sure I can reprogram to take care of this.<br />2) The joystick is useless for my play.  No comfortable way to use it because it's positioned to far away and I don't see how I can combine this with the sprint and jump keys.<br /><br />Other than that, this is a great addition to my Logitech game equipment.  G110 keyboard, G35 headset, G500 mouse, and Extreme 3D Pro joystick.

B001JIFYSA|2.0|'Barely made it 34 minutes in, and I had to hit the Stop button, despite the abundance of female eye candy and perfectly played British humor.  \\"Love Actually\\" is so relentlessly cloying and emotionally manipulative that I found myself cringing and making hideous faces constantly.  The screenwriter should be taken out and summarily executed: it seems that almost EVERY SINGLE character in this film was cast and written to be as mind-numbingly sympathetic, cutesy and adorrrrable as possible...it was like watching an endless parade of lost helpless little puppies, each one wearing a sign yelping \\"Please love me! Am I not just irresistible?\\"  And on top of this schmaltz-overdose, the whole thing is simply constructed of total implausibilities, gaping plot holes, cardboard characters, and coincidence-driven plot turns.<br /><br />The only way I managed to finish watching this sugary monstrosity: about halfway through, decided to turn off the sound and use subtitles instead, which was the only way to calm my gag reflex and dampen the constant cheese eruptions.  What a waste of an excellent cast.  It almost made me wonder whether this was actually meant to be a PARODY of a schmaltzy Christmas romantic flick.<br /><br />Truly, the most horrifying and gruesome movie in recent memory.  I never knew the Brits could match Hollywood for cinematic corniness...and then some. Even Steven Spielberg would be impressed.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Excellent Time Killer :-)  Works great. No software problems. Easy on the eyes &amp; ears. Two Thumbs up to MobilityWare!

140053271X|2.0|Even though the nook can be a potentially great e-reader, the reading experience for an e-reader is most important - and that's where this falls extremely short.   The biggest obstacle comes to the usage of the dictionary. Why must I revert to my phone's dictionary app over and over because this e-reader doesn't do its job properly? What a hassle!   - In almost all e-books, it does not highlight words to look up where, on the line, there is not enough room to finish the word, adding a dash, and continuing it on the next line. Changing text to different sizes makes different words end up with this fate, so the problem is internal.   -The dictionary is limited to highlighted words. You cannot search the dictionary directly. You cannot additionally select words in the definition. So basically, in a lot of instances, you will get a definition that doesn't help - where highlighting \\"unknown word\\", such as with a suffix -ly, and getting a definition that says...having qualities of \\"unknown word\\". And you have reached a dead end.   -The dictionary is very limited in scope. There are many definitions this doesn't have that my phone's dictionary ends up being used.    I praise b&n for making nice features for this...nice graphics, memory card slot, etc....but if graphics were my main concern, I would have bought a LCD tablet. Create a strong and exquisite foundation for a great reading experience and add graphics on top, rather than adding modernity to a product at the cost of the quality of the reading experience. I would have preferred mediocre graphics but the most complete and navigational dictionary possible, rather than the present setup.
B00008438V|1.0|It says on the box that the original music is included but after watching they changed and added music.  I didn't like it and i would recommend buy the VHS version not any of the redone ones.

B005EZJ3MW|5.0|Track 1: \\"All Night Long\\"  One of my favorites. Love this song, and if you love loud, fast songs you'll love this too.  Track 2: \\"Who's That Boy\\"  Not great. I thought this song was pretty much stupid, I think you'll agree when you hear it.  Track 3: \\"Your My Only Shorty\\"  Okay. I like it, but Demi is surely capable of better. Alright song.  Track 4: \\"Together\\"  Nice. I love Jason Derulo and Demi, but this isn't anywhere near ther best. I think it's a sweet song with a great message, nut it's not very memorable. It's good though.  Track 5: \\"Lightweight\\"  Masterpeice. Absolutley beautiful. I think you will love this song. This song has Demi written all over it.  Track 6: \\"Unbroken\\"  Great. I love this track, and it is certainly Demi. It's upbeat and fun and you will like it.   Track 7: \\"Fix A Heart\\"  Wonderful. A very cute song. (And I mean that in the nicest way.) I love this song.  Track 8: \\"Hold Up\\"  Okay. Not her best work, but you will memorize the lyrics the first time you hear it. It's catchy.  Track 9: \\"Mistake\\"  Great. I love this song. It's one of my favorites, and I know you'll be singing it to yourself the first time you hear it.  Track 10: \\"Give Your Heart A Break\\"  Amazing. Love this. Hear it just once and you'll know what I mean.  Track 11: \\"Skyscraper\\"  Inspiring. This is a beautiful song, and so sweet. I love this song.  Track 12: \\"In Real Life\\"  Decent. I like this song, but it seems weird, almost like it's not Demi.   Track 13: \\"My Love Is Like A Star\\"  Lovely. I adore this song! Can't get it out of my head.   Track 14: \\"For The Love Of A Daughter\\"  Beautiful. I cried the first time I heard this. I love this song, and you will too.  Overall, amazing.  Demi is amazing, this album is amazing.
B003O86FMW|1.0|Not worth paying for. This is a poor second book in the series. Have to get 3rd book to complete story. More of a teen series than adult story.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|Better than the second book but disappointing. Not worth paying for. Teen oriented. Do not understand all the high ratings.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|The first book isn't bad. It is a teen appropriate book. Bought because of high rating. Okay but have to have all 3 books to get the story. Recommend not starting series unless 2nd and 3rd books are free. Can't understand why this made best seller list except maybe price.
B000000OR9|5.0|All these years I never knew why David Coverdale and Whitesnake came out of the blue with a catchy unique blockbuster album in 1987 and than never made another in his entire career!  Now I know why, John Sykes!  He was as responsible for that sound as say Jim Steinman was for Meatloaf's.  Listening to this album, you can hear what sounds like a continuation of the Whitesnake album done by Blue Murder.  The guitar riffs are dazzling all the way through just like Whitesnake.  The songs are catchy the same way, have a similar tempo and flow.  You can see how John Sykes writes, the sound really captures that era when Whitesnake scored 4 smash singles and eventually an 8 million seller.  The vocals of course are very different, but you can hear it otherwise.  This was the followup that would have been Whitesnake and another great album.  I bet with John Sykes, Whitesnake would have continued to be a Platinum selling group.  Without him, two albums later Whitesnake already begun to fail commercially.  It's too bad, because I love David Coverdale.  he has the perfect voice to carry these John Sykes songs.  I also loved David in Deep Purple!  But this album is a treat, such a spirit of the 80's here.  This is 80's metal done right!  And his voice isnt all that bad either, maybe a tad generic but the material makes up for it.  I gave 5 stars, my real rating would have been 4 1/2 stars! Great CD, oh what might have been!
B005LHOKFS|5.0|TripAdvisor.com is a travel website that assists users in gathering travel information, posting reviews and opinions of travel-related content, and engaging in interactive travel forums. I've used TripAdvisor for years to find user reviews of hotels, restaurants, and tourist attractions (such as museums, zoos, parks, nightlife, sports, etc.). I've even posted a few of my own reviews.<br /><br />I was hoping that the Android app for TripAdvisor would be as helpful and easy to use as the website, and it is. The screen layout and fonts are excellent, with everything optimized for the smaller screens of mobile devices, and all the features of the website are there. Besides the restaurants, hotels, and tourist attractions, the app includes the user forums and the \\"Find a Cheap Flight\\" feature.<br /><br />Information about hotels, restaurants, and tourist attractions includes a map link. On my Kindle Fire, the link used the MapQuest App mapping, which is a Google Earth-type view.<br /><br />If you've never used TripAdvisor, you're in for a treat. It has to be the single most extensive resource for travel information, and it's worldwide, not just the U.S. You can use it to check out restaurants in your own neighborhood, or plan a trip to a city on the other side of the world. You'll be astonished at the wealth of information in TripAdvisor's databases.<br /><br />If you don't find what you're looking for in the search features, go to the forums, and if you don't see an answer to your question, post your question online. The TripAdvisor community is very active, and you'll usually get answers within a few hours.
B005FMZX9Q|4.0|My friends and family think I'm nuts because I have more than 25 watches.  But I can't help it, I love them.  Needless to say, but I am very particular about the watches I like.  They must be \\"simple\\", easy to read, nice looking and accurate.  .  This is my first Invicta watch.  It is a quartz watch and after a week, it has lost only about 1 second.  Not bad, good enough for me.  It's a very big faced watch and the face is a little cluttered (but not too bad for a tachymeter watch).  I love the numbers.  They are simple and elegant. The buttons are the easiest buttons to push on any watch I own.  It's pretty impressive how smooth they are.  Also, for a big watch, it is not that heavy.  I have smaller faced watches that are heavier.  The other thing that really impressed me about the watch is the band.  This could be the softest leather band I have and it conforms perfectly to my wrist.  The only nit I have with the watch is the date window.  At first I didn't think it even had a date, but then I realized that the minute hand can cover it completely (near the 4).  I give this watch a 4.5 rating.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|easy to use and super convenient, especially for taking notes in random places and keeping them all together in an organized space for optimum brainstorming.

B004EPYZQ2|5.0|I just rented Super 8 from Netflix and saw it last night and I am kicking myself (or my husband rather) for not seeing it in theater. We were at the edge of our seats at all time. No bathroom breaks. Popcorn practically untouched during scenes when we couldn't tear our eyes away from the screen (most of them). Sometimes, munching like crazy when we were scared out of our wits. Romance, horror, aliens, growing up, death, small towns and more: this film packs a punch. This is no E.T. but it's fantastic!

Five stars should be for 'extraordinary', I think.

B006O5XYWG|5.0|Extremely well done.  Didn't focus too much on things that I know exist but dread to know such as animal experimentation and general cruelty to animals.  Instead you find yourself on the side of and the most \\"humane\\" characters.  Also didn't resort to easy excessive violence to entertain.  If you want to escape who and what you are this movie makes you feel what it would be like to keep going and going until you are there.

0545323126|5.0|This product was a great gift for my grandson's birthday. He had been wanting to read these books and this was the complete set of the paperbacks (it was actually 7 books) for a very reasonable price. The product arrived quickly and was just as advertised.   I know this will give him many enjoyable hours of reading and that is really important. Reading is so very important for them to do well in school.   I would highly recommend these books especially for young pre-teens.
0571238343|1.0|The DVD did not come with the book as shown in the desription. Can we get it sent to us please. Thank you.  Curtis Brown  Ps. I sent the other book back and got another one and yet \\"The DVD or CD was still missing!\\" If it does not come with the book change the description and the photo's of the product.
B005FVA63A|4.0|It may seem overpriced, but if everything was sold individually, it would exceed the amount I paid I recon.  DEFINITELY worth it! I couldn't be more happy!  The only gripe I have is the package design - the weight of the contents above the drawer + the long postal travel has resulted  in the right side of the top tray to collapse and put weight on the drawer below... to which the right corner of the drawer has ripped apart from the weight.  I can't entirely blame Amazon, or the postage people, but mostly the package designers - cardboard and glue can only hold so much stress, to which this has  been exceeded. The box could've simply been designed better. A drawer made of cardboard is not a good idea.   Dissapointing, but I can't be bothered getting a replacement so I'll fix it up myself.  All in all, I'm very happy, one of the best christmas presents I've ever recieved!  Noting that the Kindergarten Alternate Achtung Baby Mix almost had me in tears, simply because it's something I've never heard before... or maybe an indication of  how much I love the album, and how much I've been pining for more music from their early 90s era.
0740748475|5.0|My girlfriend gave me this collection for Christmas, it is HEAVY! Beautifully bound, very tasteful off white pages with beautifully recreated cartoon. Little bits and pieces from the series and other Bill Watterson comments and thoughts make this the definitive edition. These books will last a lifetime.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Nice images and colors. Plenty of variety to keep it interesting. Very responsive to touch, which is relief compared to other apps on my Kindle fire. Worth the money.
0545265355|5.0|I purchased this series for my 13 year old daughter who likes to read. She has already finished the first book, and is now reading the second book. She has read many other popular series books for girls her age, such as the Harry Potter series, the Twilight series and Pretty Little Liars. She now has a new favorite! She likes that they are hard cover books and that she can add the boxed set to her collection on her book shelf when she is done. I reccomend this series because my daughter has so far found it to be entertaining, original and well written. I purchased this trilogy boxed set at Amazon because they offered and provided a discount price and fast delivery. It was a good buy!
B001CJJWWA|5.0|Anyone who is truly a fan of Amy Winehouse is in for quite a treat.  Her talent is undeniable and the DTS Master-HD audio is amazing.  She sings all the favorites, and does so with the kind style only possible by Amy Winehouse.  Amy interacting between songs with the crowd was funny at times, but could be considered a low point during the concert, but to me, a diehard fan of hers, I felt like I was invited to an intimate concert.  Her loyal and trusted Band was on point throughout her performances, and should be commended.  In short, if you are a fan of the this remarkable artist, do yourself a favor, by it now!!!
B0068AWQQ2|3.0|This movie is good fun.  No, it's not the original, which is why it is a remake.  To set expectations: it isn't as campy as the first; it's a modern version in suburbia with less camp & humor but still a fun enjoyable and well-done revision with a spin into today's world.  enjoyed it
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I read all the negative reviews even before purchasing this case, but I have to say that I'm quite fond of this case.  It is EXACTLY as advertised.  Most of the negative reviews mention it being flimsy, etc. but that is only because it is very lightweight, however, it is still sturdy.  The other issue negative reviews mention is the stand...The stand works fine, I have no idea what they are referring to unless they just don't know how to set it up right (which is not rocket science).  I would definitely recommend this case to anyone looking for a great case that doesn't add weight or bulk to the Kindle Fire.

0307959856|2.0|I've loved Pride and Prejudice since I was a child, and enjoyed P.D. James' early mysteries very much. Unfortunately, instead of producing a perfect confluence of mystery and classical literature, \\"Death Comes to Pemberley,\\" is a monument to turgid, uninspired prose. Her clumsy insertion of backstory throughout the book slows the glacial pace of the narrative even more. This novel lacks the charm and insights of Austen, and the clever plot twists of James' own mysteries.Elisabeth Darcy is almost an afterthought as is her relationship with the intriguing Mr. Darcy. Far too much time is allotted to a convoluted court room drama that left this reader praying for summary execution.In short, \\"Death Comes to Pemberley\\" has little to recommend it, even with occasional insights into the lives of beloved characters. It lacks the charm and humor of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", and the clever suspense of \\"An Unsuitable Job for a Woman.\\" Re-read both of them rather than wasting your time with this.
B000002I25|5.0|I dropped some purple owsley and listened to it over and over.  Even today I keep coming back to it and listening over and over again. I like all the stuff they did, but the first 2 albums were the best. Listening to it now.  Time for another hash hit.  Later dudes and dudettes.  :)
B004MTE6BY|5.0|I highly recommend this book.  A lot of what is happening today is reflected in the story, even though it takes place in the Great Depression.  You owe it to yourself to read this book.  Beside being an important piece of literature it is also a great read.
B00006AFF5|5.0|GRINCH 2000<br /><br />Here is a movie for all you people who said, \\"I like the 1966 Grinch TV special, but it really needed more communism and more jokes about mouth to anus sex.\\"<br /><br />The movie comes in three parts, each approximately 17 hours long.  In part 1, the Grinch comes down to Whoville.  We see the Whos are crass and greedy consumers, who only think of Christmas as a chance to spend or make money and show up the neighbors.  (Contrast this with Ron Howard and Jim Carrey, whom I have heard have given their millions to starving Africans and live like monks in tiny cells.)  The Grinch, apparently aspiring to membership in the Sendero Luminoso or Al Qaeda, launches a campaign of terror against the capitalist whos, sabotaging vehicles to cause crashes, handing out hack saws to children, invading the post office and disrupting the delivery of Christmas gifts and greeting cards, and throwing a child into a piece of industrial machinery.<br /><br />In part 2 a bleeding heart liberal among the Whos invites the Grinch to come to Whoville, where the Whos give him an award in an effort to make peace with him.  But the Grinch, after accepting the award, launches a second attack on Whoville, physically assaulting the town's mayor, setting fire to the town Christmas tree, committing a carjacking and then blowing up the stolen vehicle, and so forth.  Oh yeah, the Grinch gets to second base.  It's second base when you put your face between the girl's breasts, right?<br /><br />The third part of the movie is a retelling of the original Dr. Seuss tale, with a few additions.  Most prominent of these additions is when the Grinch makes the mayor kiss the Grinch's pet dog Max on the ass.<br /><br />I do not have room here to list all the jokes about sex and the anal sphincter that talented thespian Jim Carrey and whiz director Ron Howard have added to Dr. Suess's story, but trust me, this new Grinch is a Yuletide delight that you should rush right out and rent or buy.  Get the Blue Ray so you can really see how mind-bendingly hideous every single actor and CGI creature in the film is!ngly hideous every single actor and CGI creature in the film is!
B005V4FJC4|5.0|I had never even heard of \\"She and Him\\" before this morning, but I bought the album and have been listening to it all day.  It is one of the most enjoyable and relaxing Christmas albums I have ever heard; it just makes you feel good. Zooey is wonderful!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I knocked off a star because of the no-radar deal, but this app has just about everything else. K-Fire owners who are whining about no radar can simply browse to nws radar site or similar via bookmark. It's a no-brainer. That's one obvious reason why the web is built-in the darn things in the first place. Give us a break....
0553386794|5.0|My mother bought this book for me because her friend recommended it and I am SO glad I started reading it. It is wonderfully written and the story just keeps getting better with every new book. I ask anyone who is considering buying this book to please give it a try. It is money well spent.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|What can I say, besides the smooth vocals paired with the raw and simple sounds. You know that bare bones, gritty, garageband ish sound.Seven Devils and If Only For One Night, the latter having richocheting resemblance to Dog Days, are my 2 stand out faves. 5stars.

B006O5XYWG|1.0|I had to use my Xbox to rent this movie from Microsoft's Zune market, because four attempts to download to TiVo with Amazon resulted in the audio being out of sync, and video skipping.  This has been happening more frequently lately, I suspect that it's possibly the new copy protection codec that Amazon is using?  Please fix this issue!  Not all videos have it.
B0058VA2U4|4.0|Very good CD, and Anthrax sounds like Anthrax again with Belladonna back on vocals.  Bush was very good, but to a long time Anthrax fan the band just didn't sound like it should without Belladonna. Glad to have him back.  Some great thrash songs like 'The Devil You Know', 'The Giant' and 'The Constant', all of which have that driving, melodic Anthrax-only thrash sound.  Well worth buying. Pity the CD didn't come with lyrics.
B006JTS5OO|1.0|every single aspect of this movie was an embarrassment to the original muppet show   terrible pace extremly rushed ending \\"so cliche its not even funny\\", the worst jokes ive ever heard in my life sing a longs that last for way to long characters with no like value what so ever!!!!!!!!!!!
B004FOA84A|1.0|not sure how fun and interesting this game is because after I purchased it I cannot get the dumb thing to download.  very annoying!!!!!!
B002SJKWZ4|5.0|The wand seems well made and the commands are easy to do (all of them, even tap on the side, unlike what others have reported).  It didn't work 100% for my setup, but it is at no fault of the wand. It won't turn on my Samsung TV (it will turn it off, but for some reason my TV requires a long press to turn it on, no big deal) and it will not learn any command from my Dish Network remote control (because by default it is a RF remote, not an IR remote).  However, you CAN make it work with such devices, like I did for my Dish Network receiver, by finding out how to switch my receiver from RF to IR and then my remote control from RF to IR then teach the wand like normal.  So it does work 100% as advertised and I have used it on all kinds of devices at both my house and my friends houses and it works great!
1423124960|3.0|We opened this book on Christmas morning only to have the first few pages come out.  The book itself presents really well with a nice thick cover and silver edged pages. There was some glue stuck to the page edges. I think that it was stuck to the front cover as well. Really disappointed to have such a nice book put together so poorly!
B0063IH60K|5.0|its nice though I don't like the ads on it... I enjoy this free version... so I can play this anywhere now...

B006IVBSBU|5.0|I saw this when it was in theatres.    It has a huge cast, but the different story lines tie together well.  The reaction of different global agencies and governments seemed realistic.  But, I left wanting to shower and wear gloves for the rest of my life.  I thought it was great.

0865478570|1.0|As an EU Law specialist with 20 years experience from the EU Court, I started reading this book from the chapter \\"Language Parity in the European Union\\" and there, to my surprise, facts are so completely and shockingly wrong I cannot even start correcting them here. Where on earth did the author get his information about the the EU and the Court (which he even \\"visited\\")? Therefore, I have serious doubts whether this book can be trusted. And it makes me think how the author can write such things as a professor of the Princeton university and how this book can be recommended by the Economist, both venerable institutions where the scientific method is usually respected even as regards books aimed at the general public.

B003Y5H5HY|5.0|\\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Mikael Blomkvist is a financial reporter determined to restore his honor after being convicted of libel. Engaged by one of Sweden's wealthiest industrialists, Henrik Vanger, to get to the bottom of the long-ago disappearance of his beloved niece, Harriet -- murdered, Vanger believes, by a member of his large family -- the journalist heads to a remote island on the frozen Swedish coast, unaware of what awaits him. At the same time, Lisbeth Salander, an unusual but ingenious investigator with Milton Security, is hired to do a background check on Blomkvist, a job that ultimately leads to her joining Mikael in his investigation of who killed Harriet Vanger. Though Lisbeth shields herself from a world that has repeatedly betrayed her, her hacking skills and single-minded focus become invaluable. While Mikael goes face-to-face with the tight-lipped Vangers, Lisbeth plies the wired shadows. They begin to trace a chain of homicides from the past into the present, forging a fragile strand of trust even as they are pulled into the most savage currents of modern crime.  The cast led by Daniel Craig (as Mikael Blomkvist) & Rooney Mara (terrific as Lisbeth Salander) is excellent. The directing by David Fincher is excellent. The screenplay (based on Stieg Larsson's novel) by Steven Zaillian (also executive produced) is excellent.  The music by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross is excellent. The cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth is excellent. The film editing by Kirk Baxter & Angus Wall is excellent. The casting by Laray Mayfield is excellent. The production design by Donald Graham Burt is excellent. The art direction by Frida Arvidsson, Linda Janson, Pernilla Olsson, Tom Reta, Kajsa Severin & Mikael Varhelyi is excellent. The set decoration by K.C. Fox is excellent. The costume design by Trish Summerville is excellent.  This is an excellent and well-crafted film that keeps you on the edge of your seat with yourmind thinking and your heart racing. It is also a well-paced and well-made film that is faithful, not only to the novel, but the original Swedish language film, which this is a terrific companion to. Rooney Mara gives a terrific, career-making performance as Lisbeth and she and Daniel Craig have a great chemistry together. This is one of the best films of the winter-holiday season and of the year.
B001HN6922|1.0|As a family that watches the original Cars movie almost on a weekly basis we were HUGELY disappointed in Cars 2.  It was so bad, my kids won't even watch it through to the end of the movie. Don't waste your money on this one :(

B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|This book started out a bit slow, with a lot of detail, quite heavy at times, and I wasn't sure how necessary much of it was (until later). However, it was well written and the central plot and the characters interesting, so you keep turning the pages, albeit steadily. But then it starts to get into gear, particularly as the two main characters, Blomquist and Salander, come together - and from then on the pages start turning faster and you're well and truly gripped. If it had just kept going at that same early pace, it probably would only have got 3 stars, 4 at a push... but by the end with all the twists and turns, nothing less than five stars would do it justice. This is Silence of the Lambs Swedish style, with a mystery-plot at its core worthy of the best classics. And with Lisbeth Salander, Larsson has created one of the most offbeat, edgy heriones to grace a book in years.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This a well developed app especially considering it's free. Only downside is that after every new deal it takes you to an ad.
B0021L8V1G|5.0|I absolutely loved the second installment of the Iron Man series. Robert Downey Jr is wonderful and the only person who could have ever played Tony Stark.

0307949508|2.0|Too many characters with Swedish names made it a difficult read.  The translation didn't do much to address the change in currency so all references to money were wasted unless you have a converter.

B003YUC2FE|4.0|This is a terrific set of one of the most perfect film trilogies ever made. My oly disappointment is that this \\"ultimate\\" box doesn't also include the 3D versions of the movies. I don't have a 3D television yet,mbut have been buying the combo packs with Blu-ray 3D to build up a library for that future purchase. In the case of Toy Story, I almost wish I had bought the 3 films in separate combo packs to get all versions. That would have been considerably more expensive, though. Oh well.
B003CN4R74|4.0|I really like this album. I have waited awhile for a new album to come out. Hope to see another one soon. Just love the group.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This Blu-ray set is fantastic. A must-own for every movie collector, especially Star Wars fans. The bonus material alone is worth the investment, and the image/sound quality is spectacular. It'll even give you a new appreciation for the prequels.
B003B02PFO|4.0|Something different from John Grisham and I love it!  I am not sure if it was the author's intention, but I see that he wanted to deliver subtle hints of a bigger lesson in an exaggerated and hilarious story of a couple trying to escape Christmas altogether, and their neighbors who frowned on their idea.  The Kranks were almost successful in avoiding anything Christmas - lights and decor, gifts, parties, all the commercialism associated with it.  In the end though, everyone showed that no matter what, the goodness of the human spirit will always surface.<br /><br />Who does not want a stress-free Christmas anyway?  I believe it's a choice.  Go with the flow, or be the one to set it.  One need not go to Scroogey extremes.  Preparations and celebrations are fine, but we should not lose focus on the true reason for the season.
B006O5XYWG|4.0|Desperate to watch something new , I ordered this movie , ignoring the fact that I thought the trailer was horrible and in it the apes looked quite CG and really fake. But to my surprise it was really good! The plot was plausible , and for the most part the apes looked authentic enough that I stopped looking for the the CG of it all. I enjoyed it very much!

B005OLF6BI|5.0|I will preface this by saying I am a very big fan.  Unfortunately, I did not get to see her performance for the Speak Now tour, so I was really anxious to get the DVD when I heard about it.  I just finished watching it tonight, Christmas Eve.  All I can say is WOW!  What a fantastic production, and I do mean production.  This was more like watching a Broadway production than just going to see a concert.  I really wish I would have seen her this time around.  The video is put together as if it is all one concert.  It is very hard to tell that the songs were recorded from different venues.  The film quality is excellent, and the thing I enjoyed most is that the sound quality on the DVD is excellent at any volume level, and it didn't matter if it's on my television with full sound system or my computer.  I do have excellent speakers from Klipsch on my computer.  Haven't listened to the CD yet, but I was so happy with the DVD that I really don't even care much about the CD.  This is a definite buy.
B000BYCAJE|5.0|Just like the music when it was on a record in the 1960's with a few new tunes added on the CD
1451648537|5.0|Neutral and unbiased storytelling of Jobs' life by Walter Isaacson.  If you love tech, this is a must-read! Insanely great!
1451627289|3.0|This book received an incredible amount of praise from critics and readers.  The plot is indeed intriguing and promising.  Man goes back to before JFK was killed an attempts to prevent the assassination.  The beginning of this book and most of the end are excellent.  Full of action, suspense, and surprises.  The problem is the extremely long middle of the novel - the bridge between the setup and the conclusion.  There is simply not enough of interest going on.  There are some cute scenes and ideas (creating buzz words long before their time) but this part simply drags.  This might have been a great short story of even a novella.  So because of the problems with the middle section, even thought I basically enjoyed the book, I will not be recommending it to my friends.
B004I2K4DY|1.0|I loved the show actually I love musicals.  I've seen Les Miserable in London, New York and Los Angeles.  The 10th anniversary came out and I love it.  Soon after, I witness the worse performance done in Los Angeles (the very last performance) in the Pantages.  That turned around when Ahmanson in Los Angeles revived it.  Once more, travesty - Joel Schumacher does the movie version of the Phantom of the Opera.  But was followed by the 25th Anniversary of the Phantom of the Opera Royal Albert Hall.  Bravo.  Browsing through Amazon, I saw this 25th Anniversary Edition of Les Miserable and was about to ignore all negative review, but curiosity overcame.  I saw Nick Jonas as Marius.  My jaw dropped.  Nick Jonas' rendition of Empty Chairs at Empty Tables is empty and insulting.  Les Miserable is not Disney and it would be good for Disney singers current or not to stick with their own brand of musical.
0439023513|3.0|I understand the author intended to make a point. From her interviews, it seems she even had this ending in mind all along to make a point...<br /><br />But the thing is, a message like this could have been done a lot better justice. This book is just DEPRESSING and seems VERY HASTILY written. Everything about it screams rush-for-deadline from the expendable subordinate characters to the weak plot to the flat conclusion.<br /><br />(If you like Hunger Games and Catching Fire, I strongly recommend just reading the wikipedia synposis of this book to find your conlusion. The first two books were worthy; the third may ruin the trilogy for you. Better yet, read some fan fiction or make up your own ending.)<br /><br />*SPOILER ALERT*<br /><br />SUMMARY & ISSUES WITH BOOK 3:<br /><br />ISSUE #1: POOR PLOT DEVICES: LAST MINUTE HAIL MARY RESCUES THROWN IN<br /><br />After being rescued through a highly implausible but convenient turn of events (deus ex machina), Katiness is brought to District 13, which actually does exist.  Thirteen is actually headquarters of a clandestine rebel base, seeking to overthrow the reigning President Snow and Capitol. It's led by the morally-ambiguous President Coin, who holds tight control over her subjects dictating everything from what they eat to what they wear and when they eat it and how much.<br /><br />ISSUE #2: MIXED MESSAGES: WAR IS BAD--UNLESS YOU HAVE NUKES. NUKES KEEP BAD PEOPLE FROM HURTING YOU.<br />NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION ALL THE WAY!<br /><br />The Capitol has been hidding the existence of District 13, telling citizens that District 13 was blown to smitereens for its disobedience 75 years ago. But because District 13 made nuclear weapons, the Capitol decided not to hurt 13, but just pretend it doesn't exist instead.<br /><br />ISSUE #3: FEEBLE-MINDED ANTIHERO WITH LITTLE TO NO REDEEMING QUALITIES<br /><br />Unwittingly, Katiness has been saved for use as a propaganda symbol for the common people to rally against towards freedom.  In reality, she is just a tool of the new government.  Tragically, she suffers from severe PTSD and is as damaged as can be.  As one reviewer noted, most of the time Katiness spends her time hiding in a closet crying or throwing a misdirected violent tantrum at someone she supposedly loves. Literally, at one point, she claws Haymitches face. Her friends and loved ones frequently cover for her increasingly deranged behavior.  Multiple chapters cover this topic.<br /><br />ISSUE #4: IF YOU LOVE HIM, STAB HIM.<br /><br />For example, Katiness frequently is convinced she must kill Peeta, who has not been rescued, using various objects she finds, as she desperately tries to find him.  She goes rapidly from desiring nothing more than saving him in book 2, even at the expense of her own life, to desiring nothing more than his blood in book 3. Her transformation happens with no segway. Also, frequently to save others, Katiness is convinced she must kill herself and thinks frequently of hari kiri. Other characters also experience an alarmingly high proclivity for suicidal tendency.<br /><br />ISSUE #5: DEATH TOLL MAKES TERMINATOR LOOK LIKE A JOKE<br /><br />Many meanlingless deaths occur. Characters are introduced briefly and die in the next page. The rebels make a weak attempt to storm the Capitol. The attempt is not even described but quickly glossed over. Peeta is rescued but also driven insane from torture and drugging.  All hope seems lost.  Too literally, she trains to be a soldier and goes with her special team including Gale and a now delusional Peeta to attack and kill President Snow. Murder for her has now become a coping mechanism.<br /><br />Every message about war being bad and soldiers dying needlessly seems belabored.  The fact that violence can change people is just reiterated over and over monochromatically. It's like the reader is being beaten over the head with a stick about this point. The book may just have been hastily edited but it is, unfortunately, very shoddily done.

0439023491|5.0|I really wanted to give this book a 4.5 out of 5. (Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't let you have that option.)<br /><br />This book is good. However, it is just slightly less gripping than the first book... (but that was a tough act to follow). Some beginning chapters of this book are arguably unnecessary (a LOT of re-cap material). Also, there is a little filler material, as the book seems to try to find pace, and talks about how \\"dangerous\\" the times are - maybe one too many times.  It seems like useless exposition, considering that this is a society which revels in the sacrifice of children.<br /><br />Things get interesting when President Snow makes an unexpected surprise visit to Katiness in her home.<br />Threats aren't exactly veiled. My high marks mostly go to the twists that occur while the Victors finally go on their victory tour. Action starts to pick up as whiffs of threats from the Capitol, whom are displeased with the supposed berry act of rebellion, act to suppress increasing strife from the populice. It's interesting to hear how the people react to the Hunger Game broadcast.  It's sad how control is maintained in this society and, again, believeable--especially, in light of events unfolding in North Korea. The description of events starts to be more detailed and thought out.  It is light political commentary with much entertainment woven in.<br /><br />When the nefarious plot of the Capitol finally starts to unfold half way through the book, the pace really takes off. It begins to be as great as book one. The action is hard to put down.  I would definitely recommend for those who enjoyed book one to read book two. Expecially, if you are a Peeta fan!<br /><br />Peeta is just awesome. He is not that complex of a character but you can really feel for him because of his kind of purity, innocence, and yet integrity. While it seems like the Hunger Games and the Capitol have really destroyed or tainted everyone, he somehow seems to have survived it while keeping his own personality intact.ng his own personality intact.

0439023521|5.0|When I first heard the premise, I was very much against reading this or in any way supporting the product. It seemed very much like a direct rip-off of my favorite satire movie, Battle Royale, which pre-dates this publication about by a decade. However, curiousity from all the positive reviews got me to give this a sneak peek.<br /><br />To my dismay, I was hooked from the start. The premise is very simple. In an unnamed post-apocalyptic future, a new society has formed in what was once North America. It is called \\"Panem\\", centered by a Capitol and 13 surrounding districts, whom basically act like slave territories supplying all the needs for the Capitol citizens. But that's not all! Because of a rebellion that occurred 74 years ago, to instill peace through fear, the supreme governing powers that be in the Capitol have decided that each year two children, between the ages 12-18, will be submit from each of their districts as tributes. The tributes will battle to the death in a televised arena that every citizen is required to watch, as a reminder of what happened 74 years ago.<br /><br />Surprisingly, Susanne Collins makes the story very easy to read and believable, as if this could very well happen. It is not hard to see how a society, which is based on supreme rule and fear-- might actually take the path chosen by the people of Panem. --How the citizens of the subject districts might abandon all hope and actually do let something as terrible as the sacrifice of their children in a gruesome lottery.  Just look at North Korea for an example of this in modern society. OR even look at history, after WWI, the Allied forces were so determined to pin the blame of war on someone, they treated Germany very much like the districts. Imposing ridiculous punishments towards the citizens, which eventually led to WWII.<br /><br />Having read all 3 of these books, the first is very much the best. It is a very quick read, as that it is written in present-tense, perspective of the protagonist, Katiness Everdeen.  This is very light reading. The first book touches briefly on the atrocities of war, but mostly focuses on survival and how society can become very easily warped. I finished this book in one day, reading from 7pm to 1am, then eagerly ran out to buy the rest of the books the next morning.n.  This is very light reading.

1451627289|5.0|Quite a while ago, Mr. King said that he was all about story, and that it's important to give \\"weight\\" when telling that story.<br /><br />11/22/63 has \\"weight\\" in spades. It's a sophisticated time travel story, a love story, a thriller, a spy novel and more, all tightly wrapped and compulsively readable. I'm three years older than Mr. King and I've read most of what he's written over the years. The only negative thing I can say is that 11/22/63 has cost me a lot of beauty sleep.<br /><br />My favorite King novels include his debut book, Carrie; 'Salem's Lot; The Shining; Dead Zone; The Stand; his short novels, including The Library Policeman, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption; and The Breathing Method to mention some; his early and later short stories, but 11/22/63 is right up there with the top picks on my favorites list. I'm no literary critic, but for the \\"gentle reader,\\" this might be Mr. King's best book yet. (I don't pay much attention to literary critics anyway.)<br /><br />Thank you, Mr. King, for such a wonderful read. I'll read my Christmas gift again and again. (And traveling, I'll be reading it on my Kindle.)

I've wiped the game once and started over, but it's stuck again.  The second issue is the restaurant never opens. I keep forgetting it's there.  I also see there's an update for the Paid version that will have ads....NO!  I guess I'm stuck b/c those ads really get in the way.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I've seen countless of reviews about people bragging about the 2500K and 2600K, and i understand that most of these people just wanna have the best of the best, but in my opinion my Q6600 is still a good proc, and i'm not willing to change it until there's something out there that is 100% better and at the 200~300 dollar price range. There's still nothing that maxes out my proc in the thing's i do all day except video encoding and transconvertion which happens to all processors, i still have my Q6600 at 3.0 GHZ and the temps with this cooler is 28C in idle and 58C in max with prime 95 including the blending of 16GB of ram DDR3 for this old baby, yes 16GB for a Q6660 with a EP45T-UD3LR gigabyte motherboard, i bought the DDR3 via kingston which was incredible cheap 36 bucks for 8 gigs of ddr3 1600mhz ram, i bought two dual channel 8GB ram,(not the quad channel) and it works perfect, and the ram does not even touch the cpu fan. Here's the ram that i bought and worked from the box, no DOA'S thank GOD! http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0037TO5C0/ref=oh_o05_s00_i02_details  Btw i paired it with another cooler master 120mm blue led fan, it also runs at 2000rpm. I made this decision because my old zalman 9700 blue led fan was getting too old and even rusty and dark, the beautiful shinny copper has disappeared and the cooling was getting sluggish (40C idle and 70C max) so i bought this cooler because it still supports 775 and it rocks! i'll be uploading photos of the Q6600 with this cooler. Heres the extra cooler i bought.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026ZPFCK/ref=oh_o05_s00_i01_details  THANKS AMAZON!
B002RI9ZQ8|4.0|Well, what can I add after 3,000 reviews? I read this book after all the hype and still got sucked in - it's a well structured, well paced thriller. Two things stood out for me  - one was the original characterisations in Blomkvist and Salander. These are not \\"off the shelf\\" heroes, e.g. hard bitten ex-cops/military/spies etc. They are deeply flawed and the character journeys are fascinating. The second was how the author tackled writing a female lead character. I'm always dubious of men writing with women central characters as most of the time they still emerge with a male psyche projected onto them, however it is pulled off very well here and ther result is a very original \\"anti-hero\\" hero. Also this book rips the lid off the perception of Sweden and the Nordics as the perfect society - trouble in paradise makes a gripping read!
B006O5XYWG|4.0|Was not expecting much when I watched this movie, but found it very entertaining nevertheless. I would recommend people to see it.
B005POK858|3.0|I installed &quot;Eve of the Genesis&quot; when it was Amazon's App of the Day and played it through to the &quot;end&quot; on my Ego 4G. Now I have a Kindle Fire tablet, and find that the bottom of the screen is truncated such that you cannot see some text and prompts, and it makes finding some things nearly impossible.  My rating of the game is not based on the problems it has on the Fire. I would give it a higher rating if it had a User interface more geared to a touch screen device; as it is, it plays as though you had a keypad and an EGA on an old 80286 AT running DOS 2.6.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|It's a clever memory challenge without the hype of being penaliesed with a timer. The challenge is in the number of moves. Its awesome.
B004A8ZWVK|2.0|I hope the book brings people together better than the movie. White people of the early sixties are depicted as the most demonically evil creatures who ever cursed the surface of the earth, or at least the whites who lived in Jackson, Mississippi. African Americans are sainted portraits of nobility, standing taller than a granite statue of MLK jr. It is as if Pleasantville had been crossed with the Stepford Wives and Uncle Tom's Cabin. Heck, Simon Legree is a nicer person than the society people of Jackson Miss in this film. This is history the modern Hollywood way, crafted to win the stars Oscars and make the audience feel guilty for things that didn't happen.  Did black maids in the sixties really get fired for using the same toilet they cleaned every day? Did white people really all live in mansions and have servants in the deep south? In reality, the deep poverty and squalor that one sees in Hollywood depictions of the south was equally shared by poor whites who lived in those times, too. In Hollywood, they seem to confuse the utter servility of slaves from the 1800s with how people got along in the sixties. I got news for you, Hollywood: Rich people tend to treat all of their employees equally, like servants. My mother worked $5 an hour for a domineering woman who expected her to be a secretary, janitor, housekeeper, and babysitter. And the skin color didn't matter, that's how some rich people abuse their power.   I cannot see how any person of any ethnicity can walk away from this movie thinking that it betters race relations. The Reverend Jesse Jackson famously spit in white diner's food in the sixties when he worked at a restaurant. I can see this movie leaving minorities with a similar attitude, isn't that healing? The movie could have explored how today hispanics are lumped into maid jobs that once belonged to blacks, but that would get in the way of the message. This movie isn't a statement against hate, it is hate personified. I sincerely hope the book has a better message than the dumbed-down movie I just saw.  For the younger people who were not actually alive in those times (such as the Hollywood types who wrote this screenplay), there's a wealth of reading material out there to see the real history of the civil rights era of the sixties as it happened. Read the Reverend Ralph Abernathy's autobiography, go watch MLK jr's speech at the Washington Mall, or read Malcolm X's excellent autobiography (written with Root's Alex Haley). Heck, go get the DVD of Roots, it says far more about the factual history of this country than this movie ever could.   The message of \\"The Help\\" is that black people should hate whites even more, and whites should feel guilty for ever having been born. It might be a featured selection for Michelle Obama's bridge club, didn't she say repeatedly that only now is she proud of this country? I think this movie shows how fractured race relations are today, not of yesteryear. In that is its only value, for it shows how Hollywood views America today. And it's ugly. Sorry I paid money for it, thinking it would make a nice Christmas gift.  On a totally separate matter, the DVD itself probably has the most poorly designed menu ever created in the history of DVD entertainment. The DVD opens by asking what language you want. Once you select that, you are given a forced advertisement warning against pirating movies. There is no option to skip. Then you are forced to watch movie previews. If you choose the MENU option to get out of it, it dumps you back into the previews. Hitting NEXT repeatedly finally got me the movie. When you play that, you have to sit through no less than four copyright and anti-piracy notices before the movie will even start. I would remind the movie studio that a pirate has to put up with none of this garbage, they can start watching the movie immediately. Why are legitimate buyers PUNISHED with all of this nonsense? We legally bought the DVD, yet we're punished for buying it! Thumbs down to whomever put this DVD package together, they should have stricken you of your multimedia degree.

B004EPYZSK|4.0|I rented this movie with some trepidation due to the mixed reviews. I love Westerns and I love Science Fiction movies from both genres that are fun. Conceptually this is a great idea mixing the genres as they have done. My initial review is that it begins very well, sags in the middle, then picks up in the final few acts.<br /><br />The special effects are very well done. I really enjoy the design of the aliens. They are menacing and threatening with no regard for human life. The acting is very well done. Both Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig offer believable characters that are not one dimensional. Both men are tough, full of pride and though they are on different sides of the issue at the start of the movie it is not so easy to distinguish the typical western good guy from the bad guy. The plot is creative and they way typical adversaries in western movies all come together to battle the aliens flows well into the story and is not forced and artificial.<br /><br />Once the aliens arrive and the back story of Daniel Craig's character is explored is when the movie begins to sag. Other things also happen that slows down the pacing of the movie. One event is the revelation of another alien which is used to explain the motive of the invading aliens. I think they could have found another way for exposition and it would have quicken the pacing. The other reason the middle of the movie sags is that many scenes take place in the dark and it is difficult to view what was happening. I wish movie makers would lighten night scenes just a bit so we the viewer could see a bit more of what is going on.<br /><br />The final confrontation with the aliens is when the movie come back to life and returns to the pacing and quality story telling that it began with. Although a bit uneven all in all the movie does deliver an exciting, fun and gritty combination of the two genres.
B004T5K3OK|2.0|I believe it is bad form for Amazon to be &quot;selling&quot; this as a licensed version but not providing the latest update(s).

B0022Y570K|3.0|I find VOLBEAT to be not as good as other reviewers have stated.  Yes there are moments when I find the beat and rythm enough to make blood flow...but then the next track sounds like a country ditty from the fields of O'Malley.

B005G4TJUC|3.0|Good visual effects...but missing the relationship between the autobots and the main character.  I did not like the new girl, just a set of oversized lips.  I prefer Megan Fox who had attitude and natural beauty.  Would have been better if main character had put his friendship first with the autobots, then with his \\"love?\\" with the new gal.  I didn't see what he saw in her anyway, her character was horrible!!!  I still think Optimus and Bumblebee are the main stars that deserve more air time.
0156012197|2.0|Accidentally bought both a small paperback as a gift and a lovely \\"pop up\\" art edition of The Little Prince this Christmas and took notice from Mr. Howard's self aggrandizing and patronizing opening salvo - a pedantic \\"translator's note\\" - his \\"excuse\\" of an explanation regarding the dedication to Leon Worth, it is instantly obvious one has had a prude's stick forced upon one... making this treasured classic of poetic nuance an unrecognizable, stiff and ornery translation.<br /><br />I am so lucky and fortunate to own both the Fiftieth and Sixtieth Editions of the Hardback Katherine Woods versions.  While it is amusing to see the lovely paper work in the pop up book, it is not worth the \\"excuse\\" of reading it.  Get your hands on the Katherine Woods version every time.  Especially when reading this to children.  Why ruin something perfect already?
1451627289|2.0|Granted, Stephen King has become a better writer over the years. His best work was around the time of BAG OF BONES. Since then he has suffered an apparently unrelieved case of Anne Rice's Disease--the desperate need of a ruthless editor. Case in point: 11/22/63. Like always, he goes on and on and on. I finally gave up at almost page 500 (which was already longer than the novel needed to be, with another 350 pages to go). King writes as though he didn't trust the reader to \\"get it\\" so he just keeps throwing in more and more (and more and more) stuff because there's no one to tell him \\"enough already!\\" As always, he insists on telling us a character's every stray, random, trivial, boring unnecessary thought (often in italics). Worse yet, he fills page after page with details of small-town life in Maine, Florida and Texas as though he could not bear NOT to use all his research. And, most infuriating of all, we get a day-by-day accounting of life in the Oswald household. Why? Who knows? And everything (and I do mean EVERYTHING) comes back around again, and again, as though everything were of equal importance, right down to the little group of girls jumping rope. And after a while you'll want to pull your hair out every time you have to read about \\"the land of Ago.\\" Finally, King remains the most gratuitously scatological of writers: in every book we have to read about characters going to the bathroom, or thinking about it, or referring to it, or comparing something else to it. This is almost never necessary for the story (THE GREEN MILE excepted ).  Save yourself the time and money and read something else.
B00005QVHA|4.0|whoa - I found that THIS Raw Power is not the same as the import vinyl I had back \\"then\\".

B005N0C0JQ|3.0|I bought this album with a certain set of expectations. The release (fortunately or unfortunately, depending on your p.o.v.) met those expectations. Anyone who remembers, or has been exposed to, the music Mister Gallagher penned in the '90s knows he has a knack for pop-licious melodies and choruses. Those who supported his artistic efforts in the '00s recognized a different direction emerging. Somewhere between the recording of Be Here Now and the process of patching together pieces of Heathen Chemistry, Noel began crafting more melancholic, mid-tempo tunes. This is an album of lesser versions of cuts like; Little By Little, She Is Love, Mucky Fingers, The Importance Of Being Idle, Part Of The Queue, Waiting For The Rapture, The Shock Of Lightning, (Get Off Your) High Horse Lady, and Falling Down. In a manner of speaking, it is what I'd feared would happen when The Chief went solo. He's become a sort of \\"lonely troubadour\\". There's nothing wrong with the endeavor in itself. But Noel isn't as good at the act as the people he continuously mentions in interviews, namely; Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Donovan, and the like.   Lots of fans expected Gallagher to outdo his early Oasis days. The fact of the matter is he will never be able to do that, and he's very aware of why that is. The world has changed. Technology has helped change it and fans. Artist no longer seemingly explode on the scene from nowhere. We're no longer disconnected from Half The World Away. The \\"ground swell\\" doesn't happen under bands anymore. But that isn't what I made this album underwhelming (for me). It is the fact it plays like one long mid-tempo song... and this long song has no TRUE DRAMA to you get the listener emotionally involved. It has some hi-lights, though...  Everybody's On The Run- \\"... Trying to walk in my shoes, but they don't belong to you...\\"  If I Had A Gun...- \\"... 'Cause you're the only God that I will ever need...\\"  The Death Of You And Me- \\"... At the bottom of a bottle is every man's apostle...\\"  (Stranded On) The Wrong Beach- \\"... The faces that you can't save are calling out for me...\\"  I wish I had more positive things to write about the record. But I'd be leaning on the fact I loved this man's former band. And I've heard this side of Noel before. I (for the most part) referred to them as low points of the later Oasis releases. There is a new one coming in 2012. I'm looking forward to a side of Noel I haven't heard before.

1575666286|5.0|This is an excellent book.  Anyone who's been diagnosed w/cancer should read this.  Because you don't have to have toxic treatments such as chemo and radiation.  The Gerson method has been curing cancer for decades.  It is not an easy regimen to follow but it does work.  If nothing else, do a few juices and a few weeks of enemas and that will complement whatever other treatments you have chosen.  And not only that, but the Gerson therapy works to cure all sorts of other things like addictions and other chronic diseases.  It's imperative that all cancer patients improve their diets.  You can't heal from cancer if you don't eat all organic.  The book details diet including recipes.  Eating this way would be good for everyone.  Don't wait until you are sick!  Read this book now and avoid many health problems!
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|When I first heard that there was to be an American re-make of the mega-popular Swedish \\"Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" films, I was, if you could believe it, less than enthused. I thought that the Swedish version that was released here in the States, with subtitles, did the job well enough. Having read all three books, I felt like I knew the trilogy very well, because these books had become a part of my life. They were my \\"Twilight\\", my \\"Harry Potter\\". These books were a part of me for roughly four years, and I didn't want to see my babies be massacred by American filmmakers who were only out for the money, uninterested in satisfying die-hard fans of the novels.   I forgot about this movie, until I saw the first trailer, which featured images from the film that I feared would be taken out of the film, set to a kick-ass cover of Led Zeppelin's \\"Immigrant Song\\", by Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, and composed by Trent Reznor, of Nine Inch Nails, who I realized was tapped to write and compose the film's score. That trailer should be remarked as one of the best that Hollywood has done in years, because it was well-done enough to turn skeptics like myself.  The other night, I saw David Fincher's \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\". Having read the book, and having seen the original Swedish film, this is my third time seeing this story. The book, and the original film were superbly done, in my opinion. I had a hard time believing that this version could be better. It was. It's extremely faithful to the novel. There are little scenes and details from the novel that I assumed would be cut from the film, that weren't. The changes from the novel were refreshingly minuscule, but what was changed felt right, and didn't feel like a blasphemy to those, like myself, who swear by these books.  The story follows Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), a Swedish journalist recently desecrated by a wrongful libel conviction, who is asked by a dying man to help him find out how his niece, Harriet was murdered 36 years ago. He is asked to break down the events of one day, where she went missing. He enlists the help of Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), a troubled genius/computer hacker/research assistant who has led a very hard life. These two come together to solve what really happened on that day, but the central mystery is only one third of the story. Salander and Blomkvist both have their own stories going on, which are both quite interesting, made more interesting when they intertwine with each other. I'm deciding not to talk about those stories in this review, for a reason. You'll understand when you see the film.  A big part of why this movie works is Rooney Mara. She rocks. She transformed herself into the incredibly hard to grasp, and incredibly elusive Lisbeth Salander. She does what any other better-known actress could not have done, because they would have been too recognizable. I have seen Mara in a few films prior to this, including Fincher's \\"The Social Network\\" and the god-awful remake of \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\\", and I didn't recognize the Mara from those movies at all in this performance, because she was Salander, and not herself, at all. She had clearly devoured the books, and analyzed them as heavily as any fan would have. As a fan of this saga, I have to mention Noomi Rapace, in this review, who played Salander in the Swedish films. She, in my first viewing of the Swedish film, did a good job. But when compared to Mara, she fails incredibly. Rapace was one, too old to conceivably play the part, and two, was very much one-dimensional while Mara makes Salander exactly what I wanted her to be. I hate resorting to trite terminology like \\"amazing\\" and \\"incredible\\", but both of those overused words describe Rooney Mara's performance perfectly.  I hate to say this, but, with Mara stealing every scene she is in, Daniel Craig becomes something of an afterthought in this film. However, if I sit down and think about it, he was the perfect choice to play this role. He was a better choice than Michael Nyqvist, who annoyed me after a short while (in the Swedish films). He brings what the role needs - a character who seems to be holding it together on the outside, while visibly falling apart on the inside, given all that has happened to him. He was the perfect choice for this thing, which I hope will be an American film trilogy, as well as the Swedish one.  \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\", in a cinematic sense, is in many ways, is a mood piece, like \\"Lost in Translation\\" or anything written by Nicole Holofcener. It is very focused on imagery, setting and, of course, mood, yet it has a very fast-moving script which doesn't waste a second of its 160 minute running time. Every minute is exciting, and even thrilling. I'm pleased that this film decidedly stuck so close to the book, but changed small things that worked in its advantage, just like \\"The Help\\" did earlier this year. One thing that is important to realize about this film is that it isn't a re-make of the original Swedish film, like many will assume it is. It's AN ADAPTATION OF THE NOVEL. Many American audiences did not see the original Swedish films, and this is a great way to expose them to a fantastic and very cinematic novel, which is basically being played out, page for page on the big screen.  My big fear about this movie was not that it wouldn't be as good as the book, or the original film version, because I didn't expect it to be nearly as good as it was, yet I was worried that it would turn out like \\"The Da Vinci Code\\"; a very popular novel that was made into a film that was incomprehensible to anyone who didn't read the book. This is a tremendously accessible film. While the cast all use thick Swedish accents, and the culture is noticeably different than what Americans are used to, there is nothing lost in translation. Friends of mine who I saw the film with, who hadn't read the book were engrossed in it, simply because it was a well done moviein every aspect possible.  A big part of why this movie works is David Fincher. He did a fabulous job. He would be the only person suitable to do the film's future installments. He and Steven Zaillian, who wrote the brilliant screenplay made sure that the film would be technically brilliant, if everything else were to fall apart. I have to mention Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, and Atticus Ross, who are responsible for the cold, emotionally distant, and yet incredibly intense score. Those two worked with Fincher on \\"The Social Network\\", and that film worked incredibly well, too, so it only makes sense that the group would be reunited for this film. The extravagant and (for lack of a better term) awesome credit sequence followed to Karen O's cover of \\"Immigrant Song\\" was just that...awesome. I don't want to describe it very heavily, but it's an experience in and of itself.   It should be mentioned that this film is delightfully not for the faint of heart, featuring graphic violence and sexuality that will potentially scar young children for life. It's not going to be something that everyone will love, however it got a big applause in the theatre I saw it in. I look forward to seeing this film multiple times, and before I let this review get too long, let me just say that this is one of those \\"if you only see one movie this year...\\" kind of movies. Gripping, thrilling and brilliant. Missing it would be a crime.  Grade: A+
B005K0HDGE|2.0|king's effort in this novel is both suspect and tragically unfortunate. i had thought of the possible incorporation of sci-fi time travel canard in conjunction to the assassination some time ago. when i heard of king's take i was excited and hopeful his stature would used in the service of seeking and promoting truth. this book is dishonest, superficial, and open to question. relying on posner's discredited partyline and mailers self-professed unwillingness to research avenues suggesting a complicated scenario that he actually believed to be true, king has laid waste to his own chance to create an important work and recognize the overwhelming immensity of evidence now bringing the truth into lasar focus. king has aligned himself with individuals and motives of at the least hideously misguided if not outright evil. one of the worst facets of this publication by one so prominent is the chilling affect and pre-emption of other works which would be deemed imitative at best.  king is either oblivious. a dolt,  a dupe, or one of the many documented shills of corporate media perpetuating lies and terminally diverting us from ever addressing the truth and those who would deny us freedom once thought an american birthright.

I'm reading it again. can't wait for the movie. its such an addicting series
0618001905|3.0|The strengths of the book lie in how accessible it is and how enjoyable it is to read. It is written by a professor of journalism and who was never trained in African history and debates over Africa of today. The author was, to be fair, forced to deal with a paucity of data available on the matter.  The weaknesses are that Mr Hochschild relies on generalizations and characterizations. His narration based off of principal agents, Leopold II, Morel, Casement, Williams, etc makes for an interesting read but omits a sense of what it was like to live during that time. Hochshild makes many assumption on the psychology of certain characters, particularly Stanley, that are assumptions and not historical.  So, great superficial book, but could have been better if written by a historian/afrianist. There were simply too many questions that were unanswered for me: What really motivated the American pro-Congo lobby? Why weren't rebellions in Congo not more successful? And broader questions: what is the relationship between the book's subject and DRC today? How does that compare to other African countries.

I read this book a while ago but was particularly struck last week when seeing the images of North Koreans grieving at the death of Kim Jong Ill.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I made a big mistake and laid my Fire in this Marware case on top of my jacket on the roof of a vehicle. I forgot it was there and grabbed my jacket. In turn I slinged my Fire across a parking lot. I watched in slow motion as it slammed the pavement and rolled end over end then slid to a stop ten feet away. I panicked thinking I had destroyed my Fire. I opened it up to check the Fire and saw that there was not a mark on it and it also still worked. The case took a beating and is pretty much trashed but it did its job. I have ordered a new case to replace the sacrificed one. Thanks for an awesome case Marware!
B006O5XYWG|4.0|I go all the way back to the original movie series. Back in the day this series had me hooked   and colud not wait until a new movie was produced.In my opinion they still hold up because time does not stop  the awesome things humans can and do to theirselves even now.I love the updating of an old friend. You tell  me which came first; the idea for the drug or the movie script? The net just within the last week had a  written article on this very issue of a drug to aid in dementia and beyond. Hope abounds with such a thought  for all that suffer from many dieases that effect the human mind. Kinda deep! I highly recommend this movie.  Can't wait for the next one.

This time I'm using it because I simply hate to see the waste of a set of pipes like Christina's but the girl needs to be taken down a few notches. I saw her sing a duet with Brian McKnight where she completely showboated the entire song and the poor guy had to grab her hand to get her to calm the freak down. Nope. I'm done with her for at least a decade. Maybe some maturity with bring her down to earth.

B001IBIHQ4|4.0|This HBO series was pretty intense and gruesome as to looking at the other part of the war. (A.K.A on the Pacific side) It really opens your eyes. However I also own the HBO series \\"Band of Brothers\\" and I find that Band of Brothers is better than the Pacific, but in all they are good and educational to watch.
1451627289|5.0|An 849 page book.  The longest I have ever read without my box of Crayolas.  One might ask why it takes all those long pages to prevent the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.  You see what Stephen King has created is a book that is so much more than just the prevention, it is a long journey into the past to try and remake history.  The Butterfly Effect, I believe.  It may have taken me 6+ weeks to get through this wonderful book, but having the reading ability of a 5th grader, I had no choice.  This is a roller coaster ride from Maine to Fort Worth to finally Dallas, with so many amazing twists and turns.  The reader, if old enough, remembers things long forgotten.  But not Stephen King. He has done his research well and the reader actually feels like they really are back in time.  But then what happens after the failed assassination attempt?  Read and find out, in horror, what our world has become, just because one very serious event was thwarted.  Those of us that were alive in 1963 have been psychologically marked by the event.  According to Stephen King, it really need not be that way...only if....history could somehow have been changed on that horrible Friday in November 1963.

B0034G4P8A|5.0|I will review this later all I want to know right now is WHY did this and Captain America get a PG-13 rating??? There is no sex, nudity or foul language-These are movies a 5 year old could watch if you compare it to the filth on network tv these days-
B004ZGI1V0|4.0|Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />This film with Liam Neeson (his second action film after Taken) is really intriguing from beginning to end. It keeps you guessing. Terrific performances from Oskar Schindler and Helen Of Troy. I recommend this film. Unfortunately, God's name is profaned, hence I deducted one star. Rated PG-13.
B005Y1B3Q0|5.0|Sometimes Director's Cuts don't make that much of a difference ............<br />But in this case, the Director's Cut takes EXPENDABLES to a much higher level !!<br /><br />Now I can like EXPENDABLES much better and never watch the theatrical version again.<br /><br />Improvements -------<br /><br />1) More character development<br /><br />2) better choice of backing music<br /><br />3) different bad guys in opening ship scene<br /><br />4) got rid of the choppy edited fight scenes and returned a more complete natural action to the fight scenes so that you can now actually follow what is going on.<br />Much longer and complete fight scenes<br /><br />5) More interplay between characters .. more comradarie<br /><br />It is almost like a totally different movie<br /><br />Seeing this Director's Cut, I can't understand why they ever released the original Theatrical Version like it was.<br /><br />By comparison the original version looks like what happens when they put a movie on TV and edit the heck out of it to avoid ratings problems.<br /><br />Without question .......... EXPENDABLES Director's Cut is 100% better !<br /><br />I was not a big fan of the original release as I found it kind of shallow and nothing more than boom and pow.<br /><br />But this Director's Cut really makes it a better movie
B0043ZDU1E|1.0|I received this CD  - The Wind That Shakes The Barley - for Christmas from my wish list. However, when I opened the sealed CD package there was no CD inside. I was left to ponder how much the record companies are making by doing this? It is no wonder there is so much illegal downloading going on. For my part I will not be purchasing any more CD's. I hate being ripped off, especially by Amazon.
1451627289|5.0|I have only read two previous Stephen King books, \\"The Stand\\" and \\"Under the Dome\\", both of which I enjoyed.  This book, \\"11/22/63\\", caught my attention because the JFK assassination is still so vivid in my memory.  I was in college at the time, and after college, moved to Dallas, where I passed Dealey Plaza and the School Book Depository on a daily basis.  And the outstanding Amazon readers' reviews made me want to read this one.  King's development of time travel is very unique and very thought-provoking.  It caused me to think often about events in my own life, and what if something different had happened, how would that have played out in the future.  The story surrounding Lee Harvey Oswald was very interesting, in giving the reader a perspective on how he came to do what he did.  And I have often wondered how differently history might have been had JFK served one or two full terms in the White House.   The romance in the story was not typical of the other King books I've read, and was so very well done.    The entire plot kept me in suspense throughout, and here I am, on Christmas Eve, having spent all evening unable to put it down until I finished.  And what a pleasing ending it was!  Great job, Mr. King.
B004WR125O|1.0|I share the opinion of the other negative reviewers.  This tiny adapter does not work well in a low-signal environment.  My Onkyo TX-NR609 receiver is in an upstairs cabinet, and the router is in the basement.  The UWF-1 was able to see the home network and showed \\"connected\\" (30-40% signal), but blanked out on all of the TX-NR609's built in net and Internet radio services (\\"no item\\", \\"server not available\\", etc.)  Onkyo firmware upgrade, channel changes, and other workarounds suggested here were useless and just wasted time.  Based on some Amazon reviews, I subsequently ordered s TP-Link TL-WN722N adapter [[ASIN:B002WBX9C6 TP-Link TL-WN722N 150Mbps High Gain Wireless USB Adapter]](compatible chipset, bigger antenna) from Amazon, and it worked perfectly, plug and play from the beginning.  On the positive side, the UWF-1 is small enough and cute enough to make a nice pendant :)
B006O5XYWG|3.0|The computer-generated chimpanzee actors were good, but nowhere near perfect. That imperfection made itself felt in several key scenes, which jolted me out of my suspension of disbelief. The human actors were similarly OK, but no stellar performances.

6305327084|4.0|*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2011 'UK RELEASED BLU RAY' ***<br /><br />A should-be-doing-more-than-this-with-his-life William 'Willie' Conway (Timothy Hutton) takes a wad of crumpled notes out of a beer glass - slurps down his last whiskey of the night - and closes the lid on the bar's battered upright piano. With his dollar tips firmly wedged in his pockets, he then trudges through the cold streets of New York heading for the Port Authority building on 6th Avenue. Onboard the Greyhound bus and bound for his hometown in Massachusetts, he looks out through the neon-reflected glass and ponders what lies ahead. First will be his slightly loony family (Robert Bright and David Arquette play his monosyllabic Dad and simpleton brother) and worse - a high-school reunion full of memories, achievers and awkward questions. The big city boy who left Hicksville in the dust finally returns triumphant...or maybe not...<br /><br />But while the seasons change in snowbound Knight's Ridge (his home town) - it seems little else does. Willie is met at the other end by his sorry-assed crew of former college buddies. Paul obsesses over his ex-vegetarian girlfriend Jan who is are now dating a meat-cutter (Michael Rapaport and Martha Plimpton) while his best buddy Tommy pushes a snow plough in suburban driveways which he quickly follows with some pushing of another man's wife (Matt Dillon and Lauren Holly). Watching all of this from the sidelines is Maz Perlich as the permanently squinting hat-wearing Kev who doesn't seem to want much from life except maybe a beer with his mates and a good hot meal - while the unexciting but steady Michael (Noah Emmerich) is a genuinely nice guy trying to hold down his job and keep his marriage together. Even Willie's 13-year neighbour (a cleverly cast Natalie Portman) acts weird towards him - developing an instant crush on the thirtysomething to the point where she asks him to wait 6 years until she's 18 and they can \\"...walk through the world together...\\" Willie is so confused about his place in life and women in general - at one point - it's an offer he seriously considers...<br /><br />Then there are the other side of the relationship coin - the town's long-suffering women. Michael's wife is Sarah (a lovely Anne Bobby) - who is ever understanding and supportive. In fact most of the ladies of the town seem to exude stoical patience - they simply sigh and put up with their men's shortcomings and immaturity. Miro Sorvino's character Sharon loves Matt Dillon's character Tommy - but dies inside just once too often as he deposits his cockiness in someone else's bed. Michael Rapaport's character Paul festoons his walls with pictures of lingerie models because he is convinced they represent some kind of love nirvana - ladies who can do no wrong and bring only joy into your life simply because they're \\"...beautiful girls\\". The scene where Rosie O'Donnell bawls out the boys in a supermarket about obsessing over these fake fantasies in glossy magazines - is both brilliant and ball-breakingly funny. She makes a good point too. The boys do need to \\"...get a grip!\\"<br /><br />And into this heady mix is thrown some genuine temptation - a visiting Uma Thurman who effortlessly knocks all the boys for six (even the faithful ones) as she wanders into their regular waterhole Stinky's bar (Pruitt Taylor Vince). The habitual womaniser Tommy and smooth musician Willie fancy their chances with her - while the less-attractive boys just fancy her but would never have the nerve to do anything about it. There later follows some delicious dialogue moments - Hutton's character half-heartedly wooing Thurman in the bar and ice-hut afterwards - and especially when Hutton is sparring with Natalie Portman about how she will grow up anyway and have a great life with her own memories to savour (even at 13 she showed extraordinary star quality and acting chops).<br /><br />But when Willie's classy girlfriend Tracy finally flies in from New York to meethis family - she quietly wows them all. In fact they want to touch Willie to see how in God's name he got this lucky - she's a lawyer, she's warm-hearted, she's got the 'boob thing' going - Tracy is a catch and the clan Conway knows it (a lovely turn from Annabeth Gish). So Willie finally has to be mature now and decide...and on it goes to a wholly satisfying ending...<br /><br />Directed by TED DEMME and written by SCOTT ROSENBERG - as you can see from the names above - this 1996 movie featured an extraordinarily good ensemble cast - and each of them given real meat to work with. The women's parts (even if they were merely a cameo) were so well written. It was popular at the time - effortlessly hip too - and is a smart choice for reissue on BR (UK released Oct 2011).<br /><br />Transfer-wise - the BLU RAY picture is defaulted to fit the entire screen and is a vast improvement over the DVD (even if the opening credits to David A Stewart's score contain a few scratches and glitches). Once it gets to the snowbound town - day or night - the clarity is lovely and blemish free and really adds to the film's homely vibe. The outdoor sequences on the ice-rinks are particularly clear and eye-catching. It's a damn shame there's no extras though - a real let down.<br /><br />To sum up - \\"Beautiful Girls\\" doesn't really seem to be about anything in particular - but nonetheless you enjoy its company immensely. It's like a good night out with the boys - or girls - or preferably both. \\"Beautiful Girls\\" is like life itself - enjoyable one moment - heartbreaking the next. It's just working out which one to side with.<br /><br />My advice - go with this small movie with a big heart - and enjoy...<br /><br />PS: Blink and you'll miss it 'cameo' is by JOHN SCURTI as a Greyhound Bus Ticket Dispenser at the beginning of the movie (barely gets 2 lines). He later became the leading character Kenny Shea in Denis Leary's superlative \\"Rescue Me\\" TV series about New York firemen post 9/11.<br /><br />PPS: for other recent reissues on BLU RAY - see also reviews for:<br />\\"Amelie\\", \\"The Cider House Rules\\", \\"American Graffiti\\", \\"Bright Star\\", \\"Shakespeare In Love\\", \\"Love Actually\\", \\"A.I - Artificial Intelligence\\", \\"Bubba Ho-Tep\\", \\"Gone Baby Gone\\", \\"Michael Clayton\\" and \\"The Jane Austen Book Club\\" (Euro Issue)his family - she quietly wows them all.

What I'll say is that I went into this film not expecting much more than a \\"Boxer\\" \\"Rocky\\" feel good film. I rented it because it looked like a halfway decent way to spend a couple of hours with. I read some reviews to juice myself up for it. I'll admit that I'm kind of jaded to these sort of films and I sure as hell didn't expect to actually like, let alone love it but that's exactly what happened. Believe the hype. Rocky is my all time favorite movie not for its intelligence but for the fact that its main characters felt real, I could truly identify with them completely. And what I especially love about this film is that it used the human element and not CGI or 3D to make me feel this way.<br /><br />Haven't seen a lot of movies at the theater this year. Frankly, haven't been any that I could get myself up to driving to, and plunking down 10 bucks to see. But this is one I would have paid to see. A shame that it didn't receive the publicity that it deserves. What it does deserve is recognition at Oscar time. Best actors, take your pick. Best supporting actor, definitely Nolte. I damn near, no I did, cry, because of Nolte's performance. With all of the comparisons to Rocky, I still can't say this movie eclipses it. But I will say that this film does for MMA what Rocky did for boxing--it humanizes a sport characterized by brutality. Bravo!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Simple chess game. No complaints! So far the computer is up five games to two which is not bad for a novice.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|I cannot remember a movie that I have enjoyed more than Music Man which I have seen over and over again.  This cast of characters could not have been better and the music is unforgetable.  Great movie.
1451648537|4.0|Nice job by the author and Steve Jobs to create his last presentation.  When will the Movie be out? LOL - No one knows what really happened or if it happened.  Books are just as much fiction as movies and stories...fun read.  JanSimpson
B005J4TLQG|5.0|Attack the Block is a fun popcorn munching thrill ride.Good young actors, great writing and rollercoaster chills and spills make this urban, public housing, multi-cultural, alien invasion movie a must see.Plus, this film has heart.You actually care about the young characters. This is not just another body count film. Attack the Block is a great B-movie, which, in itself, is no small accomplishment.
0071636080|4.0|Nice job by the author - information is put together well- however we already know this information...Steve Jobs is a master of illusion.  For example, we all know music means more when you hear and see the band/singer in person...it begs to answer the question \\"Is it live or taped?\\" Do they really feel the song, can they sing, and it is about the atmosphere created that makes the concert magical.  When Steve Jobs appears on stage...no matter what he says - it creates magic!  Everyone wants to be known for their passion, being the underdog always makes for a great following.

B0063IH60K|3.0|On my kindle fire all the ads drive me crazy! I love it on my ipod touch however, there are NO ads thank God!!
B006O5XYWG|1.0|I rented this movie in HD along with Cowboys and Aliens using my Roku and neither had any audio. I was able to view (and hear) the trailer before I rented. Ripped off, what a disappointment.
B005MVIF7M|5.0|Interesting mix of styles, harmonies, showing the strengths of Wilco.  Great music.<br /><br />Be aware that there is another version of this album, with 4 more tracks, at [[ASIN:B005MVL10U The Whole Love (Deluxe Edition)]]

B002KSPKRS|5.0|My coworkers talked me into playing BF3 online and I'm hooked. These headsets give an entire new dimension to the game. It's a much better experience using the headset versus the tv speakers.  They are well worth the price plus the sound no longer disturbs my wife and daughter when I play at night while they sleep.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game very addicting I play all day long best game u use points or coins to buy other games helps set a goal very easly
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Here is an extract from my review of my [[ASIN:B002DGTGO0 Sennheiser HD448 Closed Circumaural Hi-Fi Headphone]], which describes my experience once I added the E6:<br /><br />I have never bought a headphone amplifier before, but I have recently started reading up on them, and I read the reviews for the E6, and figured why not, I'll give it a try and see if it's just a gimmick, or actually worthwhile. They were not very expensive ($29) so I didn't mind. So after charging up the Fiio and making sure it's at 100%, I plugged one end into my Macbook Pro, and the other end to the HD448s. I first played a song without the E6, about 30 seconds, then tried the same song with the E6 now in line. My reaction? WOW. The headphones came alive. What I considered was excellent before, was now muddy and dull without the E6. With the E6, the base response went through the roof, the mids and treble which were sharp became razor sharp, crisp and tight. There were instances where I had not heard certain things (backing instruments or vocals for example) in some songs, and now, they were crystal clear. Honestly, I don't think I will use my headphones again without the E6.<br /><br />Overall, well worth the purchase price, buy it and enjoy music again!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|A great alarm clock with tons of options. No more headache inducing beeps when you awake. Set a song or theme and wake up like a champion!

1582701709|5.0|A good friend of mine recommended The Secret and said it would change my life. He wasn't lying. The book is about the law of attraction and discusses how we attract all circumstances to our lives with our thoughts. If you think good thoughts and expect good things, you receive those things. The same is true for negative thoughts and emotions. The Secret helped me to realize that I can have everything I have ever imagined for my life. In the 3 weeks since I first read the book, I have already started receiving those good things. I feel more positive than ever and I never have a bad day, which I am very thankful for. Buy it, read it, and reread it!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Good Alarm Clock. I can even turn the volume off, so that I am not awakened by phone calls, text, etc... and the Alarm still sounds.  I use it to wake-up and for work events.  Doesn't let me down.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|This is a great family movie. I fell in love with the movie the first time I saw it. It make you wish Christmas came more than once a year!

B005AUWY90|5.0|My son loved the first cars. He also enjoyed this one. He though is funny. To my surprise he acctuLy sat still the whole movie
B005869U6G|4.0|This is a very enjoyable set of songs that showcase Brandon Boyd's voice. There are a couple of songs where they thrash a little (\\"In the Company of Wolves\\" and \\"The Original\\"), but overall the guitar and drums are not dominant.<br /><br />On my first listen through, there is no big \\"stand out\\" song (like \\"Love Hurts\\" or \\"Drive\\" on other albums), but as a piece its very enjoyable.<br /><br />I feel a sense of relief when I go from this album and listen to some earlier song like \\"Megalomaniac\\" or \\"Nice to Know You,\\" but it strikes me that some other listeners might really like the more even tone of this new album. My girlfriend used to always skip forward or turn down the volume when the thrashing began (even on a song like \\"Echo\\"), which is a big part of why she didn't last (seriously), but she might have liked this album a lot more.<br /><br />I think Brandon's singing voice is always worth it, even if the instrumentation and lyrics have a little less punch. Maybe part of it is that Dirk Lance is gone?<br /><br />Don't listen to the grouches, though-- it's still a good album. Glad I bought it.
B002LMV7TS|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies to watch around Christmas. Jim Carey is very funny! My 5 year old was laughing so hard.. He loved the book and now he loves the movie
B005HSL626|5.0|this is by far one of the best games that you can get for a kindle fire. good graphics,real sounds, and oust awesome gameplay.
B002BU0DPE|1.0|Product came defective.  Could not get the gamecast to play through the headphones only chat.  Purchased for my son for Christmas.  Seems cheaply made.  Would not recommend.
B005HSL626|5.0|this app is extremely fun. My cousins and I got this app on our new kindle fires and we love it so much. we play it for fun a lot of the time and we compete with each other. It also gets more challenging as u move forward in the game but u can always restart to the beginning. I recommend this game for everyone
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this app because I has all types of fun levels that take a lot of thinking so if you like puzzles then this your game.
B002VECLVO|5.0|Visually and emotionally stunning.  At first I was not sure, but as it progressed it drew me in.  I craved a Hollywood happy ending, but it did not happen yet I still felt satisfied at the end.  Really a beautiful film.  A must see.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|This is a great starter game for the kindle fire. I have my KF for 3 days and i just got this game yesterday and i am very happy with it. Great graphics. It has the pin ball machine feel to it... I would recommend for all ages and all types of gamers
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|Could love be so simple?  Yeah, it takes crazy and stupid at times to make love work.  How many of us go through this doubt and instead of making up, walk away from those with whom we love and cherish.  But stupid pride steps in and destroys love. Oh, what a great movie about love and all the topsy turvy things we all go through. And to know that making up can be so right. What wrong with being happy?  More people should watch this movie and see mistakes can be corrected.  Go Steve and Julianne.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Such fun. Very responsive and challenging.  Have tried several products but this works best on my Kindle Fire. Hive it a try.
B004GHBQPG|5.0|We had planned on purchasing this CD for awhile; checked on Amazon and there is was!  We really enjoy it and are extremely happy that we finally have it.  It is the heart of Johnny Cash felt in every song.
1567184855|2.0|What I had expected is an academic study on the possibility of reincarnation like ones of Stevenson or Tucker. What I found instead is just a story without any justification.

0340203161|5.0|From page one James Clavell convincingly recreates a place in time you want to visit and stay. He defines characters with immense depth and carefully gives you a a vivid description of each place. The story arc is dynastic and at times tragic with each character possessing the determination to succeed and often frightening cunning.  A no excuses, classic read.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is simple and easy to use. Not complicated or fancy, but it's fun, just as the game was intended to be.
B005CGI3ZG|2.0|I was so excited to see the entire series for such a great price but you truly do get what you pay for. The packaging is minimal, which I did sort of expect. My main complant is that some of the episodes wont play. It just gets stuck on the copyright warnings, shows warning one then two then back to one then two again, continually. Its done this on at least one episode of most of the disks and I haven't quite found a way around the season 2 disk I'm currently on. I noticed in a couple season 1 episodes the lighting and coloring changed so much from camera to camera within the same scene. Most is minor considering the price but episodes not playing is a deal breaker. Anyone else experience this crazy loop phenomenon?
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|When I first got this book for my birthday my reaction was \\"I've been wanted to read this forever now.\\" But when i began to read I could not put it down. I read the entire book in a day! Then the next day I went to my school library and got the next book 'Catching Fire' then the next until i was finished with the series. I think this is the best series ever written. The author of this series was brillant in writting this. I wish i could have thought about this first! but i would never have been able to write that well. If you haven't read this yet then go and get this book NOW or you will be missing on the best series ever. you will not want to miss out on this series.   Katniss and Peete should always be together. I was worried when I was read this because i thought they might kill Peete and but im glad they didnt. Peeta and Katniss= FOREVER <3  READ THE SERIES!
0440178002|5.0|I believe this is the best book I've ever read.  And re-read.  I think I've read it 5 times now in the last 16 years--this is one of the books that has shaped my life.  I've been interested in the Japanese culture since elementary school; my best friend was Japanese (he moved back to Japan at the end of third grade).  I was 15 when curiosity made me pull this off my mother's bookshelf, and I couldn't put it down.  After reading it for the third or fourth time, it occurred to me to research the real history of this time period.  I was so surprised when it became clear that the characters in the novel represented actual people, and the events described really happened.  I've since read three or four books and a lots of articles on Japanese history.    Some reviewers gave this book one or two stars, disparaging it for being inaccurate historically.  Please allow me to put this inaccuracy into perspective.  American history, as known by most Americans, is also riddled with errors; it takes dedicated study beyond the high school level before such factual errors can be recognized, and the difference doesn't change the fundamental scope of the history as understood by most people already.  That's the sort of inaccuracies present here.    It's too bad that the rest of the books in the Asian Saga are so mediocre.  I read all of them up through half of Noble House before I gave up hoping that they would rise back up to the level of Shogun.  I get the feeling, from reading the books, that Clavell wasn't a naturally talented writer.  He loved Japanese history though, and spent a large portion of his life researching and writing Shogun, and it shows.  When it sold so well, his publisher pressured him for more, and so he produced the rest of the Asian Saga, which isn't nearly as refined and polished as the first book.  This is just a guess of course.  To summarize, this is a wonderful book.  It's well written, well researched, and epic in scope.  One of the few books I consider required reading for my friends.  If you haven't read it, I encourage you to get a hold of a copy as soon as you can.  You won't regret it.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|I'm using the Fiio E6 with an iPhone 4s and a pair of Ultimate Ears Triple.Fi 10 headphones (known to have well defined bass, but still have crisp highs). The combination is amazing. The bass is even punchier now, and the mids and highs are clearer.<br /><br />Sound<br />The E6 really improves bass response and over all clarity. The 1st equalizer setting is straight- and pretty much takes the existing signal and boosts it across the board. Like many have pointed out, the 2nd equalizer setting on this amp takes the bass and punches it way up - often sounding a bit muddy. I prefer the 3rd equalizer setting - the bass is still pronounced and elevated, but the mids and highs are kept crisp and clean. (The 4th setting is for high-output devices which I don't use.) The E6 comes with a dedicated cable to attach to any headphone jack and it works well. iPhone and iPod owners can also use an LOD cable (completely optional, sold separately for about $10) which provides a cleaner sound. (One thing to note in regards to iPhones and iPods: since these devices have a software-based equalizer built-in, you can further adjust your sound on top of the effects of the E6.)<br /><br />Headphones<br />Yes, you could use this with a pair of low-quality headphones, and the E6 will improve its sound. But the cost-to-benefit ratio favors buying quality headphones first, and then adding the E6 to the equation. This is because higher quality headphones have more  ability to channel  the sound that the E6 can deliver.<br /><br />Interface<br />The device has two physical controls: a volume rocker, and a power switch. The power switch also controls the equalizer functions, and it can be  locked down to prevent unwanted toggles. Yes, it sounds iffy, but in practice it does work. The blue power light indicates that the E6 is turned on, and there is another light that changes color to indicate the setting of the equalizer. The whole thing feels cheap for sure, but the E6 isn't really breaking anyone's bank at roughly $30.<br /><br />Charging<br />The poorly-written manual of the E6 (a tiny folded piece of paper) states that charging is done by connecting it to a computer's USB port. Charging the E6 takes about 2hours. Unfortunately, there is no indicator of how much charge is left at any given moment, and it has no auto-shut-off.  As a result, I always forget to manually turn it off. The manual states it lasts for 10 hours of continuous use, but I have never gotten that far without charging it myself.<br /><br />Portability<br />While the device is very small, walking around with it connected to my iPhone is less than elegant. I almost want to glue the E6 to the back of my iPhone case so that it doesn't flop around while in my pocket. Fiio includes two clips with the device to use with the lip of a pants pocket or shirt. For me, this doesn't work since taking the clip off to answer a phone call (I'm using an iPhone after all) annoys me.<br /><br />Final thoughts<br />Most other headphone amps are way above $30, so this is a real bargain. I like a lot of bass in my music, and the E6 provides that without breaking the bank (equalizer setting 3 is perfect for me). If you want more bass, or an over all cleaner sound (and you have decent headphones), the E6  is a good little amp to try, and it's cheap.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|I love action movies, thought the cast was great, saw it at the show and now have the DVD that I will watch more than once.
1592402690|4.0|I really found this book interesting and i do recommend it. YOu can find out all about it from other reviews. My only problem with this kind of book is that the writers generally fall in love with McCartney and view the rest as a pain. Same deal here..in fact he was so dismissive of Ringo that he was not even included on the cover. Just a shot of the 3 Beatles is shown...but as we know, there were actually 4 Beatles. He also disses Harrison wherever there is a reference to him which gets tedious after the 15th time. Of course he loves Paul..he even loved Pauls dog, his wife and every idea Paul ever came up with. Other than this however, the book is jammed with great insights to the mood of the sessions and dispells many Beatle myths...such as the one that Paul played the drum solo on Abbey Road...It really was Ringo after all..its very well written and fun to read. Highly recommended ..other than the annoying parts.
B000MQ54OY|5.0|Fast delivery and just what we ordered. Thanks for being so quick to get it out to us.  Our granddaughter really liked it.
B005HSL626|5.0|great for a free version!!!! full version is intense aswell!!! it is great on all products from smartphones to tablets!
B004EPYZUI|2.0|Beautifully detailed fantasy worlds and some pretty darned good acting in support of far too little story to justify all that work. But, man, as a sequence of cool images it's amazing.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|DON'TLIKE SPOILERS DON'T READ!!!!!!!!!!!  I fell in love with this series from the first line of The Hunger Games. I love the concept, because its so twisted and it makes me think and replay scenarios in my head. You are cast in to a world of bordering extremes, the Capitol with its futuristic technology and outlandish fashion and decadance; then you have the districts,many so poor that their technology has barely if actually evolved the use of electricity. I was engrossed in the development of Katniss' character. You really get the sense that she is carrying the weight of the world on her shoulders. The actually games gutwrenching and thrilling. This coupled with Katniss' \\"relationship\\" with Peeta, and the fallout from the end of the games leave you craving the second book.  As expected Catching Fire more than delivered. We got to see what it was like readjusting to life outside of the games. I thought Collins did a great job on the love triangle angle, but what she really did great at was in the building tension after Katniss' stunt with the poison berries in the last book. Setting the stage for the real spark that leads to the dissent of the districts. This and the start of the Quater Quell just fits so perfectly, because no matter how hard Katniss tries to take control and fix things they just get worse.  This brings us the Mockingjay, the last book. I previously wrote a review that I swiftly took down, because in all honesty I was dissappointed in this last book. I have to agree with some other reviewers that the character development was lacking. None of the character seemed like the characters we were used to from the first two books. I was put off by how much time Katniss' spent drugged up or injured, and the story dragged in many places. Some of the things, like the concept of the pods, confused me, and overall nothing seemed true to the first two books.   I was however receptive to finding out how  much of a puppet Katniss' really was even if she wasn'tso keen on it herself. I thought that fit perfectly in the plot. The fact that both sides of the war we using her for their own agenda will not be lost on the audience. However even knowing that she is just a pawn the ending of the third book was totally unaccpetable to me. I was completely fine wit the death of the \\"New\\" president considering how she manipulated Katniss, I was okay with the death of Prim (EVEN THOUGH IT WAS COMEPLETELY ABBRUPT, UNEXPECTED, AND REALLY DIDDN'T FIT), and I was also fine with the conclusion of the love triangle. What upset me the most is how Katniss just fades  into the background after the revolution is over and she kills the new, but equally manipulative president. They just lock her away in a hotel room for a few months until they have and complete her trial (WITHOUT HER THERE)and ship her off to exile in district 12. You would think someone so pivotal to the rebellion, no matter how much of a puppet she was would get the satisfation of aiding in her own trail, even if she hadn't wanted to defend herself. Katniss' last impression on the people of Panem was way to lackluster.   I LOVED THE FIRST TWO BOOKS. I'm not saying thethird doesn't have its good points too, but it takes a while to get to them, but in the end you are left with a sense of incompleteness.
B0053F042G|4.0|Another fine film about isolation and connection from the director of [[ASIN:B002T9H2MO Moon]]. Smart, tense, thoughtful. Demands more of the audience than your standard thriller.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|At the present time, where the \\"popular\\" crime and romance novelists produce at least one book (sometimes more) annually (and those often with co-authors or even second rate ghost writers, once they have made a name for themselves), books which are highly priced, poorly plotted and badly written, most of those in the fantasy genre stand out as shining examples of excellent crafting and impressive imagination - these authors are almost a breed apart. I found all of Joe Abercrombie's novels to be of a high standard, absorbing, superbly written and well worth reading - up there with the best!
B005KAH7QU|3.0|Some of the motivations and plot points are a little vague and many of the characters are drawn as caricatures for no apparent reason but still, a fun action movie with a bit of a twist, some cool set pieces, and a few really good action sequences. The Chemical Brothers soundtrack combined with several extended scenes of running give a [[ASIN:B000065R0C Run Lola Run]] feeling to the film occasionally.  You can check out Saoirse Ronan's survival skills in the earlier [[ASIN:B004C45AZU The Way Back]] as well.
091581112X|5.0|\\"Spiritual Growth\\" is a wonderful and natural conclusion to the \\"Living With Joy\\" trilogy.  Where the first book deals with centering and stabilizing yourself and the second book deals with evolving your attitudes and interactions with others, this third book deals with establishing and refining your connection to your higher self.  The end-of-chapter exercises are very much worth it, try them out!<br /><br />If you haven't read \\"Living With Joy\\" then definitely start with that first.  If you have and it clicked with you then I doubt you need too much convincing to read the other two!
B0048LPRCS|2.0|Pretentious and boring. The few potentially interesting ideas are submerged under prosaic drugs and sex and sophomoric stabs at profundity.
B0018OKR2I|5.0|A wonderfully written movie couldn't progress any other way with Palma at the helm.  With the explosive and climactic ending, there was only one way this was going to end.
B004HO6I4M|3.0|Unexceptional but well enough made light entertainment. Pretty decent voice acting with Jesse Eisenberg being the standout; whenever his character (Blu) spoke, I was completely engaged.
B005FITIIC|5.0|Simply excellent movie on the first hours of the financial crisis. It definitely ranks near or at the top of all finance films ever made.
B004UXUUDA|3.0|The bones of a good idea and a few very good actors make this much more watchable than it should be for such a poorly constructed story.

B004GGTAQE|5.0|This is a review of the Kindle edition.  It's really about 4,200 locations long, with the rest covering orders of battle.<br /><br />Otto Carius was a highly decorated soldier, being the 535th Wehrmacht soldier to receive the Oak Leaves to the Knight's Order of the Iron Cross and the Wound Badge in Gold for being wounded on five different occasions.  It's amazing he survived his serious wounds at the end.  He was a tanker, serving in Pz38(t)'s and Tigers.  The focus is on the Eastern front and his Tiger, as noted the main reason for the book being written.  His views of the 38 aren't a shock at all, if you have read about tanks of WWII.<br /><br />I'm a bit surprised that any reviewer would be surprised that the author defends his comrades.  Or has a view of the war that isn't the politically correct one.  Soldiers don't make policy, that's done by the politicians.  Anyone who thinks that any side in war gets out of it clean, doesn't know much about it.  My father was a Marine in Korea, and there were things that happened there that would have been called war crimes if we had lost.  Or read Dispatches of a Motorcycle Rider - as British troops shot French civilians for being \\"snipers\\" or \\"spies\\" in WWI.  History is written by the victors, though it's always good to read all sides.<br /><br />Carius explains why they fought, and the respect that they developed for \\"Ivan\\".  Interestingly, he credits accurate artillery fire to a rumor of female gunners.  The feeling of dread as the Russians keep coming and coming and that horrible winter of 1941 is clear to see.<br /><br />The conversation with Himmler is fascinating.<br /><br />He didn't think much of the Americans, or German civilians at the end.<br /><br />The picture are a great touch, and the English translations of the awards as well.<br /><br />The English translation could use a good scrubbing - or perhaps just the Kindle version.<br /><br />Easy to recommend if you have any interest in World War II.  The fact alone that he admits to losing it and \\"bugging out\\" during one battle is remarkable.able.
1577311523|5.0|One of the best spiritual books ever written, period.<br /><br />Every sentence is powerful and helps to deeper understand the spiritual aspect of yourself.<br /><br />The book is largely based on Zen principles - the best Zen book in my opinion (without even mentioning the word Zen).<br /><br />I suggest reading this book once a year to remind yourself that you are something more than your mind.<br /><br />I highly encourage people to read this book to change any aspect of their lives.<br /><br />- Michael Yap
B00008G7UJ|4.0|Maybe you don't like Shakespeare and vowed to only read it for class. Well, you will change your mind when you see this take on Romeo and Juliet with Leonardo DiCaprio. It is great! It is so modern day. The movie has romance, of course, but it also has guns, killings, sex, and 2 suicides. It does not disappoint on excitement. If you know the story of Romeo and Juliet but you think it is boring, you have to see this movie. It is very close to the Shakespearean play but it is so modern day. I watched the movie 3 times because it is so visual you could easily miss something. I think Shakespeare would enjoy watching what Baz Luhrmann (Director)has done with his play for the young readers today!

Song after song is first-rate. The 15 songs create a wonderful mood, gloomy with a sense of doom. I love this and am disappointed that so many reviewers, while praising the music appropriately, then mark the Cd down to 4 or fewer stars because of what isn't here. This Cd deserves to be judged upon what it contains and not what could have been included!

1419702203|4.0|As a companion to Martin Scorsese's exceptional documentary on George Harrison's life, Living in the Material World provides an exceptional, personal and professional glimpse into the life/beliefs of Harrison. Consisting of photos (many of which Harrison took himself or collected)from Harrison's childhood through to his first U.S. visit (a year before The Beatles broke in the U.S.)through his years with the band and covering his \\"retirement\\", come back and final years, the book provides a mini-guide through Harrison's life and features comments from friends, collaboratories, contemporaries, his former Beatle bandmates.<br /><br />The book is handsomely packaged with great photos on heavy nice quality paper and the text big and bold. Those looking for a biography need to look elsewhere because this really only gives us a small glimpse of George's life in pictures and is designed to compliment Scorsese's documentary.<br /><br />This is an exceptionally good book. Why not five stars? I would have liked a bigger discussion of Harrison's music, growth as a songwriter and his change and growing confidence as a performer/singer with time as well as a bit more of a balanced look at Harrison's flaws and strengths. Granted this is a companion book to a two part documentary BUT this may be the only experience some people have reading and learning about Harrison.<br /><br />Still, I'd recommend this because it has a huge archive of previously unpublished photos, documents and fascinating comments (for example the ace guitarist Gary Moore has some fascinating insight in Harrison's guitar playing technique and his approach to slide playing).<br /><br />Recommended.

1419702238|5.0|Cabin Fever is for my 8 and 10 year old. Excellent book and I have also read the entire series. This one may be the funniest book in series. Jeff Kinney somehow knows how to keep readers involved and he understands how to tell a story that will keep people interested. He is an excellent writer as well as web designer as his website poptropica is also a great site for kids. One of few my kids are allowed to go to. I only hope Mr Kinney continues to write for years as I enjoy his writing
B005974CDU|5.0|I have every Dreamtheater album and with most of them I find there are 2-3 songs I really enjoy and then a bunch I may listen two every blue moon.  I really could care less who is drumming for them, I just enjoy there style of music and it has continued with this album.  This album as a whole however is very solid, many of the songs I find I enjoy more and more and a few standout tracks I listen to quite regularly.  I usually plug it in when I'm at the gym and is a great pseudo prog/metal album that doesn't scream about some kid getting screwed by who knows what or killing people with chain saws.  There is a christian undertone, kinda blatant on some tracks, but if you have listened to this band its evident on many of their albums.  The musicianship is top notch, however some of their tracks seem to be cursed with 'filler' riffs that may have benefited the songs by removing a minute or so of them.  But, overall, very very solid DT album.  I think I like this one the best since Six Degrees came out.  Highly recommended.

B004XJHBCE|4.0|Folder Organizer not only lets you organize your apps into folders with labels. It also lets you create shortcuts to those folders or display them with widgets.  It makes it easy to find labeled apps too. Titanium Backup (and other apps) can use the folder organizer labels too.  My only gripe here is that it does not find icons out of anything other than apps or Folder Organizer icon packs. If it could use Launcher theme icons (ADW, Go, LauncherPro) it would be a 5 star app.
B0064W63D6|4.0|I loved these stories in the trade paperback form, and I really looked forward to them on the Kindle Fire. The new Kindle Fire Comics with the pop-out panels are a surprisingly nice way to read comics; and I thought Watchmen in this format was a masterpiece. But I also knew Watchmen had a significant advantage in this regard: the entire series was drawn with an extremely regular panel grid, with only rare deviations. So pop-up rectangular panels suited it well. I expected the format to be more challenging for something with more panel variety -- especially something as downright experimental as Sandman.  So I expected some of the pop-out choices to be difficult. I was ready to tolerate some unusual choices. And for the most part, they handled it well. They did a nice job with challenging panels like wide or tall panels with dialog balloons in many places. They even did an OK job with some of the rotated panels.  But in a few places, they just plain got it wrong. In some places they got the dialog order wrong, so an response pops out before the statement that prompted it. And in a few cases, they missed a dialog balloon entirely; and the only way I could read it was to switch to page mode.  So I knocked off a star for the imperfections. I hope DC takes the time to fix these after the mad rush of releasing 100 Kindle Fire Comics at once.
B005VR9328|5.0|As far as the album, it's the Roots' best since Things Fall Apart, and may be their best ever. A concept album based on the life of a fictional character (Redford Stevens) who has chosen a path which usually leads to an abbreviated ending, the songs are snapshots retrospectively chronicling the demise of a human being. This, in a year celebrated by the nauseating materialism of watching the throne or Drake's ego-centric Kayne West derivative cadence. The Roots play counter and get into the mind of someone who is influenced by these exact factors and although their previous efforts have usually revolved around the ethos of the underprivileged, this is their Magnum Opus.  If the HBO series \\"The Wire\\" had a soundtrack, this would be it.  On first listen it seems like a \\"typical\\" Roots album, but after 15-20 listens, I am finally getting it.  Easily the finest hip-hop album of the year in my opinion and a contender for album of the year in any category (and I listen to everything) in 2011.  The Roots show and prove that they are some of the few remaining beacons of light in accessible hip-hop, thank you, thank you, thank you!  And only $3.99 for the download? Cop it, quick.

B0036T31YY|5.0|This movie started a bit slow. A group of people go sailing, get caught in a mysterious storm, and take refuge in a passing ship that seems to be deserted. Or is it? I was expecting a typical haunted ship story from that point. But I didn't get that. What I got was a twisted story that kept me hooked until the end.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie a lot.

B000FCKGPC|2.0|This book is one I dove into eagerly after what I consider the best book in the five part series. To my terror book 4 and 5 make it clear that George's creation has somehow spiraled out of control.<br /><br />The Prologue is the worst out of any of the 5 books, as befits the worst book in the series. It is a fine example of the starting-but-not-finishing trends book 4 and 5 thrive off of. The only reference to the prologue again is in one of the equally bad Samwell chapters.<br /><br />This is the first book in the series where you could easily just read a flash card with a sentence on it in place of a chapter and be thankful for it. Samwell's entire arc could be skipped, or shortened. Jon already has a chapter in ADWD that details the first part, and the second part could be fulfilled in a single Sam chapter in ADWD or whenever he becomes relevant in the next books.<br /><br />Brienne could be summarized as wandering around the country before clearly surviving a terrible cliffhanger(which by the way, wont be answered in the next book).<br /><br />The Dornish and Ironmen stuff is alright. I wasn't even offended by it because it was better than Brienne, Sam, or the excess of Cersei chapters(which I don't mind, but in moderation).<br /><br />Arya has graduated to being a worthless character from one of the best, and will happily remain like that well into the next installment. Its clear George knew what he wanted to do with her but had no idea how to get there after book one, but this is the first time it is downright painful.<br /><br />Sansa is alright, but suffers largely from George's now redundant formula of tons of description followed by an interesting last page or paragraph. Where she is now just isn't super interesting, the chapter about her descent with the boy lord is probably the first time I straight up skimmed a chapter in this series of thousands of pages. Basically all it amounts to is \\"littlefinger is clever\\" \\"Sansas is growing\\" \\"and holy crap after the last chapter in SOS I expected better\\".<br /><br />Jaime, one of my favorites is pretty stagnant here, but arguably goes through the most believable growth.<br /><br />George still writes great, but it is so clunky and bogged up that it makes the crappy POV's unbearable and the good ones tedious. To demonstrate, in AGOT Cats journey to Kings landing was not several chapters. It happened hastily because there was an end goal to be reached, and the journey was not a significant element. However in a feast for crows almost EVERYONE is stuck in the stasis of a journey(or standing around).<br />Imagine if AGOT spent 3 chapters for the trips of Cat to and from Kings Landing, and that when the Khalasar ventured to their conquests the journey was documented. That on the way south from Winterfell the trip before and after the Joffery incident were written in detail. You get the idea.<br />These meaningless journeys prefaced by cliffhanger endings aren't needed in the first books because there IS a destination. Martin knew where we were going and was excited to get there. That is the core problem with the plot and pacing of the series.<br /><br />As far as the main flaw in the writing formula, the whole description, description, description, CLIFFHANGER routine is seriously getting old in conjunction with the previously mentioned problem. There are cliffhangers just for the sake of being cliffhangers, so much to the point that nothing happens in the meat of the chapters. I kid you not, only about two chapters have anything truly interesting happen before the last paragraph.<br /><br />The final problem and the most infuriating is that every book(although the first 3 could justify it and had some big event or resolution) builds up, and leaves a plethora of cliffhangers. In 1 and 2 especially it was done well enough that you could imagine just enough and smile at what you thought might happen, but in 4 and 5 it all just feels random.<br /><br />The worst part about this bookis that the next one suffers the same problems and NONE of the cliffhangers from this book are resolved, instead countless more spring up.is that the next one suffers the same problems and NONE of the cliffhangers from this book are resolved, instead countless more spring up.

0553801473|2.0|After finishing the slow trainwreck that was A Feast For Crows which immediately followed three of the best fantasy books I have ever read, I was hopeful to see the series get back to its roots. I understood that due to the damn dragons a time skip or period of danys being off screen would be needed. What I didn't know was that George would handle it in the worst way possible. Except in Theon's case he seems to be ignorant to when letting a character linger in shadows is appropriate and when it is not.<br /><br /> Brienne for example, brought us nothing but a cliffhanger in book 4, when she could have gone without a POV, or two chapters max.<br />In Dance the number of pointless chapters is disgusting.<br />Surely the master who wrote Game of Thrones could nestle Tyrion into the story again in an interesting way? But all of his chapters amount to nothing and I confess I skimmed the later half of them. He went from the best character in the series and some of fiction to being annoying and negligible.<br />Aegon came out of nowhere, and while Griff is interesting his arrival was unwelcome amongst so many stale POV's.<br />Arya has fallen from grace like Tyrion and for two books has been a bore. All we needed was a chapter of her entering training, and then when we see her when training is done a brief recap, instead she pollutes countless pages in both books.<br />Dany is so painstaking, only around 4 chapters were passable. The rest were atrocious bores.<br />Jon had a strong intro in the book, but it deteriorates when time is spent on irrelevant aspects of the NW, and his POV ends with what was foretold at the beginning of the arc biting him in the ass, with an obvious cliffhanger.<br />I confess I wanted to see frankengregor defend Cersei in this book, but instead we get her long drawn out suffering. But I wont say that is bad.<br />Victarion is a beast but accomplishes nothing and didn't need to be included as such.<br />Asha is annoying at this point and I had hoped she died when we first saw her in this book.<br />Bran has been in a similar boat to Arya, though his journey has been long and dragged out. Luckily this book gets him to his goal in some of the more interesting chapters. But where his character will go is unclear and has been for 5000 pages. I don't think GRRM knows himself.<br />Quentyn is the funniest character, due to the fact he was such a silly addition to the story. I didn't know why he had come in and just wished he would die. His \\"Oh\\" thought as he got roasted was actually awesome and made his few chapters ultimately hilarious, despite being wastes of paper.<br /><br />I can't say it was all bad.<br />The prologue was amazing, and if the others actually did something in the book it would have been an incredible set up and tone setter. Much better than AFFC's garbage intro, to which I am also convinced George created without a reason. But I digress.<br />Davos is still pretty cool and meets some neat people.<br />Theon out of nowhere is the best POV in the story, though even he could have done with one less chapter.<br />Melisandre as a POV made me grin, though its unfortunate it goes nowhere.<br />Barristan is awesome too, but Mereen feels so much like a filler area I am hard pressed to care.<br />The epilogue is great, except that it makes me yearn for another installment, a real one. Which may never come.<br /><br />George still writes great, but it is so clunky and bogged up that it makes the crappy POV's unbearable and the good ones tedious.

B003EYVXUU|5.0|No-spoilers review of \\"Let me In\\":<br /><br />I'm going to help you decide whether you want to get this DVD, regardless of what I think of it. I will do so without telling you what happens.<br /><br />I recommended this to a friend at church in passing. Later he saw my wife and asked her what it was about. She said \\"It's a vampire movie.\\" He said \\"That's all I need to know.\\"<br /><br />This guy is a college professor, so he's pretty smart--and statistically he'd probably be right, given what most \\"vampire movies\\" are like. And yes, it is a vampire movie. But it's so different from most other vampire movies that leaving it at that is really misleading.<br /><br />For one thing, most vampire movies are either romantic PG-13 Romeo and Julietty things aimed at 15 year old girls (of all ages), or blood-drenched R-rated splatterfests aimed at teenaged boys (of all ages).<br /><br />This is neither. Hence the disgusted one-star reviews here by folks looking for one or the other--and who always assume the director was trying to make one or the other but was just too dumb to do so. Pretty funny, really--the arrogance of the mediocre.<br /><br />Another source of misleadingment is the fact that this stars the same actress who played Hit Girl in \\"[[ASIN:B002ZG9846 Kick-Ass (Three-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)]]\\", Chloë Grace Moretz. In that film she plays an ultraviolent vigilante psycho killer (and does most of her own stunts BTW). But in \\"Hugo,\\" which came out recently, she plays a bookish, sunny, nonviolent girl. It's called acting. And Moretz has no interest in being typecast, so you can't use her being in a movie to conclude anything about a movie except that it will probably be different from the normal fare in some way. You can expect her to do her own stunts mostly--she trained for six months for her role in \\"Kickass\\" and now may be physically the strongest, most agile actress in her age range.<br /><br />She is one reason to see \\"Let me in.\\" She and Hailee Steinfeld ([[ASIN:B003UESJME True Grit]] are both serious about acting. And both, in their early teens, are doing mostly adult-oriented movies. Moretz has the added advantage of being destined to be the next Scarlett Johansson in a number of ways--looks, intelligence, gravitas and an arresting appearance--not just pretty.<br /><br />I think Moretz wanted this role because it gave her the opportunity to do a layered performance. There's a scene where her character says \\"I'm stronger than you think I am.\\" The other teen actresses who auditioned for the role said it as a brag, smiling smugly as they did so. Moretz stated it matter-of-factly, as a piece of information Owen needed to know, but with a whiff of great sadness, since that strength is part and parcel of what's different about her that means she will never be able to have a normal life. To grow up. To have a family. To not have to live on the run forever. So she's not bragging about her strength, because she's hundreds of years past thinking it was Kool--if she ever did.<br /><br />Moretz put something into the character all those other beautiful, trained, skilled actresses didn't. She had a 360° view of Abby, while the others did not.<br /><br />You'll like this movie if you like what Moretz liked about the script, the project. It's almost like a cross between one of those Sundance Festival movies and a Hollywood movie. It has the feel of a European art film with just a tad more vividness--a bit sparklier special effects, music, high-voltage talent (like the great character actor Richard Jenkins as Abby's gofer).<br /><br />That's no surprise because it's adapted from the Swedish novel \\"[[ASIN:B002YICW7U Let the Right One In: A Novel (Paperback)]] and the Swedish movie [[ASIN:B001MYIXAC Let The Right One In]].<br /><br />So why not just see the original movie? Well, as it happens, I did see it first--and loved it. And not just me. The Rottentomatoes website aggregates critics' reviews and ratings, and the average of the 166 reviews it lists was a whopping 98%, while 44,000 viewers rated it an average of 90%. For \\"Let Me In\\" 205 critics gave it an average rating of a still very respectable 89% while 55,000 site viewers gave it 74%.<br /><br />I think the lower average audience rating for \\"Let Me In\\" stemmed from misplaced loyalty to \\"Let the right One In.\\" As if you have to choose one or the other. Team Abby or Team Eli. I don't know why this is, though. I've seen at least a dozen versions of Hamlet, and many bring something unique to the original play. Same here. An expert film critic could list a dozen aspects to each film that are better than the way the same aspect is executed in the other one.<br /><br />And of course some people are strongly biased towards or against Hollywood. If you have a strong bias, you already know which you'll want to see. If you're like me you'll want to see both. I own both movies, and both have stuck with me, while most movies don't. Each, in its own way, is truly haunting.<br /><br />Both films are vampire films that make most other vampire films seem juvenile, which is ironic, since the characters in \\"Let me in\\"/\\"Let the right one in\\" are juveniles.<br /><br />In some ways the films are meditations on what it would be like to be a vampire, both for better and for worse; and metaphorically, for what it's like to be different from others in ways that make you superior in some ways, yet doomed to never get to experience the humble delights of ordinary human existence, and in that sense it's a study of normal human existence by seeing what it would be like to not have that.<br /><br />\\"Let Me In\\" definitely has a Hollywood flavor compared to the Swedish model. The vampire is prettier, the music more pervasive, the violence violenter, the landscape even bleaker (though not in all respects). Some find these differences extremely annoying. But I showed \\"Let Me In\\" to a pair of Russian intellectuals I know who had not seen the Swedish film or read the book, and they loved it. I don't know how they would have reacted if they'd seen \\"Let the Right One In\\" first, but I think it's significant that without that comparison they found \\"Let Me In\\" to be a real quality film.<br /><br />There's a plus to seeing both versions--it's like seeing a story from the viewpoints of different characters, though both movies take third party Point of View.<br />But the emphases are distinct. Even where both films show the same scene it feels different. Don't believe reviewers here who say this is a shot for shot remake of the Swedish original. That just means they weren't looking closely enough.<br /><br />One kind of person who won't like either movie is Good Guys vs. Bad Guys kind of people--people who think if you show the human side of the villain you're somehow excusing the villain's villainy. People like the fictional Inspector Javert in [[ASIN:B00110K62U Les Miserables: The 10th Anniversary Dream Cast in Concert at London's Royal Albert Hall]]--who was so unhinged by the escaped prisoner Jean Valjean's sparing his life that he committed suicide.<br /><br />The vampires in these movies didn't ask to be vampires, don't want to be vampires, and would stop being vampires if there was a way out other than self-annihilation. And even if you don't normally watch vampire movies or horror movies you may want to watch this one. It's really more suspense than horror--a bit like Alfred Hitchcock.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is a serious movie in a genre that's rarely serious. To put it another way, it's a serious take on a non-serious genre. It doesn't ask you to believe in vampires--only that if they existed, their existences would be as fraught and painful and unromantic as they're portrayed here.<br /><br />SPOILERS FOLLOW--DON'T READ ON IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN OR READ THE BOOK OR ONE OF THE FILMS<br /><br /> Suppose you've seen \\"Let the Right One In\\" or read the book, which the Swedish movie hews to more closely.<br /><br />If youexpect the movie to copy the book, neither movie will please you, but the Swedish version will displease you less.<br /><br />The critics generally agree that \\"Let Me In\\" is a fine movie, while \\"Let the Right One In\\" verges on greatness.<br /><br />I love both and I see why the critics rate the Swedish version a tad higher--but there's one plot essential where the Swedish version is truer to the novel but falser to the audience. In the book and the Swedish movie, Eli is actually a castrated boy in drag, basically. In the American version Abby is a girl period. I think the Swedish original is trying to have it both ways, though, by casting a girl (Lina Leandersson) in the part--and not just a girl, but a girl who looks very much like a girl, and who acts like a girl. So while the Swedish version is technically truer to the novel, (a) I'm not seeing the movie as a visualization of the novel, and (b) the American version is more honest. It has a girl play a girl at least. If the Swedish movie had cast a boy to play Eli(as), that would have been true to the book, though it would have had far fewer viewers, including me. I'm glad neither movie was true to the book, frankly.<br /><br />I wouldn't have disapproved of Eli being a boy in the movie, but I probably wouldn't have chosen to watch it either. And Eli/Abby's social isolation and disinterest in sex have nothing to do with Eli/Abby's gender, but rather by her age (12) and need to be an unwilling serial killer, which can be quite a buzz kill. So the rest of the story doesn't need this character to be a boy for the rest of the story to make sense.<br /><br />And apart from this element, there are parts of the American movie that are better than the Swedish original, even though I grant that the reverse is also true (especially how the woman dies in the Swedish version, and how Eli spares the life of one kid in the pool scene, the visual of Eli scaling the side of the hospital, and the visual of what happens to Eli when (s)he enters a home without permission). But when Owen asks Abby what is she if she's not a girl, Abby says \\"I'm nothing,\\" while Eli just stares at him with those Japanese anime character huge eyes. Abby's response is more profound, and her being a girl makes the reason for her saying \\"I'm nothing\\" deeper--you don't need gender bending to feel isolated if you're a vampire. Honest. Being a vampire is plenty!<br /><br />Also, it's absolutely fascinating to see Chloë Grace Moretz' rendition of Abby/Eli. She didn't see the Swedish movie or read the novel before making the movie, so this is her independent interpretation (ditto the boy). It's really different from Leandersson's, yet both performances are deep--truly impressive from actors so young. And the difference in their appearances contribute to making the role different.<br /><br />So instead of trying to decide which is better--which here is like asking if a pear is better than bacon--I love having two unique interpretations of a fine story to watch.<br /><br />The negative reviews of \\"Let Me In\\" by \\"Let the Right One In\\" fans--and vice versa--show that there's a Team Abby and a Team Eli...and Team Can't We All Just Get Along? which I belong to. You probably won't enjoy \\"Let me in\\" if you regard every difference as automatically inferior, and every similarity as automatically a needless copy, and if you feel superior to Hollywood movies in general.<br /><br />I should point out that both films end the same way, so it's not like they tacked one of those happy Hollywood fantasy endings onto this story. And I should add that the author of the book has endorsed both versions. That doesn't prove both versions are good, but it does cast an interesting light on those who disparage \\"Let Me In\\" because they think it betrays the book.<br /><br />I haven't addressed the subtitle issue because dubbing is unacceptable to me in all circumstances (except when used for humorous effect), and anyone who has the sensitivity to enjoy \\"Let the Right One In\\" must be able to deal with subtitles.<br /><br />You'll like \\"Let Me In\\" alongside \\"Let the Right One In\\" especially if you're a serious filmgoer and like to see, for example, different versions of Shakespeare plays.<br /><br />Lastly, I think people on Team Eli believe that the American version is stealing sales from the Swedish original. Personally I'd argue that the exact opposite is true. \\"Let Me In\\" will garner viewers who wouldn't see the Swedish original anyway because they don't like subtitles and dubbing, and/or because they prefer more American production values and style, as I described in the first part of this review. At the same time a certain % of \\"Let Me In\\" viewers will then want to see how the Swedish version did it, because it's a good enough story to justify multiple interpretations.<br /><br />Wouldn't it be interesting to see how Hayao Miyazaki would interpret this story as an animated film? I think it would be magnificent, given how wonderful [[ASIN:B00005JLEU Spirited Away]] is...I love both and I see why the critics rate the Swedish version a tad higher--but there's one plot essential where the Swedish version is truer to the novel but falser to the audience.

B005FVA63A|3.0|My wife went to considerable effort to research, save for and procure this for me for Christmas. I hoped she might, but she is so frugal that I didn't really expect it. What a great surprise! So fun to open and discover all the nooks and crannies of this box set. The magnets on the top are a fun touch. I'm tempted to use them on the refrigerator, but probably wont. Don't want to impair the collectors edition status of the box by losing one of the tiles.<br /><br />Oh yes, the box. All is not well with this product. The issue is well documented here and elsewhere - the box is coming apart on two sides. Is Principle Management listening? Are you going to address this? Which is more important, quality or profitability? Will McGuinness's bottom line view win out over the commitment to quality espoused by the band? Especially you Larry. Your reputation as the force for quality in musical expression is well known. Does it still extend to the full product experience like it has in the past? Efforts to resolve fan club ticket sales issues come to mind. You have an opportunity to make this right as well.<br /><br />How much would it cost? $20K to redesign the box, $10 BOM cost, $15 shipping, 10,000 units = $270K. Not an insignificant amount to be sure, but a worthwhile investment in your fans and in your reputation.<br /><br />It may not make financial sense to invest your resources in a relatively small percentage of fans, but we're the loyal, vocal segment. In a time where you are reported to be searching your souls to know the path forward and questioning your broader relevance, I suggest you take care of your base.<br /><br />In summary: The content of this box is jaw-dropping great. The packaging is unacceptable.

0439023483|4.0|I am still pretty new to the Dystopian genre in YA Literature.  This has been by choice.  But now after reading a few Dystopian novels I am asking myself \\"Why did I wait? What was I afraid of?\\" If all Dystopian books are written like this then my fears will vanish!<br /><br />As many other fellow reviewers have stated, The Hunger Games is very very addictive.  I cannot quite put my finger on why, but you immediately become invested in the book, the plot and the characters.  You automatically feel a connection to each character, even beyond Katniss, through Katniss' own emotions for them.  Katniss lives within the poorest and dirtiest of all 12 Districts.  She is forced to hunt outside of District 12 and takes constant risks to make sure that her mother and sister do not starve to death (something that is quite common in District 12).  Her ally in this is Gale.  At first I thought Gale and Katniss made the perfect couple, understanding each other so clearly.  That is until she meets Peeta after volunteering to take her sister's place in the Hunger Games.<br /><br />The relationship between Katniss and Peeta has you constantly guessing - not only about Katniss' feelings for Peeta and Peeta's for Katniss but also Peeta's intentions and role in the Game.  Its through the Game that Katniss' real strengths really shine.  And of course we cannot forget Peeta's feelings and role.<br /><br />Again, I cannot quite put my finger on why this book was so addictive.  I found the character development quite wonderful and Suzanne Collins' plot lines unique and interesting.  Once you step back from this book you find that there are many layers to not only the plot but to the characters as well.  In terms of quickness, this is easily a novel you could have read and an audiobook to listen to in one day.  I am definitely looking forward to picking up the sequel!
B006O5XYWG|5.0|This movie is a joy from start to finish. The script, is good, the pacing is good, the special effects are superb. I especially love the expressions of Caesar . . .

John Lithgow was exceptional in his role as a broken man and a man renewed.  Highly recommended.

B004IY6API|5.0|Stained Class is without a doubt the most epic Priest album ever and the one that spawned a new wave of metal into the world and launched thousands of bands that attempted to follow.    Stained Class was my first experience with Judas Priest, and remains my favorite till this day. I suppose it was because it's so different from any thing else in 1978. Here was a new kind of metal attack, twin guitars taking turns leading and riffing some of the best stuff that my young 22 year old ears had heard, and Rob Halfords vocals what range this guy had, still one of the most recognized in the bussiness today, and the whole thing built upon a foundation of double bass drums and killer bass.    This album is just full of power! I had been looking to replace my worn copy, and this one is a hard Priest to find in any record store retro or new. People just seem to not let go of it. When I found a new copy still wrapped at my local record store today I yelled out in joy. My best friend and store manager came running yelling \\" what did you find\\"? I smiling showed it to him and he knew how long I had been searching but had no idea that this copy had come in. While the Priest went on to become the top metal band in the world and release several other big time albums that I own and cherish, this one is means alot more to me than any of the others.    Stained Glass is just so powerfull, in my opinion from begining to end. Another reviewer didnt have much good to say about the Song Saints in Hell. Let me tell ya this is one of the greatest Priest songs ever in my opinion, how could anyone not like this song, come on the Saints take the battle into Hell and defeat the demons to save mankind, and talk about rocking the house down.    I just have to say that Saints in Hell is one reason I have to have this cd, but again every thing on this baby burns and has allways defined to me what Judas Priest is. After all it was the album that brought the Priest to light in the world and launched them to become one of the biggest metal acts ever. Its hard to say that as good as British Steel, Screaming for Vengence, Point of Entry, and one or two more are, that Stained Glass is Judas Priest at their very best. Stained Glass is one of the albums that launched some of the most heralded American metal bands in the late 70s and particulary in the early eighties. The big record companies just werent ready for what was coming and many bands like The Rods , Riot and many others just slid under the radar.    Stained Glass should be a classic, heck maybe it already is being that a used copy is so hard to find these days. If you havent heard it you need to. If youve heard it and dont have it then you know you need it. This remastered copy with bonus tracks is the way to go too. Some good extra stuff here.

B0060V1WJ6|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />  'Crazy, Stupid, Love' is billed as a romantic comedy but ends up much more as a sentimental romance. The inciting incident comes up quite quickly: Wife Emily Weaver (Julianne Moore) announces she wants out of her 25 year marriage to husband Cal (Steve Carrell), after revealing that she's been having an affair with a colleague at work. It's a poorly written scene as Cal meekly acquiesces to Emily's demand and we never really find out why she's so dissatisfied in the first place.<br /><br />  After some rather long-winded scenes where Cal drowns his sorrows in drink at a local bar, bemoaning his fate as a marriage castaway, he finally meets Jacob Palmer (Ryan Gosling) and we break into the second act of the story. Jacob is a womanizer, a 'player' of great skill, if you will, who takes pity on Cal and decides to teach him how to pick up women. This is perhaps the best and most amusing part of the movie where Jacob first picks out a new wardrobe for Cal and then orders him to watch him in action, as he seduces women step-by-step. At first Cal is resistant but soon learns how to imitate Jacob's every line and he ends up bedding nine women, one of whom happens to be Kate, the public school teacher of Cal's son Robbie, played by Marisa Tomei. Unfortunately, Kate is one of Tomei's least likable roles in awhile, as she is an over the top nymphomaniac, who ends up continually giving Cal the finger later in the story, for bedding her and then leaving her high and dry.<br /><br />  Meanwhile, other ditsy complications accrue. Robbie becomes obsessed with he and his sister's babysitter, Jessica, who in turn develops a crush on Cal. There's a rather unfunny bit where Jessica, upon the advice of a seductive high school student rival, takes nude pictures of herself with the plan of sending them to Cal, only to have them fall, way too easily, into the hands of her hot head father. Even worse is the obnoxious infatuation that festers in Robbie throughout the film. How much can an audience take of a 13 year old's creepy obsession that only abates at just about the final scene of the movie?<br /><br />  'Crazy, Stupid, Love' becomes a lot less 'crazy' in the second half, more stupid and pours on the 'love', a little too thick. It seems that the cool Jacob character turns into a cream puff when he falls for Hannah, who happens to be the adult daughter of Emily and Cal. There are virtually no clues (except for Cal's reference early in the narrative, to 'Nana', Hannah's childhood appellation), so the big 'twist' feels forced and unearned, on the part of the film's scenarists. Now the tables are turned and Jacob is turning to Cal for 'advice' on how to handle relationships. Cal's insecurity and goofiness is a now a badge of honor, as he can show Jacob how to 'be himself'.<br /><br />  While Cal wants to cut off all ties with Jacob, now that he's fallen for his daughter, it doesn't take long before an extra dose of 'love', becomes the more prominent moniker in 'Crazy, Stupid, Love'. Yes, Cal soon sees the light and is willing to embrace ex-bad boy Jacob, as his new, potential son-in-law. He interrupts Robbie's speech as Salutatorian of the school, who is in the middle of a put down about true love, due to his rejection by Jessica. Cal recounts his courtship of Emily, affirming his love for her. After the graduation ceremony, Cal hands Robbie the nude photos of Jessica, as his 'consolation prize'. Robbie agrees to call off his stalking of Jessica, by shaking her hand and promising to look her up only once he finally begins to look more like his Dad in a few years. As if we couldn't predict it, Cal and Emily are seen reminiscing about the events of the past year and the implication is of course, that they soon will be back together.<br /><br />  Even more disappointing than the transformation of bad boy Jacob into into a virtual milquetoast, Julianne Moore is saddled with the weakest role in the film. We learn little about Emily throughout the film--and the pseudo-romantic subplot involving the dull office colleague, David Lindhagen (Kevin Bacon), proves to be a subplot that goes nowhere.<br /><br />  'Crazy, Stupid, Love' is occasionally amusing, especially when Carrell and Gosling face off in the first half. But by the denouement, we're back in the realm of the predictable, and even worse: an egregious, sentimental, happy-ending. Try this once but see it a second time at your own peril!pseudo-romantic subplot involving the dull office colleague, David Lindhagen (Kevin Bacon), proves to be a subplot that goes nowhere.

B004ULNJIU|4.0|Like many people, I've been a Jason Statham fan since the Transporter, so if you like Statham's other movies, you'll probably like this movie, though this is a little more gritty and less humorous than the Transporter or Crank.  The plot here is fairly formulaic - a serial killer is targetting police officers in a large metropolitan area.  Based on information provided by a police informant, Statham's character is provided with a suspect and Statham's character soon figures out which officers are being targetted and why, but can't prove anything.  Eventually the police set a trap and deal with him.  One sub-plot includes a policewoman who was undercover and became a junkie and is now back on the forece after getting out of rehab.  However, as the pressure mounts,she starts using again. Another sublot is a rivalry between the police who are responsible for the high-end neighborhoods and those who are responsible for the seedier parts of London.  The plot is fairly formulaic and derivative of other dramas, with bits from Dirty Harry, Nighthawks, and other police dramas thrown in.  The interesting part is that the story is based in London, so we get a bit of a UK perspective.  The slang and the accents are difficult to follow and I strongly suggest viewing with the subtitles on.
0385344325|4.0|I was a little disappointed with the last 2 Reacher books, but I was not disappointed with The Affair.  Lee Child does spend a little too much time on narrative, e.g. describing Reacher's thought process, but that's OK. I like how this book goes back in time and covers how Reacher ended his career in the Army. This story kept me guessing for the reason of the killings in a small rural town.  And how the problem was resolved was typical Reacher.  Reacher fans should not be disappointed with this book.  It was a good read.
B004P4S4NM|3.0|Adele's always been an ok singer, nothing to spectacular. I was never really a fan of her first album 19, but I did like the song \\"Rolling In Deep\\". I also really like the indie/down home style of the videos and songs. I decided to buy the album. While it's not my favorite album, it's propably the best pop album of the year. It's classy, yet catchy and cute. Rumor has it is a great throw back jam, and It reminds me of something I'd hear on an oldies radio station. The fact that Adele is singing and writing her own music scores points in my book. Fire in The Rain is my favorite track; I more like the piano melody more than anything else (I think most people will enjoy that track). People should defiantly buy and support this album; people will enjoy it.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|since using this alarm clock I very rarely have fallen back to sleep only to be super late, since I can't just turn it off! with the right settings it's sure to wake you up and keep you waking back up. :)
031261246X|2.0|This was a recommendation, but it turned out to be a disappointment. The plot is far fetched, too many accidental encounters, board-carton personage. I expect more from a Microsoft techie.
1451627289|5.0|the best book I have read this year.....my husband is now reading it and enjoying also.  being raised in the 50s and 60s so many things really hit home....the saddle shoes, the music references, the slang, the Lindy Hop dance, so many things.....as well as it was extraordinarily written by Stephen King.....his best
B005BQTUVI|4.0|This is a great old fashioned monster movie. The directors cut is superior to the original theatrical version in many ways. If you enjoyed movies such as Relic or Species, give this movie a chance to show you how they could have looked if it was made by someone who cared or understood about the genre.
1451648537|5.0|Our heroes always are imperfect and many die young.  Jobs certainly is one. While the book is about Jobs, it is more than about him.  Isaacson captures so many lessons for budding and adult entrepreneurs, for technology developers and for businessmen everywhere, who hope to \\"put a dent in the universe.\\"  I found myself highlighting many passages on my Kindle.  Toward the book's finish, Jobs rails about the deficiencies in America's educational system, and Bill Gates agrees. It makes one think that a boy or girl in India or China will read this book, embrace its lessons, build a great company, and become the true successor to the Great Jobs.
B005R2S3VE|2.0|I thought I liked Chicago.  This DVD is almost enough to persuade me I don't really.  Video quality is that of a tired VHS tape.  Audio quality is better, but the performance is rather unpolished.  Buy a studio album instead.  This is doomed to be one of those purchases only ever played once.
B000TGJ8IU|5.0|This is one of, if not the, best Greek Myth type, sword and cape/sandal EPIC films.   The Brad Pitt/Achilles gets played up abit, and like some of the other celeb names in the film, if you didn't know who they were already, then you readily see that their character elements really fit the dramatic story being told.   The film covers all the bases of a modern hollywood blockbuster, & while that can seem like it is going through the motions at times, it is within a greater story being told which makes it easy to accept it on a dramatic level and just appreciate the film where similar conventions in other films are transcended in this due to the film's greater tapestry.   For me, full enjoyment of the film is like the characters, none of them are truely fully sympathetic but together they are greater than the sum of their parts which along with taking place in a totally different mode of life in relatively ancient historical myth settings that is woven into life with a type of Germanic Ayrian hyperbolic reverential flair for the utopian warrior mythical romance, creates a great Greek tragedy of ego & loss, love and war.    The Trojans are more likeable & spiritual, but that brings it's own problems also for them, the good King of the piece for example helps seal his people's doom. The scene of Paris fighting the Greek Kings brother in a challenge, is totally ace & very fun i might add, while in a way emblematic of the complex narrative in it's heroics & villiany of the film.  Perhaps an overlooked jewel somewhat in jaded blockbuster audiences I think Troy Director's Cut is a MUST have film experience if you like fantasy, Greek myth etc with it being one of the modern greats to that type of cinema.
B005KELQEU|5.0|The sleeve fits perfectly my kindle, it protects it really well. The color and the design is pleasing at sight, maybe -as any other kindle accessory- a bit expensive, but, in my opinion, it's very helpful, especially if you like bringing your kindle with you.
B00632HWOG|1.0|there's not a way to get to the next page of emails, when I read that on a review I thought they could delete emails to get more emails. you cant delete emails on this app and you can't put your emails in folders too. I'm very disappointed.
B0050CQY1W|1.0|While I enjoy the more gospel-inspired singing Beyonce is doing on 4, her fourth solo effort, I must admit that the songs still aren't there.  And her material is not appropriate to her age and current life experience. As I have said, in a previous review, my expectations are very low where this entertainer is concerned.<br /><br />My opinion on the CD, the title of this review says it all. Skip it! Buy Chrisette Michele instead.
0307594777|1.0|I just finished reading the Millennium Series and found it to be very over-rated.  The only reason people like these books stems from the endowment effect.  People want these books to be better than they are.  I also think there is some \\"foreign bias\\" in that people like these books because they automatically think they are good because they come from a foreign country.    I don't see any reason why anyone would like these books.  The plots move like icebergs and go nowhere if they do move.  The ending of the 1st book was very deus ex machina and then doesn't resolve in a good way.  The 2nd book goes nowhere and the 3rd book has no plot at all.   There is no character development and none of the characters, other than Lisbeth, are interesting such that as things happen to them the reader really doesn't care.    Finally, the narrative itself is poorly written.  There are a lot of details to the point that you can tell that Larson was running out of ideas.  Do we really need to know all that detail about CEPO and the people involved in it?    If you're thinking about reading this series don't bother.  Look for other, better written material out there.
B0063GORYU|5.0|classic fun. miss the spiders. running. around. when you win. but still. relaxing &amp; challenging. one of my favorites of all times.
B003L77FYS|5.0|This show has a bit of everything for everyone.  If you have seen the show before this season opener does not disapoint.  My husband didn't have a chance to watch it since he was deployed and when he got this he was on the edge of his seat.  The humors is still great and i think that the romance between the lead characters is evolving quite well.  If you like the show the ending will leave you wanting more.  I can't wait for the next season to come out.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|i was so excited to download this as i love playing it on my phone, figured on my tablet it wuld b even better? to my surprise after paying and downloading it keeps saying not installed, then i read some reviews to find out its not compatable with my tablet yet there is no refund button. how do u get refunded for a game you cant even play?
B005HSL626|5.0|Simple and enjoyable but addicting. Installed yesterday and spent the majority of the day playing. Easy to figure out and perfect for killing time!
B000099T2L|1.0|Even though I am not a fan, I did have the hope the Beyonce's debut solo effort would break new ground and allow Beyonce to reinvent herself apart from her former group. Sadly, this didn't happen.<br /><br />What happened instead was a 13 song CD with only one hit (Crazy In Love), two mediocre songs(Baby Boy & Naughty Girl) and a whole lot of duds (everything else). I suppose the problem lies with Beyonce's curious lack of life experience. It's easier to write songs when you have actually lived a life with heartbreak, disappointment, dead ends, and baseless hopes. However, none of this happened to Beyonce, judging by the generic lyrics and themes to her songs.<br /><br />What this CD needs is pathos.  What the listener gets is sub-par songwriting, elementary lyrics, and shameless over-emoting vocals that are enough to drive any musical tastemaker mad. It's a wonder to me that anyone bought this CD in first place; let alone gave it 5 stars!<br /><br />And the fact that it won Beyonce, who is an entertainer not an artist, five Grammys is nothing short of astonishing to me. Even Beyonce's little sister, Solange, is far more capable of putting out more varied and inspired work than this testament to mediocrity.<br /><br />In summary, if you like uninspired and unoriginal r 'n' b from a woman most known for her beauty than her talent, by all means, get this CD. On the other hand, if substance over style is more important to you, skip this CD. Go get Janelle Monae's ArchAndroid instead.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book I'm sure will be very good I have heard it being talked about many times. I love the storyline and the suspense involved in it. I will definitely finish this book quickly on my Kindle Fire. The only bad thing about ordering this book is that it costs $5 almost and there are no refunds whatsoever. At least that I can find. I bought this book and then my sister told me that I could read hers. If you know if I can get this refunded please tell me in a comment. Anyway back to the book I amvery excited to read it Kindle or not. I'm sure it will be amazing. Suzanne Collins made it easy to spend lots of time with. I keep wanting to read it and I'm not even done with the second chapter. Good job although I haven't rated this yet I probably will rate it 5 stars based on others' reviews and what I've read of it so far.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|DO NOT BUY this set if you own any apple products.  I thought I was getting a digital copy I could put on my kids ipods.  No such luck.  This is very deceptive and I won't buy this again.  I will be trying to return this.  You can only view it with a Flixster account and can't import it into ITunes.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|I didn't care for this app. I did not like the way it was laid out; i.e. not easy to move around in as a remote application. I will go back to Teamviewer, which is a much easier app to use for re mote access to my home computer. I'm very glad it was only .99!
B004LWZW7O|5.0|i dunno what people were looking for but i was well entertained in this movie, the acting was incredible, and i liked the story, i really dont see how anybody didnt like this film, it has action, love, guns, badasish cars, cool effects, i guess most people want a real movie if they want that go to hollywood and be a stunt double or something. all in all you need to check this out, i will be buying this when it comes out on blu ray!!
B006FLGBGA|5.0|I wish I had the BD already. I would prefer to write a review on the whole thing, but this will have to suffice for now.<br /><br />I read one review some time ago saying that if you can allow yourself to fall into the story and ignore a few things, then you'll likely enjoy the film very much. I see other 'reviewers' derailing the film for having no realism (this IS a sci-fi film, by the way, an attempted hard sci-fi at that).<br /><br />No one is paying attention. The true star of this film is the editing. We are not left to suffer the ten / fifteen minutes it takes a character to start a process; we know the character is about to try something, scene skips to the attempt. At one hour forty-four minutes, we get the information dump of a three hour film.<br /><br />Bare Bones: the film has virtually no violence outside the neighbourhood chase scene. The count of human death is barely noticeable and in fact five, for an entire supposedly intro to human-v-ape war. But this isn't the war. The reason a few hundred or so apes beat back humanity is two fold: the apes were only trying to find an effective new home, not destroy the oppressive humans; they didn't have to. Within a very small number of years the 113 strain of the virus has obliterated the human population.<br /><br />The movie is understated. It moves so quick that a jaded mind, thinking they know what's gonna happen, will miss at least a quarter of the understated plot. To catch everything, one is advised to watch the film on BR with the fullest sound system programme available, and appropriate subtitles engaged.<br /><br />And watch with an open mind, and enjoy it.
B005YDLJ76|1.0|Granted that Beyonce is a great entertainer with a gift for singing songs with incendiary rhythms and beats. Clearly, her voice is in fine form with its new gospel-inspired stylings. But this video does not do anything to inform the viewer about the film's subject, Beyonce.  It feels very over-polished, slick, and completely forgettable.<br /><br />It's too heavy on material from her DC period, and the story-telling aspect of the show wears on the viewer after a while cuz you never get hear full versions of the songs. The video clips interspersed between performances does nothing to create the sense of intimacy with the entertainer as most concert footage should do.<br /><br />In the end, the viewer is left feeling unsatisfied and wonderding if the purchase of this DVD was worth the money. It isn't. Watch one of her other performance DVDs if you want to experience her live performances without braving the elements, astronomical parking fees, and suffocating/overexuberant crowds.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I liked this game because of the story's and why I gave it. _four stars is because it was shot.:)
B004G600A4|5.0|People are only dumping on this book because it was made by Disney, which pays a price for having such heft in the industry.  If this movie had been made by some fledgling, no-name outfit struggling to survive, it would be hailed as a work of beauty, simplicity, and charm.  As it is, a lot of people are just groaning because it resembles so many past formulaic outings of Disney.<br /><br />But this one is particularly well-done.  There's a reason you keep seeing formulas in movies:  THEY WORK.  This is probably the best-wrought animated Disney movie I've seen since \\"The Little Mermaid.\\"<br /><br />There were two things that stuck out in my mind as particularly excellent:<br /><br />1.  The completely unexpected yet captivating way that the horse Maximus stole the show from the middle of the movie onwards.<br /><br />2.  The relationship between the mother and the daughter.  This was bitingly, spookily convincing.  I don't know who wrote that, but there's more than a dose of reality in there.  For me, the mother is the most comprehensively convincing villain I've ever seen from Disney.
B004GNFSO0|1.0|Singularly one of the worst fact-checked books I have EVER read.  This book has been hailed as a true story, but in reality, the man NEVER made the trek he describes.  The writing is poor, the story-line, had it been presented as fiction MIGHT have been interesting, if only the writing wasn't so, so uninspired. I read this for a book club and was NOT impressed.  Not in the least. Google the \\"authors\\" name.  Read the documents.  But DO NOT buy this book and read it.  Again, the story-line, presented as fiction, might make a good movie and that is what Hollywood is counting on.  In one word, annoying.  Don't waste your time or your money.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|plays for 1 minute then freezes gets very laggy other than that when game worked was amazing please fix i miss it
B000UE29SW|5.0|My first time reading this book was 16 years ago after my daughter's death.  It helped me SO much!  Since I have purchased books to give to families of patients that I deal with that are dying.  They are hard to find in bookstores at times, so I get them where I can.  I was pleased with this purchase, the price was fair and the shipping timely.
B001KR9AP8|1.0|Ok. From reading the 5 star reviews, the listener could expect some house-wrecking beats, some hot singing, and lyrics worthy of a entertainer at the height of their creative powers.<br /><br />Prepare to be disappointed. Again. This CD doesn't live up to the hype. I kept wondering while listening what CD everyone, who gushed about it, was listening to.  There is no attempt to grow or mature into a potentially legendary entertainer on this CD. All you notice is the sounds of cash registers ringing all over the world as people queue up ten deep to buy this crap and gush about it later to everyone with ears.<br /><br />Don't waste your time looking for signature track, or swoon-worthy vocals as Beyonce has shown herself to be a vocalist incapable of singing ballads.  Her strength lies in up-tempo songs where she can do that rap-singing she has become famous for.  While that was enjoyable when she was a teenager; it is not something a married woman pushing thirty should be doing.<br /><br />So...I give up! In the future, I will lower my expectations where Beyonce is concerned.
0240815807|5.0|No matter who you are, you will at least learn something from this book. its is a wealth of budget studio and general audio knowledge. The narrative voice sounds like you're actually listening to mike talk right in front of your face about each topic. as others have said, it does assume you at least have a little knowledge of audio at least. but even if you don't, with dedication you'll still love it. just a good book for anyone who is looking to learn more about mixing and set up.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|Note: This is a review of the film, not the DVD, which, I understand, suffers from poorly translated subtitles.<br /><br />Let the Right One In (LTROI) is about loneliness, brutality, and love. The brutality of nature, of other humans, and of the world in general is inescapable; but, it can be alleviated by love, which, although it does not completely erase the brutal necessities of nature, relieves the heart of its suffering solitude. Vampires, in this film, are cursed. They do not sparkle in the sun (as in other terrible movies); they are sickly and possess an inveterate need for blood, which painfully requires destroying human life. Eli, the vampire \\"girl\\" in this film, kills those she feeds from because that spares them the horror of becoming a vampire. Without getting too clever, one can read this movie as an indictment of nature. Eli isn't immoral; however, she is compelled to either destroy or die. She simply has no choice.<br /><br />Oskar, the film's other main character, is as lonely as Eli. (He is isolated by the brutality of his peers; she, by the brutality of nature.) He and his mother live alone; his father is an alcoholic, and his peers maliciously torture him at school. Violent revenge fantasies play out in his imagination. His face stern, serious, and menacing, he begins to talk to an imaginary tormentor (\\"are you scared?)\\" and then stabs a knife into a tree--the substitute for his tormentor--and yells \\"scream...squeal.\\" But he is not utterly consumed by his fantasies (although they seem to have dangerous potential), and the viewer sees an intelligent and taciturn boy longing for connection. He meets Eli on a sparse, snow covered jungle gym, and they soon bond. At first, she is etiolated and foul smelling because she is starving for blood. A disconcerting grumble can be heard. After she \\"eats,\\" though, she is healthier and more friendly. The viewer understands why a lonely boy would take to her.<br /><br />Oskar and Eli's growing intimacy is revealed slowly. In one particularly poignant scene, Oskar buys candy for Eli. Eli says she doesn't want a piece and Oskar ruefully replies \\"too bad.\\" Understanding that her rejection pained Oskar, she asserts that she will try one. She looks at it nervously, almost disgustedly, draws in a breath, and pops the candy in her mouth. In the next scene, she is shown vomiting against the wall of the store. Oskar hugs her; she hardly reacts. Tragically resigned to her fate, she glances unseeing into space and asks Oskar if he likes her and if he would continue to even if she \\"weren't a girl.\\" The scene is perfectly executed--it sadly and subtly illustrates their growing bond. Eli knows the candy will make her ill, but she wants to make Oskar happy, and she wants, in spite of certain knowledge of its impossibility, to be \\"human\\" for him. When she ineluctably fails--as she knew she would--she hints to Oskar that she isn't what she appears.<br /><br />Beautifully filmed, LTROI is filled with haunting and poetic shots. There are woods like a Bruegel painting, filled with wasted white trees; solitary apartments, uniform, bland, rising from a field of snow; and intimate faces, pensive, searching for love. The last shot of Eli, in particular, is brilliant. The camera shows her eyes and small portion of her face; it does not show her mouth. She smiles, but one can only tell because of the subtle movement of her facial muscles. In a Hollywood film, the focus would have been her smile. In LTROI, the focus is her eyes and the smile is inferred.<br /><br />LTROI is a work of poetry. Even the love shared between Oskar and Eli is poetic; it is pure, platonic, unadulterated by petty lust. This is the film's central story. Other stories, although touched upon, are not thoroughly explored. What results is a unified, singular vision that achieves a \\"unity of effect\\" that is haunting and unforgettable.<br /><br />FINAL SAY:<br /><br />Instead of watching or purchasing another treacly tale from Stephenie Meyer, treat yourself to a profoundly beautiful, subtle, and intelligent film. You will not regret it.e, and intelligent film. You will not regret it.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Before \\"11/22/63\\", I had not read a Stephen King book. Mostly, I have been intimidated by the size of his novels and I am not much of a science fiction or horror fan. The premise of \\"11/22/63\\" caught my attention with the historical significance and the intrigue of time travel. After reading the reviews, I decided that it would be worth the money and I was hopeful that my fellow Amazon customers were not steering me wrong with their in-depth reviews. I started reading \\"11/22/63\\" as soon as it completed its download on my Kindle and from that moment on, I read it every free minute I had available. I felt as if I was living vicariously through the main character, Jake Epping, and experiencing the era with him. I work 50+/week but still managed to finish this book in just two weeks. I have recommended this book to all of my Kindle friends.

I am sure you could go deaf while using this at maximum. After reading other's reviews I was ready for the worst but was happily surprised. It is not meant to be a high dollar amp but for what was paid, I would say I would have bought this for myself. If you do have IPod I think the L3  that can also be bought is better than the mini jack to mini jack, no back ground sound (hiss)

B004LWZW4W|5.0|When rating excellent (or terrible) movies, it can be difficult to determine at which point to start.  With Rise of the Planet of the Apes, the same may be true in some respects.  However, with regards to stand out traits \\"Rise\\" stands out as being believable before all else.  The way that the planet is turned into a place controlled by super-intelligent apes instead of by mankind falls into the category of something that is entirely possible, particularly if one follows scientific news and progress.  The apes are a far cry from those used in the Tim Burton film, \\"Planet of the Apes.\\"  Another motion-capture suit portrayal by the masterful Andy Serkis (Gollum of the film 'Lord of the Rings' and Kong of the film 'King Kong'), this time blended directly into and shot within the live action sequences blurs the lines of reality and cinematic fiction.<br /><br />Furthermore, each differing type of ape within the movie presents a different personality and a different viewpoint; all expressed in a surreal, but believable manner despite lack of voice acting throughout most of the movie from the apes.  This movie will, at very least, leave one wondering further about the thoughts of apes as they play or throw fits of rage at your nearest zoo.  However, the environmentalist feel of several scenes does not take away from the emotionally driven, thought-provoking experience that this film presents.<br /><br />In the end, I was unsure as to whether I felt more emphatic towards the apes or the humans, as our species biggest struggle began. The movie left me feeling euphorically connected and contented.  I am not ashamed to say that I nearly shed a tear at several points in the movie or that I smiled hugely or even chuckled with joy throughout several parts.  The acting aside from that of Mr. Serkis does nothing to harm the movie and I may go so far as to say that Mr. Franco is becoming a very good actor and developing a definite adaptability to fit the roles he chooses to portray.  Mr. Lithgow and Mrs. Pinto also perform their roles beautifully, providing a dynamic that is difficult to remain untouched by throughout the movie.  I would highly recommend that a person watch this movie BEFORE purchasing because it is one of those that \\"there are bound to be those who hate it and those that love it and few in between.\\"  However, you must watch it. It will be worth it if you end up loving it and then BUY it to support those who are giving us the gift of their art.  And if you hate it, it will be only an hour and a half lost and not very much money.<br /><br />--START SPOILER ALERT---START SPOILER ALERT---START SPOILER ALERT--.<br />The irony of course, is that the apes technically and honestly have nothing to do with the horrible outcome shown within the credits (which you must watch beyond the first minute or two, in order to tie this movie to \\"Planet of the Apes\\", as this is a prequel) and we brought about our own end.  This is gorgeously portrayed.<br />---END SPOILER ALERT----END SPOILER ALERT----END SPOILER ALERT---.Mrs. Pinto also perform their roles beautifully, providing a dynamic that is difficult to remain untouched by throughout the movie.

Siamo nel 1983, e il 6 dicembre dello stesso anno negli studi televisivi della CHCH Studios di Hamilton ( Ontario - Canada ) si svolge una straordinaria session musicale con protagonisti due leggende del blues, Albert King ( 1923 - 1992 ) e il giovane, talentuoso e lanciatissimo Stevie Ray Vaughan, ( 1954 - 1990 )  accompagnati da Tony Llorens al piano/organo, Bus Thornton al basso e Michael Llorens alla batteria.  Questo straordinario evento viene registrato per la fortuna di tutti noi appassionati sia in audio sia in video, e in questa spettacolare Deluxe Edition troviamo entrambe le versioni con una qualità audio/video assolutamente degna dell'evento.  Il CD ci offre 11 tracce semplicemente emozionanti, anche se in realtà i pezzi sono 7, con alcuni classici dello stesso King come \\"Blues at Sunrise\\", \\"Match Box Blues\\", ecc...e solo una di SVR, ovvero la celebre \\"Pride and Joy\\", in versioni lunghe e dilatate con fraseggi e assoli da brivido, il tutto intervallato da dialoghi e commenti tra i due musicisti tra una traccia e l'altra.  Un'emozione davvero unica sentire le parole e le risate di queste due leggende del blues, e per nostra fortuna questa emozione possiamo ritrovarla in maniera ancora piu evidente guardando lo straordinario DVD che ritrae la stessa jam session, e in cui troviamo brani non presenti sul CD come ad esempio una versione da brividi della meravigliosa \\"Texas Flood\\" e immagini mai viste prima, ma soprattutto ci regala la grande emozione di vedere insieme due musicisti immensi, in una occasione unica e irripetibile pensando con tanta malinconia al terribile destino cui andrà incontro il povero e indimenticabile SRV.  Credetemi, questo è un CD/DVD evento, assolutamente da non perdere.

B004XQO90E|4.0|This film reminded me a little of \\"Run Lola Run,\\" but a little more intricate.  It was enjoyable watching Jake, he is simply delicious, and that is partially why he's where he is.  It is difficult to remember a lot of the film because it is so detailed and different.  I'm not sure how many times I will watch it because there is so much repetition within the plot, and that get's a bit tedious.<br /><br />This film is not for the overly anxious or easily irritated, which I tend to be.  The only reason I could watch this, was because of Jake.  Had it been Cruise, Reeves, or some other big name, I might have skipped it.  But I could overlook the tediousness because of that beautiful face.<br /><br />The blu-ray is nice, of course, but it irks me that one cannot stop the film without returning to where one left.  I can only pause and quickly have a break before my quirky blu-ray player automatically shuts down.  I'm sure that's an equipment issue.<br /><br />If you like intrigue and action, this blu-ray is for you.  If you like Jake, but not so much action, this film might be for you.  If you don't like Jake, Intrigue, action, or special effects, this film isn't for you.
B004M9ZI0M|4.0|This was Shakespeare's final play, and it appears he broke with traditional play formats to develop underlying themes implied throughout his previous plays.  As such, the plot and character development prevalent in earlier plays is minimized in The Tempest.  That carries over into this film, making it initially difficult to follow.  On the other hand, this film makes it obvious that a major character in The Tempest, the deserted island setting, cannot be captured on stage.  This is more a screenplay than a stage play, and now we finally have an appropriate treatment of this essential work.<br />  The casting is outstanding.  We are presented with multiple characters in short order, but there is no problem telling them apart.  The lead character Prospero is played as a female Prospera by Helen Mirren, who comes across as a Queen Lear, showing what could have happened in a sequel if Lear and daughter had been exiled rather than killed.  All the other characters bring substantial stage cred to their roles.  And then there's Russell Brand, who as in all his projects leaves the viewer wondering, \\"What the hell was that?\\"<br />  Any Shakespeare afficionado needs to see this.  In all his previous plays we have appreciated his insight into the deficiencies, tumultuous condition and redemptive efforts of mankind.  But in this play we have Miranda, who has grown up outside human society, on first observing a cross-section of scoundrels, exclaiming, \\"O wonder.  How many goodly creatures are there here.  How beautious mankind is.  O brave new world that has such people in it.\\"  This play is an exposition of, within the magic of our own supressed powers, what we have lost but may rediscover.<br />  Now, if Director Taymor would just hook up with Ms. Mirren again and do Queen Lear ...

B001SRC9P8|4.0|i started reading the book series after watching the first series of the tv show on abc family. it is very captivating and you will get hooked. they are very fast reading and you can fly through them. my only problems with the series are all of the references to clothing, handbags, shoes, etc. the author wastes so much time and space in the books talking about every little item the girls wear or see or buy.  also this series needs to end! i stopped reading after book 9 i think. once i got to the end of that book, i expected it to be the end of the series, but there have been more books released since then. i get that it's popluar, but don't drag it out so long.   i'll keep watching the show, but i hope they don't do the same thing and drag it out forever. it seems that the point of the series is to find Ali's killer. once we know that it should be over!
B005OLUOVA|4.0|I recieved mine from amazon a pre-order without a hitch, and at a really good price from where it is now. I knew there were some issues occuring in the manufacturing (see other reviews and Rammstien's website), and was very pleased when this shipped on time.  Arrived in great shape, no dents.  All of the CD's were in place and correctly sorted, printing appears intact on otter tin shell, and on book sleeve. Binding on book is very good. The only thing I noted was a few grey stains on white covering cloth that would be consistent with an unwashed sanded metal case.  Not a big deal. So for the content.  This has the new track Mein Land, very cool, along with a good selection of songs from each Rammstien album on disc one. Second disc has the \\"best of\\" remixes compiled from the many rammstien singles.  I'm not impressed with remixes, but i like the idea rammstien decided to pull some of these together to get more of their scope of work in this box. The part that is the best is the final 3 dvd's of this set. Spread across them are all of the Rammstien videos and the makings of.  Very cool, and fills in where Lichtspielhaus left off. The book (240 pages) is very cool and comes nicely bound in a hardcover that fits into a metal slipcase that's all the size of a cd and as thick as about 3-4 digipacks, with some great pictures that remind me why they are such a great live show (saw them on the Mutter tour, the last time they fully toured the USA).  For the money I paid for it (50% of the cost) than going price, very worth it. If you didn't catch the break I did, and due to the problems and now very limited quality, the two disc deluxe version set and Lichtspielhaus would likely due fine unless you are very hardcore and want the dvd's. The current price is the only reason I would not give this set a 5 star review and say all fans should run out and get this.  Should it fall, I would say great value and get it.
B004EPZ06Q|3.0|Overall, I think this is a great movie, if your expectations are similar to the original.  My biggest problem is the stupid UltraViolet copy that comes along with.  It does not allow you to download in iTunes.  It downloads to some crappy app called Flixster.  I use Apple TV to watch movies and that is not possible with UltraViolet digital copies.  I am not buying any actual dvds because of this.  Extremely unhappy on Christmas because my parents have a Apple TV and no blu-ray.  Thanks Warner Brothers for ruining Christmas.

B004TI5N38|5.0|A number of people in these reviews have accused Baldacchi of basically plagiarizing from Lee Child's book \\"The Affair\\" and using Child's character Reacher as a model for his new character and lead protagonist John Puller, an Army investigator who was a combat hero in Afghanistan, now called on to battle a new set of bad guys at home.  Aside from minor and insignificant similarities, such as the fact that both Puller and Reacher are in the Army and are investigators, these books, characters, and authors are entirely different.  Baldacchi's book is tightly written, with every word building toward character and plot development. It is one of his most masterfully crafted books since \\"Absolute Power.\\" Child's book is loosely written, with excess verbiage everywhere.  His book needs a much better editor, frankly speaking.  Reacher in no manner reminds me of Puller -- he is a more uncertain and perhaps even more timid character than Puller. Of course, that in better hands would make him easier to relate to, but as presented in Child's book it comes across as awkward, as though Child is trying self-consciously to be literate without adding nuance to the characters or plot and is inappropriate.  Shakespeare too was accused of lifting characters and plots from other sources.  But no one really cares as his work is far better than the original material. The same can be said for Baldacchi. Even if he was inspired by Child to invent Puller, I am grateful that he was so inspired as he has in \\"Zero Day\\" produced a compelling story.  I imagine it's the start of a new set of books for Baldacchi involving Puller, at least I hope so, as the Camel Club series was starting to get a bit old.

B005TBN3EU|1.0|if you think funny is watching a grown man cry like a blubbering little girl because his \\"buddy\\" told him they are no longer friends, then you will find this movie hilarious. this must have been written by high school kids... no wait - 8th graders!! I was a huge fan of the Hangover (1st one) and I when I heard they were coming out with a sequel, I couldn't wait! however, after watching this drivel, this movie was absolutely pathetic! it was the opposite of funny. same plot, but the writing was completely dumbed down. really mindless humor... I think the \\"Ernest\\" movies are funnier than this and I hate Vern! the only reason this movie was made is one reason: MONEY. they knew no matter how bad a movie it was, with the success of Hangover 1, they would rake in the dough... I don't know how it did in the box office (it was a Netflix rental), but I do know I'm glad I didn't waste my theater money watching it. don't waste your time on this crap.

SECTOR 3 set...I have no problem with the mix of \\"Closer to the Hear\\" on the DVD disc...I think it's just fine....I did notice that the percussion on the stereo mix is missing at the first of the song..but hey...I have no problems with that..i'll never listen to that version on that disc.  I think everybody needs to stop and check their brains here....these albums were totally disassembled and then re-mastered...So I would think comments like \\"They used the wrong master\\" for tracks on some albums..would be incorrect...these are \\"AlL NEW\\" masters.  These are amazing new mixes!!!!
B00407PNWO|5.0|Outstanding adventure flick.  It was delivered on time and in the condition as advertised.  I enjoy these old movies much more than the ones done today.
B004EPYZUS|4.0|MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: GHOST PROTOCOL is a perfect popcorn summer movie, never mind that it's coming out in wintertime. It doesn't try to be more than what it is. It harbors no pretense to high-minded Merchant Ivory ideals. It merely wants to entertain the bejesus out of you with a barrage of fun explosive espionage. All it asks is a suspension of disbelief and, since this is Christmas time, accomodating them folks at Bad Robot isn't so far a stretch. This franchise has always been hugely entertaining if you're into crazy cloak and dagger and action sequences contrived with audacity and flair. The stunt crew wore their big boy pants for this one.<br /><br />What mission is so crucial that it requires a languishing Ethan Hunt to be sprung from a Russian gulag? This time out the McGuffin centers around Russian nuclear launch codes and the nuclear extremist codenamed \\"Cobalt\\" who seeks to make use of them. Ethan, still recovering from his wife's death, is saddled with a new crew. It comprises vengeful-minded operative Jane Carter (Paula Patton, drop-dead gorgeous), new field agent and resident tech-head Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg, very funny), and seemingly out-of-his-depth IMF (Impossible Missions Force) chief analyst Brandt (Jeremy Renner). It turns out this team doesn't play too well with each other. When the caper in Moscow goes disastrously south - and exploded bits of the Kremlin would attest to how rough it all went - the U.S. President initiates Ghost Protocol which mandates the disavowal of the IMF. Short on support and resources, Ethan Hunt has no recourse but to put on a hoodie and regroup with his newly declared rogue operatives.<br /><br />Brad Bird, who helmed IRON GIANT and THE INCREDIBLES, transitions to live action directing and makes it look easy. Of course, it helps when you have an icon like Tom Cruise headlining the project, but, really, nothing about the production values look cheap. The film makes use of exotic locales as what's left of IMF travels from Budapest to Russia to Dubai to Mumbai. The spy gadgets are cool - the blink-activated eye lens camera, the edifice-scaling suction gloves, the magnetic flotation device, etc. - even if they all almost universally end up betraying their operators. But that's part of the fun. It would be horrid if these spy strategies work seamlessly.<br /><br />I would've loved to have seen more of Paula Patton in action because she seems to have the physicality to sell \\"Jane Carter\\" as a buttkicking spy. But her much anticipated showdown with the female assassin is a bust. Meanwhile, Simon Pegg can show up on anything and I'll watch it. He's awesome; he never fails to add comedic color. Jeremy Renner does exhibit several wicked good moves in various confrontations. Word on the street is that whenever Cruise decides to step down, Renner's set to fill in those shoes. It should be fine, providing you take into consideration that Renner doesn't carry a smidge of Cruise's star wattage.<br /><br />Tom Cruise has mastered the blueprint for playing that relentless, undaunted super-spook. And you have to respect the shape he's in and his nerves of steel because there's no way in the world would I have scaled the outside of the Burj Khalifa tower, only, like, the tallest building in the world (there's some silly plot point about having to access the tower's server room on the 130th floor from the exterior). Cruise performs this stunt himself, and somewhere maybe his stunt double is wiping his sweaty brow in relief. These action set pieces are spectacular stuff. And because it's dull when the super spy is too indomitable, I like the running gag which centers on Ethan Hunt's jumping misadventures; all his desperate leaps end up with his just missing the mark. It's nice to see a chink in his armor. But, holy carp, this guy's pain threshold must be unbelievable. Ethan Hunt takes a hellacious beating in this film that I don't think even wearing a fresh stylish leather hoodie can make up for.Budapest to Russia to Dubai to Mumbai.

B002ZG99N6|2.0|As the Coen brothers did in Fargo, Affleck does a wonderful job of making the place character in the movie. High speed chases down narrow Boston streets and the feel of the Charlestown community let you know that this is a story about a place and not just people. But, apparently unlike 90 percent of other viewers, that's about the extent of the praise I can offer this film, one I really wanted and expected to like.  It simply crumbles under the weight of its implausibility and unbelievability. The smart girl gets blinded by the love for an outlaw theme is really played out by now. Like Tara in \\"Sons of Anarchy\\" Claire makes me want to hit her over the head more than connect with her. I guess Jon Hamm is just too good looking to be portrayed as a bumbling lawman on the tail of a cunning criminal, but that's almost the impression one gets. There's just too much that doesn't makes sense about these two characters to accept what happens in the story.  The ending, if you can call it an ending, while it seems touching on the surface, leaves at least two very important unanswered questions that one has to ask when following through the result to its logical conclusion.  The lead and supporting performers are all strong, and Affleck's handling of the place and action were well-crafted. He needs to pick a better story (and possibly another lead actor) for his next directorial effort though.
0374275637|5.0|Author Kahneman, a Princeton psychologist, was the 2002 Nobel prizewinner in economics. His contribution was to point out that rational decision-making, a fundamental key assumption of most economists (especially in the 'Chicago school'), is not a good representation of reality.<br /><br />Instead, Kahneman contends there are two systems that drive the way we think. System 1 in fast, intuitive, often unconscious, and emotional, while System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and logical. Kahneman challenges the idea that 'people are generally rational,' discovering systematic errors such as erroneous estimates due to 'anchoring,' bias against losses, 'framing,' failure to follow planning with good management --> gross underestimates, the 'focusing illusion,' experience drawn from small samples, recency of media coverage, the 'halo effect,' lack of awareness of what one doesn't know, ideology, degree of optimism, and regression to the mean. These errors are reinforced by a preference for certainty - the media are far more likely to defer to a self-assured less-accurate 'expert' than someone seeing more complexity and less certainty, and more accurate.<br /><br />The year-to-year correlation between mutual fund outcomes is very small, barely greater than zero; similarly, political pundits and others have poor track records - though plenty of excuses.<br /><br />When confronted with a problem, intuitive thought does the best it can; if the individual has relevant expertise, the intuitive solution that comes to mind is more likely to be correct. When the question is difficult, we often answer a simplified version instead without noticing the substitution. (Eg. Instead of addressing how much should an oil company pay for environmental damage, System 1 may substitute a simpler question - 'How upset am I by a photograph of a bird soaked in oil?') System 2 thinking requires attention, often involves several ideas at once, and time pressure, and is disrupted when attention is drawn away.<br /><br />Kahneman tells that System 1 is 'the origin of much that we do wrong,' but also 'the origin of most of what we do right.' One way to determine how engaged a person is in System 2 thinking is to observe how dilated the individual's pupils are.<br /><br />Many people are overconfident, placing too much faith in their intuition and failing to check their answer. Those with greater ability to defer rewards (self-control) do better at avoiding overconfident intuitive answers. We're prone in System I to see patterns and trends where there is only randomness. (Example: The conclusion that small schools produce better pupil outcomes was based on the fact that small school results are more variable - they also produce a relatively high proportion of poor results.)<br /><br />Simple algorithms (eg. 6 or fewer variables, each with five or fewer levels) have repeatedly been demonstrated superior to expert judgment in a wide variety of fields. One reason is that humans are inconsistent in evaluating complex information - eg. radiology, auditing, pathology.<br /><br />The validity of one's intuition increases with the proportion of science involved (medicine, vs. investing) and the speed/certainty of feedback (anesthesiology, vs. radiology).<br /><br />The chance that a small business will survive 5 years in the U.S. is about 35%; however, those opening them believe these low odds don't apply to them (eg. they're in a 'promising line'). Clinicians 'completely certain' of their diagnoses for ICU patients that subsequent died were wrong 40% of the time. We overestimate the odds of rare events - shark attacks, lightning strikes.<br /><br />Bottom-Line: Beware of trusting your gut, basing economics and law on models of human rationality, watching Jim Cramer and most everything else on CNBC, and simplistic works on decision-making such as Malcolm Gladwell's 'Blink.'hat System 1 is 'the origin of much that we do wrong,' but also 'the origin of most of what we do right.'

B003QNXPUK|1.0|This is my first written review for Amazon and I will keep it short and simple. I purchased this full body protection for my new iPhone 4s expecting it to hold up and it did, for about a WEEK. I am usually not that good on putting on these screen protectors but I thought I did a great job this time. Fast forward a week later, bubbles are gone (as it states) but after taking my phone out of my pocket, I noticed a lint buildup in the bottom of my phone UNDERNEATH the front screen protector. Apparently after a few days, the screen protector decided to come undone now the front of my phone has a bubbles and lint in the bottom, hooray. I don't know if they changed the quality of their protectors but I bought one for my 3g long ago and this never happened. Needless to say, I'm done with Zagg. I could have spent $20 more wisely this week.  I purchased the mediadevil screen protector here; http://www.amazon.com/PhoneDevil-MediaDevil-Magicscreen-screen-protector/dp/B003VPT5U2/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1324781663&sr=8-5. Let's see how this one holds up!
1250004349|5.0|A wonderfully moving account of the not so familiar involvement of the French in the Holocaust event. The format keeps the characters and events clear, from past to present, and connects them in a unique series of events. I seldom cry when reading, but this one brought tears of sorrow and shame for all the times I may have been able to do something for someone (albeit not of this magnitude) and didn't intervene by word or action. Characters are realistic and memorable,
B0063IH60K|5.0|despite a few tweaks needed to the GUI, MW has made off nicely. At the very least, it's good fun for the price (or lack thereof) .
B000JQU4TW|4.0|This book is really worth reading! Some classics are just kind of boring, but this one was quite a surprise! I really enjoyed it!
B004QK5N5W|1.0|This adapter worked once with my new ipad2 then refused to ever work properly again. I have it on exchange right now.  Extensive research on Apple forums and support groups indicates a widespread problem. No one knows for sure if it's a problem with the adapter or with the OS5 operating system.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Nice cover that provides the protection my Kindle needs. I carry the Kindle in my purse all the time and it needs this protection. The cover is very light. I love the built in cover features that make it easy watch videos without holding the Kindle. Would recommend the cover and the price is right.
B003H6KRIE|4.0|I submitted a review earlier but will do so again. Product arrived in mint condition. Ahead of scheduled arrival. Will use shipper again if need be.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I love the color(pink) and that it's light weight. The stand part is good but if you are playing a game and haft to turn vertical it doesn't work as well but other than I'm thrilled with the case.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I enjoy spider.It is one of my favorite solitaire apps. good graphics and easy to read and play cards.  thanks for putting.g it on kindle fire.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This is a great cover.  It is lightweight, yet offers secure portection. My grandaughters love to play with my Kindle Fire and love the pink cover.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|The transfers themselves onto BluRay for the first five films looks absolutely gorgeous. Smooth, crisp, vivid, delicious 5.1 audio. My only two complaints are that it features very little bonus material, and the packaging and BluRay art are just taken from previous BluRay releases, and feature 'Disc 1' written on them. And the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is literally just black with the name written on it, which looks very cheap and out of place among the others. But if you don't care about the bells and whistles and just want the films in excellent HD quality, then this collection is for you.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Force close after 2 levels. Very pixelated on larger screens. Developers should be ashamed to put out such a lazy port. Samsung Galaxy Nexus.
B004A8ZWVK|1.0|Seems every year there is a movie that is loved and nominated for awards that I just don't get.This year it's The Help.Too long for one thing ;wrongheaded and not funny.Other than that the performances are good and it has lots of production values. I just can't get my head around a movie that says its ok to put your own excrement in someone's food if you think you may have been treated unfairly in some way.Most of the white ladies in the movie are cartoon charactors ,more out of the simpsons than reality.Oh well what do i know?But putting your own fecal matter in someone's pie????????????
B004EPYZQ2|3.0|Good special effects with a so-so story.  Fair overall.  It's not the usual quality you'd expect for a Spielberg production.
B001NFNFIK|5.0|Tommy Lee Jones was made to play this part. I've read the entire series and he has definitely nailed it. I wish he would do more from the series. Do yourself a favor and read the book as well.
B000JQUKKU|4.0|In my life I'd heard about \\"A Christmas Carol\\" so many times I thought I'd actually read the story. Who has not heard the words: \\"Bah! Humbug\\" or known that Scrooge was one of the most disagreeable characters in literature? This story is fairly short and only takes a few hours to read but it will leave you with the hope that if Scrooge could change there is hope for everyone. The plot is simple. Scrooge is visited by his dead friend Marley who informs him that he will be visited by three spirits. These three spirits take him on different journey's to show him memories from his past, what is happening in the present and then what will happen in the future if he continues to live his life in a selfish way. During these journey's we get some insight into why Scrooge became such a horrid man. This story is great to read at Christmas time and it has a very happy ending.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
B004RQVVGU|4.0|This is one of his best albums ever. It continues his very good solo career after Blizzard of ozz and it is an album i recommend anyone to get.
B005DR64OQ|5.0|Loved the service, love the movie. Cam Gigandet steels the show.  Didn't do well in theaters, but not sure why.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|games are fun and occupys me I enjoy the app very much thank you for making this app so much fun
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I like it! It is a really good game but I would to play with a larger screen. but it's good
B000002B7Y|4.0|I have to say that i like most of his albums and especially his first albums (even with Black Sabbath or with his solo career). This album is no exception. It has amazing songs like: Miracle man - Crazy babies - bloodpath in Paradise. The rest songs lets say that are good. I truly believe that if you like Ozzzy in general or/and heavy metal, then you will like thia album too. Its not an album to love, but definitely not a just ok album. A good work.
145551389X|5.0|My son is the biggest Lady GaGa fan in the world...I got him this book as a xmas present, and he loved it....(so much that he couldn't contain himself to watch others open gifts)  PERFECT GIFT FOR A FAN OF LADY GAGA
B006O5Y0SS|5.0|I at times love Woody and at other times don't. This is one I love and will buy the movie.  The actors did wonderful and I just fell in love with Paris in the rain or the sunshine. The film is worth it just to see the sights.  I loved the portrayals of the famous writers and artists!<br />A wonderful see~
B00447G29S|5.0|This is not a review about the story (many reviews abound about this classic story) -my review is about the 3D version.   I wanted to purchase it, but hesitated after seeing the many very negative reviews about the quality of the 3D version, One way I figured to not get confused by these reviews - see the item purchased: those writing about more recent single disc 3D BRD seem to like it. So I bought that latest version. Do note that this Blu Ray disc DOES NOT come with any viewing glasses etc - those purchasing that edition appear to dislike it.  You will need both your BRD player and projector/TV to be 3D capable. It is FANTASTIC in 3D. The movie just comes alive, and the 3D effects are simply excellent. The effects are so real and in the moment, that the kids were trying to reach out and grab every snowflake.   I suspect that those reviewers who did not like it are referring to a previous 3D version released in 2004 (I have not seen that one), or perhaps there was some problem with their equipment.  It worked beautifully for us, and the kids simply loved it.    Bottom line: if you have true 3D equipment do not hesitate to get THIS 3D version of this classic movie. Happy Holidays!
B005K17RU0|1.0|I want to like it I really so but.I cant! it doesn't work well on kindle fires at all enough said!!!
0446585025|5.0|I love this book! Ellen makes me cheer up with her jokes and her good suggestions.reading was never my thing because i couldnt find a book that interested me.this one is just great!
B0057O6IDW|5.0|Finally i can see one of my favorite Fulci films in all it's glory.  I cannot even begin to say how great this movie looks on blu-ray.  It was like seeing the movie for the first time, being able to see details that i couldn't on DVD.  I loved the bonus features as well.  Being able to see the cast revisit the film was a treat.  A commentary by them would have been wonderful, but this was still one of my best buys of the year for my horror collection.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I have to force close on my kindle. never works. not sure why it seems to work for everyone else but not me. I really lime this game on my iphone. wish it worked on my kindle too
B004EPYZU8|5.0|Alice in wonderland on acid. Great piece of cinema art work. For those that didn't grasp the concept stick to conventional flicks.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I play a lot of different mahjong games, this one is different. some how. for any and or all mahjong players those one is a must play.
B005HI4LLY|5.0|I am difficult to please with horror comedy.  I will not even mention the popular horror comedies i don't like to avoid haters... but this movie; PERFECT!  I enjoyed every last frame of this film and other than lack of female input on the commentary from our female lead and... um 2 of the special features seemed to just repeat the same material i couldn't be any happier with it.  The commentary was great, the movie was a blast and the bonuses were decent.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Downloaded to my Kindle,  really enjoying it! Gives my something to do in between reading great Kindle books. It becomes addictive, I keep playing game after game.
B005LAIHKY|5.0|Love the old Dark Shadows programs that ran from 1966 to 1971.  I love all the actresses and actors that took part in that series but of course Jonahan Frid stands out all on his own as does Angeliqe.<br /><br />I am so very excited about this new movie and hope it stays true to the orignal but then I have never known Johnny Depp do any part of any movie that was not just EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005HSL626|5.0|very addicting. Can play it for hours. almost no problems at all...awesome game very good when you need to pass some time
B005IZLPMY|2.0|This movie had a strong beginning, however the bulk of the movie was either just actions scenes or flashes of action scenes.  There was very little story line.  I love Marvel movies but this was a disappointment.
B005AUWY90|1.0|Thankfully a non-Bluray DVD was included in the package, as the Blu Ray version is incompatible with Samsung Blu-Ray players as you can only view the Disney Magical Castle opening screen and not play the actual movie.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I bought these 4 years ago and use them when I workout.  They stay put and project good sound for even the most active workouts.  I'm buying 2 more to put on the shelf in case my old ones Peter out.  Definitely great Sony quality!
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I've tried all the other remote  app's on my Kindle Fire and none come close to the flawless video/audio streaming that this one provides.  Its fantastic if you'd  basically like to stream audio video to your tablet anywhere!  i would have paid full price for this great app  as well.
B006O5XYWG|3.0|I don't write spoilers. This movie didn't do well in the theaters. I see why. It's not bad. It's just not that good, either. It's totally predictable, unenthusiastic, & bland. It was worth the $1.98 rental special I paid, but not more. I would imagine movie theater patrons felt very disappointed as they walked out. The CGI they tried to push as being so great in this movie? It wasn't, either...
B005KDWUFA|5.0|This latest Il Divo CD has great songs that are made more enjoyable because of the incredibly beautiful voices of these four talented men.
B004W2UBYW|1.0|It looks like the Kindle price is inflated compared to both the hardcover book, and other digital editions. I've always saiid my Kindle beat out Kobo at every turn, but when I wanted to gift this to my dad and found it absurdly overpriced, I decided to get the hardcover from a physical store for substantially less. This really saddens me.
B004BSFSTA|5.0|These headphones were a nice surprise. They have performed far better than other cans Ive tried in this price range and the build quality and feel far exceeds what you would expect. All the plastic pieces feel like they are high quality and don't have a cheap feeling to them at all. The leather is soft and is also of great quality, in my opinion the quality of the leather is what makes these headphones feel like they should be priced much higher. The cord again is of a higher quality than what you would expect, unfortunately it is not the best I have seen on a pair of headphones, but I have no complaints about it. The coiled section of the cord gives the headphones a more \\"authentic\\" look, and when extended the standard cord actually has a pretty long length. The plug that the headphones come with is also very cool. The base of it is long and textured in a diamond pattern, it feels very high end. But finally the best part of these headphones is the sound, which is incredible. The sound is crisp, clear and deep. The sound is probably about on par with what you would expect in this price range, maybe a little better. My one complaint about these would be that their size is a bit small. The cushions help but I am not a huge fan of the on-ear design. The entire package though adds up to be one great pair of headphones that are offered at a very fair price. I hope Marshall keeps expanding their line and bringing in some cool models, Ill be buying the Minors as well because I have had such a good experience with these.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Having tried several weather apps, I've settled on this one. ir provides tons of information and can be customized to your peeference. I love having the local temperature ib ny status bar, and I set the widfet to the 3-day forecast. Both update quickly while I'm traveling.
B001IF252M|5.0|I got this adaptor for my 2011 Mac Mini. It has 1 HDMI and 1 Thunderbolt port. This adaptor works with Thunderbolt which frees up the HDMI port for another display or TV. It works as advertised.
B002KSPKRS|2.0|I will start by saying the headset has amazing sound, when and if you get it to work with your wireless network.  I was very disappointed in that the RF of the headset broadcast tower interferes with wireless N router type signals.  I spent alot of time messing around with placement of my device, router settings, and eventually got it to work, but now have to re-test my connection every time I turn on the xbox on and off.  I would not recommend this product for these reasons.  [...]
B005HSG3U6|4.0|Hoping for something light, this adds too much weight, but does protect the face very well.  My thumbs have gotten sore holding the fire.
B005K17RU0|5.0|super accurate and doesn't take up a lot of memory like other weather apps! I especially like the small weather widget that lives up in the dock! useful for knowing the temp without having to open the app!
B002JVWR9U|5.0|thank you for your fast shipping and delivery looking forward to doing business with you again in the near future .
B000H4QD1O|5.0|First thing I got from my prime test drive.  Easily streamed as noted by others.  For those uninitiated, this was one of the best hidden gems as far as shows go.  Damn shame Fox was so short sighted.  Ironically, they back the idea of Space Cowboys (see Universal's Cowboys and aliens)in a mainstream movie now.  Wheadon's version is substantially better, on the small screen or the large.  Enjoy the show, it has a potential to be another Star Trek if Fox would just get the legal stuff squared out.  PS - for the reviewer re: Summer Glau's character, see the movie.  It would have been great to expand it, but the series didn't run long enough.  For those watching - another interesting story/plot arc not investigated is the background of the Sheppard Book character.
B003L77GH4|5.0|thank you for your fast shipping and delivery , looking forward to doing business with you again in the near future .
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game is challenging  and actually relaxing at the same time! I can't stop playing! lovely graphics and music also.
B0068AWQQ2|2.0|This is a terrible remake. It lacks all of the charm of the original, leaving the viewer with a revamped (no pun intended) story line that is ridiculous. The dialogue is horrendous. There is nothing about this movie that recommends itself.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|Loved the movie, they pitched the personality of the key characters spot on!  Bought back a lot of childhood memories.  The 3d animation was brilliantly mastered and spielberg did it again.  It was quiet an action packed move and there was a hint of Indiana jones, pirate sofmcarribean in it too.  It will make you laugh, giggle, oooooh, exciting and truely an all round family movie, although my hubbie thought the special effects were very realistic in places and though therer were pieces with the violence that maybe a little realistic for young kinds below 10: you have been advised!
B004EPYZSU|4.0|It's 007 and Star Wars in a wild west film shooting aliens. Yup, that didn't make sense at all when I first heard about it. I saw it less than an hour ago on blu-ray, and no regrets. It was a little boring at first, but the story got better, and so did the action. I don't want to ruin the movie, but expect a lot of action. A bit emotional scene to make the story flow, but don't expect much of that. This movie actually makes more sense then what the title says. The scenery is great too. It was worth spending 2 hours watching. Probably not worth watching in the theater, or buying the movie. I would not watch it again, but rent it if you want to check it out. The overall movie is more like 3.5 stars, but 4 stars since harrison ford is in it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It actually takes skill :p not something I expected. THEY ARE AWESOME mini games to and it will take a while to beat the game. RECOMMENDED.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|its a great game, but the ads are way out of control.  They pop up full screen in the middle of playing,  I thought the banner ads were annoying. now its just not worth playing anymore. the game is great, get the ad free version. This one is a joke.
B005XI94HY|5.0|It seems like every couple of years I'm introduced to a new artist that blows my mind away -- Florence + The Machine takes top honors for me. I have a tendency to look for, and find, groups/singers who are below the radar in the \\"not quite R&B\\" realm, so I was sleeping big time on F+M until a friend brought my Lungs and pretty much dared me not to listen to it and have a review the next time I saw her. Well, I'm glad I took her threat to heart -- and I became an instant fan. This new album blew my mind away -- and now has added this phenomenal group to my \\"Must See Live\\" Bucket List. My favorite song, if I had a gun pointed at me, is \\"Shake it Off\\" -- when I saw them perform it on SNL with the gospel choir, it took on a whole different meaning for me. Don't hesitate -- and download this album -- you won't regret it.
B006LS7DQE|5.0|love the rpg element of this game.  equipping gear and weapons.  love the matching puzzles.  one my favorite games. like assigning skill points as I level up
B0063IH60K|4.0|Pretty straight forward. If you know solitaire on the PC then your learning curve will be pretty flat.   Skill level starting out is challenging enough even for intermediate players.
B004SBB0LU|5.0|It's Queen. It's a lot of Queen. And it was perfect for my CD loving roommate for Christmas.  Great buy when it was on for a lightning deal.
B0052RDHTM|1.0|The ratings for this book do not justify the ridiculous Kindle price. I'll wait until the publisher figures that out.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Everyone should see this DVD.  It is a real eye-opener to the food we eat.  We need to make informed choices
B0052VUNHC|2.0|**(contains spoilers) This book was interesting to me but not the way that I expected it to be. I picked this book up expecting it to be a typical romance story about a bad boy and a good girl. This is what it started out as, but right off the bat I was immediately freaked out by the relationship between the two characters. I found their relationship highly unhealthy and I found the ending, where they ended up together, highly disturbing. In the beginning of the book I started to wish for their break up, and when it came in the middle, I was relieved because I began to think that this book was about emotionally abusive relationships and how hard it was to get out of them. I truly expected Abby to end it with Travis and was highly disappointed when the ending was actually the opposite. I hated Travis, the male character, and found myself liking the female main character less and less as her individuality and spirit were crushed by her unhealthy relationship with a moody and at many times frightening boyfriend. I would be cautious to recommend this to someone, but at the same time I can't say that it was so bad that I couldn't read it. I wanted to find out what happens, but while I admit this book was intriguing I definitely have some moral issues with it and I would warn people looking for a romance that this book is not what it seems to be.
B0012HCASA|5.0|Loved that toward the end of the second season they had a really interesting plot line. It gave a new depth to the Terminator series.
B005LLX582|5.0|This is the type of film you have to watch several times in order to appreciate and understand. Highly recommended for those who think about the meaning of life. Good product and was delivered quickly.
B0058VW36U|4.0|Awesome App would've given it five stars if it would've been a little more difficult. Probably only took me 4-5 hours of actual gameplay.  All in all though this App is a Grand Slam...PR for a TD...etc. Can't wait to play some other ZeptoLab Apps!!!
B0064MT1QW|5.0|I would place this film as one of my top ten favorite films! Its a serious love story that makes you think and feel. The casting is perfection and direction flawless. Beautiful film.
B005N0BN58|5.0|The bonus features consist of video interviews of various people who had a part in the comic book series. They go into the history of the series from the early beginnings until the present day. These are most useful for anyone who hadn't been a fan of the comic series and/or was unaware of its history. However, most of these things could be learned by simply reading the Wikipedia articles on the subject.  Green Lantern is a modern retelling of how Hal Jordan becomes the first human Green Lantern. The straightlaced Hal Jordan from the comics is replaced by the rather roguish film version. I find the film version much easier to relate to, as he has problems with commitment to relationships, self-doubts and more than the usual helping of cockiness.  Suddenly, he finds himself given the enormous responsibility of being a Green Lantern, who is charged with the guardianship of an entire sector of space, including all star systems and sentient species within them. Some people have labelled Hal as being whiny, but if I suddenly was given this kind of a burden, I might have some doubts as to my ability to carry it out and I think any honest person would have to admit the same.  The Green Lantern Corps is shown as having faults of its own, as well. Sinestro, who is apparently the leading Green Lantern, displays more than a little arrogance in his belief that the Corps has never been defeated and never will be, which is proved incorrect early on. The news comes as quite a shock to him early in the film. The Guardians also show doubts in their own abilities, as well as a habit of withholding needed information when they are afraid of the consequences of revealing their own past mistakes.  Overall, this is a good movie and I look forward to a sequel.
0300169787|5.0|It's a really really perfect book. it covers everything and it has the best peices of his collections! I love it and i keep going back. I own many books about Alexander Mcqueen but this is certainly the best!
B005KDWUFA|5.0|I have all the recordings of the group, IL Divo. This new offering of their's is the best of all I have.  Gorgeous songs, gorgeous voices and gorgeous arrangements.  Wonderful all around.  I highly recommend it!
0446581356|4.0|It's a really good book for make up but mostly for professionals since it has many (!) informations you would not need if not a pro. But it really claers your head out when it comes to certain make up technics. It only shows the most popular of course, such us how to put on a red lipstick, smokey eyes, eyliner, shadow and stuff, but it covers pretty much the whole face!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|works perfect. wouldnt watch you tube without it ever again. I love dling them to my kindle fire in near hd quality
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Works great for Kindle Fire if you don't mind small adds in the the corner....so small I don't notice them unless I look for them.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|what is with the 20 words minimum requirement. This will stop most people from making a rating, unless that is the goal; to prevent people from making a rating. Truly, all I wanted to say is that this is a great app and its exactly what I needed. Excellent job.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Excellent in every way. Great, swift shipping and packaging. Item as described. These are excellent movies for one and all.
145551389X|5.0|This book is wonderful. Lady Gaga is captured in a range of moments from intimate hotel beds to her electrifying stage performances and everything inbetween. It makes a fantastic coffee table book and is really fun to look through with friends.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Give it a red five a black four a red three a black two a, well, you get the idea, right??
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This app is much better than the default pdf reader on the kindle fire.  1) it is much smoother, quickly loading files and scrolling is a breeze. 2) the zooming issues that plague the default reader (namely the inability to maintain the desired zoom level while changing pages and orientation) are absent here! a required app for serious pdf readers.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|This is a very useful and effective app, if you have any issues syncing your phone with your computer this will help.  I love the service and suggest everyone use it.
B0000025RI|5.0|Thriller has quite a reputation.  It's the single greatest selling album in the history of recorded music, haven won a record-breaking 8 Grammy's upon its release and continues to be highly regarded to this day, consistently ranking highly on basically all \\"best albums of all-time\\" lists.  So you could say that it's a pretty good album.  And that (obviously) would be putting it mildly.  This was Michael Jackson's breakthrough album, released a few years after his solo debut Off The Wall (which is also a great album in it's own right), Thriller catapulted Michael Jackson into the stratosphere of popular culture, music, and stardom.  It's an incredibly catchy dance-pop album, loaded with classic hits which are surrounded by equally infectious supporting tracks, amounting to an enthralling and exhilarating listening experience.  Everyone knows the classics like \\"Thriller\\", \\"Beat It\\", and \\"Billie Jean\\" (the latter being perhaps the greatest dance song of all-time), but what really makes Thriller such a great album are the consistently good supporting tracks on the album.  Take the invigorating opening track for example \\"Wanna Be Startin Something\\".  Perhaps the 2nd best song on the entire album, it's a tour-de-force dance-pop song which still sounds fresh, exhilarating, and exciting to this day.  The \\"mama-say-mama-sah-ma-ma-coo-sah\\" part is the climax of the song, and really highlights the celebratory vibe of the track.  The next track \\"Baby Me Mine\\" is an incredibly smooth, soulful, grooving track with a great R&B flavor.  Phenomenal beat.  \\"The Girl is Mine\\" follows, featuring trade-off vocals between Jackson and none other than the great Paul McCartney.  It's a corny track, but it has a sweet, endearing quality that makes it work.  The middle of the album is jam-packed with the 3 classics \\"Thriller\\", \\"Beat It\\", and \\"Billie Jean\\".  The fact that these 3 tracks are all placed sequentially in the middle of the album really adds to the power of the record as a whole.  It kind of feels like you're listening to a \\"greatest-hits\\" album as these tracks roll by, as you would be hard pressed to find 3 powerhouse tracks like those stacked side-by-side on any other dance-pop album, which really showcases the fact that Michael Jackson was operating at his artistic peak at the time.  Most artists would be lucky to come up with just 1 song as good as any of those for an album, let alone 3 back to back.  Quite impressive.  After the tri-fecta of singles, the listener is treated to the incredibly sweet and sensitive \\"Human Nature\\" which is a good reflection of the singer himself.  It's got a really beautiful melody that is complimented well by Jackson's soft, soulful singing.  The dance-funk them comes back in full force with \\"P.Y.T\\" which sports one of the best pure dance-beats on the entire album.  Thriller then closes out with the somewhat underwhelming \\"The Lady in my Life\\" ending the album on a soft, melancholy note.  Aside from that borderline lackluster song, and the corny yet endearing \\"The Girl is Mine\\" every other song on Thriller is fantastic.  This was definitely Michael Jackson's best album, and really the last truly great album of his career.  It's also the last album where Jackson sounded like he was having fun, the last album where the prevailing vibe was joy, and not claustrophobic angst.  Jackson still had plenty of memorable hits left in him after this album, but he would never be able to put together an album that was as consistently fresh and brilliant as Thriller.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  Great story line.  Lots of action.  Definitely recommend this movie.  I could watch this movie a million time without getting tried of it.  Movie came fast in the mail.  I would definitely do business again with this seller.
B0039TD826|5.0|Plastic soul.  That was the tagline some placed on the Rolling Stones during their ascendance to rock & roll supremacy during much of the 1960s.  Sure they rocked and made great songs, but their efforts to channel the classic R&B influences that helped inspire their own unique brand of raunchy, blues-centric cock-rock didn't always translate well across the span of an entire album.  In fact, prior to Exile on Main St, the Stones hadn't really crafted an undisputed masterpiece of an album yet, and this was in an era when many of their peers were creating great, epic albums on a regular basis.  Sure Beggar's Banquet, Let It Bleed, and Sticky Fingers were good albums, each offering up their respective share of classic songs, but in between those great songs featured some less than stellar material.   Enter 1972, fresh off the heals of arguably their best album to date (Sticky Fingers), the Stones found themselves in, well, for lack of a better term, \\"exile\\" from England, haven fled the country to avoid paying excessive taxes before the government could seize their assets.  Keith Richards had developed a nasty heroin habit, and Mick Jagger had recently married and fathered a child with his new wife.  A lot was going on with the band, which makes it all the more extraordinary that they were able to come together and create the best album of their career, and one of the best pure rock and roll albums of all-time.  Exile starts out in a fairly underwhelming fashion, as the first handful of songs are all pretty good, but somewhat lack the punch or freshness of some of their earlier work (with the exception of \\"Rip This Joint\\" which is a riot).  It's not until the 5th track on the album \\"Tumbling Dice\\", that the listener is hit with a classic Rolling Stones masterpiece.  One of the band's greatest songs of all-time, \\"Tumbling Dice\\" is perhaps the best representation of why the early labels of \\"plastic soul\\" no longer applied to the Rolling Stones, as they really bring it alltogether on this track to create a near perfect rock & soul combination.  \\"Tumbling Dice\\" effectively kicks off the start of an absolutely fantastic set of songs that make up the middle section of the album.  These tracks are not in the vain of your typical cock-rock, prancing/posturing-type songs that the Stones are largely known for.  No, these songs actually have soul, and there's nothing plastic about it.  \\"Sweet Virginia\\" has an authentic, weary quality to it that sounds like it was recorded after last call at 4:00AM in a some dingy, old-school whisky-stained bar with a lot of character.  \\"Torn & Frayed\\" is another warm and soulful track, also weary in tone but with a country-flavor going on.  Not overtly country, but enough to make the song a unique and endearing.  \\"Sweet Black Angel\\" follows, continuing the soulful vibe of the prior tracks, but adding a quality of sweetness to the mix.  The streak of great songs peaks out with \\"Loving Cup\\" which opens with a beautiful piano intro that greets the listener like a warm fire on a cold and snowy winter's night.  It's a really beautiful song, and Mick Jagger's yearning singing only helps to accentuate the warm and soulful feel of the song.  Another classic in my book.  The album then takes a bit of a break from the more inimate vibe of the prior tracks with \\"Happy\\" and \\"Turd on the Run\\" which, to me, almost serve as a brief intermission from the barrage of soulful tracks that proceeded them.  \\"Ventilator Blues\\" starts the transition back into more soulful territory, although this is primarily an old-school, down-tempo blues song.  It eventually melts into the moving \\"I Just Want To See His Face\\", a beautiful, spiritual song that sounds as if it was cut live from a church on Sunday morning somewhere in the deep South.  It's mostly chanting, reverb, and light-drumming, but it has a very personal, holy quality to it that makes it a very gripping piece.  \\"I Just Want To See His Face\\" leads into possibly the best songon the album \\"Let It Loose\\".  If it's not the best song on the album, it certainly is the emotional climax, acting as the culmination of all the blues-soaked, rock & roll soul that leads up to the track.  Jagger really puts his heart into this song, and the backing female vocals definitely add to the soulful and emotional feeling the song possess.   After that, the album somewhat reverts back to the same vibe of the introductory songs on the album: good songs that rock, but aren't particularly great or epic in quality.  With the exception of \\"Shine A Light\\" (which reclaims the epic, soulful vibe of the middle-portion of the album) the remaining songs to a respectable job of closing out an overall great album.  A classic in most everybody's book, Exile on Main St is easily my personal favorite Rolling Stones album of all-time, not because it rocks, but because of the authenticity and beauty of it's soul.
0553579908|4.0|I actually am really enjoying this Series as a whole because it is gritty and not as wordy as most fantasy books, like Lord of the Rings. It is a really good sequel and I seriously can't put it down and can't wait until I can get the next books.
B000002I2M|5.0|\\"Well I've been down so god damn long, that it looks like up to me\\", sings Jim Morrison on album's 3rd track \\"Been Down So Long\\".  As the song and lyrics suggest, Jim Morrison is singing the blues the majority of the time on what would prove to the The Doors last album, L.A. Woman.   Morrison had good reason to be singing the blues.  It was 1971, and The Doors had been stirring up a heep of controversy the past few years on the US tour circuit, playing an exhausting amount of shows and Morrison himself having several run-ins with the law along the way.  By this time, Morrision had developed quite a reputation for himself as a hard-partying, controversial, drugged-out lead-singer of the one the most popular acts on the planet.  By the time L.A. Woman was recorded, all of the hard-partying, excessive drug use, and stress from touring was starting to take it's toll on Morrison personally.  He sounds weary and worn out on L.A. Woman, occassionally shouting himself hoarse on a couple of songs.  The album has more of a loose, bluesy, rock & roll sound to it than some of their past records which were more psychedelic in nature.  That's not to say there isn't a fair share of trippy songs on the album (it is The Doors after all) but the backbone of the album is more firmly rooted in the blues than any if their prior efforts.  Take the raucous opening track for example \\"The Changling\\".  This track bursts out of the gate with a borderline funky, danceable sound.  It's an up-tempo, adrenaline-pumping song and one of my personal favorites from the band.  \\"Love Her Madly\\" follows, which is one of The Doors most popular songs and another favorite of mine.  The blues really kicks in with the aforementioned \\"Been Down So Long\\".  It doesn't sound forced, it sounds sincere and rough, a genuinely good blues song.  Morrison sounds weary, reckless, and borderline pissed on this track, like he's genuinely fed up and sick & tired.  He really conveys a sense of drugged-out wearniess on thenext track \\"Cars Hiss By My Window\\" which is a hazy, slow, lethargic number, but no less interesting than the prior tracks.  The tempo kicks back up again for the epic title track, which again is another Doors classic, possibly my favorite song the band ever recorded.  One can't help but picture early 70s Los Angeles when you listen to this song, with all it's glitz, sleeze, and allure.  The \\"Mr. Mojo\\" build-up and release is absolutely fantastic and classic.  Probably the peak/climax of the entire album.  \\"L'america\\" follows, taking a page out of the Doors patented psychedelic playbook.  It's catchy and quite effective, managing to incorporate a bluesy swagger in the chorus admist the psychedelic backdrop of the song.  The next track \\"Hyacinth House\\" is one of the best songs on the album, oddly left out in many \\"best-of\\" compilations of the band's work.  It's a beautiful song, somewhat somber in tone.  It also has a kind of yearning, haunting vibe to it given the fact Morrison would not survive the rest of the year.  An endearing song, that kind of gives you a peak into Morrison's psyche at that perilous time in his life.  After a somewhat underwhelming blues song \\"Crawling King Snake\\" The Doors treat us to \\"The Wasp (Texas Radio and the Big Beat)\\" which is a fantastic blues-based song.  It features a rather odd arrangement, but it's quite catchy and another Doors classic.  The album closes out with the atmospheric \\"Rider's On the Storm\\".  Quite mellow and trippy in nature, it would turn out to be the final song on the final album Jim Morrison would ever record, which only accentuates the haunting, mysterious nature of the song.  It's a classic in anyone's book, and a fitting way to end a great album.  As previously mentioned, Jim Morrison would not survive the rest of the year after L.A. Woman was released.  Shortly after finishing the album, he left his bandmates behind and moved to Paris, where he would die of a heroin overdose a few months later.  Tragic as hisdeath was, he did manage to leave behind a fantastic swan song of an album, possibly The Doors best album of their career, firmly cementing their legacy as one of the greatest bands of all-time.

B000002LQR|5.0|Prior to 1991, the Red Hot Chili Peppers had broken a lot of ground musically.  They were one of the first bands to successfully infuse the disparate sounds funk, rap, and punk-rock together, creating a new and exciting brand of music in the process.  That said, prior to the release of their breakthrough album Blood Sugar Sex Magik, the general feeling about the Chili's was that they were a good band, a dynamic band, a fresh band, but they hadn't really harnessed their full potential yet.  In fairness, there were plenty of reasons for that.  Shortly after the band started to hit their stride with 1987's Uplift Mofo Party Plan, their founding guitar player Hillel Slovak died of a heroin overdose, which led to the departure of their drummer at the time, Jack Irons.  In the process of rebuilding the band, they struck gold with the additions of new drummer Chad Smith and a young guitar prodigy (and diehard fan of the band) John Frusciante.  The resulting album, Mother's Milk, was their most successful record to date, building on the raucous vibe of Uplift Mofo Party Plan while adding new melodic textures to the mix as well.  After recording that record, the band got an opportunity to truly gel on the subsequent tour, and they returned to the studio 2 years later to record their follow-up album.  Actually, they didn't record the album in a traditional studio, but rather the mansion that magician Harry Houdini lived in back in the 1920s (which was rumored by some members of the band to be haunted).  It's difficult to say how much of a factor the setting played in the resulting sound of the album, but for whatever reason, Blood Sugar Sex Magik sports a much different feel and vibe than any of the band's prior releases.  It's the sound of a band maturing and evolving as musicians, slowing down the tempos, getting deeper into the grooves, exploring the melodies, and adding a greater sense of emotional depth to the songs.  While prior albums focused primarily on speed and power, Blood Sugar Sex Magik emphasizes melody and restraint, and the result is more fully-realized, dynamically structured songs.  What's probably most noticeable about the band's sound on Blood Sugar Sex Magik is the evolution of John Frusciante's guitar playing, and the newfound chemistry between himself, Flea, and Chad Smith.  Frusciante's playing on Mother's Milk was powerful and distortion-heavy, as he would later comment that he felt his playing on the album was \\"too macho\\" in sound.  As impressive sonically as his playing was on Mother's Milk, he really takes his craft to a new level on Blood Sugar Sex Magik, albeit with a much different style.  His playing is almost spare in comparison, with much more focus on melody and less emphasis on power cords.  As a result, this minimalistic approach allowed more room for Flea to focus on the groove and less on his traditionally fast, slap-bass style.  Flea and Frusciante play off of each other brilliantly throughout the album, and Chad Smith's drumming compliments them well with his more rhythmic, beat-focused style.  He's not trying to pummel his drumkit on this album, he's more concerned with the beat.  So in a nutshell, the band sound much more chilled-out on Blood Sugar Sex Magik, and their chemistry as a group was at it's peak.  Not only was the band musically clicking on all cylinders, but frontman Anthony Kiedis really steps up his game as a vocalist as well.  Kiedis sounds much more focused and seasoned on the album, and his lyrics reflect that on the majority of the songs.  Take the rap-tastic opening track for example \\"Power of Equality\\".  Kiedis comes out like a prize-fighter heading into a heavy-weight bout, with his pointed and topical raps flowing out effortlessly as the band jams to an infectious groove behind him.  The song soon transitions to the hypnotically funky \\"If You Have to Ask\\".  The Chili's really ascend to new heights on this track, as Kiedis spits stream-of-consciousness-type lyrics amidst the sublimely chill backdrop of Flea's bass, Chad's drums, and John's noodling on guitar, occasionally interrupted by the giddy chorus of the song, adding a quirky brand of soul and funk to the mix.  The song ends with an absolutely disgustingly gritty and dirty guitar solo by Mr. Frusciante, one the best solo's of his career.   If you happen to be listening to the beginning of this album in the right setting, preferably on a warm sunny beach with an ice cold beer handy, it is a fact that you will start levitating out of your body during the course of \\"If You Have to Ask\\", as your soul, body, and mind become one with the music and the surrounding serenity.  It has that effect, and it's that good.  If you haven't started levitating with \\"If You Have to Ask\\" you most certainly will on the following track \\"Breaking The Girl\\".  Simply put, this is easily one of the best Chili Peppers songs of all time, possessing an almost spiritual quality with it's soulful acoustic sound.  It's a beautiful song, it's sweet, heavily melodic, yet still sounds very raw at the same time.  It sounds almost tribal in nature, particularly the drum-jam towards the end of the song, which really captures the emotionally rawness of the track.  This song sounds ancient and timeless, really a unique piece in the Chili Pepper's catalog and easily one of the best songs they (or anybody) ever created.  After the incredibly dynamic nature of the opening tracks, the Chili's really kick-back and settle into their down-tempo groove on \\"Funky Monks\\", an aptly titled track that is laid-back and funky in nature.  It sounds right at home on any hot summer day, with its chilled-out beachy vibe.  The boys then kick up the tempo with the incredibly awesome \\"Suck My Kiss\\".  This song rocks hard, and has one of the sickest rhythms on the entire album.  And it doesn't rock hard because it's heavy (it's not really) but rather because of its driving, infectious groove which is virtually impossible to sit still to.  This song is funk-rock personified and another Chili Peppers classic.  The following track is also a Chili Peppers classic in most people's book, albeit a somewhat under-rated classic since it was never released as a single.  \\"I Could Have Lied\\" is effectively the first ballad on a Chili's album and it works quite well.  This is a perfect example of Kiedis's newfound emotional depth as a lyrist, as he delivers this song with an earnest and heartfelt sincerity.  It has a somewhat somber tone, sounding convincingly authentic in the process.  A fantastic ballad and real highlight.  If one is not listening closely, the next 2 tracks \\"Mellowship Slinky in B Major\\" and \\"The Righteous and the Wicked\\" might sound like borderline filler material sandwiched between a great ballad and the notorious single \\"Give It Away\\".  But in actuality, both songs feature some of Frusciante's most dynamic and intricate guitar playing on the entire album.  \\"Mellowship...\\" starts out with a raunchy, classic-rock inspired opening jam that quickly transitions into a funky and quirky sound with Frusciante and Flea delicately playing off one another.  \\"The Righteous and the Wicked\\" has a bluesy down-tempo sound.  It's got a gritty and soulful \\"slow-burn\\" vibe to it, another high quality contribution from the band.  The aforementioned \\"Give It Away\\" follows, which is a classic in anyone's book.  Similar in sound to \\"Suck My Kiss\\" this song was THE summer anthem for years to come, largely because of Kiedis's infamous lyrics and delivery.  It's catchy, there's no way around it, but what's most impressive about this song is again Frusciante's guitar playing.  Nobody sounded like this guy back then, as his unique style is really on full display on this track.  Chad's drumming provides the absolutely perfect beat for Flea and John to noodle around each other, and with Kiedis's catchy and smooth flow laid on top, you have a quintessential Chili Peppers classic.  The Chili's take the tempo down a notch with the slow and sultry title track, which provides a nice buffer between the 2 biggest singles on the album.  But to call the following track a \\"single\\" really does not do \\"Under the Bridge\\" justice.  This song is so much more than that.  It's not just a good catchy song, its the best song of the Chili Peppers career, and in my personal opinion, the best song of the entire decade, and depending on my mood, the best song ever.  Period.  It's difficult to describe how powerfully this song resonates with me on an emotional level.  It's a song about loneliness and it's a sad song, yes, but it does not feel too weighty or negative.  It has an uplifting quality as well.  The honesty and beauty of the song make it all the more powerful.  Although somber in tone, it is light on its feet, thanks to John's intricate noodling throughout.  It just has an incredibly relatable quality that is really unexplainable.  The song is soothing, soulful, honest, relatable, endearing, unique, and beautiful.  It's \\"Under the Bridge\\" and it's one of my personal favorite songs of all time.  Its virtually impossible to follow-up a song like that, but the Chili's do a fine job of it by kicking up the tempo with the incredibly fun \\"Naked In the Rain\\".  Flea's bass-line is wickedly funky and danceable on this song, and it possesses such an upbeat quality that it manages to suck you right out of the emotional weight that proceeded it and back into the infectious funk-rock vibe that dominates the album.  Speaking of funk, the following track \\"Apache Rose Peacock\\" is one of the most groovingly funky songs on the album, with its laid-back swagger.  A great song and another highlight on the album.  \\"The Greeting Song\\" follows, kicking up the tempo again in the same vain as \\"Naked In the Rain\\", as by this point in the album, the Chili's have established an infectiously fun vibe that flows through the songs following \\"Under the Bridge\\".  That fun vibe continues with the soulful and endearing \\"My LovelyMan\\" an ode to the bands fallen guitarist Hillel Slovak.  Not only does the song rock, but it is funky as hell and celebratory in nature.  Flea contributes some fantastic bass to close out the song, as Chad Smith jams away behind him, the sound becoming gradually spare and sweeter in nature towards the end.  Overall a righteous tribute Slovak (R.I.P.)  To close out the album, the band saves their raunchiest, dirtiest song for last with \\"Sir Psycho Sexy\\".  As the title suggests, this song is laced with sex-obsessed lyrics that only add to its raunchy vibe.  But the band manages to ascend above the hedonistic vibe by closing out the song with a sublimely smooth and beautiful melody.  The instrumental jam that dominates the 2nd half of the song is wickedly sublime, and effectively finishes the album on a transcendent note.  Well, that's not entirely true, as the Chili's throw-in a quick and spastic track \\"They're Red Hot\\" to officially close out the album, which most folks could probably do without, but who's complaining?  So despite the record ending on a slightly quirky note, \\"They're Red Hot\\" does nothing to take away from an overall outstanding album.  Not only is Blood Sugar Sex Magik outstanding, but it stands to this day as the best album of the Red Hot Chili Peppers career, in addition to being one of the best (or in my opinion THE best) albums of the 1990s.  And why?  Because this album has it all.  Funk, rock, rap, punk, ballads.  You name it, it has it.  Not only that, but look at the people delivering the goods.  Flea is one of the most influential bass players of all time and he expanded his style greatly on this album. John Frusciante is one of the greatest guitar players of his generation, and in many circles one of the greatest guitar players of all time.  He really came into his own on this album and made a name for himself.  His guitar playing on Blood Sugar Sex Magik speaks for itself.  Chad Smith contributed the perfect beats to compliment Flea andJohn, proving himself to the one of the best drummers in the business in the process.  And Anthony Kiedis delivered his best lyrics and vocal performance of his career, and he has yet to top it.   Sometimes everything comes together at the right time for a band, and that was certainly the case for the Red Hot Chili Peppers on Blood Sugar Sex Magik, an album that still sounds as fresh and original today as it did way back in 1991.  A classic album, the Chili's at their peak, and my pick for best album of the 1990s.
B002ASVYPU|5.0|This is the first CD that I purchased from this band and I really liked it. Several of my favorite songs were on it but I fell in love with a few of the others especially \\"I'm Yours\\". Very pleased :)
B000003TA4|5.0|1991 was a big year for music, namely, alternative rock.  The seeds for the alternative rock revolution had been planted in the prior years by bands like the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Jane's Addiction, NIN, and Faith No More, each contributing classic albums with their own unique, dymanic sound.  Alternative rock wasn't quite mainstream when 1991 started, but by the time the year was over, it had exploded onto the scene thanks in large part to Nirvana's breakthough album Nevermind.  Prior to 1991 and the release of Nevermind, Nirvana were largely unknown outside of the Seattle grunge circuit.  They released their debut album Bleach in 1989, which was largely ignored in the press and received very little acclaim as a result.  While Bleach was certainly not a bad album by any means, it wasn't great either, toting the line between Melvins-inspired alt-rock and lunk-headed pop-rock, it was a sloppy, somewhat abrasive album by a band that showed some potential, but sounded too raw to create anything particularly brilliant, let alone classic.  And perhaps that is one of the reasons why Nevermind sounds so fresh and engaging.  Where it's predecessor was harsh, jagged, and blunt, Nevermind is polished, smooth, and laid-back.  Even when the album rocks-out hard, it sounds easy and effortless in the process, giving it an accessible quality admist the fuzzed-out, murky backdrop.  It's all apart of Nirvana's unique style, a style best encapsulated in the classic opening track \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\".  This song almost single-handedly blew the door of the proverbial hinges of alternative-rock, catapulting the band and the scene into the national mainstream.  For such a popular song, it's surprisingly heavy for the most part, but it also sports a tossed-off, slacker quality that effectively channeled the disenfranchised Gen-X vibe that was so prevalent at the time.  Overall, it's a great song that is a classic in pretty much every critical circle imaginable.  But what really makesNevermind such a great album is it's lazy, mid-tempo groove, and no song better captures that feeling than \\"In Breed\\".  It rocks hard, yet it's steady and easy, sporting it's own unique vibe that is unmistakably Nirvana.  Aside from the steady groove that dominates the majority of the album, there is also a fair amount of variety as well.  There are a few up-tempo, punk-rock infused songs that add a sense of fun to the album, i.e. \\"Breed\\", \\"Territorial Pissings\\", and \\"Stay Away\\".  All of these songs rock hard, but not in a threatening way.  There's not really a sense of anger or rage in these songs, it's more a sense of earnest, propulsive grit that drives the songs forward, a style that is distinctive to Nirvana's sound.  The other side of Nirvana's sound, and what truly made them a special band, was their ability to create uniquely personal and authentic ballads.  Ballads may not be the best description of such classics as \\"Come As You Are\\" or \\"Lithium\\" as they are not traditional cheesey ballads, but they do have a sing-along, laid-back quality that make them unique to Nirvana.  Kurt Cobain had a special ability to sound incredibly sincere in his singing, with his natural, un-forced delivery, a delivery that really shines through on those two classics.  The album closes with the haunting acoustic number \\"Something In the Way\\" which is quiet and spare in tone, similar to the other other acoustic track on the album \\"Polly\\".  Both of these tracks give the album a sense of solace admist the fuzzy, thrashy backdrop that dominates the majority of the album.  They give the album variety and an added sense of weight.  Nevermind is universally praised and recongized as one of the most important and influential albums of the 1990s, and is often considered to be one of the best albums of all-time in most critical circles.  With such lofy praise, you might expect the album to sound larger than life, or epic, or grand in sound and structure.   The truth is it doesn't sound like that at all.  It sounds laid-back, smooth, and polished.  What really makes this a classic album is Kurt Cobain's honesty and sincerity, which really pours out of every song on the album.  Not only that, but it's Nirvana's unique vibe, a sound that compliments Kurt's authentic style, a style that would be often imitated over the years, but never duplicated.

B000078DOI|5.0|A lot had happened to the Red Hot Chili Peppers between the release of their prior album Uplift Mofo Party Plan in 1987 and 1989's Mother's Milk.  Their founding guitar player, Hillel Slovak, died of a heroin overdose in 1988, and their drummer Jack Irons subsequently quit the band as a result, leaving only Anthony Kiedis and Flea left to pick up the pieces.  Admist such devastation and heartbreak, most bands would have probably packed it up and called it a day, but Kiedis and Flea decided to press on, recruiting new drummer Chad Smith and a 19 year old kid (and diehard fan of the band) named John Frusciante to take up lead guitar duties.  In the process, Anthony Kiedis sobered up and kicked his own nasty heroin addiction, and with that, a new era of the Red Hot Chili Peppers was born.  John Frusciante certainly had some big shoes to fill in replacing Slovak and as well as the pressure of playing alongside his favorite band, but it soon becomes clear over the course of the album that Frusciante was more than capable of delivering the hard rock goods, proving to be a very gifted guitarist in his own right.  His explosive guitar playing is all the more impressive considering the fact that he was only 19 years old at the time.  Somewhat surprisingly, the Chili's suffered very little in the way of growing pains with the addition of 2 brand new members to the band, as Mother's Milk basically picks up right where Uplift Mofo Party Plan left off, with the raucous and celebratory opener \\"Good Time Boys\\".  It's not quite as good of an opener as \\"Fight Like A Brave\\" but it's pretty damn close, effectively establishing that the new lineup of the Chili's were just as explosive sonically as the original, and that the they were back in full force, and ready to rock.  They sound rejuvinated and exciting on \\"Good Time Boys\\" like they're ready to conquer the world (which they effectively would in a few years time).  After that explosive opener, the band serves up the best cover songof their career with \\"Higher Ground\\".  If you thought it was impossible to top Stevie Wonder's classic original, you haven't heard the Chili's rendition.  It is a seriously hard-rocking, pulsating, thrash-tastic song, further solidifying that the new lineup of the Chili Peppers were truly onto something special.  The intensity and high-energy continues on the next track \\"Subway to Venus\\", as the band pulls out all the stops on this song, blazing guitar, dizzyingly fast drumming, and they even throw in some horns for good measure, a sign of the band's increasingly more dynamic sound.  After the spastic ode to the Lakers on \\"Magic Johnson\\", the Chili's push the boundaries of of their sonic capabilities with the powerful \\"Nobody Weird Like Me\\".  It is almost overwhelming in it's speed and intensity, but that only adds to the song's power.  It rocks hard, really hard, impressively so, before slowing it down at the end of the song with a sick, psychedelic-flavored down-tempo jam.  Wicked song.  After that set of songs, the Chili's have more than made their point that they can rock really, really hard and fast, which is great, but the best is yet to come.  The band really take their sound to a new level on the next 2 tracks, which are arguably the best 2 tracks on the entire album.  \\"Knock Me Down\\" and \\"Taste the Pain\\" aren't the best songs on the album because they're the fastest, the loudest, or the heaviest, but rather because of their melodies and structure.  \\"Knock Me Down\\" is an absolutely righteous Chili Peppers classic, and is really the first time Anthony Kiedis ups his game lyrically, actually delivering a positive, heartfelt message with an earnest and sincere vibe.  Its easily one of the best songs of their career, still holding up to this day alongside their many classics.  Righteous.  Another under-rated classic is \\"Taste the Pain\\", which is one of the funkiest, coolest songs the Chili's ever made.  It's just a rad song, difficult to describe, but it has agreat chorus, a sultry vibe, and a fantastic horn solo by Flea.  It closes out on a beautifully sublime, mellow note.  Overall a great song, and along with \\"Knock Me Down\\" it really showcases the dynamic new range that John Frusciante brought to the band, along with Kiedis's newly found knack for melody in his delivery.  Speaking of melody, the Chili's turn in their best instrumental piece of their career on the beautiful and sensual \\"Pretty Little Ditty\\".  It's somewhat in the same vain as \\"Behind the Sun\\" but with a more dymanic and sublime melody.  Really a beautiful piece.  Another highlight on the album is the sultry \\"Sexy Mexican Maid\\".  John's guitar playing on this song is lights-out, and the band even throws in a saxaphone into the mix, which suits the song's hedonistic vibe.  It's a delightfully funky and dirty song.  So overall, despite a couple of songs that sound a bit too rushed/underdeveloped (but would be undeniably fun in a live setting) Mother's Milk is a fantastic album that pushed the boundaries of what the band could do sonically while adding new melodic textures into the frey as well.  The result is a fresh, exciting sound from a band that was on the cusp of realizing their true potential, something they would finally achieve with flying colors on their next album Blood Sugar Sex Magik.

B000005DQR|5.0|DJ Shadow's debut album was met with widespread critical acclaim, toping numerous best-of lists for 1996, and eventually best-of lists for the 1990s as a whole.  In some circles (including mine) this is not only one of the best albums of the 90s, but also one of the best albums of all-time.  A sprawling, down-tempo instrumental masterpiece, Endtroducing plays out like a dark, intimate journey through the history of soul, R&B, jazz, and of course: hip-hop.  Listening to this album is like taking a trip through an endless urban cityscape of dark alley-ways, dim-lit jazz clubs, seedy backstreets, glitzy skylines, basically through the heart and soul of a city.  Along the way, haunting and timeless characters pop up here and there, which only serves to enhance the unique, mysterious spell that Endtroducing casts on its listeners, or at least those listeners that are picking up the vibe.  That vibe can be described in many ways: soulful, sensual, smooth, dark, etc.  Those are the predominate themes that permeate throughout the album, propelled forward by a steady undercurrent of down/mid-tempo hip-hop beats.  This album is incredibly sensual and smooth.  One moment you will find yourself bobbing your head to the music, and the next you'll find yourself transfixed by the all-encompassing, spiritual mood.  Take \\"Building Steam With A Grain of Salt\\" the first proper song on the album.  This song never fails to send chills up my spine, and sets the tone for the entire album.  It is almost impossible not to bob your head to this song, but there is no hype to be found here.  Like most songs on the album, there is a dark undercurrent to the hip-hop beats that is quite engaging and demands attention.  The subtle textures to the track, like the piano, the guitar sample, add a sense of drama to the song.  \\"Building Steam With A Grain of Salt\\" acts like the gateway inviting the listener into the world that is Entroducing.  It's intense.  The next track \\"The Number Song\\" kicks up the tempo a notch, and is probably the most up-tempo number on the entire album.  But that up-tempo quality does not sound forced or hype, as there are enough twists and turns on the song to keep the listener's attention, including a very cool jazz/soul breakdown, and then an otherworldly and brooding drum-solo to close out the track.  Wicked.  Possibly the smoothest track on the album \\"Changeling/Transmission 1\\" has a warm/numbing vibe to it that is almost mournful in quality.  It's a really beautiful piece.  \\"What Does Your Soul Look Like\\" follows, featuring an equally smooth sound, but perhaps a bit darker in mood and overall vibe than the prior track.  After a brief skit that adds personality to the album, \\"Stem/Long Stem/Transmission 2\\" kicks in, and kicks up the intensity in the process.  One of the longest compositions on the album, this piece is a roller coaster ride of varying tempos, moods, and emotions, a good microcosm of Entroducing as a whole.  It is truly a haunting piece with an almost spiritual quality to it.  Beautiful.  \\"Mutual Slump\\" kicks up the tempo similar to \\"The Number Song\\" and still manages to retain that dark/mysterious quality that the other songs possess.  \\"Organ Donor\\" does a masterful job of merging the two disparate ideas of combining an organ with hip-hop beats to create an infectiously head-bobbing track.  The brief, but sensual \\"Why Hip Hop Sucks in 96\\" quickly transitions to \\"Midnight In A Perfect World\\" one of the best tracks on the entire album.  It combines the best elements of some of the prior tracks into a more focused, tight and smooth composition.  It's incredibly soulful, sensual, and spiritual.  The next track \\"Napalm Brain/Scatter Brain\\" starts out with a slow, grooving, chill, head-bobbing beat that eventually transitions into a borderline house-flavored sound.  After peaking out in intensity, the track ends with a calming keyboard/synth that really adds to the atmosphere.  The last track on the album \\"What Does Your Soul Look Like (Part 1): Blue Sky Revisit/Transmission 3\\" closes out the album in a soulful/mournful kind of way.  It too is a beautiful piece, and a fitting way to end an incredible album.  So I've probably ran words like \\"dark, soulful, sensual, smooth, etc\\" into the ground by now, but these are all fitting descriptions for an amazing album the likes of Entroducing.  Listening to this album is an experience, the same way people say listening to Dark Side of the Moon is an experience, or Sgt Pepper.  It has its on unique vibe, its own unique soul, its own unique spirit.  Truly a special album, and one of my personal favorite albums of all-time.
B000VECAC6|5.0|Previous DVD releases of this movie had awful sound transfers.  This Blu-ray release has fixed that and it sounds fantastic.  The movie looks great too with lots of extras.  Very happy.
B000002LRX|5.0|Angel Dust was released 3 years after Faith No More's breakthrough album The Real Thing, which brought the band a great deal of commercial success and critical acclaim.  With their hit single \\"Epic\\" and the associated infamous video for the song, Faith No More were riding the huge alternative-rock wave that was cascading through the early 90s music scene.<br /><br />So what would they do for a follow up?  With the prospect of more fame and fortune knocking at their door, Faith No More decided to send a big, collective FU to the mainstream by producing one of the most difficult, inaccessable follow-ups to a hit record in recent memory.  And while Angel Dust may certainly be a bit more of a challenging listen that it's predecessor, it is certainly no less rewarding, and in many respects, is equally as good if not better than The Real Thing, at least from an artistic-merit prospective.<br /><br />One of the first things that is noticable about Angel Dust compared to The Real Thing is the change in Mike Patton's singing voice from a nasally tone to a more more mature, fuller sounding tone.  That was certainly an improvement in most people's eyes.  Additionally, the album is much more sinister in nature that it's predecessor.  The opener \\"Land of Sunshine\\" sets the tone for the entire album, with it's funky, menacingly mocking vibe.  They also bring the heavy on this album too, as evidenced by the next track \\"Caffeine\\", which is one of Faith No More's heaviest songs of all-time.  The song's mid-tempo thrashing is infectious, and Mike Patton is in full psycho mode with his threatening delivery.<br /><br />After one of the more accessible (but no less cool) tracks on the album \\"Midlife Crisis\\" the album starts to get weirder and weirder, steadily decending into stranger and more experimental territory, like a sinister ride through a twisted funhouse of country music, metal, tribal chanting, cheerleader-led choruses, eerie keyboards, wickedly funky basslines, and thrashy yet danceable drum beats.  Throw in Jim Martin's unique brand of guitar playing and you have Faith No More reaching their full potential with Mike Patton, who acts as the mad-scientist leading this incredibly maniacal, bad-ass monster.<br /><br />It's a beautiful thing, and the climax of the album hits with \\"Jizzlobber\\" (see mad-scientist reference above).  Truly a menacing piece of work, and quite brilliant.<br /><br />After this album, the lynchpin of the group, guitarist Jim Martin, would leave the band, and Faith No More would never really be the same again.  They put out a couple of decent albums a few years down the road, but they never would be able to capture the evil-genius quality that permiates through Angel Dust.  Truly one of the best and too often overlooked albums to come out of the 90s.
B006O5Y0SS|5.0|The long lead-in showing scenes in Paris had me wondering....but it was nice to look at.   The movie's first ten minutes had me wondering....to stay or not to stay.  After that I stopped wondering... it just got better and better....and better (and I am NOT a Woody Allen fan).  Almost anything else I praise about this film will act as a spoiler.  My wife and I intend to see it again...and soon
B000002H33|5.0|1986.  The year (and the decade for that matter) was not a particularly good one for music generally speaking.  Almost all the great icons of the 60s and 70s had either become irrelevant (Dylan, Rolling Stones, Bowie) or had broken up (Zeppelin, Pink Floyd) and the rock music scene had turned into an embarassing charade of cheesey, materialistic hair-metal bands and spineless synth-based pop-rock groups that made boring, uninspiring, and dreadful music.  Fortunately, such a generic music scene often breeds new, inspired brands of music, often as a reaction against the hopelessly dull status quo.  In this case, I am refering to heavy-metal, or more specifically, thrash-metal.  By 1986, heavy-metal had been around for over a decade, thanks to godfathers Black Sabbath, and the new wave of British metal bands like Iron Maiden, etc.  Those type of heavy-metal bands were generally ignored in the press however, and not really taken seriously as a legitimate, quality form of music.  Metallica, moreso than any other band, helped change that perception.  And although their 1986 masterpiece Master of Puppets got zero radioplay and won very vew accolades at the time, it did start get people's attention somewhat.  Master of Puppets helped prove that heavy-metal was more than just about how fast and loud a band could play, but that it could legitimately have artistic merit too.  Take the title track for example.  More than just a head-banging thrash-metal song, it reveals many layers as the song progresses.  It's effectively more of a composition than just a song, and although Metallica had constructed some impressive compositions before (\\"Fade to Black\\" and Call of Ktulu\\" come to mind) they are really on top of their game here on Master of Puppets.  There's really no better example of that than on \\"Orion\\" which is probably Metallica's best instrumental composition they ever recorded.  It's also probably one of their most impressive songs period, lyrics be dammed.  Every member of the band displays their musical chops on this track, and it's probably the climax of the Cliff Burton era for the band.  At one moment steady and driving, the next soothing and smooth, all with a healthy dose of the band's patented thrash thrown in for good messure.  It's got an epic feel to it which is fitting for such a grand, epic album.  Aside from those brilliiant compositions, the band also manages to mix in a nice variety of other metallic flavors throughout the album as well.  Their full-speed-ahead thrash shines through on the opener \\"Battery\\" the closer \\"Damage, Inc\\" and the biting \\"Disposable Heros\\".  These songs absolutely slay the listener with a barrage of speed-metal riffs and enough twists and turns to make your head spin.  My neck is sore just thinking about them.  \\"Leper Messiah\\", which also has it's fair share of speed-metal riffs, is actually most impressive with it's bombastic mid-tempo stomp that opens the track and dominates the majority of the song.  For lack of a better term, it's incredibly badass.  The same can also be said for the epic \\"Thing Which Should Not Be\\" which also a sports a more mid-tempo style that only adds to the menacing power of the song.  It pounds and grinds along, sounding like a steady rumble of thunder in the process.  This track more than any other on the album shows that you don't have to play fast to convey power and heaviness.  And it wouldn't be a classic Metallica album without a classic Metallica ballad to go along with it, and \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\" serves it's purpose well.  It's another great composition, with more impressive guitar playing, and a great chorus to go along with it.  Fantastic song and simply one of the band's best.  So overall, Master of Puppets is an epic powerhouse of a thrash-metal album, showcasing how good of a band Metallica actually was at the time.  This would be the band's last album with their famed bass player Cliff Burton, who would die in a tragic bus accident soon after the album was released.  He really shines through on this album, along with Kurt Hammet, who's guitar playing is legendary throughout the record.  James Hetfield is also in full command here, with pointed lyrics and powerful guitar playing himself.  And while Lars will never be known as one of the greatest drummers around, he does have excellent timing and rhythm which fits perfectly with the band's sound.  Master of Puppets is Metallica's best album, and in my opinion, one of the best albums of the entire decade.  Metallica deserve extra kudos for spearheading the genre of thrash-metal right down the throats of all the spineless, pretty boy hair-bands that were dominating the hard-rock scene in the 1980s.  While most bands were more concerned about making money, fancy cars, and a prettyboy image to get on MTV/radio, Metallica served as the antithesis to the hollow, materialistic scene that surrounded them.  They had grit, principle, and the musical chops to boot.   In 1986, they hit their peak and made a classic album, one which should certainly be in every heavy-metal fan's collection.
B004EQAVHI|5.0|I've watched this film now 3 times in the last 3 days. The first time I saw it, I came into it about 15 minutes late but it caught my attention and I stayed with it. The second time was to see the first 15 minutes I'd missed and then watched the entire thing again...the third time just now. Some of the objections brought up by reviewers seem to be by people who want logic in what is an unlogical world. Why didn't they just walk away and (SPOILERS) avoid their destiny? They were conditioned, entirely conditioned, to fulfill a destiny. The conditioning was so strong that they never considered the possibility of walking away. In a very real sense, they never grew up - they remained quite immature in their understanding of choices and taking chances and how the world might work more in their favor, other than pursuing deferments, which, of course, never existed......<br /><br />Andrew Garfield's acting brought me to tears, especially his sensitivity and the painful realization that the powers-that-be would question that they had souls....that they were disposable....and the scream of pure agony towards the end of the movie...Carey Mulligan was subtle in her acting and all the more heartbreaking because of it. Keira Knightly seemed to be perfect for the part she played but she reminded me much of herself in other movies....<br /><br />This most definitely is not a movie to be taken lightly.  It bears looking at because it questions what life is.  In this brave new world, when cloning is becoming a reality, how would we feel or deal with the moral issues concerning bringing a life into this world only to harvest its organs?  Would \\"it\\" have feelings? Would \\"it\\" want a life of its own?  Would we me \\"murdering\\" when we harvest?  What if we only clone an organ? How much different is that? It is, after all, only a liver, maybe. It wouldn't have feelings....I may take this too far but these are things that this movie made me consider.<br /><br />On another note, the music is heartbreaking and matches the movie exactly.  I, btw, have ordered both the movie and the soundtrack.<br /><br />Be warned: this is definitely is not a happy  happy movie. It is a thinking-person's movie but only if you are prepared for it.ovie exactly.  I, btw, have ordered both the movie and the soundtrack.  Be warned: this is definitely is not a happy  happy movie.

B000067CPX|5.0|The Chili Pepper's 1999 album Californication propelled the band back onto the radar of the alternative rock scene, ranking highly on many \\"Best-Of\\" lists for the year and earning the Chili's a new generation of fans in the process.  The band's newfound sense of melody on Californication certainly had a lot to do with the success of the album, so it makes sense that the Chili's chose to further explore their melodic tendencies on their follow-up album By The Way.   That being said, what is somewhat surprising about By The Way is just how melody-intensive and subdued the album sounds compared to their prior efforts.  On By The Way, the Chili's have all but abandoned their hard hitting brand of funk-rock that made them famous.  In its place are mellower songs with sweeping choruses, lush guitar tones, subdued bass, easy rhythmic drumming, and an undeniably poppy vibe.  That's not to say that this newfound sense of melody is a bad thing, since it is hard to deny the fact that most of the Chili Pepper's best songs were those that carried the most emotional weight, which in turn were typically their ballads like \\"Under The Bridge\\" or \\"Scar Tissue\\" for example.  And the Chili's had certainly hinted at a more melodic direction as evidenced by several tracks on Californication, but By The Way really takes their melodic impulses into new territory.  And its interesting territory too, as while the vast majority of the album is quite poppy in nature, the band does a good job experimenting with some unique melodic textures throughout By The Way.  A good example of this is on \\"Universally Speaking\\", which has an almost magical, uplifting quality to it.  Its a joyous song with a beautiful melody, sounding almost Beatlesque with its hints of psychadelica in the chorus.   Other good examples of the Chili's broadening their sound include \\"The Zephyr Song\\" which features some computer generated beats and \\"Midnight\\" which includes a sweeping violin intro, creating a brooding yet sensual atmosphere for the song.  Both tracks feature memorable choruses and some beautiful melodies.  But as mentioned prior, the best songs on By The Way are those that carry the most emotional weight.  After the upbeat \\"Universally Speaking\\" the Chili's deliver 3 back-to-back moodier pieces, starting with the dark yet compelling \\"This is the Place\\", then the incredibly sweet and somber \\"Dosed\\", followed by the dreary yet gripping \\"Don't Forget Me\\".  These songs do an excellent job of sucking the listener into the album with their strong emotional resonance, giving the album a more personal and intimate feel.  That vibe continues on the romantic and endearing \\"I Could Die For You\\", which is a perfect segway into the equally sensual \\"Midnight\\".  It's hard to believe that the same guy who wrote \\"Sir Psycho Sexy\\" also wrote these 2 songs, which is just further evidence of how significantly different Anthony Kiedis's mindset was compared to a decade earlier.  But Kiedis can still spit white-boy raps with the best of them, as evidenced on the catchy \\"Can't Stop\\".  As a rapper, Kiedis sounds much more seasoned and wiser compared to his younger days on this track, which really adds to the endearing quality of the song.  \\"Cabron\\" is yet another highlight, with it's upbeat and light-hearted acoustic feel, and \\"On Mercury\\" recalls some of the old-school, beachy sound that dominated much of the Chili's classic Blood Sugar Sex Magik album.  But ultimately, the predominate vibe on By The Way is that of intimacy and warmth, so its fitting that the last track on the album \\"Venice Queen\\" effectively captures that spirit.  It's an endearing dedication to a friend of the band's who had recently passed, so it's a touching way to end a very emotionally heartfelt album.  By The Way reflects the sound of a band continuing to grow older and mature as musicians.  That being said, by putting such a strong emphasis on melodicsm, the Chili's also sacrifice some of the excitement, rawness, and energy that made them such a great band in the first place.  Ultimately though, despite the change in sound, By The Way is still a great album, not only because the melodies are legitimately very good, but mainly because of the Chili's ability to create a strong emotional resonance in their songs, which in turn gives the album a uniquely warm, initimate, and endearing vibe.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|Double-albums, by their very nature, can be difficult to digest.  They are often times meandering and bloated, usually with a fair amount of filler material to boot.  The reality is that it is quite difficult for any band (with the exception of The Beatles on the White Album) to cram 2 albums worth of material into 1 product, and have each song sound fresh, engaging, and keep the listener's attention over the course of 2 solid hours.  And as good of a band as The Red Hot Chili Peppers are, they too are not immune to the downfalls that accompany their sprawlling double-album Stadium Arcadium.  The record contains 28 songs total, evenly divided between 2 discs, the first being \\"Jupiter\\" and the second being \\"Mars\\".  Overall, Stadium Arcadium is a very good album, containing some exciting new songs that rank right up there with some of their classics.  That being said, this is a double-album, so for every great song on Stadium Arcadium, there seems to be a mediocre song to cancel it out, diluting the overall impact of the album in the process.  Additionally, the album suffers from a bit of a sequencing flaw, as there is not really a cohesive flow to a lot of the tracks, which makes Stadium Arcadium sound more like a collection of songs thrown together as opposed to a unified, solid album.  But as previously mentioned, Stadium Arcadium boasts some fantastic songs.  The opener \\"Dani California\\" is one of the catchiest Chili Peppers songs ever (which is really saying something), and features some lights-out guitar by John Frusciante, who by the way puts on an absolute clinic throughout the entire album.  Frusciante really pulls out all the stops on this album, channeling one of his main influences, Jimi Hendrix, in the process.  No doubt Jimi would be proud of John's blazing solos on this album.  They are really impressive to listen to amidist the all the catchy pop-rock found on Stadium Arcadium.  And it is understandable how you might get distracted by all the catchy songs on Stadium Arcadium and not even realize that Frusciante is putting on a clinic on guitar, as most of the tracks on the album are absolute ear-candy.  Take \\"Snow (Hey Oh)\\" for example.  This song has such a sweet melody and an engaging chorus that you might not notice the intricate interplay between Frusciante and Flea, which is really fantastic on this song.  As on more recent albums, the band manages to produce a strong and intense emotional feeling on this track, steadily building throughout the song and ending with a great guitar solo by Frusciante.  Possibly the best song on the album and definitely one of the Chili Pepper's best songs period.  The next track \\"Charlie\\" sports a funky, light-hearted vibe with a catchy and endearing chorus.  And once again, Frusciante provides a lights-out solo to close out the song.  Another highlight.  The Chili's also get back in touch with their funk roots on the infectious \\"Hump de Bump\\" which features some cool tribal drumming a trumpet provided by Flea.  A very cool, fun song.  \\"She's Only 18\\" is another highlight off the Jupiter disc, sporting a very cool, low-key, almost bluesy sound.  \\"Especially In Michigan\\" brings the pop-rock goods as well, sounding similar to \\"Fortune Faded\\" (a very catchy song from their Greatest Hits album.)  But perhaps the best song on the Jupiter disc is the spare and subdued \\"Slow Cheetah\\".  An acoustic ballad, \\"Slow Cheetah\\" effectively captures the strong emotional feeling that are apart of so many Chili Pepper classics.  Its got a haunting stillness to it, and a somewhat spiritual quality. This song is under the radar for a lot of folks, but it is an absolute gem and easily one of the best songs on the album, as well as one of the best songs of the band's career.  Who says you can't make catchy songs that are also compelling at the same time?  \\"Slow Cheetah\\" is a good example of that.  After a few underwhelming tracks to close out the Jupiter disc, the Mars disc opens up with the weighty and yearning \\"Desecration Smile\\".  Then the band kicks up the tempo with \\"Tell Me Baby\\" which is a good old-fashioned Chili Peppers funk-rock song, featuring Kiedis's patented rapping and a very catchy chorus to boot.  \\"21st Century\\" follows, which is also a very cool song with some funky bass playing from Flea.   The Chili's then reach back into their \\"romantic\\" bag of tricks with the incredibly sweet \\"She Looks To Me\\" which is in the same vein as \\"I Could Die for You\\" from By The Way.  It's another highlight on the album, accentuating the bands sensual style.  On the opposite end of the spectrum is \\"Readymade\\" which features a hard-rocking, almost headbanging groove that is almost impossible not to bob your head to.  It's got a deep, raunchy, powerful groove.  Another great song with a unique style.  \\"Make You Feel Better\\" is another quality track, sporting an uplifting and endearing vibe.  The same could also be said for \\"So Much I\\" which isn't a standout track, but it certainly isn't filler either.  It's quality.  The band saves perhaps their most interesting songs for the end of the album, starting with the warm and intimate \\"We Believe\\", which kind of has a trippy vibe.  \\"Turn It Again\\" follows, which features Frusciante's longest, most blazing guitar solo he's ever cut to an album.  It is pretty impressive to listen to and once again shows that Frusciante is one of the best guitar players of his generation.  Lights-out good.  The last song on the album \\"Death of a Martian\\" sounds appropriately other-worldly in quality, sporting a spacey, mellow vibe.  Kiedis finishes the song with an epic stream-of-consciousness rap which ends the album on a wickedly righteous note.  So overall, Stadium Arcadium features some of the band's best songs of their career, and the double-album format allows them to explore a lot of different sounds and vibes throughout the album.  On the flipside however, the Chili's kind of sound like they're on cruise-control on Stadium Arcadium, like they're going through the motions.  They're good motions, mind you, but it doesn't sound like they're really pushing themselves into exciting new territory as much as their just doing what they do best at this point in their career: making catchy, endearing, funk-rock songs.  And overall, they can't really be faulted for that.  The band are old pros at this stage of the game, and although listening to Stadium Arcadium straight-through in one sitting can be a somewhat daunting process, the album does have some undeniably great songs, and plenty of good songs too with enough variety to make Stadium Arcadium yet another high-quality Chili Peppers release.

B00000J7JO|5.0|Prior to 1999, a lot of people had given up on the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  The decade started out on a great note, as the band released the best album of their career in 1991.  But the rest of the decade was not a good one for the band.  Shortly after the release of Blood Sugar Sex Magik and the subsequent tour that followed, John Frusciante abruptly quit the band, slowly descending into a nasty heroin addiction that nearly killed him in the following years.   This left the Chili's with a seriously huge void to fill, so the band recruited former Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro for their next album One Hot Minute.  It took the band over 4 years to release the album, and during that time Anthony Kiedis relapsed into heroin addiction after years of sobriety.  That, along with the addition of Navarro, who's style differed greatly from the band's, resulted in an uneven, disappointing album that received very little in the way of positive reviews upon it's release.  Fast-forward to 1998, the band had fired Navarro and were once again left without a guitar player, basically on the verge of breaking up.  Meanwhile John Frusciante had cleaned up his drug addiction, and was subsequently asked to rejoin the band, an invitation that he gladly accepted.  So roughly 8 years after the release of Blood Sugar Sex Magik, the original recording lineup for that album were finally reunited, and the result was the critically acclaimed Californication.  One might think that having the original lineup back together would result in a similar sound and vibe to their last outing, but that is not really the case with Californication.  Whereas Blood Sugar Sex Magik was raunchy and raw in sound, Californication sounds poppy and polished by comparison.  This sound is not all that surprising considering the fact that the band was now 8 years older and more mature as a result.  There was also a lot riding on this album after the disappointing One Hot Minute, so the band seems intent on focusing more on the melodic aspects of their sound and trying to make the most well-rounded, catchy songs as possible.  But despite the polished, poppy sound on the album, the Chili's sound rejuvenated and fresh throughout, and no song better captures that spirit of renewal than the opening track \\"Around the World\\".  The band comes blasting out of the speakers full-throttle to start off the song, making clear that the Chili's are back and ready to rock.  The song (like the rest of the album) is catchy as hell, featuring all the trademark ingredients that make a great Chili Peppers song: Kiedis's rapping, Flea's funky bass, Chad laying down a tight beat, and John's much missed melodic guitar textures.  It's a Chili Pepper's classic and a fantastic way to start off the album.  The following track \\"Parallel Universe\\" is sonically and melodically spectacular, and is definately one of the best singles on the album, which is really saying something considering the numerous high-quality singles found on Californication.  Take the next song \\"Scar Tissue\\" for example.  A very mellow and somber track, it tries to capture the softly spare and melodic vibe of such classics as \\"Under the Bridge\\" and \\"Soul to Squeeze\\" and does a pretty damn good job of it in the process.  It's a really beautiful song, not quite as good as the aforementioned classics, but it is still nonetheless one of the Chili's best ballads to date.  Another great single is the dark and gripping \\"Otherside\\" which is also spare and somber in tone.  Its very effective, sporting more beautiful melodies but with a dark undercurrent running throughout the track.  The album's title track also features a beautifully intricate melody as well, making it one of the best known and most successful singles on the album.  The singles are really compelling to listen to, especially when they were first released, as at the time, the Chili's hadn't really fully explored their melodic tendencies.  These songs sound fully realized with a borderline epic quality to them, and it was exciting to hear the newly rejoined band harnessing their full melodic potential.  But the album is not all about melody and ballads.  The Chili's really shine through when they explode out of the speakers on such tracks as the hard-rocking \\"Get on Top\\" and the uplifting/catchy \\"Easily\\".  They also don't forget to bring the funk on tracks like \\"Purple Stain\\" which frankly rivals any of their older material as one of the funkiest songs they ever wrote.  Flea's bassline is disgusting on this song.  Ultimately though, the Chili's are at their most compelling in their more emotionally weighty songs.  Many of the singles capture that feeling, and tracks like \\"This Velvet Glove\\" and \\"Savior\\" really add a strong emotional dynamic to the album.  And the two softest tracks on the album \\"Porcelain\\" and \\"Road Trippin\\" add an extra layer of sensitivity and warmth to the album, making it feel like a more intimate listening experience.  On Californication, the Chili's sound like a group of old friends who have been to hell and back and survived, finally reunited after several dark years to once again make beautiful music together again.  They sound grateful, reflective, and indebted to each other, which gives the album a uniquely warm, sensitive, and endearing quality.  Californication marked the beginning of a new era for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, one that put to rest the wild, raunchy, and hard-partying vibe of years past and gave birth a new, sober, poppier band with a squeaky clean image.  And although many of us miss the \\"good ole days\\" when the Chili's were more cutting-edge and raw in sound, the band's new focus on the melody would yield some undeniably positive results in the coming years, and would be further explored more deeply on the band's next album By The Way.

B000002TQV|4.0|Radiohead are generally considered by most music critics to be one of the most influencial, groundbreaking bands of the past 20 years, and any many circles, one of the greatest bands of all-time.  The seeds of their greatness were planted with their modest (compared to latter releases) debut album Pablo Honey and really began to sprout on their 2nd album The Bends.  Prior to The Bends, Radiohead were just one of many new promising young bands, lost in the vast sea of alternative rock that was thriving in the early to mid 90s.  It was hard to seperate the pretenders from the contenders, but on The Bends, Radiohead proved that they were much more than contenders, not only creating a great album, but also one of the best albums of the entire decade.  The sound on The Bends is quite varied, featuring layered, experimental guitar textures which serve as a backdrop to Thom Yorke's uniquely emotional and yearning vocal style.  Like most Radiohead albums, the predominate vibe found on The Bends is quite somber and downtrodden in nature, but Yorke's ability to convey a real sense of emotion through the songs is ultimately what makes The Bends such a compelling listen.   Yorke's angst pours out of each song with such stirring authenticity it is hard not to get sucked into the emotion of it all.  The Bends has a uniquely personal quality to it, as most of the songs deal with themes such as loneliness, regret, depression, and a general pervasive sense of yearning.  The band compliments that vibe quite well with their ability to create a gripping musical backdrop for the songs, producing a compelling atmosphere that really enhances the gut-wrenching feeling of some of the tracks.  Good examples are the 1-2 punch of \\"High and Dry\\" and \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\", two incredibly somber and meloncholy songs that are perhaps the best representations of the all-ecompassing yearning vibe of the album.  But it's not all \\"woe-is-me\\", a lot of the songs flat-out rock, sporting an uplifting quality to boot, most notably on the title track, \\"Just\\", and \\"My Iron Lung\\", the latter of which featuring some killer guitar playing.  But ultimately, the most powerful moments on the album are also the most emotionally intense and draining.  \\"Bullet Proof...I Wish I Was\\" is an incredibly somber and haunting song, featuring a sublimely beautiful guitar along with Yorke's mournful singing.  It possess such a bleak and mournful quality it's almost numbing to listen to, but the melody and soul of the song are so beautiful, making it my personal favorite Radiohead song.   By the time the listener reaches the final track on the album you almost feel exhausted from the emotional highs and lows (mostly lows) that dominate the album, only to be greeted with perhaps the most intense song yet \\"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\\".  Like many of the other songs on the album, it has a strong emotional weight, acting as the culmination of the yearning, somber, lonesome vibe that dominate the album, but with an added brooding feeling.  It's a gripping song and a compelling way to end a very emotionally heartfelt album.  On The Bends, Radiohead were in the process of evolving into something much more impressive than any of their contemporaries would prove capable of.  Their next two albums broke new ground artistically, as they ascended into the ether of sonic experimentation, pushing the limits of what was possible in rock/electronic music.  But on The Bends, they made a much more accessible, human album.  It's no less impressive than their future albums, and in many people's eyes, it's their best album, not because it broke new ground, but because of it's sincere, down-to-earth, and powerful emotional weight.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|If you're like me you will experience a ray of emotions. From mad, laughing, crying to celebrating. The actors are amazing in this movie. They really capture their characters. It's a great movie and \\"kinda\\" gives you a glimps of how African American folks were treated and thought of. As a latina brought up around Afican Americans my whole life, it would burn me up reading about history and seeing movies regarding their treatment. So watching this movie, amongst others, gave me that feeling \\"YEAH\\" get her girl. Just seeing Minny take control and no longer tolerating the injust was victorious. What else could she do to gain control but use something she could hold over Hilly that would prevent her from retaliating, which we know would of been a beating or death, but a chocolate pie!!! Love, love, love this movie!!!

B004WPYNY8|5.0|Are you kidding me? I don't even know how to begin to describe them. Words fail me.  I'm a BIG -no, HUUUGE- Dream Theater fan. No one can touch them. I have believed them, for the most part of my adult life, to be the epitome of progressive rock. The end-all. Well, they still are (to me). I fear (truly fear) the day they decide to break up. A part of me will die when that happens. But this review is not about Dream Theater ...  Well, now I stumble across Symphony X! Wow, just wow! This is not like anything I've ever heard before.  This utterly technical music will agonize your senses, torture your melodic imagination and will certainly tear to pieces any hope you may have had as a musician. It's a bit depressing, actually. That's how good it is.  Here's my quick breakdown of the band, for fellow Symphony X new-comers (how sad and lost have we been):  Keyboard&bass: Nirvana. Just an unbelievable composition of cords and utter sophistication. The Keyboard/cords are a truly a spiritual experience  Guitar: Goose bump inducing melodies, riffs and power cords. May cause spontaneously numbness of the ears, possible inexplicable nose bleeds  Vocal: Scares me sometimes. Such a powerful thrust of cords, so many ranges of octaves and precise control, otherwise believed to be impossible  Drum: A metronome's nightmare. When metronome's have too much Icecream before bed, these drum solos, breaks and pure psychotic drummer-rage are what come to their mind, and terrorize them in their sleep.  So many mood and tempo shifts, it's agonizing. These drum lines absolutely will shred-to-pieces away any ideas you may have had of music in general, progressive rock drummers and possibly make you question your life in general. It's that profound.  This is what Heaven sounds like. Track 10of10 Revelation, Paradise Lost, is what it will sound like when your life ends, This is what you will hear when the Angels descend from the sky to take your soul.  Ok, maybe I'm exaggerating. But maybe not.My mind = BLOWN.

B005QMOZOO|2.0|I am a big fan of both Austen and James, but I feel that the author here would be far better served creating her own characters, in an 18th century setting if she wished. The use of these characters is too jarring to immerse yourself in the book. It is very well written and the story is interesting but it is next to impossible to move past the disconnect between the characters Austen wrote and the changes James has wrought upon them.

0553386816|5.0|Different than most of Grisham's work -- but extremely well written.  A great slice of life; the book contains 7 short stories, and although it is set in the same small town as a previous book, none of these stories require any knowledge of any of Grisham's other books.  This would make a great gift for nearly anyone.  My favorite story was \\"The Funny Boy\\" though there is little \\"funny\\" about a man who returns to his hometown in 1984 to die, and is shunned by his family.  It pulls at the heartstrings.  Disclaimer: These are not short stories with a \\"twist\\" at the end -- if you are expecting this, you will be dissappointed.  Rather, they are just well-written, realistic views of southern small-town life.  Enjoy.

1451627289|3.0|This book has some long, saggy subplots. I was enchanted by the visit to 1958, but we didn't get to experience much of that. THere were a few cultural icons that took me back, but not nearly enough to evoke the era. Instead, we are plunged into a seedy romance between characters without much spark. All we know about Sadie is that she is a chain smoker and is clumbsy... not enough depth to register any empathy. I, too, did research on the Kennedy assasination, and reached a very different conclusion than King has. That is forgivable, but the first 75% of the book was too slow moving, took me where I did not want to go, and bored me with paper thin characters. I endured to see how he would end it (and King fans endure the detours, we are used to them but hope they won't dilute the plot too much). The detour turned out to be the main story. The last 15% of the book is engaging though, and salvaged the whole story from being a huge flop in my opinion. It seems to be written for the big screen, using the lure of big screen sex and not much else.

B002N5N5QQ|2.0|Sons of Anarchy started off quite strong in its first season. The characters were compelling, the pacing was just right, and the story was focused without ever becoming too convoluted. Season Two abandons all of those positive qualities.<br /><br />Most characters were developed into solid, well-defined personalities in the first season, only to be completely unraveled in the second. The show has no problem having a player act uncharacteristically if it helps propel an utterly contrived subplot.<br /><br />The pacing is excrutiating for the majority of the season. Most of the episodes are what would be considered \\"filler\\", a litany of subplots with very little impact on the main story other than to extend the season into the finale. The best example of this is the extreme division between Jax and Clay that develops, only to magically disappear towards the end like nothing ever happened. If only all disputes, regardless of their severity, could be resolved with a couple of bro-hugs.<br /><br />Worst of all is how the story becomes insanely contrived towards the end. There are so many overly complex schemes at play at once that the viewer will be left frustrated by all of the plot threads that he's expected to keep track of. All of it leading up to an unsatisfying, cheap cliffhanger ending that's become all to common in TV series these days.<br /><br />It's unfortunate that the quality of the first season wasn't carried into the second. With SOA's foundation of strong characters and backstory, it truly had the potential of developing into a long, interesting drama. Instead we're left with a series that trades well-paced and engaging storytelling in exchange for cobbled-together, throwaway narrative.<br /><br />Just like Sam Crow, this series has lost its way.
B004VBAHG6|5.0|This is the first PM solo album I've truly loved since Deep.  There were a few good tracks here and there on some others, but mostly, I had stop connecting with his solo work for many years.  This one hooked me on the first listen through.  The time spent on the Bauhaus reunion project seems to have rekindled his creative fire in a profound way. It's almost as though he has recaptured that dark, elegant spirit that caused his Bauhaus fans to fall in love with him in the first place, all those years ago.  He's done that in a brilliant and very current way, without it sounding like a derivative rehashing of the past.  As a cohesive work, this is his best in years. Peter, more please!
B0057R5XRG|5.0|I bought the Jurassic Park Ultimate Trilogy blu-ray set during the Black Friday massive bargains.  It was the blu-ray boxset I've always desired to collect because Jurassic Park represented the pioneer Hollywood breakthrough in visual CGI and DTS audio technologies.  I loved all three films, although after watching them, I must say Lost World was probably my favourite.  Lost World was a further evolution of animatonics-CGI hybrid collaboration, had 2 adult T-Rexes, a cute baby T-rex, introduced the popular Stegosarus, had a T-rex rampage through urban San Diego, and had the highest bodycount of all three films.  I loved the first film as well, because dinosaurs were brought to life credibly despite the maiden experimental animatronics-CGI techniques. The technologies will go on to be refined and improved upon with each sequel.  And of course, the third film was the most highly evolved.  Smarter, new-look velociraptors with communicative vocals (compared to the simple hisses and screams of the first film); a prior unknown new monster Spinosauraus (although the way it managed to break a T-rex's neck after having had its neck chomped between the T-rex's jaws earlier, is just UN-believable); and pteranodons who finally make their full-feature debut.  There're some film grain in the first film which becomes less noticeably in the sequels. But the visuals are crisp and highly-detailed for the most parts. DTS-HD surround sound is pure audio bliss.  The tonnes of extra documentaries and behind the scenes features (about 2 hours worth for each film) add further value to the package.  Of highlight are the two deleted scenes in Lost World which explain the change in InGen CEOship after the events of the first film and how Roland Teembo (my favourite character) got involved in the Isla Sorna expedition. Notwithstanding it being my favourite of the trilogy, I have to criticize the film adaptation of the Lost World compared to the first film.  The first film, despite its changesfrom the novel, felt truer to the latter's essence.  The Lost World was a cut-and-paste job from its novel, creating disjointed parts.  A good example is the mystery of how the baby T-rex fratured its leg in the film when it was well and happily feeding in earlier scenes.  You would have thought Roland and Ajay broke it to capture it to lure the adult T-rexes.  But in the novel, it was another character (written out of the film) which accidentally stepped on the leg.  So when that part was cut and changed in the film, the scenes became disjointed and created question marks.  Overall, the boxset is definitely a worthwhile purchase and a collectible item for a long time.

B002ZG98FU|4.0|It appeared more chick flicky than it actually was. Harrison Ford plays such a strong, likable character that he balances the neurotic main character nicely. It kept my attention through the entire movie. Its a decent comedy that I imagine most people can enjoy.
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|didn't need the 3d blu-ray.... but had to have the digital copy and wanted the regular blu-ray so this was the one. I guess it was worth it. I am glad they bundle these because that helps with... one for home (BR) one for car (DVD) and one for the Ipod (DC)  good deal for us.
0316056863|3.0|I really enjoyed the beginning of the book, but some of the parts about 30 Rock and SNL are frustrating.  It seems that since she worked so much there she doesn't have perspective and seems to be saying that the shows are the most important thing a person can do.  Despite the self-deprecating humor these bits still come off as storytelling by a somewhat conceited person in show business.  I really enjoyed the pre SNL years so the later half of the book becomes a bit disappointing.  I guess even people I like in entertainment are probably somewhat self-important.  This sounds bad, but I would definitely pick this book up again because of the laugh out loud parts and astute observations and insights about being a lady comedian and writer.

Great place to start. 3 days and I'm past halfway. Which is great for me this time of year.

Seriously if you like back story this is a great place to start.
B004HS1L9U|3.0|Three stars for a book that details perhaps the most remarkable land journey ever recorded? I'll get to that.   Slavomir \\"Slav\\" Rawicz was caught by the Soviets at the outbreak of WWII, accused of being a Polish spy, brutally tortured to confess, and shipped off to the Siberian Gulag with a 25 year sentence. After a horrific rail journey to Siberia the prisoners were made to walk a thousand miles in the dead of winter to their permanent camp. The idea of escaping seemed nutty but Rawicz got a band of fellow prisoners together and, with some strategic help, they fled the camp and started off on what became a 4,000 mile journey by foot to India and freedom. Along the way they picked up a young Polish girl, also on the run, walked south to exit Siberia into Mongolia, crossed the Gobi desert in the summer, and then crossed through Tibet and the Himalayas in winter. A remarkable achievement and a gripping page-turning tale that seems unbelievable. How can such a journey be possible? How can you survive in the desert without food or water for a week at a time? How come his companions were never heard from afterwards? What about those Yeti?  Well, sometimes fiction is better than fact. Almost from the start my thoughts went to that other Polish author, Jerzy Kosinski. I remember reading his harrowing \\"The Painted Bird\\" as a teenager with the understanding (perhaps my fault) that it was autobiographical. I was highly disappointed when I realized that it really didn't happen in real life. So with this book. Ever since its publication in 1956 people have been suspicious. The author died in 2004 and in 2006 the BBC dug up damning evidence (google it) from Eastern Bloc archives that, while Rawicz was indeed sent to the Siberian camp, thus making the first part of the book at least somewhat true, he was also released as part of a general amnesty given to all Polish prisoners. That would make the extraordinary trek fiction. Perhaps not entirely, as there are claims that he essentially stole the narrative from others who did make the journey.   As with the Painted Bird I wish I didn't know this. While the story is great it does make a great deal of difference if it is fact or fiction. As a true tale it would be 5 stars, as fiction I generously give it 3.
0307716988|5.0|This is why I'm clearly enamored with him....he wasn't like other guys. He was sweet, sensitive, humble, emotional, etc. He was alot like me. It may not be as detailed as his brother's autobiography book, but there are things he shared that I didn't know like he loves mexican food, classical music, and reading. I already knew about his personality that's why I felt so connected with him in my childhood and in the present. He was such an intellect that people have greatly underestimated him and his creativity and his intelligence. This book was a way for people to get to know him and understand the way he was. He mostly talks about how the J5 band got started, his first love, his determination to be bigger and better, and his admiration for Diana, of course. He never mentioned about his vitiligo and lupus, but he addressed the rumors about the skin bleaching and plastic surgeries. He also mentions that other than Tatum and Brooke, he has dated other women but did not want to mention their names since they were not celebrities and want to respect their privacy. I wish other men could take notes from him. In my opinion, Michael is a TRUE definition what a REAL man is and should be. He was never afraid to show emotions or his sensitive side and it does NOT make him weak at all. I hate it when men try to act all macho and stuff just to prove themselves to people. Michael never had to prove himself to anyone. He was just being himself and that is VERY VERY VERY sexy to me. He respected women in that he never boast or exaggerate what he did with them like I've seen other men have done. Why can't people ever praise a dignified, Godly man who had morals.
B005AUWXZ0|1.0|The quantity of violence is overwhelming in this Disney-Pixar offering. The negative comments you will read on Amazon are TRUE. I just previewed this \\"movie\\" before giving it to my five year old son for Christmas because of the large divide in Good vs Bad reviews and the comments about violence, torture and death. They all have merit. This is a SICK and TWISTED tale that is not for toddlers or young children. It should have been rated PG-13 to warn parents. THANK GOODNESS FOR AMAZON.COM and it's REVIEWS!  Thanks to the honest reviewers and good parents who warned about the dark inappropriate nature of this pitiful attempt to derail children. The script and storyline are also twisted. But that is really not the issue. As a father I cannot recommend this to anyone with children under 13.

B006CDDLX2|5.0|For years I have felt that research into the near-death experience is among the most important in terms of understanding the spiritual aspect of the individual. While many spiritual approaches speculate on the existence of a spiritual dimension, a soul, this research presents consciousness, a non-brain dependent essence, as a stark reality.   All books on the NDE offer helpful insights and Pim van Lommel's presentation is among the best. It is impressive that a cardiologist, a seasoned scientist, speaks a language quite familiar to those in my own profession as clergy. Though some of what he presents is scientifically over my head, he offers much to any who are open-minded enough to grasp the importance of this research.   The evidence of the NDE is undeniable. Those in the scientific and religious fields who continue to deny it apparently do so based more on prejudice and predispositions that simply will not allow them to listen to those who have a sincere need and desire to share an experience for which we have no language. I myself have had the privilege of listening to people attempt to describe the beauty, freedom and all-encompassing love they experienced in the momentary death of their physical bodies. None have had a thing to gain by sharing, yet they wanted to talk to someone about the single event that left them forever changed.   Thank God we have researchers like Dr. van Lommel who are willing to listen and to learn and who have the knowledge and expertise to give us perspective and understanding in this developing field that is lifting a bit higher the veil that cloaks in mystery what it truly means to be human.

B0016K40KY|5.0|One of the pleasures of my current job is that I selecting movies for this various  film series I run.  My current series is \\"100 Years, 100 Movies: Selections From the American Film Institute,\\" and while I don't have the rights to screen EVERY selection, the many that I have gotten to show have initiated a good deal of discussion and debate among my attendees as to what makes a film a classic.  Even at a glance at the AFI's roster of classic films, it was pretty clear that a wide variety of subjects, styles and genres would be open to us.  Greatness doesn't come in a one-size-fit-all format.  We began our series with CASABLANCA,  certainly a classic of its era--but one that caught its audience,  the critics and, yes,  even the actors and filmmakers by surprise. Shot in elegant black-and-white,  CASABLANCA is not quite an example of film noir--but it does have its `noirish' aspects.  And by the standards of the day, it was not actually a low-budget venture, but still no one involved in the project realized they were making a classic  You could say that lack of pretention proven to be part of the beauty of the film.  It's one of the big screen's little ironies that it is often that very lack of pretention that makes for classic cinema.  And just as frequently, the bigger, more epic productions turn out to be bloated, boring and sometimes ludicrously bad.  But not always.  Cinema can do many things, and in the right hands, a screen epic can be a wondrous thing to behold.  British director David Lean (1908-1991) is generally considered one of the masters of mid-20th century epic cinema (with such films to his credit as BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER KWAI,  DR. ZHIVAGO, and especially LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, hailed as the best epic film of all time by the American Film Institute,  the magazine Total Film and many others critics, film societies and publications.  Aside from the twenty years--and all the attendant technical advancements between 1942 and 1962--that separated CASABLANCAand LAWRENCE OF ARABIA,  the two films do have a number of points in common: both speak to a certain fascination with exotic locales, the machinations and intrigues of war, and both pose questions about the nature of heroism and sacrifice.  And is it just coincidence, that both feature veteran character actor Claude Rains in co-starring roles?  (Who knows?  Maybe David Lean was indulging in a subtle kind of \\"stunt casting.\\")  LAWRENCE OF ARABIA remains one of the most widely respected and influential films ever made.  While some have questioned its historical accuracy,  others have championed its cinematic beauty (and, yes, this is definitely one to view in letterbox format).Its visual style has influenced directors as diverse as Martin Scorsese, Sam Peckinpah and George Lucas. You can't get more diverse than that, and that very roster gives you an idea of how the notion of \\"epic cinema\\" has expanded over the decades.  The film is also noted for its literate screenplay (another trait it shares with CASABLANCA and so many other \\"classic films\\") and for Peter O'Toole's impressive star turn in the title role.  O'Toole had appeared in smaller roles in three movies prior to making this film.  Interestingly, hewas not the first choice for the part, but Marlon Brando was not available, and Albert Finney turned down the role.  Producer Sam Spiegel had worked with O'Toole previously and wasn't eager to work with the Irish born actor again.  He did, however, yield to director Lean's better judgment--and the rest, as they say, is movie history.  It's ironic that the film many consider to be the greatest epic of all time was made in the era (the early `60s) when the genre could be said to be winding down.  (But as suggested by the list of filmmakers who've felt LAWRENCE's influence, MAYBE the genre was just being redefined).  It was clear even then that the days of lengthy, grandiose film with a \\"cast of thousands,\\" and actual intermissions were on the wane.    It probably canbe said in more recent years,  \\"epics\\" tend to be more in the sci-fi and fantasy realm, with the vert occasional historical film   surfacing from time to time.  It's ironic that the film many think of as the cinema's GREATEST epic was--in a technical sense anyway--one of the last true examples of the genre.  It probably had a lot to do with budgets, and with changing public tastes.  But then took, maybe LAWRENCE OF ARABIA just set too high a bar.

1400052173|4.0|Henrietta Lacks was a sharp dresser.  Henrietta Lacks had style.  And though she died in 1951, she is still with us in a physical sense.  Lacks, an African-American woman living near Baltimore, Maryland, went to John Hopkins hospital after she noticed some vaginal bleeding.  She was diagnosed with cervical cancer.  While being diagnosed or treated, a tissue sample was removed from one of the tumors.  This sample, unbeknownst to Hentrietta (and certainly without any consent forms) proved to be the origin of the first human cell line to survive in tissue culture.    Healthy human cells die out after a fixed number of cell replications when maintained outside the body.  Cells infected with cancer may be able to replicate continuously when maintained in culture.  Such cells are very useful in research.  Henrietta's family did not learn that her cells were growing in laboratories all over the world until the 1970s, when doctor's took blood samples (to help identify which human cell cultures were Henrietta's - scientists had just realized that her cells tended to over power other cell lines and cause contamination problems) and an article came out in Rolling Stone about Henrietta and her cells.    The family were nonplussed by learning about what had happened to their mother's tissue.  The lack of informed consent, the racial aspects (white doctors doing stuff to a black indigent patient without telling her or her family), the lack of financial compensation (John Hopkins may not have made any money from the cells, but others do sell the cells commercially), and the fact that the family  often can't afford health insurance while their mother's cells contribute to medical research all grate.  Also, the weirdness of some of the stuff done with Hentrietta's cells and the basic oddity of discovering that part of your loved one is still alive added to their hurt.  Rebecca Skloot, a middle class, agnostic white woman from the Pacific Northwest, had a task getting an poor, angryblack Christian (mostly) family with roots in rural Virginia to tell their story.  Eventually she did; Henrietta's daughter Deborah was the key figure.  But it was slow process, marked by episodes of mistrust.

0451169514|3.0|Bottom line: King does what H.P. Lovecraft couldn't quite manage: build up a world detailed and solid in its normalcy and convincingly shred the fabric of that world when horrors from some unknowable (non-Euclidean, even) unreal reality begin to break through. King writes people acting *mundane* fantastically. He doesn't shy away from all of the bland, everyday (even disgusting) details that make people seem real. On the other hand, the way he approaches women leaves me ambivalent.<br /><br />****SPOILERS**** from here on down.<br /><br />Trigger warnings: Many. Violent murders of children and adults; non-murder violent deaths; parent-killing by minor child; sibling-killing of infant by a minor; infant-killing by protagonists (non-human infants); graphic suicide; physical, emotional, and sexual abuse of children (by parents); physical, emotional, and sexual abuse of spouse (wife by husband); physical and verbal abuse by a teacher; sections of narrative told from abusers' perspectives; gaybashing ending in murder; severe physical bullying (for fat, stuttering, glasses, being Jewish, asthma, being black); anti-Semitism; casual racist, anti-gay, and anti-Semitic remarks by protagonists; white supremacy and arson resulting in graphic deaths; references to lynching; cruelty to animals, including killing of pets; shaming for barrenness; mutual masturbation (m/m) by minors (dubious consent); consensual sex by minors (f/m); graphic rape metaphor; miscarriage (non-human). I'm certain I've missed some.<br /><br />How does it treat women/same-sex relationships? Not well. The story is set in both 1958 and 1985, in our world, and characters express sexist and anti-gay views (including unexamined casual remarks by the protagonists). A gay man is beaten to death by antagonists. The novel's views on women are confused. On the one hand, it has the feel of King trying hard to Not Be Sexist. On the other hand, he fails. The one main female character is the only main character physically and sexually abused by a parent (and, later, by her spouse). She also becomes the sexual and emotional center of the main protagonist group of seven friends. The one self-labeling feminist character is beaten by a man and shamed into not reporting it. Mothers are shown as not comprehending their sons, largely absent from the narrative, ignoring abuse of their children, or nagging. Wives are around to evoke shame and motivation to save or protect in male protagonists. The main antagonist is revealed in a Surprise Twist as female and pregnant (at which point, the male protagonists start calling It a \\"bitch\\"). Nice try, King, but no dice.<br /><br />Does it have explicit sex scenes?: It has semi-explicit sex scenes. King doesn't go into great detail, but it's clear what's happening. These include a consensual m/f sex scene, a graphic extended rape metaphor, a f/m sex scene between a girl and multiple boy partners (all minors), and a m/m masturbation scene (between minors, with dubious consent). The children in the novel also do a lot of children's speculation about sex.<br /><br />Would I read it again? Maybe years from now. It's very long, and a bit of a haul to read. Some of the otherworldly scenes were worth it (I would read the scene with Hockstetter getting killed by flying leeches again. FLYING LEECHES, awesome, and the deadlights were Lovecraft Done Right).<br /><br />Would I publish it? Hard question. No, not as it stands. I would at least ask King to write another girl into the group of friends (though this would be difficult, because the cast is already unwieldy, and taking out any of the existing friends would wreck the balance. Could any of them be girls easily?), and to take out the bit about It being female and pregnant and therefore More of a Threat.arent (and, later, by her spouse).

B0052UZIFA|3.0|Freezes constant when trying to run it on the Galaxy Nexus.  Really, this is a high end dual core 1GB of RAM device.  There's no good reason for it to not play properly this phone.  A shame no one at PopCap seems to care.
B0065GG2ZK|2.0|If you're thinking of songs like \\"Money to Blow\\", this album has nothing even close to that. There's only like 3 tracks that are \\"Okay\\". Wish Drake had more than two flows (his standard flow and that same flow just faster). The rest of the songs are super soft. Cool music if your like on a date.   Want better music, check out Lloyd's \\"King of Hearts\\" or Jay-z and Kane West's \\"Watch the Throne\\". Both 5 star albums with a lot of songs.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Works great for my kindle fire.  I have 4 separate calendars with google and they flood over nicely even the ones updated on my android phone. I like the ability to really make this look and feel the way I want it to. Worth the money!

B00005B1W5|5.0|...the music is outstanding...its even better to watch it actually being performed.  Each member of his orchestra seems to be the best at whatever instrument they play.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|Together with Redbreast, this Harry story is the best. It's rich in many ways.  Not only are the characters fascinating, funny at times and very human, and not only is the story gripping and complex enough that I could not guess the culprit(s), through it I saw, felt and heard Norway, a place I've never been but can't wait to visit. Wow, I will be watching and hoping for the next Harry Hole book.
B004VD3YIM|5.0|great. i use it all the  time to keep track of my elderly parents.  thanks for creating the app.  very very nice.

B004TF3HZ2|4.0|I have been a huge Hackett fan for over 30 years. That being said, I will not disagree with any of the other opinions here. This is great stuff. My complaint is that this seems hastily thrown together. There is no smooth transition between tracks to give this live presentation the flow that it deserves. The audience noises cut abruptly at the end of tracks, which I find annoying.
B004LWZW7O|1.0|The idea is great but the movie is trash and the acting is trash. They could've made a great movie but they didn't.

1601251505|5.0|D&D 3.5 is arguably the most popular edition of the venerable gaming system. Paizo has taken what Wizards of the Coast abandoned and improved upon it to produce Pathfinder RPG. With a few tweaks to the rules, anyone familiar with 3.5 will pick right up on it. The quality of Paizo's books are great, fantastic artwork, solid bindings and an overall quality book.<br /><br />Paizo's writers are also fantastic, they put as much effort into the story or \\"fluff\\" as they do the rules or \\"crunch\\".
0307987698|3.0|Having grown up with the original \\"Monster at the End of this Book,\\" I was really excited to get this one, along with the original, for my 16 month old daughter.  The sequel is good, and it does include Elmo, but just not as memorable as the first one.  I'd say, go with the original and try to find another one for your kids, this one is good especially for the price but not great.
B004O3YGMC|3.0|I thought this would be great for accessing my home computer desktop while sitting in bed. It's okay but verrrrrry slow starting up and verrrrrrry slow using. It takes a long time between tapping on anything to actually getting to it and sometimes no matter how hard you tap it won't go anywhere. Also I found because it changes the resolution on my home computer screen during use on the Kindle Fire, I always have to go back to the home computer to put my desktop icons back in place because it \\"rearranges\\" them. So your home computer has to be on & running the Splashtop Streamer whenever you access it from the Kindle Fire. So you can't access it when you're away from home on a trip for instance. Not very convenient. Otherwise the display is fine and large enough print to read things.
1401233066|5.0|Well, it seems like every loyal Fables reader on the internet has been bashing the anticlimactic ending to the Dark Man arc, but I must admit that it was befitting. Not every single war ends with a great, showy battle. The noble sacrifice of one man is sometimes enough to warrant an end to even the greatest of conflicts, and this is certainly the case in the Dark Man arc's ending. Surprisingly, or perhaps not so, this book provides a respite from the seriousness of the last book by providing Pinocchio's vision of a 'super team' to defeat Mr. Dark and also a chapter on the misadventures of Bufkin, who journeys 'home' after many days of climbing a very tall tree. I would recommend this book, but I am such a huge fan of the series that my love for the art and the characters may diminish the faults of this book, which it undoubtedly has. For someone looking for an exciting end to the Dark Man arc, I suggest you borrow this book to read instead of buying it. However, for someone whose love of the series is already enough to warrant a purchase of the book, you will not be disappointed. The art is as good as ever, and Bill Willingham does not disappoint in his clever witticisms that populate every single Fables issue. Overall, a worthwhile read.
B001UV4XJ2|3.0|This was a Christmas gift.  As far as I know, it was \\"liked\\".  I don't know if it's been watched, yet, but it was what was asked for.

Just download and play 5 mins with my son. He likes it and super user friendly. I hate those complicated apps. Maybe I am not the digital age people (even though I am working in IT), like something super easy to use.
B00005JPAO|5.0|This film shares what must have been one of the greatest trials of \\"the Queen,\\" Elizabeth, II.  It tells of the ordeals of a short period of time, from the election of Tony Blair, P.M., the tragic death of Diana, Princess of Wales, and the mixed feelings about that loss.  Elizabeth, II, is protrayed as a rigid, if not defiant, Royal, but one who must respond properly to the deep almost universal grief of her subjects.  It is a new light on the importance of maintaining the monarchy, the great affection and wish to protect her grandsons, and become less \\"royal\\" and more like her people.  If the film even approaches the reality of the time, it shows her own grief to be held privately only to be released when no one else could see nor hear her quiet sobs. The acting is without flaw, each true to real life personality, direction and editing, as well as costumes and all facets which elevate a film from mediocre to a classic. Here is a classic which should have a place in most, if not all, privately held film libraries!
055357342X|5.0|This is the best book in the series so far.  I couldn't put it down.  There are incidents in this books that made me truly anxious when I had to put it down to get off the train while on the way to and from work.  There are also parts which are just awesome so it evens out - ups and downs.  The best.
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|\\"The Help\\" tells a powerful story about a situation that should never have come into being; the very idea of people being owned is repugnant and the idea of them being looked down upon because of a matter of birth is equally repugnant. It tells the story of two groups of people, the black and the white, living in the same community but living two distinctly different kinds of lives because of the fact of their births.<br /><br />The story centers on the life of a young white woman named Skeeter Phelan, played by Emma Stone, who has recently graduated from college and her decision to write a story from the perspective of the help which is synonymous with the servants. This opens the door to more than she ever expects and changes her life and the lives of many others as well. The story is set at the beginning of the Civil Rights movement.<br /><br />\\"The Help\\" is a touching reminder of how far we have come regarding the respect each of us deserve as individuals. It is a sometimes painful review of what was and, unfortunately, still may be in some cases and makes a serious statement about race and race relations.<br /><br />I would not classify it as entertaining but more as a sometimes painful education.
0553582038|3.0|I adore the firs three book and had to get this one to find out what happens in the story.  This book is clearly not on the same level as the first three.  It's a necessity if you're a fan of the series but don't get your hopes up - it only contains half the characters' stories and way too much about the Greyjoys...  I'm also getting uncomfortable with the gratuitous sexual violence against women.  I know there is war going on but really - we can be spared the graphic details about an assault on a 12 year old without missing out on anything.  Just the hint of something like that is horrific and abominable to all - no need to go into details, repeatedly.    I miss Danaerys.
B006C45CFG|4.0|I'm always interested in the wide range of opinions expressed by the reviewers; one would almost wonder if everyone was watching the same movie. It just reaffirms that beauty is in the eye of the beholder; well this beholder enjoyed the movie and found it both entertaining and interesting.<br /><br />I'll agree that no really new ground was plowed with this one but that in no way compromised the overall effect of the story. It did have some interesting twists and also some very predictable elements.<br /><br />The picture quality and sound are both up to the task and contributed to the excitement of the film. As with most science fiction one has to accept the assumptions if one is to enjoy the story; I was able to do that and I think most viewers will be able to do that also.<br /><br />Most fans of sci-fi action will not be disapointed with this one; I know I enjoyed it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is such a fun game. Can keep u busy with so many different games u can play really great game :)

B0021L8V0M|4.0|I hope that a decision is made to make a Salt II film continuing the superb suspense and action contained in this movie; it is that good. Angelina Jolie, known as Evelyn Salt in the film, is freed from a North Korean prison after being continually tortured in the prison while the North Korean soldiers try unsuccesfully to get her to admit that she is an American spy. When she is released, we are told that she has been working as a top agent for the CIA. We are also told that had a certain man not caused a lot of publicity about her capture, the CIA would not have tried to get her released. She hears this from her CIA boss.<br /><br />Two years later, when she is married to the man who helped get her released, a top Russian agent comes to the CIA claiming that he wants to defect. He reveals that Russians want to kill the Russian president while he is visiting the US and participating in the funeral service for the American Vice President. He says that Salt is the Russian agent assigned to do the murder. Government agents try to arrest her, but she escapes. We begin to see that she has many skills. She tries to locate her husband who does not answer any of her calls. We see a long and exciting chase by government agents after Salt.<br /><br />The film raises the questions: What happened to Salt's husband? Is the defector telling the truth? If yes, how did she become a Russian agent? If not, what is going on? Will the Russian president be shot and, if so, by whom? Why did the defector identify her as the murderer?
B000YHG72E|5.0|I try to watch this every Christmas. It always makes me laugh out loud and makes me cry.  Truly a great Christmas movie for all ages. Hilarious in many ways. When you watch it again you'll find yourself laughing at new things.
B001PPGAIA|4.0|Besides the basic plot of a love story between a rich English noble woman who was searching for a place to settle down and a poor cattleman who had been married to a black woman and who wanted to \\"walk about\\" in 1939 Australia, and the beginning of World War II in Australia, this film explores many subjects, such as the following:<br /><br />Blacks verses whites<br />Mixed races vs. whites<br />Rich vs. poor<br />Allied forces vs. the Japanese<br />Secularists vs. missionaries<br />Hiding the parental identity of children born to mixed racial marriages<br />Men taking advantage of wars to make money<br />The Australian cattle industry<br />Can magic work?<br />Why were aborigines not allowed the rights given to whites until 1973?<br />Who killed Nicole Kidman's husband and can it be proved?<br /><br />While others may not have my problem, I found it hard to understand many of the words spoken in the film and many words uttered softly; therefore I recommend that viewers view the film with the subtitles. I also recommend if at all possible that viewers look at the film with a large TV screen so that they can enjoy the beautiful panorama of Australia.

B005ELQVGW|3.0|It's hard not to be critical of the new album. Definitely not as good as Homogenic, but not as horrible as Medúlla either- -arguably Björk's worst album.   On the positive side, it's full of new sounds and rhythmns (typical Björk). She was always a few steps ahead of the industry & her fans. You grow into a Björk album or catch up to it, for instance, I never liked Homogenic or Vespertine until many years later. Maybe we'll all grow to love this one almost as much. To me anything that is not as bad as Medúlla is a win! Íslenska!!!
B003Y5H542|4.0|Movie may be a little advanced for the young kids or toddlers but felt it was fine for the older kids. Overall good movie for most.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|Like the angry birds as I have the full original but hate the tasteless tactics to push the advertisements. Random full screen pop up advertisements? Really come on mid game.

0452273331|4.0|Approximately 700 pages in length, this prelude (though not prequel) to Atlas Shrugged, is excruciatingly boring for its first approximately 600 pages, but picks up well and ends on a high note.  Too much detail and agonizing prose for much of the book (with a few minor exceptions), but then becomes a page turner during its last 100 or so pages.    Really emphasizes individualism vs. collectivism, and Rand does well highlighting the evil of Ellsworth Toohey vs. the creativity and integrity of the novel's protagonist - Howard Roark.  I think the book and many of its points emphasized could've been written with nearly half the length, but then again if it were that short, it wouldn't be classic literature, now would it?!!  All in all, a good read, if you have the patience to make it through to the more exciting parts.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|I have been a Stephen King fan for years, and -- like most fans -- have enjoyed some of his works much more than others.  I was very torn about how to give this book a star rating because there are some aspects that rate 5 stars and others that rate only 1 or 2.  The premise is intriguing, the overall writing as you would expect from Stephen King, and as one reviewer already commented, the beginning and end are both quite well done.  The middle, however, drags on and on and on.... and on.     Perhaps I was just too anxious to get on to the end, but I was genuinely bored by a significant portion of the middle of the book.  This is the first of his books that I have resorted to just skimming a dozen pages at a time yet still actually finished the book (I gave up on The Stand when I was ony 150 pages into it and already skimming and restless).  I kept mentally pleading with him to \\"get on with it, already!\\".  In the end, however, it is well worth forging forward.  I did enjoy the book quite a bit;  I just think it could have been about 200 pages shorter without sacrificing anything significant.
B001V5JGEY|4.0|Another great period novel from Jane Austen. You can lose yourself in the manners and customs of the time. Enjoyable read!

0316069884|5.0|This is the first book review I have posted on Amazon. I just finished reading Eating Animals and felt I had to share my experience.<br /><br />In my teens and early 20's, I was a vegetarian and even a vegan. Nothing Jonathan presented was new information to me. And yet, at some point in my 20's I became a \\"selective omnivore\\" and gradually began eating more meat. I am guilty of occasionally, no, semi-regularly, eating factory farmed meat.<br /><br />This book felt like a reawakening. I have been gradually sliding down a slippery slope. I started off believing that locally raised meat is morally ok because I had talked to the person who raised the animal. But the problem is that eventually I started to believe that organic meat was ok. And then even occasionally, natural meat (which we all know is meaningless). In this way, I found his argument about the need to 'draw a line in the sand' was very compelling. It is hard to eat meat occasionally because without the cover of a fixed rule, there are just too many times when an exception seems appropriate.<br /><br />The fact is, I am ashamed at my complacency over these last ten years. I have a young son too, and when he asks me someday what I did when I learned what people do to factory farmed animals, I want to look him in the eye and say that I stopped eating them.<br /><br />I also think that Jonathan makes an essential point that being a vegetarian is not enough. We cannot sit quietly by as animals are tortured and feel good about our own decision not to eat them. As a teenager, I spoke out about this issue, even when it made my friends and family uncomfortable. I want to do more than be a vegetarian. I guess this post is my first step.<br /><br />Jonathan is smart and profound and he articulates complex moral dilemmas in a refreshingly simple way. I agree with all the other reviewers that Jonathan is not preachy and his book is approachable and interesting. His notes are meticulously presented and, although I wishthat some of the stories he tells were made up, I believe they were all absolutely truthful. This is a must read book for everyone. I hope you will give it a try.

B005LLXB9K|1.0|Wutz up ya'll?  I love hard rock and grunge as much as everyone else does these days but this Pearl Jam group is just a bunch of talentless hacks that don't deserve the hype! First of all, Creed and Nickelback originally created grunge/hard rock wayyyy before Pearl Jam ever existed.  Not to mention, Pearl Jam doesn't really have the emotion and rhythm that good bands like Staind, Nickelback, and Puddle of Mudd have.... I think the entire Seattle scene was just a big trendy joke back in the early 70s! Bands like Nirvana, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, and all those other losers from Seattle didn't make it out of the 70s and this is living proof why they didn't!  For true music legends, check out talented singers like Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga.

I have been knitting for many, many years; it was interesting to see where she agreed with what I have been doing and in other areas she did things differently.  Her directions for making sure sweaters fit will be taken seriously; I have made a couple that were a little too large.  This would be a good book for someone learning how to knit - it's written in an easy-to-understand fashion.

030771652X|5.0|I enjoy something unique, unusual and this book certaily fit the bill.  The approach, an open letter to her dead sister, gave Bee an opportunity to express her overwhelming sense of loss, of unbelievable pain and guilt, not otherwise possible.  Yes, the plot muddled up at times, but this book, I felt, was more character driven than plot driven and I enjoyed watching Bee change herself, her own life, as she attempted to understand her sister's death. The author's descriptions of other characters in the book were sharp, crisp and made even the most minor character come quickly alive.  Excellent first novel.

B00319ECGK|5.0|I love the first matrix movie, infact I don't even really like revolutions or reloaded that much, but the first one is awesome! The blu-ray single disc was only $7.99 when I purchased it (which was like $3 less than the dvd at smith's or walmart and this is blu-ray)! It shipped really quick (only like 2-3 days) and the show looks and sounds great! it's not he best transfer out there, but the picture doesn't look very grainy and it has some good documentary style special features along with it!
B004EPYZUS|5.0|\\"Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol\\"  is a film that carefully blends non-stop action with riveting plot schemes.  Tom Cruise brilliantly portrays a fighter named Ethan Hunt.  Ethan has the adversarial task of battling criminal elements while adhering to discretion.  Paula Patton gives a strong performance as the headstrong and astute assistant Jane Carter.  A desire for vengeance drives Jane to help Ethan.  There was natural rapport between the interactions of Tom Cruise and Paula Patton.  Please understand that I also felt that Jeremy Renner and Simon Pegg powerfully portrayed their roles as Ethan's right hand men very well. It is just that something in the intense performances of Tom Cruise and Paula Patton compel me to check them both out in their future movies.  \\"Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol\\" is best for anyone that enjoys movies by any of the above mentioned actors and/or high-energy action films.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|The Bourne Trilogy is one of my very favorite franchises/trilogies ever! So I finally decided to get it on blu-ray and amazon had if for like $18 less than walmart so I bought it off here and it shipped really quickly! The blu-ray movies are in their own individual cases, and all 3 of the individual cases are in a cardboard case. This does NOT have the flip-disc of blu-ray to dvd like the individual blu-rays do (thank heavens)!! But to be honest, the bourne Identity and the Bourne Supremacy didn't get the best video transfers because they still have alot of grain and just don't appear that high def. (but they do sound great). The Bourne Ultimatum on the other hand looks and sounds great and is the best transfer of the set! The Ultimatum is the best of the 3 movies anyways and was the movie that I was most excited to watch on blu-ray, so I'm not too disappointed and will still give my review a 5 star review!
B004SBQGHS|1.0|i purched this copy to replace the free copy and its glitched and does not load backgrounds, foregrounds and obstacles. i have uninstalled and tried to install again and the problem persist. i do NOT recommend buying this game.
B001OQCV2E|1.0|2 hours & 40 minutes of poorly written dialogue & (unintentionally I think) funny acting. One \\"main\\" story line & 10........20......30.I lost count sub-plots. Few of them interesting. This movie badly needed editing and re-thinking on every level. Apocalyptic: the Earth's crust is melting and shifting due to sun spots & nuclear neutrinos & OH WHO CARES?!?!?! blah blah the Mayans predicted the End of Days to be 12-21-2012 .......(too bad they couldn;t have warned us about this stupid movie!) The same director did Independence Day & apparently that got him full control of this movie & he went for it BABY--Yeah the CGI effects are interesting hence the 1-star I gave it but this movie has every lousy cliche & emotion jerker set up ever used in a disaster flick and with much less effect than Towering Inferno or even that Poseiden thing.Special effects do not a good movie make in and of themselves. BUT if you DO watch this DVD please don;t skip the Adam Lambert music video in the Special Features......OMG! It is as awful as the movie & no gay glam guy should ever let them ruin his hair like they did here. A total hot mess. But WAIT......there's more.......an alternate ending?? Deleted scenes?!?!you mean they actually left things OUT of this turkey?? OK> My husband was in hysterics during the scene where the \\"scientist\\" (Ejiofor - doing his best to bring some dignity to this mosh pit)is trying to get to the something something chamber to unblock the gears (Lego Ark anyone??)and/or save the writer dude & the kids & the dog...stop STOP...but no.......so he's trying to get to the chamber in under 4 minutes & as he is pushing thru the crowds of \\"saved\\" passengers he is tapping them on the shoulders & saying \\"excuse me, excuse me\\" like he's in a hurry to get to the concession stand. One actor, as they are about to be swept by a tsunami into the side of Mt Everest (you heard me) actually puts his hands over his ears, elbows out, like a kid with a lit fire cracker. I am nnot making this up & the writers shouldn;t have either. WOW what amazed us both is that the movie just kept going and go---ing and GOING....& got worse and worse and WORSER As it kept going and going.........OH sweeet Bippy MAKE IT STOP. This movie so deserves to be made fun of but it is already its own parody.Incredible waste of talent (the actors probably thought \\" OHh Independence Day --how can I go wrong being in this movie??\\" Hey --we thought that too) time and no doubt GOBS of money. Positives: the kids weren't overly annoying and the dog was great. The most believable part of the movie is that uber rich people & self-serving politicians would be the ones saved by the Arks. I bought this movie for $2.99.....well worth it at that price but not a penney more!    BUT WAIT there's more!  HOW much do we owe China for building the Arks?? And who negotiated that deal?? The Vatican is destroyed? The Russian pilot dies?? (Hey I liked that guy --he looked like he was trying) I am SO annoyed that they let the feisty Russian girl drown.....really??! I mean would it have killed you to mix it up just a little bit and let her live & the DAD die?!?! The Chinese guy lost his foot in the gears!!  OH NO ..the Captain & Crew look like rejects from Captain Nemo.........Hey didja know that the 2012 Bentleys are voice start activated?? Super suspension on those cars too....good on ice. BUT wait.......those Russian twin kids might turn out to be OK humans because they will \\"share\\" the dog with the cute widdle girl...Woody--- WOODY.......run dude RUN........no wait you and the monk/priest with the gong have the right idea.......have some more tea dudes & crank up the Caldera..........de plane DE PLANE......are you asking me out on a date?!?!  It has already been proven many many times that you can pile a bunch of good actors into a movie but if they have nothing clever or useful of intelligent to say or do.......the movie will stink. OK> You get the idea. You wanna watch this movie........goahead, make your day.........no no it IS fun but it will make you regret that you are NOT getting those 2 hours and 40+ minutes back again. Not even if you beg & write a review for amazon.(--:  BUT WAIT there's MORE: If they thought they could allow like what.........100,000 people to \\"board\\" the Ark in under 4 minutes (or was it 15, who can keep track of these unimportant details?!?!) and they DID...please give the Airline Companies a call & tell them how you did it because they sure can't get an airplane loaded in under 30 minutes on a good day. Hopefully 2012 will not be the in-flight movie. ....on the other hand people sure would exit the plane a lot faster,,........MAKE it STOP...(--:
1451629184|5.0|This is a vivid account told by that beautiful little girl who's picture I used to see in the Post Office.But this is not just a story about survival.It is also a story about indomitable courage, strength and self sacrifice.Where most other children would have become a catatonic vegetable, had they been subjected to the daily rapings,some that lasted several hours when her abductor was loaded on drugs,then telling her that he wanted to videotape her having sex with a dog, then begging forgiveness with tears in his eyes, only to rape her again a few days later.Only a very unusual child could have remained steadfast, and not become catatonic or withdraw permanently into a state of shock.This beautiful child survived and knowingly sacrificed herself so that someone else would not have to take her place after she was told that she might have to be sold and kept in a cage if her crying didnt stop since it was interfering with her abductors fantasy.This child has now become a mature and beautiful woman, is a beacon of hope and a pillar of strength for others to look up to and find inspiration.This is her story, totally unforgetable, and will remain a part of you for the rest of your life.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|The Sound of Music earned spot #55 on the AFI top listing, a list only a few musicals got into. How did this movie get onto a list with Gone with the Wind and The African Queen?  Yes, the plot is a little simplistic. Evil nasty Nazis are threatening smiling beautiful children, and the family has to make a run for it. The children are not only photogenic but also have the voices of angels. Some of the lyrics are a little silly as well.  Still, these are minor complaints in a moving story based on a real life adventure. The captain really did fall in love with his governess, the children really did have musical talent, and the threat of the Germans drove them to flee. It's great to see this true world tale brought to the big screen with such beauty.  The scenes in Austria are just beautiful, from the elegant dances to the gorgeous landscapes. The movie really was filmed in Salzburg, Austria, and the exterior of the convent is the actual one the real Maria stayed in. You're getting an authentic world of the world these characters inhabited, although the house shown was not their real house.  Julie Andrews is phenomenal. From her pure voice to the glow in her cheeks as she falls in love, she is an ideal heroine.   Even more unusual, this movie actually passes the Bechdel test! The Mother Superior at the convent talks about how each of us has to follow our dreams, take on the challenges our life presents to us. Yes, in part it was about the captain, but it was about life in general, and she was talking about herself as much as Julie.   A great movie well worth watching and rewatching for the pure joy of the story.
B003GFIWGK|5.0|I've downloaded several free versions of Holmes from Project Gutenberg but thought that I thought that I should have one single collection with everything in it. The second Hollywood Holmes movie probably inspired me to continue reading the books.<br /><br />The Kindle version is now from Vintage Classics/Random House UK/2009. Everything is there, and the table of contents is lovely. PD James gives an introduction. Highly recommended!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B003GFIWGK The Complete Sherlock Holmes (Vintage Classics)]]
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I absolutley love this game! I play it all the time it is so fun and addictive. I have been playing it a lot since I got it and I love it
B00164GDD2|4.0|I bought the BluRay edition of this disc, used and got a great deal. Very happy about that. This was better than the original vhs but still grainy throughout the movie. It does give it a nice look. I can have my kids watch it and they aren't put off right away that its an \\"old\\" movie but still not a fantastic picture quality for being bluray on hdtv.
B005H0IW6W|4.0|Mr. B sounds great on this LP and the production is top notch.  The only thing that I wish we could change would be to eliminate Santa Baby from the playlist.  It is dreadful.  Horrible selection.
B0063GORYU|5.0|great. love playing it. its easy to use and so fun. I'm a fan. and I reccomend it to others.
B00632HWOG|4.0|An odd glitch with the Fire is you must rotate to landscape to scroll down the first time looking in a folder. Can then rotate to portrait, which is best way to view imo. Works quite well other than that.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|I'd meant to see this in the theaters but somehow missed it. I'd heard such scattered things about it-- it was good, one person said it made them cry, and more than one said \\"It's not what you expect.\\" I didn't know what I was expecting, really, so I didn't know how it could be Not That-- but it turns out, somehow, it managed that. It really wasn't what I was expecting.  I'm going to go on record and say this movie was ridiculously good. I haven't read the book although now I very much want to. I don't want to get into any specifics of the plot to avoid spoilers, but I will say that I loved all the characters except the ones I wanted to kick who were just horrible human beings. (Well, there was mainly just one who was especially horrible)  What was well done about it is that they were all just people-- even the ones who were horrid were mostly a sign of the times. That's one of the things that hit me hardest when watching this... how screwed up everything was at the time (and this movie was even pretty tame for that time period). Obviously this isn't the first time I've seen or read anything set during that time, and it hits me hard every time. What was probably the most impacting to me was the way the rich white women talked amongst themselves about things like why it was necessary for there to be an outside toilet for the help because they carried \\"different diseases,\\" and that such discussions were as offhanded as talking about benefits coming up or whether someone was going to get married.  I haven't read the book so I can't say anything in comparison to that, but I felt like the movie had a pretty good pace, excellent characters with fantastic acting, and places that made me laugh as well as places that made me cry. I have to admit that my favorite character was Celia Foote (Jessica Chastain). She was so sweet and adorable but also hilarious... I'm not sure how intentional all of it was but there were a lot of parts in the movie, even some in serious scenes, that had me crack up laughing (Minny/Octavia Spencer especially had some great looks).  I loved that when it comes down to it, this movie doesn't try to generalize an entire group of people by painting one side or another all good or bad. Instead, everyone is just a person-- with good and bad parts. Some people choose to show more of the good and some people choose to show more of the bad. And some maybe never realized they had a choice but may be trying to make one now. (Although admittedly, Hilly is just a horrendous person with few redeeming features. It's only the fact that you see her uncertain once or twice that she's still believable as a character-- because there are, sadly, people who seem to exist solely to make others miserable.)  I read some reviews where people pointed out some issues they had with the film/book, including that Skeeter is a bit anachronistic. I think there are some fair points made as to why someone may not be sold on some parts of the movie. Even though I can understand their viewpoints, and even though I think some of the points are good arguments, I still have to give this 5 stars because I think the story worked well for how it was intended and because I found it to be very moving. I'm mentioning this to say that the movie can still be very good even if you understand why others may not like it. If for no other reason, the acting alone deserves high marks.  If you're on the fence about it-- just try it. It's well worth the $2 and 2 1/2 hours to watch on instant video. If you are at all intrigued by the plot, you very well may love the movie.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Can't get through a level in Android 4.0 without the game freezing. Unplayable.  Looks like it will be a fun tower defense style game once it's fixed through.
B00689ILQC|5.0|Talk that Talk is Rihanna's best album by far. you da one and and Cockiness(love it) are two well written songs and the best two on the entire album. But Farewell and Watch n learn are the next two. She manages to get even more freaky than her two  previous albums combined. Greatest thin i have heard in a while i think Talk THAT TALK is better that Beyonce' album 4
0345529057|5.0|Good stories, books are well put together for being mass market paperbacks, not sure what all the negative reviews are about.
0446541478|5.0|I was very pleasantly surprised.  While one reviewer claimed this was just a series of anecdotes it isn't.  While written in a popular style this is a serious study of national development in Israel.  It is a careful analysis of the social forces that have made Israel such a success with recognition of the key political decisions that helped.  It is true, however, that the book would have been stronger if just a little time had been taken to discuss the situation of Arab citizens.  Is it just \\"mistrust\\" that has prevented the well educated Arabs from getting ahead in the high tech sector?  A few paragraphs on the threat poised by Israel's ultra-Orthodox population (which is also barely mentioned) would also have been appreciated.
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|I bought this movie on Blue Ray when it came out. Once I saw it this past summer I had to buy it! Fanning does a great job on one of her first movies Ive seen her in. The whole cast did a great job! Deffently a instant classic for all time.
1401233066|4.0|I got this the other day & of course I finished it within a few hours of getting it, then went back to admire the artwork once more.<br /><br />Firstly, the story in this is pretty good. We revisit Mr. Dark and see an ending of sorts that leaves enough open for a few more volumes. We also see hints of a new romance between two surprising characters. I won't name them, but in a strange way they seem to be a pretty good pair. Only time will tell if anything more comes from this. We also get to see more of Buffkin, which is always entertaining.<br /><br />The artwork is pretty good, but what I was most excited about was the Terry Moore story at the end of the volume. I absolutely love his art style, so it was a treat to see him do an issue of Fables.<br /><br />The only thing I'm a little concerned with is that the story is getting a little stretched out at times. There's still story to be done, but I'm not sure how much longer this series can really go without revisiting the same stories over again. This was only a small concern in this volume and it doesn't really bother me too terribly much, but at times it just feels like the series is growing a little stagnant.<br /><br />Overall this was pretty fun to read and I'll continue to read it, but this wasn't as exciting as the previous volume (Rose Red) was.
1423136802|5.0|Excellent seller... I received the item before when it was due....The Percy Jackson series is worth a read, and the boxed collection is well worth the money..Definitely recommended..
1439152799|4.0|Kate Morton did it again with a wonderful read. Her descriptions of the characters and the places in the book are fantastic. What twists and turns she takes with these people's lives !! The secrets just keep getting revealed and you as the reader are always waiting for the next revelation. She keeps you guessing throughout the book's 500 plus pages, but then kinds of wimps out at the end like she was running out of time or pages for this book. Still, I highly recommend it. It is a fascinating story.
B00689J512|1.0|I have not received the product ... several people who bought after I have received ... what's going on??  Pass me the tracking code.
B003Y5H54W|5.0|I enjoyed this movie because I can let my grandchildren watch it without scareing them to death.  I plan to make future purchase of this movie to give to my nieces and know that they will enjoy it as well.  If you have read the story to your children, you should know that this movie goes right along with the story.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome why would some people give it a 1star rating love love love love love ti's game so much
B006O5Y0SS|5.0|I absolutely was transported to that wonderful time in Paris, France and I can't wait to go there and sit on those steps at Midnight and go for that marvellous exiting ride back in time to meet all those interesting people  if only it could happen !!! meanwhile I will watch the movie from time to time and be transfixed once again  anybody who gets the chance watch it
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games are fun, but harder than what you might expect, so you still get a good challenge. app works great and is a blast to play!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I love how this app works and also the game well I am playing this on the kindle fire for the first time it's great so thank you to the creators of this app!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Very fun app. hard to move some characters around though. I would recommend downloading. very easy to get points too
B001UV4XIS|1.0|How can I write a review if the DVD will not play in my  player. all it says is wrong region. KI dont live in the states I live in Great Britain! Yes I did buy it from Amazon.0 stars  ican't rate it if I can't watch it
B004SBX112|5.0|this is the best angry birds ever new levels and a great new bird so fun u should get it
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I had heard complaints about too many characters, hard to follow etc, but it's not that many characters and they are all well developed, so easy to follow. Yes, it's a bit tough if the story of one character is suspended to follow another character around, but they all interlock. Interesting plot twists as well. Towards the end, a bit too much of sexual violence that is treated as happenstance, but then this draws the picture of the society. Not young adult fiction though ..
B003Y5H5FQ|3.0|The remake when compared to the original doesn't come close to adding up.Colin trys his best to save the movie and he was the only character that even came close to making it interesting..The new Peter Vincent..pathetic...the new Evil Ed..pathetic and stupid looking,not scary at all.No evil zombie bodyguard protecting the vampire,no good transfermation scenes.like Evil Ed turning from vampire to wolf to dead human with stake in the heart like the original.HOWEVER....after all those negatives..the 3D kinda saved the day and made it watchable.Amy's part at the end when she turned was creepy,and again...Colin tried his best.And the 3D was pretty good.
B000003CUJ|5.0|Incredible and beautiful.  The intense triangle during the cave's working slaves (0:09). The horns melding with the violins, building ever to a greater crescendo.    I wish I could write Lorin Maazel on his genius in both creating this masterpiece from a masterpiece, and in conducting it so well.  If you can afford it, get the video.  I could not (unemployed), so I watched it on YouTube from MD051 (zero five one):  [...]  This is a good example where the transmission of knowledge, even when at zero cost (YouTube), helps create sales, because this is one of those.  You can see the giant wooden sledge at (12 minutes).  I think those with money will buy the DVD.  But I'd sure like to give some money to Maazel.
B004YJMQCS|3.0|Had anyone told me that I would've liked any of the Final Destination movies since maybe the 2nd one I would've told them they were nuts....predictable..i.e everyone must die,etc,etc. But because I am a fan of 3D,and I thought the 3D scenes were good,I actually enjoyed this one.I am puzzeled that some of you said that yours came with 3d glasses or that it didn't work on your 3d set.Did you purchase the blu ray version ?? I thought everything flying out of the screen made it fun,even if it was predictably violent.
B005HSL626|5.0|The fruit ninja is absolutely amazing!!! It was a very good time killer. On the fruit ninja free, you can play classic mode, zen mode, and arcade mode.
B005HSL626|5.0|Good game to have some quick fun with. I like using it on my tablet not my phone. having a bigger screen for the game makes it a lot better.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|I love this game, it have great graphics and everything, I would recommend it to anyone to play.,. The best part I like about the game it helps you throughout the game and the evidence is not so easy to find but u will get it eventually. Awesome game.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|My family just opened this for Christmas. We bought the warehouse version which cost $12 less than the \\"new\\" version and it was completely brand new unopened with no issues at all. So excited to watch this from start to finish with all the extra features.
B0040UAYI4|5.0|This thing works great.<br />One thing you have to do is take your time in setting it up. Once it is set it is like being on your PC. I am an avid PC gamer since the days of my old 286 IBM playing off a 5.25-inch floppy disk. Penguin United web site has sample configs for you to use by other gamers. Pick a game and down load a config for it. The tuning in is for your mouse. Take the time in doing this. Important. Do not skip this step or it will not work well. Need to take a few min in this step. It is not a 100% plug and play thing. All mice are deferent and this is why the tuning in is needed.<br /><br />Now to get one for my XBox 360. kids are mad at me. I took back my man cave.
B005C9YZIW|5.0|I specifically ordered the special edition in blu ray because of the extra features and because people praised the narration compared to the US version (which we already had, but lost a disc). I really love it but thought I'd mention that the episodes start off differently than the US versions. there's no intro video like the US ones had. Not a big deal except I had grown so used to it and loved seeing the shark attack before each episode.
B005HSG3VK|3.0|I love the bright pink of the cover and how easy it was to put on my Fire. However, I think the cover doesn't convert to a stand good enough. It falls down at the littlest movement. I do like the band that holds it shut. Personally, I would like this item way better if it were all pink! Over all, though, I am satisfied.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|this game is a colorful game that keeps people entertained and amused when they are bored. and being annoying. anyone young or old can play this even if they are weird.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is the best pocket sharpener for the money. Its small compact size lets you carry it in your pocket or EDC bag. I have used it on my pocket knives, kitchen knives, and shears.
B0041QSZJM|2.0|This is such a misfire--no coherence.  Demonstration of political correctness and/or \\"we are such creative musicians\\" that will appeal to many of like mindedness. (I do own many other disks sung in foreign languages.) One star subtracted for group support of Occupy terrorists seeking to destroy America. As always, listen to samples first.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome it would be so worth it if it cost 99 cents I think that the ads aren't enjoying some Pol are like ought I have to unlock games. well if they gave us all 100 games at once we would be bored within a day
B004LUS390|1.0|App dosent even open on a kindle fire, just spits out error messages THIS MUST BE FIXED ON A PAID APP!!!
B005NJ2K6U|4.0|My specs: Samsung Gravity SMART (runs Froyo, low-midrange). I'm not a huge fan of the \\"match 3\\" genre, because the vast majority of them are nothing more than Bejeweled clones. Not this one! The twist here is that your gems are encased in larger shapes, and you clear the shapes by matching a piece on each square of the shape. The tricky part is that while you can move shapes adjacent to each other, you cannot move gems from one shape to another. You can, however, rotate the shape 180 degrees provided there is enough space to do so.  I had a lot of fun with this game, but I was disappointed that there wasn't so much as a \\"Congratulations!\\" screen when I cleared the last area.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is so fun. It can be picked up and played at any time but very hard to put down!  beautiful game.
B004DMIIVO|4.0|For the people who say this movie is \\"anti-American\\" because our government is the bad guy, thank you for worrying me over nothing! I had already purchased this product when I read one review about the movie having an anti-America theme, and it made me regret buying it. This movie is in no way offensive. If anything, we're hardly mentioned at all, and it even says that the military did not know it would have these results and became out of their control. So, don't believe what those people say. It's perfectly fine. It's a bit corny in some parts towards the end, but the animation is FANTASTIC and it's an enjoyable movie. The main character is quite adorable, and I would definitely recommend this movie.
B005ZUR724|2.0|I'd love to play this game on the kindle fire but it will not install. I keep receiving an unnamed error.
B002OFWG7E|5.0|Thanks to Amazon's snippets of albums, I listened to this album and decided I would buy it. The first time I heard it I was completely impressed. I thought to myself, \\"how could I have missed this one?\\" This is music that I never knew existed because I just thought the name \\"Foo Fighters\\" sounded like it was out of my generation. Boy, what a mistake! Every song on this I think is some of the best music of any generation. I started listening to their stuff in March and now it's December and my 5th album just came in. \\"Stacked Actors\\" and \\"M.I.A\\" are excellent, but unfortunately didn't make it on to this one. Dave's music reminds me a little of the classic stuff with a heavier mixture of fresh and new. The man is a musical genius, no doubt. Playing drums seems to have been an important experience because I could swear that he's taken the drum and molded it into a guitar, a masterful one, at that. I recently told my son in law about my discovery and the first thing I said was, \\"Dave Grohl is a guitar God!\\" \\"I have re rated all I ever knew about musicians and I put \\"The Beatles at #1 (I don't see how anyone could ever touch them), Led Zeppelin at #2 and Dave Grohl at #3\\". \\"He's that good\\"!
0736092269|5.0|I had been working out to build muscle and referencing several years already, so the knowledge of how to workout was already familiar to me. I just felt I needed something I could actually put on my bookshelf that wasn't like a 300 pg book on fitness and nutrition.   This book is perfect for that! I can very easily grab the book and flip toward the pages I want. The diagrams in here are also amazingly drawn and very easy to understand. They highlight the obvious muscles you would use in an exercise and mentions any supporting muscles that are also used. There are a few exercises I do that aren't in here, though. I would be curious to see a diagram for those. However, you can feel certain that there is a workout [or two ;)] for virtually every muscle in the body.   I also really like the fact that there are pages in here to help prevent bodily injury due to poor form, posture, bodily morphology, etc. The author even says to proceed with caution on certain exercises depending on whether you are tall, short, broad shouldered, or if you have long or short arms! All these are just some of the more common injuries that happen in strength training and should not be your sole source of information. This book is not to replace a doctor.   So if you are someone who prefers to workout alone... or if you truly want to create a FULL BODY program and not the typical chest-bicep-tricep-ab workout... I highly recommend this book!

B001KEHAI0|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've ever seen and this Bluray version is the one I've been looking for. Don't think twice, buy it!
B0015DROBO|5.0|With all the buzz about the movie being released based on this novel, I figured I ought to see whether it was worth it. I have to admit, I got off to a slow start with this story, but by chapter 3 I was getting hooked. I have seen some reviews that were negative because of the rough sexual content, but I found that while the scenes were described enough to understand the horror perpetrated...I have read a lot more graphic descriptions elsewhere. I fell in love with Lisbeth...the troubled young woman who is so misunderstood by the world around her. She has learned to deal with those who wrong her...sometimes rather harshly...but I found I was rooting for her all the way. Considering how many months this book has been a top seller, I am convinced that its praises were well earned. I recommend this story for any reader seeking an excursion into a fascinating mystery.
B001B6PBBK|1.0|Ignore all 4 star reviews. This movie goes nowhere. Seriously< i did not like it. Spending any more time on the review is throwing away useful time after wasted time.
B00632HWOG|4.0|its a pretty good app I like how I can get on with out getting on the Internet so just try it
B002VKE1K2|5.0|\\"Paranormal Activities\\" demonstrates that creative, no frills movie-making methods can scare the pants off of people. What's scarier, for instance, than watching video playback of your girlfriend standing in the middle of the bedroom at 3 a.m. -- just standing there, and nothing else -- as you sleep soundly? Or seeing her sneak off in the middle of the night to sit alone on the porch swing on a chilly California night, once again well past midnight. The events in \\"Paranormal\\" get eerier and more disturbing as the movie moves along at a brisk clip. This poor couple can't escape the malicious presence that terrorizes in both subtle and overt ways: persistently loud thuds and odd noises; a disconcerting hum whenever evil is in the room; a swinging chandelier after a particularly harrowing episode; a wisp of wind that snakes under the covers in the stark of night, infiltrating its target with ease. Who wouldn't be driven over the edge by this stuff? It doesn't help that the cocky camera keeper eggs the demon on at times.<br /><br />Arguments abound as the couple struggles for solutions. Following the mold of the great \\"Blair Witch Project,\\" \\"Paranormal\\" is a horror \\"documentary\\" that feels as real as real life. This isn't one of those movies where a demonologist cutely breezes in to save the day (think \\"Poltergeist\\" from 1982). In \\"Paranormal,\\" when the ghost expert returns to the house two-thirds of the way through the movie, he apologetically runs for his life. Now THAT indicates a problem.<br /><br />Probably the scariest movie I've ever seen to this point ... don't watch it alone.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|true some games are a little boring. 90%are half decent though. and you cant expect a free app with 117 great games. making games unlockable adds to the fun.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is all I one fun for everyone and everything for every person. this is the best app I have gotten in a long time.
B004N44SOI|5.0|A good friend turned me on to this.  I had heard that Nikki Sixx had a solo project but I did not think anything of it.  This stuff is better than Motley Crue.  Nikki Sixx is a more accomplished musician than I realized.
B006JPS1OM|3.0|real easy to play and fun and exciting to play some problems with selecting items though.  Have fun with the game I am sure u will enjoy it.
B004LWZW4W|1.0|Bought the blu-ray but not able to watch it because it saying it needs encrypted new key update with ps3, I'm disabled and not able to hook my ps3 to internet for update, I wish Sony would put this updated on an availble dvd to update, not everyone can hook up there ps3 to the interenet or able to put it on a usb
B0066W1AZK|4.0|This game is a lot of fun!  I gave it four stars because the game could have had a more entertaining interface. The sound effects and animations are lackluster and bland; however, being able to name your computerized opponent is a positive quality.  If you're looking for a simple and challenging chess application, go ahead and give this one a try.
0439023521|5.0|I can't wait for the movie to come out. Hopefully the movie will add a little more tension between Gale and Peeta.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is fun. It is fantastic you get 101 + 16 extra. That equals 117 games total. I recommend this game for anyone who loves games. Plus people who get bored easily.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I am hooked. I loved reading a review and being able to buy the book for .90 The next best part was to get a free book per month. I also watched for free some previous programs, Fire Fly in particular. The only problem I have encountered is when I loaded in a wifi away from home when I tired to use my system at home I had to reset the unit. The help line was able to get me reset right away. I have had to do this 2 times.   Is ther a new update to prvent this?
B0043URV5U|1.0|The cd itself is awesome the problem was the cd has flaws..It sounds like it is scratched on some of the tracks, but there is no visible damage, I am assuming it is just a defective cd!
B003VANOFY|5.0|Great gaming set good sound quality very durable. I have this head set running on windows 7 64bit pro perfectly fine. Battery last a good 8 hours for me atleast. Don't be discourage. By other review I recently bought these and they did come withsoftware and a manuals. Very easy to install and run.  Only flaw is some games don't support the 7.1 surround so u can have some interferance with sounds. for example dead island doesn't support 7.1 so its constantly makes poping sounds you manually have to change you sound settting to 5.1 dolby atleast for that game v.v. but left 4 dead supports 7.1 and bf3 and the sound quality brings tears to my eyes, I never thought u could hear so much detail in game till tried these head sets. The mic works great on all voips and I can say u really do get what you paid for. One last thing you can use them while charging unlike many wireless head sets. So no having to lose any conversation cause of a dead battery just plug and play =D
1451648537|5.0|you can learn many useful things from this book . I love it .  Im not a critic so I don't know what I should write .
B000AL730Y|3.0|After years, this record is still the same as it was when I first heard it. And my opinion is the same too: a few prime songs, a couple of things that shouldn't have been there, and a couple of bad songs. First, ¿is this a concept album or just a bunch of slow paced tunes with two sort of rocking ones to help you not want to kill yourself out of depression?. I think Macca tried to impress his producer with some \\"deep\\" material, and although he can crank that type of stuff, I think he went too far. Two \\"fast\\" songs: Fine Line and I Promise To You Girl. Two out of thirteen. Fine Line is monotone, it's only virtue being well recorded. I Promise To You Girl is good, too much on the Wings side, so it's just ok and helps the record shed some daylight into murkiness. Then there's the hits: Jenny Wren, solid acoustic pure Macca, ranks with his best; Too Much Rain, superb song from a man who has suffered terrible losses, never lets it out but here he bares his feelings; A Certain Softness, here, his natural gift for latin rythms and boleros pays off with a delicate tune; and, This Never Happened Before, perfect love song, perfect writing and singing, a classic. Now the quite good not bad at all bunch: At The Mercy (could have been better with a faster pace and drumming), How Kind Of You (same as before), Friends To Go (if it actually had been sung gy George it would have been better, George was more of a cynic than Paul); English Tea is the type of song he can write for fun, it is good but obvious for this guy; Riding To Vanity Fair is better but the production, with the excepction of the cello at the end is a misfire, it is too dreary, this is not McCartney, he is not that vindictive, he is more a live and let die kind of guy, if he didn't vent strongly against John in their \\"war years\\", then this tune which is obviously about his ex, could have been treated with fun, like Dylan`s Don't Think Twice It's Alright or Macca's own Let Me Roll It. The there's the misses: FollowMe, a terrible song with no aim or melody, seem like Goodrich was tired by then and just wanted to get it done; and, Anyway, which sounds like Whatever, one more to fill the quota, with chords stolen from People Get Ready...zzzzzzzzzzzzz. So, hits and misses, the star producer of Radiohead didn't turn Macca into Radiohead and Macca did not turn him into George Martin, so, more of the same: 4 five star songs (20 stars), 6 three and a half star songs (21 stars), 1 two star song (2 stars), 2 one star song (2 stars). 45 stars divided by 13: 3.46 stars, so, 3.5 stars in general. That is not good, it could have been much better if writer and producer had brought a band, Macca can play everything but he is not Rusty on guitar nor Abe on drums, the live feeling would have given the album LIFE, it is almost dreary.
B005ETA5K2|4.0|I had the previous version of this product, 2000mw, which is totally the way to go. The old one I bought came with a suction-cup holder, and a 9dbi omni-directional antenna, along with better software too. While I sprung for this one because it was a tad cheaper, the 5dbi antenna is practically worthless. You can get a panel antenna for pretty cheap to screw into it to really get some range. Over all, I am happy with the product, I just wish it would have come with some of the extras that the old version came with for about the same price.
B001JIFYSA|2.0|good movie, would have gotten 5 stars if they cut the porno scenes out in order to go for a rating of PG13. those scenes were very awkward and out of place... the rest of the movie and the stories and interconnections were great!
B005ZUR724|5.0|Very similar to World of Warcraft.  Also very different. Requires constant internet connection. Fantasy levelling up game. Gear grinder. In app purchase microtransaction available, but not needed.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I have played many versions of mahjong, and this is the best I've played. I highly recommend it. the graphics are absolutely beautiful.
B005K17RU0|4.0|works well. have not had any issues with freezing or skitzy behavior.  One of the best weather apps I have used on Aneroid or iOS.
B0002IQOZA|5.0|Christina Aguilera has proved herself to be strong and ready to do anything with her new Christmas Album 'My Kind Of Christmas'. With many best loved and traditonal christmas songs such as 'The Christmas Song', 'Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas' with other songs such as 'Oh Holy Night' in a jazzed up version. But she has proved her musical talent by putting some of her own songs on their such as 'This Christmas' and 'Christmas Time'. The album contains a mix of jazz and soul, it will definitely put you in the festive mood or if you want something a little faster or something to dance too you can always listen to 'The Christmas Song' (Holiday Remix).
B005BDZN62|5.0|I was just 12 years old when West Side Story came out.  I had forgotten some of the awesome energy and the incredible musical arrangements, so to see the movie again on Blu-ray has been the best!  To see interviews with some of the stars of this classic and to learn about what it took to film this masterpiece makes it even better.  A great piece of film history that I would recommend for anyone.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I hesitated spending this amount of money on a cover, but I'm glad I did. Part of the package, so to speak. The worn look is pleasing to me, and if it looks more worn as time goes on, I favor it even more. I really like the snug fit and soft feel. I've wasted money on less expensive or same cost covers that inadequately secure the kindle.  One thing I have aditionally purchased is a sleeve in which to enclose the device so I can toss it in my bag without exposing it to dust, lint, etc..  No gimickry,shiny color, instead a signal of the quality of its contents.
B004529NKC|4.0|Forget the story line here, which is beyond stupid, and forget the acting, which is even stupider; just fast forward to the dance scenes.<br /><br />These are mixed. Hollywood has a love/hate relationship with street culture and never seems to know whether to present it raw or smooth it up and digest it into 'professional' work.<br /><br />Some of the more authentic hiphop pieces are amazing in their athleticism. And some of the produced pieces are first rate also. Adam G. Sevani is a super talented young guy; his takeoff on Fred Astaire's\\"I Won't Dance Don't Ask Me\\" is one of the best dance performances in movies since Gene Kelly - his partner Alyson Stoner is almost as good.<br /><br />On the other hand there are some faked up production numbers. The two main characters are replaced by dancer doubles in some places - easy to spot and jarring. In other places the frame rate of a dance sequence is artificially speeded up so it will appear more difficult than it is - obvious and a cheap trick.<br /><br />So a mixture. But still a fun movie.
0316098329|4.0|This is a great book.  The only downside is that I think it takes too long to get to the action portion, but after reading it and looking back it is great.  Keep reading and you won't regret it.
B005MYEPXC|5.0|Woodie Allen has finally reached maturity as a filmaker. He is less self absorbed these days, more universal and even self effacing. Midnight in Paris is wonderful, above all for the perfect casting. Everyone is just right. I loved Lea Seydoux; what a beauty.<br /><br />But Vicki Cristina Barcelona is even better.
