B0053O89KG|3.0|I love Castle.  All 4 Seasons have been the greatest and am enjoying season 5.  I just got season 4 and am enjoying it once again.  I do have one complaint and that's why I have given it a rating of 3 and it's the packaging. I wished they had of given it the flip inserts instead of packing one on top of the other.  I keep having to move disks around and be extra careful so I don't scratch them. I sure hope next season they package it like they did season 2 & 3. The price we pay is definately worth that little bit of extra.
0895292211|4.0|I believe this bok by Dr. Edward Howell is another very good example of the healing power we have in the food and supplements all around us. I really appreciated the simple instructions Dr. Howell used throughout the book. If we just add afew raw foods to our dietary intake we can improve our health and wellness. Dr. Howell doesn't go crazy and say that only raw food can be eaten, but including some is a must. I would also add that proper nutritional supplementation in todays is a must. Dr. Howell points out that we have a limited amount of emzymes in our bank and if we do not incorporate foods and/or supplements that help keep this bank full we will ultimately be overdrawn.[...]
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book is a nostalgic trip back to the 80's by way of the future!  What a treat to read this book and feel my geekdom is justified.  I have recommended this book to my friends and family.  And so should you!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Judi Densch and Maggie Smith seem to be attracted to making movies and shows about ordinary people and ordinary people can relate to these.  This was one of the very best movies I have seen, and all the more remarkable since Judi Densch is only partially sighted.  A winner - Oscar material for sure.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|This game was addicting for the first few min. I noticed you get money for being away. You get 1 coin every 30 sec. I left the game for an hour hoping to get a lot of coins but I only got 3. anyways I don't like the game
B009FO908A|5.0|So catchy and upbeat! Great tune. Plus Niall gets a solo, what more could you want? Or maybe I'm just a very biased Directioner...
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book grabbed my attention from beginning to end. Conflicts were as tense as ever and the relationships between characters was heart-throbbing. A must read for any book lover.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Totally awesome! Cant wait for next one to come out. When you start reading this book you will NOT want to put it down!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Read this beast in a day! Not the same feeling as the first, but it couldn't be. Can't wait to get started on the last one
B008MC175A|5.0|The bluerays are  crystal clear with amazing sound. They were packed nicely and came on time. It's nice to do business with pros.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Match 3 games are fun if they work well, unfortunately most don't on Android. This one works very well it has an interesting story. I would recommend it.
1423140605|5.0|Mr Riordan just keeps getting better.  My thirteen year old grandson loves this series as much as I do.  Outstanding
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love this game simply amazing addicitng time consuming fun for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and hours
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This movie exceeded our expectations big time. It is heartwarming and heartwrenching at the same time. Richard Gere was outstanding with the dog and vice versa.  If you love dogs and don't mind sobbing while watching a movie, then I would highly recommend it.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|The case worked against dropping, water, and dirt damage perfectly fine. However, I wasn't able to easily use the switch on the side to go from volume to vibrate. I had to use my teeth to make it work. Also, everyone that I talked to on the phone said that when they spoke it echoed back to them so anytime I wanted to talk on the phone without people complaining I had to take my gone case off. Although this case worked protection wise, it is not the best for functionality. I was disappointed since I paid so much for it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is amazing. I could never put the book down. I can't wait for the next one. I love Sylvia Days writing!
B007FG9LIE|4.0|this is a fast-paced read that keeps you wondering the whole time. The author does a great job perpetuating the mystery, and saving the big reveal til the end.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|played for a couple of hours. liked it. graphics are excellent.  but $5 is too expensive. should be no more than $2.  why 20 words?  good game good game good game
B000002GFC|2.0|The Very Best Of Cream contains twenty of Cream's hits.  You can check the mp3 offer for this CD to see what songs are included.  I purchased this CD used so I am not out alot of money.  The audio quality of this CD is poor.  There is no low end, there is no high end and there is no dynamic range.  In my opinion this CD does not qualify as high fidelity.  Not worth listening to.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|its fun. keeps you challenged. not boring. I keep having to come back to it. well worth it. try it
B005S9EJ46|5.0|A group of aging British folks are enticed into moving to India in hopes of finding an exotic paradise for their golden years.  Each of them have different reasons for moving but they all arrive to find something not quite what they expected.  The story evolves into how they all learn to cope, or not, with their new adventure.  I dislike giving too many details in movie and book reviews so as not to spoil it for others, but this movie was probably one of the best I've seen it a while.  Highly recommended.
B00992CF6W|4.0|ok so everytime I mine redstone in survival mode I get nothing. I tried it with every single pickaxes quality....and I wanna be able to make things like the Pc version
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I've been waiting for this book to come out and wasn't disappointed at all. It's an easy read, obviously, and no one would confuse it for great literature, but it's fun and it picks up nicely where the original left off. I felt a little frustrated with  the lack of communication between the characters at the end and was startled by the surprise ending. Looking forward to the release of the next book to see how Gideon and Eva's story concludes - but disappointed that I'll have to wait for it to be written. ;)
B000QCS8TW|5.0|George RR Martin is a genius, i could not put this book down. Right after I finished One, I started Two.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|I watched HBO's series GoT and fell in love with the series.  After season two I couldn't wait to see how it ended so I bought the books (kindle) and read all 5 and still didn't come to an end (frustration).  I have rewatched season 1 and 2 (recorded on my Direct TV box) and still get more and more information out of it.  The series is made complete on reading the books.  So much of the dialogue and references to names and places become clearer.  This is without a doubt one of the best adaptations of a books.  The locales, characters, all of it.  I have recommended this to everyone I meet.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Worked great on the kindle. Great graphics. Loved it really. Wasn't too easy or so hard I couldn't complete it.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love this app. There is nothing I would change. It is just like where's my water. Would totally pay for it. Get the app.
B002B413NQ|5.0|Excited to see what happens to Walt.  This show is addictive - no pun intended.  Interesting how the show has developed leading up to the final season, how they have taken Walt from a good guy who you sympathize with, to whatever it is now... dont want to spoil it for you.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The Mark of Athena by Rick Riordan was way beyond my expectations.  I never knew that Rick could write little scenes like that that had so much emotion and character to them!  I recommend this book through and through, however, you must read the first two books of the series first to really understand it.  Also, this series makes all the more sense when you've read his first big series Percy Jackson and the Olympians, which are amazing too.  You should read this if you're in elementary, middle, high school, or college.  Read it to your kids.  Its a fantastic book that fills the characters so well!  I absolutely can't wait till the next one.  SPOILER!!! This book about a group of 7 that travel to Rome and split up is exhilarating.  Annabeth goes off solo and runs into her destiny.  Percy, Jason, and Piper go off and gets in trouble with some ancient spirits and save the one and only...Nico di Angelo.  Leo, Hazel, and Frank find an old man's workshop and nearly get their heads chopped off.  Then they all head off to save Annabeth.....of which at the end of the book...her and Percy take a fall....(I LOVE THAT SCENE)...read it and you won't regret it!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I always enjoy Ken Follett's books and this was no exception.  He is a brilliant writer but I did feel  $19.99 was a little steep price wise.
B004SH40BQ|4.0|Using it with the nano 6 generation and Jay bird Bluetooth headphones. No problems finding headphones every time. Does drain nano battery faster when using it. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a small Bluetooth transmitter
B008A0PUSY|2.0|I'm so glad that I rented this from the library instead of purchasing it. I'm sure that many would enjoy it but I didn't. The combination of instruments and vocals was incredibly discordant and I found it more agitating than soothing.
B0053O89XI|5.0|A great set to enjoy TBBT season 5. This is the first Blu-ray season that I bought and I think I'll get the rest as Blu-rays.
B00846F1YW|5.0|keeps me entertained for hours.<br /><br />I would play it longer if there were more scenes.  hope they come up with a third version.
B005EGXTHG|4.0|Well we all went mad for this series, it's fantastic and bringing Katins back for another hunger game! Brilliant. I really enjoyed it, it wasn't quite as good as the first but still a great book!
B008XG1X18|5.0|love it I kill so much time with this if you pinterest on. your computer then you deffinatly need this
B005EGXTL2|3.0|Well she lost it, this was nearly not worth reading. I mean after the first and second books you are in love with Katins and all that she is and fights for, this is the only reason to read it to see how it all ends and who finally wins. Don't get me wrong it's a good story but she just lost the brilliance and standing on your toes type of writing.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|It was funny, enjoyed it to the end. Caracters were developed well, and the now/before was mixed evenly. Didn't want to put it down.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|love the app. It is a critical tool in my work and life<br />Evernote has designed a mobile app to work with all features you get in the desktop version.
B009B50QOU|5.0|This band is still the best and most relevant in all of music and one of the only true hopes we have for rock's ultimate survival.  UNO rocks!!!
1455519006|5.0|Shoot To Kill<br /><br />Will Robie is the man America or her allies turn to when they need someone eliminated.  Classified as one of the top five assassins in the world, nothing gets between him and the job that must be executed.  The only problem is that the latest assignment just turned his world upside down.<br /><br />Sent to a small apartment near the nation's capitol to eliminate what he was told was a woman who was attached in some way to terrorism, everything was going to his plan, until he was just about to pull the trigger.  At the moment, a small child who was in the same bed with the woman he was tasked with killing, woke up, and his world began to unravel right in front of him.  When he refused to kill her, his handler took out both the woman and the child she was holding.  There was another child in a bassinet beside the bed, which Will grabbed on his way out of the apartment, and began running for his life.<br /><br />Will doesn't know who to trust, or who to turn to, when event after event forces him to re-examine every case he has ever worked on.  The FBI and Secret Service can't help because they have both been infiltrated by whoever is after him, and their doesn't seem to a way out.<br /><br />Every person he interviews, every lead he goes after, death follows.  Will should be used to death because that is what he is best at handing out, but this seems personal.  Someone is after him, and him alone.  It doesn't matter how much collateral damage it takes, Will Robie is a marked man.<br /><br />From the Middle East, to the coast of Africa, to Washington D.C., this non stop thriller will have you on the edge of your seat holding your breath until the final act.  It never felt so good to root for a guy who kills people for a living, but you sure are glad that he is out there keeping people like you and me safe from the lunatics of the world.<br /><br />The Innocent by David Baldacci
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|I first saw this film in the 70s and have loved it ever since.  It is so unique and funny a story.  Furthermore, the casting of Ruth Gordon and Bud Cort was genius.  I love showing this to friends who've never seen it.  It's a hit!
B007TBZ63Y|2.0|I love the Percy Jackson series, but this book went no where. You would expect a big reunion between Percy and Annabeth, nope. The action was so short lived and doesn't even compare with the action in books passed. Too many main characters and all it focused on was their insecurities. Very depressing point in this story line. Thumbs down in a big way.
B004HX4RT6|5.0|Solid chess game. Good chess engine, not predictable. No weird permissions. Nice simple, changeable graphics.  Writes to SD card. What's not to like.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved the second one much better because it was written without the same affects of Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy. I cant wait for the third book to come out. December cant get here fast enough!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|So much better than any other book I read, lots of action, jokes, and a surprise twist you wouldn't understand.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|From the day we downloaded we all take turns playing, myself,  husband &amp; our boys (age 4 &amp; 9) they love it as much as I.<br />The sounds effects are great! You get plenty of coins to play for free and overnight you gain more!<br />We all love Coin Dozer. So much fun!<br />Unlocking puzzle pieces is the most fun and the more you play-the better it benefits you in the game!
B000FC1MM8|4.0|Once again I got caught up in the human drama of poor, out of luck Harry Bosch as he takes on bureaucracy both post earthquake and during his post traumatic stress syndrome on the force. Interesting to revisit and solve a complicated murder that touched his family and molded his future. Most enjoyable and a truly simple yet engrossing read. DG
B007L6VR6M|2.0|There is no commentary audio, and about 10-15 minutes of behind the scenes which were already available on the internet.<br /><br />I love this film but this release was barebones. I imagine they will rerelease it with more content to the Criterion collections while getting more money from Wes Anderson fans.<br /><br />I would void buying this release if you can manage.
B007PJFIU6|4.0|Dixit is one of our fave party games! The artwork is fo shizzle \\"whimsical\\" as Wil Wheaton says. Each drawing is most awesome. Very detailed, indeed. You could sit and look at each picture, one by one, and totally forget about keeping score and all that \\"winning\\" as Charlie Sheen says. And every player is in the game until the very end. That always keeps everybody interested. And, even if you didn't win the last game, you come back for more next time cos you were just so close! We love the ambiguity of it all. What YOU see in a drawing is not what your neighbor sees. Again, awesome. The game is a great mini glimpse into the psyche of the other players.<br /> The only complaint/question I have is, when will it be available on Kindle? I've seen an app for the iPad and Android, but not Kindle!  We bought Dixit on Amazon. We're loyal to Amazon (I don't know why) but no Dixit app for Kindle yet? Hopefully soon.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|love the game! I keep playing a puzzle until I reach 3 stars! can't wait to try all the new levels.
B007SGM084|5.0|All of my girlfriends were reading it!! Talking about it on all social network sites, reading it on lunch at work...I wanted to see what the fuss was about so I downloaded book one on my kindle shortly thereafter and omg!!! This trilogy!! All I could think of was...Lawd where is MY Christian Grey!!! Lol Suspense, romance, and erotica...what more could you ask for in a book! Kuddos to E.L. James. She did an awesome job with this trilogy! I'm anticipating a book 4 or a motion picture!! By far the best non fiction book(s) that I've ever read! #Team50Shades
1449410243|5.0|Vety entertaining book... makes you wonder what your cat is really thinking ...funny and enlightening.  Sheds light onto a cat and their personality.
B008XG1X18|4.0|pinterest definitely got cooler when you were able to download the app on your mobile device. before that I couldn't even pin on my kindle fire or phone.. it does crash sometimes, so you have to back in but other than that its a very cool app. I've got and used many cool ideas that I've pinned. its very addictive!
B005OP7162|5.0|Heard about this series from a friend at work.  Decided to give it try.  It is a combination of Mission Impossible/Dark Angel/and Dynasty. Not sure how long they can play this idea out.  I've been watching season 2 live this year.  It's really good but season 1 blows it away.  When I watch the video on the computer it is very smooth. When I watch it thru a HDMI cable onto my HD TV, the action scenes are a little jerky.  I don't know the reason for this.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Fun and addictive. I felt compelled to leave the game and rate this. It really has a unique premise in its storyline. It does become very challenging as you go.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Did not disappoint. Gideon and Eva were just as exciting in this book as they were in the first one. This series is right up there with the Fifty series. Can't wait for book number Three.
0553801473|5.0|The book is a parallel in the begining and then catches up the continuing saga of the Game of Thrones.<br />I enjoyed the read, but will tell any fan that they have to wait for the next book to find out what<br />happens next.
B0097PW7H8|1.0|Battery Doctor turns itself on in the middle of the night and when I check in the morning my phone is at 15% battery (while connected to the charger) because it went into some other charging method.  I never had this problem before installing Battery Doctor.  Have now un-intalled it.
B00910Y1OQ|1.0|Will not install either on my Nexus 7 or Razr Maxx, no matter what I try. Last time I tried I got message indicating there was trouble &quot;parsing&quot; the package--HUH????
B0057O6IDW|3.0|This is not a review of the movie (because I LOVE this movie), but a review of the Bluray transfer. I was very disappointed. I understand that given the original film, there is a limit as to what can be improved, but in my opinion this Bluray offers nothing to merit purchasing it over the already fine DVD version which I already had. When I buy a Bluray I expect it to be worth the price of the update. The sound on this is no better than the DVD. The picture is barely better.  It does not pop, nor did it even seem to be in full 1080p.  It's buying these kinds of Blurays that make me really question the overall worth of this format. There are certain Blurays that ARE well worth the upgrade (Blade Runner for one), but sooooooooooooo many others seem like nothing more than a attempt to suck more dollars from loyal fans who, like me, are constantly trying to obtain the best possible movie experience. I can not readily recommend this product.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Season One started it all.  Now we're in Season 3, and the show is addictive!  Haven't seen The Walking Dead?  You must see this series!
B000P0J06U|5.0|Everything was as promised. The DVD was in good condition in what seemed to be original packaging.  The price was great and delivery was quick.  I would definitely recommend this reseller.
B008XG1X18|4.0|the only flaw is that sometimes it crashes right at the beginning of opening it. Other than that it's so easy to use
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|This is a very decently polished gem matching game. I've played through a few levels, and I'm finding it to be enjoyable enough.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Sometimes when you read a book that is similar to another, not so good.  However, Sylvia Day rocked this series.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I prefer to use pinterest from my laptop, but will use from my kindle if necessary. I receive numerous error messages during each session.  pinterest is often &quot;not responding&quot; ...which results in program closure. with a few updates, I'm certain it would be awesome.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I cannot finish this book. I have the trilogy and I think I 'm just going to delete it from my Kindle because I don't think I can stand reading anymore of it. I really recommend spending your money on something with more substance, less repetition (seriously, what was the problem here with the repetition), and less irritating relationship angst. The hype about hot sex scenes- those people MUST have been reading a different book. There is better erotica out there if that's what you're looking for.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Although this series mirrors 50 shades it is still on my top 10. I am totally enjoying this series and can't wait to read more by this author.  It has all the sex but so far none of the bondage. lol
0307960471|3.0|Others have summarized the plot well. Harry going all out to protect the son of his long time lover gets your adrenalin flowing quickly.  By the middle of the book, sadly, the narrative becomes plodding and repetitive--Harry has too many \\"drink or not drink\\" scenes; too many scenes where he gets away with squeezing former friends and foes for help, etc.<br /><br />The ending is very muddled and unsatisfying.<br /><br />There is an excellent novel here, if an editor had been more rigorous.  The Snowman was much, much better.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|This book had a lot of the punch the first book did, but it was a little more tame and not as intense.  It tied up the loose ends, but kind of left me feeling like there should have been more.
B0013LKFVO|1.0|I got the Nite-ize bulb upgrade for $9.99.<br /><br />I don't know if this one is defective or not, because it lights (like a tired old incandescent) and flashes. The flashes are slow at first but speed up to an eye-straining pitch.  In a Mag Light, a bulb is supposed to focus, and this one slightly adjusts from medium-beam to semi-diffuse, never tight or wide.<br /><br />I'm sure that the batteries would last 3x longer, since it's 1/3rd (or less) as bright as a krypton bulb.<br /><br />Ten bucks wasted.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I can't live without it. It Has Made A Big Difference In My Life. Thanks To All That Made It. God Is Good.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|The beginning was hard for me to get into.  But when I got past that I loved the book.  Now I can't wait for the next one!!!
B009A3NGF4|4.0|I feel that there were a couple very good songs on this album.  Broken Crown(was very edgy and more rock-like) and Wait So long(already a classic for me) were excellent and Babel was very good.  The rest of the album sounded very similar and kinda sad.  If you like Mumford & Son you'll still like to listen to the whole thing, if not, just buy the three best songs on Itune.
0593070631|5.0|I was lucky enough to be able to get the book for £10.00 and its amazing.<br />I read most of it in my hotel room, due to shitty weather, and it actually<br />turned out to be the best day of my trip!<br />I've been a fan since 2005 and to be able to explore the band in this new<br />light was amazing. Ive found a new love for the boys and their music. I hope<br />they do another book soon, one with tour stories!!
B004I4M0A2|1.0|This is by far the worst app I've downloaded.  I could not get a single item to appear in the browser.  Only by doing a search on broad topics could I get any merchendise to show.  The photos are microscopic and cannot be expanded or even  zoomed in on.  For such a fine business to put it's name on such a poor program is really pathetic.  Deleted and purged from the Cloud.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome  book keeps my eyes glued on the screen  and is very detailed and is full of action and romance.
B008XG1X18|5.0|for me the app on my fire is quicker than on my computer and a lot better. I don't have a problem with it freezing like others
B002U5HKZ6|3.0|This biography is good and interesting, but not exactly captivating.  It's a harder read and I am struggling to get through it.  It's one of those books where you want to know what happens but it's an effort to get through.  I'd compare it to the Steve Jobs bio.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this series! This book was better than the first, if that is even possible! i am buying the next one as soon as i submit this review!!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|its the best game in the whole world!!! no other game is better than this one! those of u who like to run you'll love this game!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is a fun game that works with a variety of ages and has an interesting story and graphics. I wish more of amazon's free offerings were similar quality of this game.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|my three year old and five year old both love to play this game it is the best free game out thetr
B008673ZAQ|4.0|\\"Reflected in You\\" was a really good book; however it had too much back and forth between Gideon and Eva. Every time I thought they were getting closer to each other he seems to push her away. His constant hot and cold mood swings were beginning to drive me crazy at certain points. I understand why he was so tormented throughout the book because of what he did and how he was trying to protect Eva but it still doesn't explain everything about his lashing out at Eva all the time. I really wished this book spent more time allowing us to get to know Gideon better.<br /><br /> I really loved \\"Bared to You\\" but I a felt like she left us hanging at the end of the book in regards to Gideon's story. I was expecting to find out more about Gideon's past in this book. She only revealed one major thing about his past. Yes it was a big thing and helped to explained some of his nightmares. But I feel that there is more to his mental state. What happened in Gideon's home as child with his step father and brother? Why is Chris Vidal is so resentful to Gideon?<br /><br />I thought that some of the repeated descriptions of Gideon's office and the city were not really necessary. The way Nathan was brought into the story was so brief. I wanted to know what was going on in Nathan's mind and how he was tracking Eva as well as for how long.  I want to know who was in Corinne's apartment when Eva stopped by her building. Will Eva's father ever find out what Nathan did to her as a child?<br /><br />There are so many unanswered questions. I really hope she can bring it all together in the third book.
B0065AVS0K|5.0|Awesome, did they ever come out with Sin City 2.  I have watched this several times.  It is a classic that you don't want to miss.
1400052181|5.0|Henrietta Lacks was a poor African-American woman who died in 1951 at the age of 31 from cervical cancer. She was treated at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, where it was discovered that she had an amazingly aggressive tumor and was in agonizing pain. While she lay dying, some of her cells, both healthy and diseased, were extracted from her for further use in research. This was done without her knowledge or permission, or the knowledge of her family. This was actually common procedure at the time. At the time, permission was not required.<br /><br />Others cells in other patients had not worked. Most cells will divide for a certain number of times and then die. But for some reason, Henrietta's cells were amazingly vital and survived. Her cells were dubbed \\"HeLa\\". HeLa cells were the first human cell line to prove successful in vitro, in test tubes or Petri dishes , which has had profound impact on medical research. For example, Jonas Salk used HeLa cells to test the first polio vaccine. They have also been used in cancer and AIDS research. HeLa cells were dubbed \\"immortal\\" because they could be divided an infinite number of times. They still exist, in various forms, today.<br /><br />Henrietta's family knew nothing about the HeLa cells until many years later. Here is where the story gets even more complicated: the original doctor, George Gey, seems to have had no bad motives. He was completely dedicated to medicine, and simply wanted the cells for further research. Gey freely donated the cells to other researchers. However, it was other companies who obtained HeLa cells who made money off of products invented because of the cells. Henrietta was forgotten or unknown to most of the scientists and researchers. While some corporations made millions, Henrietta's family, while proud that her cells have helped countless others, have remained poor.<br /><br />The whole idea of medical ethics is enormously complicated. Was racism involved? Was it because Henrietta was poor and black? Or was it simply in the interest of science and medicine? What about the companies who benefitted financially from the research? Are cells still harvested today without permission? The answers are not as simple as they may seem.<br /><br />This book studies medical ethics, family history, racism, and poverty. Author Rebecca Skloot does a fine job in researching and setting forth her arguments. This book was obviously a real labor of love and she is passionately devoted to the subject. Skloot became so involved with the family that she set up a foundation to help them: The Henrietta Lacks Foundation.<br /><br />If I have any quibbles about this book, it is that it is a bit too long. I did make my husband read the book. It is not at all the sort of book he usually reads, but he is a scientist and he found it fascinating.<br /><br />I also highly recommend this book. It is not light reading, but it is undeniably intriguing and important.<br /><br />Henrietta's cells have helped many scientists and researchers develop new ways of dealing with disease. In this way, Henrietta Lacks has become truly immortal.

0345803507|3.0|As most of you probably know, Fifty Shades Freed is the final installment in the Fifty Shades trilogy, and for my money, it is entertaining if you have enjoyed the series-to-date, but also entirely too expected.<br />What started out as an interesting, dark and psychologically twisted sexual tale, soon becomes a story about change, love and all of that mushy unrealistic crap that's penned in some of these fictional romances.<br />To my mind, Christian Grey is annihilated in character within these pages, turned by affection and what he believes is the weakness of his past. Anastasia Steele (now his wife), excavates to the very essence of what drives the darkness that makes Christian so infallible and interesting in earlier plots. She smooths his emotional wrinkles and even begins to embrace what she found morally reprehensible within his previously rigid character in earlier novels.<br />Although there was a part of me that enjoyed this happy, safe and neatly wrapped up ending, there was a part of me that longed for something more sinister, perhaps more of a play on Anastasia's unfurling confidence versus Christians domineering and heavy-handed approach to all situations.<br />There was no lack of sexual content. In fact, towards the end of the book I felt like throwing it at a wall, wondering what the hell my husband and I were doing wrong if simply the darkening of his mercurial expression made her insides tighten and mouth part in need. I mean, what married couple really has sex three to four times a day? I was honestly exhausted just reading about it!<br />Once again the plot followed expectation. There was no real mystery or unexpected twist requiring clever deduction on the reader's part. The action was limited (unless you count the incessant fornication) and the writing style was adequate but not overly expressive (unless you count Anastasia's ability to orgasm with a simple worded command - unrealistically impressive).<br />Overall, as I've said before the series is enjoyable if you take it at surface value - a simple, slightly twisted romantic read with a few shock factors. Fifty Shades Freed was the lightest of all novels with the predictable happy ending. Again, this is only going to be a three out of five fangs rating for me but this is based on my earlier interest in the much more complex, self-serving and charismatic sadist known as Christian Grey.

B005LAIHR2|2.0|This movie was painful to watch.  I, for one, knew what I was getting into.  I love musicals, this is a musical- perfect match, right?  WRONG.  If we're going to have a rock musical then please- let it ROCK!  The voices of the main leads were too smooth- Julianne Hough's voice was as far from rock n' roll as they could possibly get (and actually borderline obnoxious if I have to be honest).  The plot line was weak, at best.  There was nothing fun about this movie.  I can handle cheese, when done well.  Awful, just awful.

I also love how mike has chose the compound proven exercises that really work.  This book has an amazing amount of info on everything you need to know to get in shape and feel great. I also love how you can email him with any questions and he takes the time to give you advice etc. Everyone looking for a good program to follow should certainly give this one a shot!

B000FVE3AC|1.0|I just got my Invicta 3044 in black and the 3045 in blue.  Wow!  These things are beasts!  Heavy and solid.  I just love the feel and look of them.  I'm a big guy, about 6 feet 3 inches and about 230, so I think the watches fit me well.<br /><br />Pros are the sturdy feel, the tight yet smooth turn while winding it and setting the time, the overall finish and the price.<br /><br />The only cons I could think of are the \\"diver\\" emblems on the band and on the face.  They seem to clutter the look of a very attractive watch.  Also, the diving watch look is pretty well known.  I just don't see a need for the emblems.<br /><br />I will let the review board know how it keeps time in a month or two.<br /><br />Overall, it's an excellent value and I would recommend this product.<br /><br />Two weeks later and I still love the watch.  The clasp is getting a little easier to open and I've noticed no error in its accuracy.  This is a fine watch.  I'll be buying Invicta again.<br /><br />As of 12/26/2012, it (the black 3044 that I wear daily) still works perfectly and I'm still very happy with my purchase.  It's a great value by any measure.<br /><br />July, 2013.  I had placed the blue 3045 in a drawer (still in the box) for safe keeping.  I had only worn it maybe 2 or 3 times.  I pulled it out this month and could not get it to work.  An inspection by a jeweler said that the mechanism had been cracked so badly that it is amazing that it worked at all after I received it.  The repairman gave me an estimate of $250-&300 to replace all the inner mechanism.  OUCH!  I had not dropped or bumped this watch at all.<br /><br />In short, I'm not impressed.<br /><br />But wait!  There's more!<br /><br />The emblem which marks the 6 on the black 3044 has fallen lose.  Another $50.<br /><br />The reader should keep in mind that I am a health care professional.  Theses watches were only subjected to very light usage.<br /><br />To sum, they look good and feel great to wear.  But I clearly did not get a good value for my money.  I will not be buying an Invicta again.

B00005JCAA|5.0|Characters are totally engaging and you really invest emotionally in them which makes for a much more rich experience especially when some event occours around the main characters. The bonus version of \\"death takes a holiday\\" is also a nice compliment. Personally, I like the modern version better but that's just me. The older one is nice to watch after meet Joe black because you can compare them aand try to guess who brad Pitt would be in the old one ect.

0307960471|5.0|Jo Nesbo's THE PHANTOM features Det. Harry Hole returning from self-imposed deportation in Hong Kong to try and help out Oleg, the closest thing to a son he ever had. Oleg is Rakel's son, a woman he loved but left him after what the Snowman did to her and Oleg a couple of novels ago. Harry isn't a cop anymore, but still knows enough people to get the information, help, and cooperation he needs.<br /><br />Oleg isn't the kid Harry remembers. Oleg has gotten involved with the drug culture and has been selling a new highly addictive synthetic drug called violin with Gusto and his foster sister Irene. Gusto was murdered, and Oleg arrested. Harry is convinced Oleg is innocent, and does everything he can to free Oleg while protecting him from the Phantom, the man who has cornered the Swedish drug market.<br /><br />This has everything readers excpect out of a Nesbo novel: violence, depravity, complex plot, moral quandaries. The plot is really quite simple. It is about a drug culture, and those helping the Phantom and those trying to stop him, and those doing both. If anything, this novel delivers a powerful anti-drug message.<br /><br />I enjoyed Harry's rekindled relationship with Rakel. This is the one woman who cares for him. At the same time, Harry seems intent on self-destruction, never really believing happiness is possible. The story moved along quickly with much of the novel the story of Gusto, who provides the needed backstory for the drug trade, since he is dead as the book begins.<br /><br />Nesbo's novels are dark, violent and brooding. They are long and deliver a complex story with lots of interesting characters. I highly recommend it.

0393088774|5.0|Paul Krugman is a centrist Keynesian economist with Nobel Prize winning authority.  Although many on the right call him left-wing or liberal, the truth is he is more centrist.  I've read many books about economics and have a degree in Economics and Journalism and there is no doubt, Paul Krugman is practical and pragmatic providing solutions of how to work within the current system and does not change the debate or discussion.  Krugman provides a clear and easy-to-understand-for-the-layperson description of why we could be but aren't yet out of this \\"depression,\\" as most economists agree that this is more than a recession.

0316228532|5.0|I bought this book after reading several lukewarm reviews- mostly comparing this book to Rowlings previous works.  I decided to go into reading this as if I had never heard or, or read anything previously creating by the author. I loved this book!  The storyline is fantastic, and draws you in to all the families in the story.  You can't help but identify with the characters.  She shared with the reader a special talent in this book- showing depth for every character, and how you never really know someone or what has brought them to this place in life.  She took each character and gave you the good and bad that exists in all of us.  She also knows how to tell a story without giving away the plots too early.<br />Great job! I look forward to her next adult novel!!
0140143505|4.0|I've been familiar with this book and wanting to read it for quite some time.  But I was waiting for my novella challenge and, once it started, this was the first book I read.<br /><br />I knew it was a book of correspondence between a woman in New York and a bookseller in London.  For some reason I got it into my head that they ended up falling in love which isn't the case.  This book could definitely be viewed as a love story but it has more to do with a love of books than an actual romance.<br /><br />It is clear that Helene Hanff is very passionate about books.  She also has what I would consider to be quite unusual tastes, as she requests books that I'd never heard of, including poetry and works by British authors I've never even heard of.  I was really hoping I'd come away from the book with a long list of books I just had to go out and read, but alas she and I don't have similar tastes.<br /><br />But it did get me thinking about my own reading habits and how I rarely read anything that literary.  She had a seemingly encyclopedic knowledge of classic authors but she wasn't just being pretentious about it; she really did love their writing.  So even though I wasn't drawn to pick up anything by John Donne, I realized that it's important to read whatever you enjoy.<br /><br />Because the letters are written between 1949 and 1969, I was also impressed at how inexpensive the books were.  And it's amazing how the bookshop, Marks & Co., had such a knowledgeable staff who were able to acquire books so effectively in an era without the internet or Amazon.  I can't even imagine trying to find books or categorize them, learn about the order of a series, or discover works by another author if it weren't for book blogs and Goodreads.<br /><br />All in all this book of letters is itself a love letter to books and reading.  Helene's personality shines through in her letters and it's easy to see how such strong bonds can be forged between book lovers even if they haven't yet met in person.  Not to mention Helene herself seems like such a cool person and you'll wish you were friends with her as you read.<br /><br />I did find this book a little sad as Helene kept putting off her trip to England when things like purchasing a new flat or having dental work done got in the way.  But the book is realistic for showing that and a lot of people get caught up in their lives and think they have all the time in the world to accomplish their dreams.  Unfortunately it sometimes takes big life events or the death of someone to realize how short life is to provide the stimulus we need to take action.met in person.

B0011UJMK2|4.0|This is a riveting page turner set in Stalinist Soviet Union. The story follows Leo Demidov, an officer of the ruthless MGB, who becomes convinced that there is a serial killer targetting children. The problem is that in Soviet Russia crime does not exist, per the government, and when it does occur it is the direct result of an undesired element for whioh society must be purged. People are guilty once they are accused and there is no escape once an accusation has been levelled.<br /><br />It is under this back drop that the reader follows Leo from an enthusiastic agent of the government to a man hunted by the same government he has served.<br /><br />The story is cinematic. Author Smith does a fantastic job of painting the oppression throughout the book and building the suspense as Leo & his wife are thrust into a fight for their lives while they attempt to locate a monstrous killer of children.<br /><br />I highly recommend this thriller. I was entertained as well as transported to a society that is foriegn to me.
1451696191|3.0|I've been aware of this book for quite some time growing up as I'd heard it referenced before and a lot of people have said it's their favorite book.  All I knew about it was that it was the story of a boy growing up and all the trials of adolescence.  But for some reason I never got around to reading it and so it took on someone of an elusive air because so many people were talking about it but I could never get my hands on a copy.<br /><br />So it's been on my TBR for a while and with the movie adaptation just released it was the perfect time to read it.  This book has also been on some banned books lists and with this being Banned Books Weed, I thought I'd post my review now.<br /><br />Overall I found the book quite enjoyable to read and I think most people can identify with Charlie even if they haven't experienced all the things specific to his life.  The book also deals with some tough issues like suicide, rape, drugs, homosexuality, and child molestation but it never feels preachy or depressing.<br /><br />Charlie definitely isn't your typical teenager because he's very thoughtful, observant, and despite his crush on his friend Sam, he doesn't act like a hormone-fueled teenager and doesn't like objectifying women, instead choosing to respect them.  I know there are kids out there like that but at times I found him to be a little contrived, as if the author wanted him to be extra quirky and unique.  I also found it odd that he was writing letters to some random person instead of just keeping a diary.<br /><br />Still, there are some important lessons intertwined throughout, for example when Sam speaks about honesty and being true to yourself and the quote, \\"We accept the love we think we deserve.\\"  So this book was definitely worth reading and I might have got more out of it if I'd read it when I was younger and could identify more with Charlie.  Still, I'm glad I finally got to it and would definitely recommend it to others.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|The Wool series was extremely well written, with compelling characters that you immediately cared about.  Definitely a different take on a tale that has been told before, with some unexpected twists and turns.  I've already purchased more from this author and have high hopes because this was such a quality read.

B000GCFO0S|3.0|3 1/2 Stars = Very Good<br /><br />Ok, yes, \\"Silent Hill\\" the movie is nowhere as great as the video games, but you know what, they did a pretty damn good job of turning this supremely eeriest of video games, into a pretty good eerie film. No small part due to the fantastic CGI effects, atmospheric cinematography, & what may be the most unnerving soundtrack in horror movies, or I should say, video games, the original \\"Silent Hill\\" video game music.<br /><br />But for all this going for the films benefit, the direction was surprisingly weak, especially considering director Christophe Gans amazing effort, \\"Brotherhood of the Wolf!\\" Even so, a mediocre effort by this superior director is many directors \\"A\\" game, & the film does have it's surrealistic creepy, \\"Hellraiser\\" like charms. Other problems include a uninspiring execution of the plot, some weak acting, & an overwrought climax, to much of a good thing makes a mockery of the whole point of the film. Yet, it does get under the skin, & that is not a easy thing to do. Compared to the \\"Resident Evil\\" films, I'll take \\"Silent Hill\\" as my nightmare any night or day!<br /><br />For horror lovers of both cinematic & video game!

B007QPFGJW|2.0|As I seriously despise spoilers* and those who commit them, I will say little except that this is pretty much the nitty gritty that we've come to expect.  Harry is no longer a cop, and one wonders why he (or we) bother anymore. The plot is substandard, and plods along. There's a narrative in italics by an apparent murder victim, just to obfuscate matters even more. The ending has so many loose ends that we toss the book (hard to do with a kindle) and hopefully wait for Phantom, Part Two to be published.  Not up to the earlier HH novels.<br /><br />*Spoilers: tell us what it's about, but don't tell us what happens.

B002ZG99A4|5.0|Read the title, that's all you really need to know going in.  And the cast is full of recognizable faces, led by Sylvester Stallone, who has been making these movies for over 25 years.  No, it's not perfect, but the movie does not have to be.  If you grew up watching the Rambo movies, Commando, Die Hard, Red Scorpion, Universal Soldier, Terminator, Over the Top, Predator, Lock-Up, or any of the other awesome cheesy 80s/90s action movies, this movie is what you need.  New guys like Jason Statham, who has filled the role of the 80s action star in present times, is one of the stars, and he too does not disappoint.  The rest of the cast is limited to supporting roles (Jet Li, Mickey Rourke, Stone Cold Steve Ausin, Randy Couture, Terry Crews) or cameo roles (Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger), but they fit in perfectly too.<br /><br />The special features are fantastic too, as the documentary goes into the creation of this movie, and the hardships Stallone had while doing so.  He broke bones, and bled to get this done, and did so by not just acting in it, but also writing and directing.  Other features include the Comic-Con panel in its entirety and a host of trailers and post-production featurettes.<br /><br />I am also one of the few who thinks this movie is better than the sequel that just came out, so definitely give it a watch, you won't be disappointed if you go in knowing exactly what you are getting:  an 80s action movie made in 2010, by the guys who really know what they are doing.  Nostalgia never was this awesome.
B00846REIS|5.0|The story developed well, the characters were fun and endearing.  It's easy reading, but not so simple that it's not fun.  For a working soccer mom of two, room mom to two classes, and doting wife... it's a good read!

B000EXZI1O|5.0|I just started a college when this album came out.  \\"Tragedy\\" and \\"Too much heaven\\" was pretty much what one could hear on the radio and not much else. I only realized the full potential of this album when I finally bought it and spent some time listening to it. I am writing this review not only because the whole album was superbly made and executed, but also because I was simply blown away by the title tune \\"Spirits having flown\\".  Artistically I can't find any other piece of Bee Gees music that I could compare to it.  The music, the lyrics, the whole conception of the song is a pure masterpiece. Never before have I heard such an elaborate arrangement that actually served the purpose. Every note, every sound was in its perfect place following the mystique of four winds, empty skies and \\"...neither here nor far away from home...\\"  . The multilayered vocals, and an occasional analog buzz of an old Juno synth is just a small part of this picturesque tune that actually seeps colors through your speakers. Spirits having flown remains one of my personal favorites, through decades, never getting tired of it and I keep wondering what will it take to make a piece of music that will surpass it ...

B000SGGUWS|5.0|My best friend forced me to read his book. I was a bit reluctant to read the book at first but after the first few pages I became hooked. Alison is an intriguing character on her own and the fact that she was missing, dead, kidnapped or other adds to the many interesting factors in this book. I personally identified with Aria, the kooky friend. The book was totally relatable except for the most parts and for others we just have to tak Sara's word for it. Overall, good read, a tad predictable sometimes but the books wil have you constantly saying, &#34; Did she really think she could've kept that secret all to herself?&#34;
B004P8JPS6|5.0|It was as expected, a Jack Reacher series story.  Just what I wanted, a fun light read and entertaining.  If you are a Lee Child--Jack Reacher series fan, this book will not disappoint.<br /><br />For those that have not read any of the books and enjoy a masculine primary character--do so now!  I just started the series about a month ago and have not stopped reading them.  That is saying something since I read maybe 4-5 novels a year.  Reminds me a little of the John D. McDonald, Travis McGee series.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The Mark of Athena is EPiC. There is the perfect amount of adventure, and mystery. I loved how Rick put each chapter in another person't perspective! Anyway, another thing I LOVED was the romance. There were some conflicts, which kept me on the edge of the seat to see who ends up with who. The thing I don't like about this book is the end- another cliffhanger. I don't like cliffhangers cause I never know what happens after! I can't wait another year for the next book to come out...
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved this book!  It was such a great sequel and did not disappoint!! It was more relaxing to read than the first book as the characters were more in sync with each other.  I loved not being able to put the book down because questions were not answered until the end!  Thank you for your writing style and content!  Can't get enough of this story.

And with this thing blaring in your house for kids to hear, we wonder why they talk so filthy. Robert Forster could have been good, seemed to have phoned his performance in. This one didn't have any strong scenes, just kind of limped along to the end.<br /><br />On the plus side the scenery was nice.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is great and very fun to play. You can lose hours to this game alone. It starts out easy and friendly and becomes harder and more challenging as you go. Some levels feel almost impossible to pass with 3 starts but it is possible.<br />Its great to find the hidden eggs and get the extra levels.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|When I finished this book I  sat in my bed just amazed.  I didn't know what to think other than woah. This book made me feel like a completely different person once I finished it. I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone.
034580404X|5.0|I bought the Fifty shades of grey set at amazon.com and I loved them. They made you feel like you were in the book I couldn't stop tell I read all three books. The worse part is there is not a forth one.

B007THA4FI|2.0|This time JK introduced too many characters at one time. The book is hard for me to follow and I would rather go back and read 50 Shades of Grey all over again. She should stick to young adult fantasy books.
B0085TKAW6|4.0|The 2nd book in the Century of Giants Trilogy doesn't disappoint once you get into it. But I wish there had been a bit of an introduction to the major characters that we met in the first book in the series! A brief synopsis would have made reading Winter of the World even more enjoyable as it has been some time since I read the first volume in the series. Ken Follett gives a 'face' to all the people who endured WW2 and a better understanding of its impact on their lives.
B008LV8TSU|4.0|I bought the book because I didn't know that it was a book before it was a movie. But I like to read book that have been made into movies to see how close to the original they have keep the story and to better understand the characters.<br /><br />In the book the characters are slightly to drastically different to the movie.  The story takes on different paths also.  Where in the movie the main plot is finding out about Howl and how he became so powerful, the book deals more with Sophie's power and how she learns that she is a witch.<br /><br />I really liked the book and had a lot of fun reading it.  But on the Kindle version I felt that Amazon was trying to get me to buy other books by the author,  Diana Wynne Jones.  Over half of the Kindle file was first chapters of several of her other books. So when I finished reading Howl and still had 50% of the file left to read, I felt let down when I realized that the book had ended without me knowing that it was the end.<br />Don't misunderstand it was a good ending and I liked how it ended, but seeing that I was only halfway through the file made me think that there was more chapters to go and I would get to learn more about the character I came to like and care for and learn more about this amazing world they live in.<br /><br />Of the other books that they put first chapters in the file, they didn't but should have put the first chapters of the sequel's to Howl's walking castle, to make the reader want to carry on reading and learning more about this realm where Howl makes his home, but they didn't.<br /><br />Over all the Book was very good and fun to read, and when my children are older I will read it to them, and let them watch the movie.  But on the Kindle file the end of the book will come to fast leaving you think that there is a lot more to read and not realize that you have finished the book already.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|Like honestly the show starts out decent enough for anybody to be satisfied.  The farther you get though . . . the better it is.<br /><br />By the end i laughed so hard and not just every once in a while, i'm talking ever couple of minutes i had to try hard to stay off the floor.

030758836X|3.0|This book is brilliantly plotted with well developed characters but the ending was totally unsatisfying ending for me. It took me some time to understand it - she ended the book in a way that stays true to her characters and while I can appreciate that as a writer, as a reader I wanted something more. Characters should grow and change and learn over the course of the book and in the end, these people were no different than they were at the beginning. That was a disappointment.<br /><br />Not sure I'll read other books by this author.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|After reading this book and following the workout plan, I've got compliments about my size increase.  In the gym I've notice that my strength has increased.

I love the book and would recommend it to everyone.

0316228532|2.0|THE CASUAL VACANCY, Rowling's first novel for an adult audience, takes place in an English village called Pagford.  A member of the parish council, Barry Fairbrother, has died suddenly of a brain aneurism, leaving the casual vacancy - the British term for the need to fill a vacated seat on the parish council.<br /><br />Pagford seems like the perfect little English village, but it is far from it.  With politics being politics anywhere, readers see the people of the parish council quarreling among themselves, particularly over what people in the U.S. would call a housing project between Pagford and Yarvil, and the effectiveness of a drug rehabilitation center which the Pagford government controls.<br /><br />There's more:  Parents and teens disagree; this is natural, too, but for some families in the Pagford area there are serious consequences. Spouses have horrible quarrels among themselves, also with serious consequences.  There is indeed domestic abuse in this novel, as well as drug, alcohol, and tobacco use/abuse, teen and adult sexuality, and much foul language.<br /><br />The characters impress me as rather flat and stock.  There is the overweight parish councilor who feels that his son is an effeminate slacker.  There is the woman doctor with three children, one of whom is not as clever as the other two and is constantly put down for it, not just by her mother but by her schoolmates.  There is the bad girl from the wrong side of town with the big heart who is caring for her nursery-age brother because of her mother's drug habit.<br /><br />But the real mystery (at least, as far as the members of the Parish Council):  Who is posting the \\"Ghost of Barry Fairbrother\\" posts on the council website?  Is it one person, or several?  Why is this person/ these people doing this?<br /><br />So, in all honesty, Rowling has given us a Peyton Place in a British village. This book just didn't work for me, and I think - know! - that Rowling can do a lot better than this.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|I bought these a long time ago and my first pair lasted about a year until I broke them (no design flaw) just me getting mad at a game, lol. I got a replacement and they have worked just the same perfectly since.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Comfortable- even in long periods of time. I used to have logitech's that would hurt my ears after only a few minutes of wearing them because of pressure points. These do actually hurt sometimes, but not really too noticeable much of the time. If they do, its easy to notice why and adjust them to relieve the pressure.<br /><br />Versatile- I bought this specific pair due to its versatility to be used with both ps3 and xbox 360. The xbox requires the talk back cable to plug into the headphones control and the xbox 360 controller, but it's no big deal. I've also used them for watching TV and on my computer. Very good in all cases.<br /><br />Good sound quality- obviously you don't expect exceptional sound because they are just typical stereo headphones and not surround sound, but they do produce a nice crisp sound.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Cord length/design- Nothing has happened yet, but in part to me being paranoid and extra cautious with them, the cord length is a little too long and inconvienient a lot of the time even though there is a thing you can wrap it up with attached to it. The real thing I'm worried about it the cord that comes from the control to the actual headphones because it is so small and flimsy. If it gets smashed or cut at all, I bet these would stop working immediately.<br /><br />Mic- while it does have the nice adjustable bendy straw type design, it doesn't seem to perform well no matter how close or far away it is to my mouth or how loud or soft i talk. My friends and others can never seem to understand or hear me unless in perfect conditions (not in game and no one else talking) I set it to be as loud as possible yet, they still can't hear me a lot of the time.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say these are great headphones, I'd recommend them to anyone, unless you are really only planning on using them for the mic. Although, it might just be me and not the mic because i know a lot  of people that use these and i hear them just fine even with gunfire in game. Also, don't plan on moving them around. I thought that before I got them, but with the huge cord length and the setup, it's definitely better to just keep them in a stationary position at one TV or computer spot.
0374214913|3.0|Mr. Penumbra is one of those books that start a story with a quite good concept. The central narrative is crafted well. The scenes are described concretely and with attractive texture. I think the characters, however, came and went without much, if any, depth.<br /><br />But I am willing to be charitable on character. This is a fantasy tale, in the best sense of the word -- and fantasies can be skimpy on characterization. Its narrative leads to some ultimate statements that may or may not correspond to reality: this is expected, of course, in the fantasy genre.<br /><br />Here is the intriguing point. That very possibility -- that the final revelation of the novel's central gnosis is less than metaphysical -- is itself the most fantastical notion of the book.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this most fantastical conclusion is articulated in a way that does not do justice to the richness of everything the writer has invested in the tale -- even his less-than-solid characterizations.<br /><br />I enjoyed Mr. Penumbra. However, it joins an ever-lengthening shelf of recent books that promise a lot at the outset, and even succeed at establishing an attractive world, but do not advance a conclusion that is worthy of the beginning.
B007TBZ63Y|3.0|I don't know if I was just anticipating too much from this novel but it felt like a bit of a let down. The story line continues effectively and characters like Annabeth and Leo develop very well, but some of the things you are just oh so hoping to happen don't happen that way. I love the author and I am so happy to read this far into the story, but it just seems as if this novel was lacking his usual prowess of adventure. POSSIBLE SPOILER: I am not a fan of the cut off and abrupt ending.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Definitly worth the wait. Loved the first, felt complete after the second. Good, easy read And very fun!  The love story between Gideon ad Eva evolves and I like a lot.
0345803485|5.0|I have never read such a descriptive sexual book before in my life.<br />I did not know what to expect from this, other that everyone said<br />it was very different from anything they had read. OMG were they<br />ever right!  Girls hope you have a boyfriend/husband or vibrator..<br />ha ha you will need one. Am waiting for #2 then on to # 3. I guess<br />I heard that this was a woman who wrote this book, just wondering<br />what her sex life is like! Good reading out there.<br /><br />PS I only have one problem with the postage they charged me $22.00 +<br />and it took 6 days or so to get here. Thats not a good thing. This was<br />thru Amazon. I could have gotten all 3 books for that price.

My Dad landed Normandy Dday+2; I respect and appreciate our military and especially the elite special forces. This book provides a view that only someone on the inside could communicate.

B003WUYP56|3.0|This is a facinating book. I am an engineer, not a physicist. Therefore, I am not fluent in the language. I look up words. I found that Smolin is a controversal person probably with both or several groups of other phusicist. He refers to other physicists as friends, but when I searched for information about him I found that he like other physicists often disagree, which should not be surprising in research and theory exploration.<br /><br />I have not finished the book for several reasons, but I am reading only this book plus daily the newspaper. I'll give another review when I have completed it.
B005ER6STG|5.0|The first thing you will immediately notice about A Serbian Film is the quality of the production and acting. For a film of this nature, one would generally expect a B-movie atmosphere. This is simply not the case, and is perhaps the one major reason this film has intrigued me so much. The character development in the early portion of the film was also surprisingly well done, and was very convincing to boot. It has been a long while since I've seen a good horror film that allowed me to feel something for the characters on screen. The family is relatively normal, albeit Milos' taboo job of being a porn star.<br /><br />As far as porn is concerned, we see very little gratuity in this area. Certainly there is nudity, but it is mostly done in a tasteful fashion. It is a paradox of some sort. To see this piece of cinema that undoubtedly falls under the moniker of \\"torture porn,\\" yet so much is held back. Indeed, the gore and the themes presented are taboo and will not appeal to everyone. The film is genuinely intense. However, I did not feel that the gore or the nudity itself was the reason why this film was intense. While there are a few scenes that will stick in mind for a long time, the overall somber atmosphere and psychological torture you (as the viewer) will undergo is what I found most gripping.<br /><br />When it comes to adult themes, this film holds nothing back. We see rape, child rape, genital torture, and similar things. Still, so little is shown. But, what will stick with you is what is said. The final words in the film change the dynamic of the movie, make it far more disturbing, and ultimately cause this film to be one of my favorites in the horror/thriller genre.<br /><br />So, in conclusion, if you can stomach a good amount of gore, don't mind gratuitous nudity, and are interested in seeing a movie explore such adult themes, you will enjoy this for sure.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a great series that draws you in. You have the aristocratic family's issues, the help's issues, and it gets good when both worlds intermingle.

B008O9V4C2|4.0|It all starts with a signature groove so nasty it could be a Bond villain and before you can shout \\"Goldfinger\\" we are deep into the new Donald Fagen LP \\"Sunken Condo's\\". With the \\"Nightfly Trilogy\\" now safely tucked away the erstwhile Steely Dan frontman is free to cast away the concept shackles and provide a straightforward set of expertly delivered jazzy rock tinged with soul. Whether he and Walter Becker will ever follow up the decade old \\"Everything must go\\" is a moot point but frankly as long as both artists produce wonderful solo material from time to time we should pay homage to the mighty forces. There have been some reviews claiming that \\"SC\\" ranks alongside \\"The Nightfly\\" as Fagen's best solo effort to date. This suggestion deserves outright scepticism since his first solo album recorded nearly 30 years ago remains peerless and his latest doesn't match it. What \\"Sunken Condo's\\" does represent is further evidence of that unswerving and alarming quality control that Fagen has achieved on all his albums ensuring that nearly all of them remain head and shoulders above most artists. It's all about cool detachment, a sprinkling of cynicism and songs like onions that you peel away and discover different layers. By doing so they reveal something slightly quirky and original. The delight of an unnoticed backbeat, deep bass run or a jazzy guitar phrase so that every listen sucks you in to Fagen's sheer level of musical craft.<br /><br />The albums opener is the louche jazz of \\"Slinky thing\\". It has everything you would expect from Fagen present and correct. The band is tighter than a gnat's chuff, lyrically we have females standing next to a \\"Reptile cage\\" and great understated guitar solos from Jon Herington. Next up \\"Not the same without you\\" is so pure Steely Dan it could have been on \\"Gaucho\\" where ironically forty years after \\"Can't buy a thrill\\" Fagen tells us \\"that I'm evolving now/at a really astounding rate of speed\\". Who are we to argue? Third track \\"Memorabilia\\" is one of those upon first listens seems rather repetitive but stick with it since it turns out to be a lovely song. \\"Weather in my head\\" is one of the toughest urban blues songs Fagen has penned and references Al Gore with great horns from co-producer Michael Leonheart, while \\"New Breed\\" has one of those slight reggae vibes which are a specialty of our hero and echoes \\"Gaslighting Abbie\\". One bump in the road is the cover of Issac Hayes funk anthem \\"Out of the Ghetto\\" which would no doubt make a great encore in a live show but doesn't really fit here. Do not fret too much however since Fagen follows this with his best song in many a long year and the albums highlight. \\"Miss Marlene\\". This is a brilliant and effortless collection of jazzy grooves so infectious they could cause a pandemic and his acerbic nasal croon is as good as ever. A fine Fagen lyric underpins it and the band is cut loose resulting in some of the greatest \\"Dan style\\" instrumentation since \\"Aja\\". Download it immediately and think kindly of your reviewer. More cool nasty funk follows on the truly excellent \\"Good stuff\\" a song which deals with the shipping of an illegal special brew which requires that \\"Tonight we jack the convoy/ Two hundred barrel run /Trucked in from Agooey/In East Patterson\\". Closer \\"Planet D'rhonda\\" has a superb solo at its heart from jazz guitar giant Kurt Rosenwinke (thank you Erik) but at this stage it sounds like one of the weaker songs on the album.<br /><br />So there it is. The master returns with yet another dose of what Adam Sweeting has described with pinpoint precision as \\"a set of impeccably tailored grooves which wear their expertise with insolent nonchalance\\". \\"Sunken Condo's\\" also confirms that there are a generation of musicians like Donald Fagen who qualify for retirement but who refuse to lie down and indeed seem to be thriving into the third age. This album is quiet treat and you really would be very foolish not to let it soundtrack your daily existence for a short while.nce for a short while.

I'm happy to find that it worked very well.<br /><br />There are definitely some funny parts, but don't read this expecting a dark comedy. It has social commentary, but it's entertaining. Half way through the book, I couldn't put it down. It's been a long time since I've read anything this good.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|Got some good ideas for updating my ebook [[ASIN:B008A12SVK The Landlord Way!]] One key thing is to create a memorable scene in your book; something the reader will remember about your story or book. His book is well written and makes a lot of sense.
0062073486|5.0|I cannot say that I am Agatha Christie's number one fan in the world simply because I am not the number one fan of the mystery genre.  But I must tell you that when I do read a mystery I like the sort of story that features deductive reasoning in solving the mystery rather than the plethora of such novels involving scientific police procedures.  I think the term that suits me best as far as such things go is \\"reactionary,\\" at worse and \\"old fashion\\" at best.  I am a big Arthur Conan Doyle fan for that very reason so even though \\"mysteries\\" per se are not at the top of my list, I do enjoy reading them from time to time.  Over the years I have read a number of Christie's book and have yet to be disappointed in any of them.  This, my third reading of \\"And Then There Were None.\\" is no exception<br /><br />I will say that this work is a bit different than Christie's other work in that there is no detective to \\"solve the case.\\"  The reader is put on the spot to supply their own deductive reasoning to work out \\"who done it.\\"  I rather like this approach for a change.<br /><br />Ten people are invited to an isolated house located on Indian Island.  No one else is in the house or on the island.  One by one the guests, after each has been rather uniquely accused of murder.  And then one by one the guests begin dying...murdered.  One of the guests is the murderer!<br /><br />The author has done a very nice job, in my opinion, of putting this plot together.  While she possibly could have done better is the area of character development, this work, when you consider its length, is really not set up for that.  The overriding theme is murder and who did it.  I personally was unable to figure out who the killer was, but then I am not the brightest star in the sky and am most certainly not an expert on murder mysteries.  Perhaps others will do better.<br /><br />This is an interesting book for a couple of other reasons.  Since it was first published in England in 80 some odd years ago it has gone through at least three title changes and has, via various editions been bowdlerized - to the extreme.  This all has been done out of political correctness and belated racial sensitivities.  While Christie was most certainly a brilliant writer, she was also most certainly a product of her times when it came to racial issues and it shows. The original English edition never made it to this country, as far as I know, and if the original title was kept there is no way on earth that it would be published in this day and age.<br /><br />This is one of Christie's better known novels and there have been a number of plays and movies made from it.  Some folks love this novel; others are not so fond of it.  It is one of my personal favorites of her work but then I have not read every one of her books so I cannot really say it is the best or worse.  I do know I liked it and will quite likely read it again on down the road.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarksgo it has gone through at least three title changes and has, via various editions been bowdlerized - to the extreme.

0307279189|5.0|Without repeating all the great comments, I did take away from this book that we as people have an evolutionary disposition for community.  And even something as seemingly singular as running is actually a community experience.  This book was not just a mechanical book on running; although I recite the mantra of proper running to myself now.  This book was not just about loco's doing loco things; although I found that inspiring.  This book was just not a scientific explanation for minimal shoes; although I run and happier now because I am closer to the ground with my minimal shoes.  This book was all the preceding and then for me the big shoe to drop was all of these things are best enjoyed together.  Super book and I took a lot from reading it.

0316228532|3.0|I was very excited waiting for JK Rowling's first adult book to be released---even pre-ordered it. The disappointment came from the fact that she is still writing about children, or should I say, adolescents in this case.  She did a wonderful job with character descriptions(and there were many), however, I was hoping that the plot would be over-the-top excitement. Next time I'll think twice about getting another one of her \\"adult-themed\\" books, if there is one.

B007VT6QSI|5.0|I was so excited to receive this CD when it came in the mail! I listen to it when I'm in my car, before I go to bed, and anytime I am feeling like listening to him during the day. He is an amazing artist who is changing the music industry. I love JB no matter what!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I'd been looking forward to this book since the second one came out and I loved it! One of Riordan's best yet!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|the game is fun waste of time.some of the levels are hard to figure out how to get the pieces. its worth a free download would never pay for it
B008673ZAQ|4.0|The continuation of the Crossfire Series Reflected in You was not as similar to Fifty Shades as Bared to You was.<br />However I will say that it was thoroughly enjoyable. The chemistry between Gideon and Eva was unmistakable. Having said that I anticipated a totally different ending.<br /><br />I am looking forward to reading other books from this author.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really liked this book! It reminded me of 50 Shades, but for some reason I liked this one even better, can't wait for book number 3!!
B0087HT36U|5.0|very additing game...very hard at times, but well worth it, and no i did not get bribed to write this.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I enjoyed the other book so much more as it was about times that are not written about as much. This one was well written as usual, subject matter not as complex.
0307948110|5.0|This book grabbed me in the first few lines and kept me knotted in suspense until the very end. It takes place over a little more than 24 hours, and it's hard to believe how much action can be wrung out of a thriller involving nerds and numbers and money, lots of money! I hated for it to end.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was an awesome second part to this series. It picked up right where part one left off in a smooth manner. I would highly recommend this engaging series.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|it said u can choose side....but I can't and the zombie bosses are way too hard. EVERTHING ELSE IS AMAZING!!!! BEST GAME FOR FREE
B0083EM24C|2.0|I love manners. This doesn't come close to the magic that that album holds. A lot of these reviews are just fans blinded by faith. The album seems forced, whereas Manners was flowing and flawless.
B000NH7SZ0|5.0|This memory module works well with the Brother HL-6180DW printer so far- so look no more! Great product, good price. I did not do a hi-tech evaluation, but it fits and seems to work well and shows up when I print the summary of the printer's status. This one module takes the printer up to 384MB which is its maximum.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|I was waiting impaciently to buy this, and i dont regret the buying. In fact i will buy another copy when i can, to save it intacts as the treasure it is. the compilation of the CDs and the DVD, the cute and elegant case, the poster, everything suits perfect. Amazing gift for any MJ fan and any BAD era fan.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Very fun match 3 game with some extra puzzle elements thrown in. Forgiving because there is no penalty for losing a stage.
B0084I9QIW|5.0|I dont think there is any need to rate this item, MJ's fans know how valuable this is. Even the image quality is not the best, the sound is amazing and you can see Michael and his magic on stage, in this epic concert at Wembley. The songs you are not used to see in Bad Tour are here, and its truly an amazing buying.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|the game is fun but very addictive...enjoy 5 stars just because I cant stop playing this game...looking for the whole collection
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Received the movie in great time! Everything was in great condition! We'd already seen the movie in theatres and wanted a copy for home. This seemed to be the most cost friendly option
B0087HT36U|4.0|Very fun game, looks great. plays easily.  gets progressively more difficult yet quick to pick up. lots of levels. Please make more!
B000FCKGPC|1.0|Having read and enjoyed the first three books, I was anticipating greatly the next installment.  But instead of picking up where book three leaves off, we are introduced to new story lines and characters, while other story threads are left hanging or have been dropped completely (I guess we'll have to read the next book to find out where he's going with this.)  The stories of Tyrion, Bran, Rickon, and Dany aren't mentioned at all in this book.  Jon Snow appears briefly, only to tell Samwell to go to Oldtown with Maester Aemon and Gilly.  Tyrion was the most interesting character in the first three books, and to have him simply disappear is a major disappointment.<br /><br />He's got so many story lines going here, I seriously don't think he can keep track of all of them and some just seem to peter out without any resolution or explanation.  I hope I'm wrong and we see resolution in the next book(s), however many more there might be.  I, for one, do not intend to make this my life's work reading this series.  Get it together George.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Haven't seen the HBO series yet, but after reading the first book I'm actually looking forward to it. Bought book two already.
B007QPFGJW|4.0|Please please tell me this is not the last Harry Hole story! I would have given it 5 stars but felt the ending was a little too open-ended. That may be wishful thinking on my part.
B005LAIHR2|4.0|Is this a great movie? No. The tone is uneven - they should have gone more campy, but shied away from that and so the film ended up feeling uncertain of itself. The young leads - Julianne Hough and Diego Boneta - are weak, and there's not much of a plot. BUT if you like the 80s music of Foreigner, Journey, Pat Benatar, etc., and like the big names in this cast - Alex Baldwin, Russell Brand, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Paul Giamotti - it is well worth it. And Tom Cruise is simply fantastic! I am not usually a Cruise fan, but personally I do like him in comic spoof roles (this role and his Tropic Thunder role are my favorites.) He's riveting here, and I loved it. It's a lot of fun - if you're a product of the 80s, you'll probably find yourself singing along - and there's plenty of laughs too. If you don't like this music, or Tom Cruise ever, than this movie is probably not for you, as that's pretty much what it's got going for it. But otherwise, give it a shot, and don't expect Oscar material, just a fun romp.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|fun and addictive. sucks to wait for the coins to build up. I don't know who buys the coins waste of money. but otherwise u gain coins with time.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|My family and I thoroughly enjoyed this (2 adults, an 8-year old, and 2 six-year olds) - it was our favorite of recent kid's movies. Adam Sandler stars as the voice of Count Dracula, widowed father to a daughter, Mavis, voiced by Selana Gomez. To protect her from humans - who he blames for his wife's death - he builds a hotel for monsters, where no humans are allowed. Frankenstein, Big Foot, mummies, werewolves, the Invisible Man and many more are all regular visitors and converge for Mavis's 118th birthday - clearly the equivalent of a human's 18th. Mavis is bored and would prefer to explore the human world - something her father does not want her doing. Things are thrown into chaos when a young hip human backpacker somehow wanders in, and he and Mavis fall for each other.<br /><br />This movie is thoroughly entertaining, with many funny moments for kids and adults. The monsters are more comedic than scary, and most of the humor is warm-hearted, not mean-spirited like so many films are (even family films.) The plot ultimately revolves around the father daughter relationship between the Count and Mavis, and his having to accept her growing up, and in that sense it's downright sweet. A nice break from superhero battles. And this movie appeals to both genders - my daughters and son both enjoyed it equally. So I highly recommend it!
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|The player worked well. The movie did not disappoint, a fun and care free movie. the underlying themes of disobedience to over controlling parents didn't bother me as much as I thought it might. The songs were catchy and the kids enjoyed it.
6300213668|4.0|Anyone who Travolta will love this movie. Combine it with Olivia Newton John and GREAT music. What's not to like.
0525953728|4.0|No Easy Day is a quick read. It provides a lot of insight into some of the amazing acts and sacrifice our nation's soldiers do for us. I'll definitely recommend to my friends!
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Gift for my girl, she got so caught up that it only took the weekend to watch the whole season. Got to love Sam & Dean!

B0027MJU00|5.0|Gillian Flynn does an exception job writing characters that interest you.  Each character she has crafted in Dark Places is intriguing, terrifying, and thoughtful.  Well worth the read.
B00979OL5A|5.0|This type of game is somewhat new for me to be playing but I am enjoying learning it. Having fun.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the games are fine but on kindle fire are hard to play but still recamended I also regimens 100 floors if u like puzzles
B0084IG8TM|1.0|I ordered this DVD as it was advertised as a two disc DVD, it was not. I received a e-mail after the fact that the product was not as described. The product had already been sent before I could respond to the e-mail not to send it.  Unfortunately, the DVD was sent and it was some theatrical version something that no one would want. This product was falsely advertised and I will be sending this product back. Truly dissatisfied.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love this book!! It was brilliant and Rick Riordan has struck gold once again. Book like this is the reason why I love reading.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This book has more substance than fifty shades. A story line that keeps you intrigued and eagerly anticipating what's to come
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Can not put this book down. Love it, can't wait to start the next book! This was a great deal and would never shop anywhere else but Amazon!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I'm sure I will be rereading this book again in a couple of weeks to catch all the meaning that I know I've missed. This is also a great reminder that kids do know a lot more than we think they do and our outright dismissal of many of their thoughts leaves us missing a lot of life.
B00270WH3Y|5.0|Downloading music is a great way to avoid snail mail waiting times, paying for faster postal service, or - even worse - having to go to a shop. This CD doesn't need a review, it speaks for itself ...
B0094BB4TW|1.0|this app worked a lot better before I installed the latest update! now everytime I try to update my status it tells me &quot;cannot post at this time&quot;. you also can't share posts or anything. photos don't load unless you are looking at comments. seriously, Facebook through the browser is much easier.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Definitely NOT Terrible. As a shark, I eat a lot of paper products by accident in the ocean. I came across this book floating on the surface one day and decided to have a bite. Decent.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I was part of Pinterest from the very start, and I am so pleased to have an app for it on my phone now! it works decently well. definitely worth downloading.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|After reading the 50 Shades collection I was searching for something to fill the void for Christian Grey.  Gideon Cross definitely did the trick.  I can't wait for the final book.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|awesome game. vivid colors. much better than bejeweled or similar games. the story line is great and with the option to bypass.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|The app was good but it would be cool if they had other things on there that were added to the app to make it cooler but other than that its good
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|It was a little slow to start for me, but when it got good, it got really good! l loved all the different creatures.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Always have been a Follet fan and this book is a good, but not excellent example of Ken's work. The plot jumped around a bit more than I would have liked as he tried to bring the various threads together which at times made it unclear who was doing what to whom - but still readable. Only real criticism is he has taken some liberty with the facts and from what I can tell, accelerated the use of crematoria as a means of disposing of concentration camp victims prior to the dates when this was actually done. Not critical, but there was no need to have it that way.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|I recommend this movie to anyone who loves classics. One of the best interpretation of the timeless fairytale.Love the digital, blue ray dvd.
B002BX4VEK|5.0|I thought I had all of Elvis's songs between DVD's and albums. This album has some great songs that are new to me.<br />I definitely recommend this to all Elvis fans.
0446573027|3.0|Good thriller<br />Stock characters --<br />The policewoman is always a beat behind the hero --<br />I know she's not as trained & adept but comon -- once.<br />Minimal strong language and that reads false.<br /><br />But well written and I finished it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|ADDICTIVE, LOVE IT.  BUT I WOULD LOVE A HINT BUTTON! lol.  great graphics, bright colors, no problems with program.  Enjoy!
B003UESJH4|5.0|Colin Firth is Prince Albert, who suffers from a speech stammer that has kept him and his family largely away from the public spotlight. But when his reckless brother steps down from the throne, he finds himself in a position he never thought he'd be; leader of an empire. But with trouble brewing overseas and his new position demanding that he makes speeches to the public, he turns to Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), an Australian speech therapist, for help and the two form an unlikely friendship.<br /><br />If you haven't already figured out from the 5-stars and the heading, I absolutely loved `The King's Speech', it's beautifully shot, the production is gorgeous and is anchored by stellar performances from some of UK's, and Australia's, top actors.<br /><br />Colin Firth is at his best here as the suffering Prince Albert, conveying layers of emotion both in voice and body language and getting us emotionally connected with Albert and we're really rooting for him to overcome his stammer by the end. Geoffrey Rush is equally as good as Lionel Logue; confident, straight forward and unwilling to kowtow to Albert's status and when the two share a scene together, it's electrifying to watch as their friendship develops throughout the film.<br /><br />Helena Bonham Carter, away from the weird-wacky Tim Burton roles also shines as Albert's supportive wife, Elizabeth, as does Guy Pearce, playing a brash Edward VIII.<br /><br />It's not just the strong acting, although it's really what drives the film; it's the production design, the sets, the costumes really do a great job at bringing this world back to life. They also made sure to flesh out the world by surrounding it in history, with the threat of World War II always looming in the background, and to represent the attitudes of the people at the time, especially the way the English looked down on Australians. Everything here pulls together to make this a compelling and elegant film, if you like period movies or shows like `Downton Abbey', then this is worth the watch, if not the purchase, and is deserving of the four academy awards under it's belt.<br /><br />There's a sleuth of Special Features on the disc; a commentary track, an okay behind the scenes featurette and `BBC America Special' with Q&A with the director and cast. The more interesting features are `The Personal Diaries', an interview clip with Lionel Logue's grandson about his grandfather and how he came to access materials that helped him write a book about Lionel and King George VI Archive, featuring real speech clips of Prince Albert.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The book lives up to all the expectations.  Has been read by both generations in our house and we always enjoy Riordan's books.
B008MJC6ZS|3.0|Love Testament.  This album doesn't seem quite as good as the last one but it's still pretty killer.  Amazing guitar work and some very interesting and different, yet still heavy, songs.  Need to give it a few more listens as it might grow on me more but I still like it quite a bit.
034580404X|5.0|Great story.  Keeps you interested page after page.  I started reading it on a Friday and couldn't put it down the entire weekend.  Haven't enjoyed a book this much since the Twilight series. The characters are intersting and the little side stories keep you wondering. I just started the second book and I am glad I purchased the trilogy.  I would have hated to wait to begin the second book.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I Love Mahjong and can play for hours! It is my all time favorite game.I will be buyibg the different versions from them.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|As the title of the review suggests, this app is a lot of fun. Addictive and entertaining, I recommend getting this fun app.
B007ZGO7EM|2.0|Although it functions fine I take issue with this app because it is 9MB in size, not to mention the unnecessary network permissions. The Graphing Calculator in the store is only 219.7kb and includes simple and scientific calculators. This one is 40 times the size and doesn't even have a square root function. Why? Uninstalled because I don't need 8.5MB unnacounted for with network access.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|this app keeps foreclosing please fix on my kindle fire.<br />I had uninstall and install again now I can't get on
0316228532|5.0|I don't understand the negative reviews that I read.  Yes, in the first part of the book there are a lot of characters to read about and digest but if the information wasn't there the rest of the book would not make sense.  Once I was past the first part, I absolutely devoured this book.  The story was in some ways dark but so is life.  I got \\"involved\\" in the plot to the point that I felt I was in the middle of the story myself.  It grabbed me in a way that few books have recently.  It wasn't a happily after after kind of story but that's part of what made it real and personal.  Real life doesn't have many \\"happily ever afters\\" either.  I hope Ms. Rowling writes another book for adults - I will be first in line.  Three cheers and five stars for THE CASUAL VACANCY!!
B001EBWINQ|5.0|Great to have this classic stored in the cloud ready to access at any time.  Amazon makes it easy and with high quality.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This set is jam packed full of cool features and little add-ons. Probably the best quality blu-ray I've ever watched.<br />Also, it gives you the option to skip all the previews. Nice touch Marvel!
B007IXWKUK|1.0|The first volume was incredibly badly written & edited (doesn't anybody know what the word 'bemused' means ), but compensated by  being sexy as hell.  The second book is almost entirely conventional.  Bummer:  good soft porn is so hard to find these days!
B008XG1X18|3.0|love this site and so excited to get it on my kindle fire but half of the time I cannot open the app. a error message pops up saying pinterest is not responding. so frustrating!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|No Easy Day appears to tell it like it is (was).  These are different accounts of what actually happened. It is not  what was reported in the news.  So, I tend to believe the book versus the spin we get from the newscasters or our elected officials.  Seal Team 6 or whatever it is now being called are truly America's best trained fighting force.<br /><br />It is sad this book had to be written because of the publicity that Seal Team 6 received starting with the President.  Their missions are Top Secret and should stay that way if we want them to continue being the ultimate force for their mission types.<br /><br />A very good read and really hard to put down once started.
0316223239|3.0|I felt the story was not consistent in many ways but it was a good read and the characters were interesting. I would tell people to read it.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book was great. If you liked \\"Fifty Shades,\\" you will love this book as well. I actually liked it just as much if not more. It isn't as much of a porn book. It was still a quick read and I am already about done with Book #2 in the series!!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The sequel did not disappoint.  Hot as ever, sexy as ever, and definitely what I was craving for the two of them.  Cannot wait to see what the third has in store!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was amazing. I loved it just as much as the others. I hope that she will write more books!!!!
B005FISBV2|5.0|Nothing has topped Season 4, but this season was pretty great. I enjoyed it and had a hard time not watching it in a marathon format. Definitely recommended.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great book. It was well written and fast paced. I felt like I had to immediately read book 2 and 3 to feel like I had accomplished something. Even my husband (who does not normally read) loved this book. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is wants a quick but \\"heavy\\" read.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Okay, it was well-written, I'll give the author that - but that's all - almost. I have to say it was riveting and I stayed with it to the end.  But mostly I stayed with it to the end hoping I would find some redeeming qualities in the 2 central characters, which I did not!!! What a pair of lying, sociopathic losers they were. They deserved each other and I think their baby will be \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" and she will kill her parents when she is 11 and I say 11 because she is a smart, scheming little creature who knows she won't be tried as an adult and she knows she can handle juvenile detention.  Hey, that might make a great sequel to Gone Girl!!!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Jetpack Joyride has great orginial concept and gameplay. It has humor, action, and strategy all rolled into one. This game will always be one of my favorites.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|I enjoyed the book but it's no 5 star read. It is rather obvious where the book is headed long before you get to the end. I get the impression that some of the characters and background were inspired from 1970s-80s TV series.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This was by far the best episode. I can't wait for more to come!! Leaves you wanting more.  This season is going to be amazing.
B00005N6KG|5.0|The sound quality is very good as is the efficiency. The volume does not need to be turned up as highs as with other headsets. They are also more rugged and the wiring does not pull out as soon as other headsets. I found that these last much longer than any others I have used in spite of the inevitable challenges (cable gets caught on a drawer handle, or on chair etc.)<br /><br />They are very light and very inexpensive. What more could you want than cheaper, longer lasting, with better sound quality?<br />I use these with a Sansa Clip + and they work beautifully together.<br /><br />When I don't want to use headphones with the Sansa Clip +, I hook it up to portable GoGroove Sonawave amplified Speaker Box. This unit has rechargeable batteries, two speaker on each side and produce room filling, undistorted sound. Highly recommended.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I love this game! It took a little time, but now I can't stop playing it. If it had a little more instructionini in the begining it would have made it easy to learn what to do.
B0063IH60K|5.0|love this solitaire game. like that you can shuffle different hands. there is the ability to play hard games or easy hands. truly a good app for kindle fire.
B005D9MUWY|2.0|This is without a doubt a  5 star app, but as of late, has force close issues which keep it from fully installing. This is a known issue, and is only existent when downloaded through  the Amazon appstore.<br />Swiftkey is a great alternative for the stock Android keyboard, and faster than Swype! The word predictions are spot on. If you use this keyboard for a week, you'll notice that you'll barely have to type anymore!<br />I guess I've become predictable. My girlfriend won't be happy about that :-/<br /><br />*NOTE: This review was written using Swype. Let's hope for a fix for Swiftkey soon!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|We were told by friends how much they loved this series.  We watched Season One and we were hooked!<br />Ordered Season Two and were just as excited about this one.  As the individual stories unfold, you can't wait to see what happens next!  Season Three will be coming soon and we plan to watch every bit of it!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I play this on Facebook and absolutely love it. there is just so much to do that mystery manor will keep you busy for hours
0399157565|5.0|For those who may have questioned the direction that Cornwell - and Scarpetta - were taking in the past few novels, there is no question in Bone Bed. Scarpetta is back, and better than ever. This novel has all the most familiar characters doing what they do best. Kay, using her brilliant mind and skills, Bennett, being ever vigilant and elusive, Lucy, strong, tactical and secretive, and Marino, still naïve despite his abilities, and still carrying the chip on his shoulder. I highly recommend Ms. Cornwell's Bone Bed.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a great little game!!!  My kids and I have a ton of fun playing it.  Even the youngest can play.....

B004FGMDOQ|3.0|So I read this book a few weeks ago and may I say this was kind of boring. So the book starts out just like a normal book, it had detail and imagry, it was ok acctually. A littl into the book it had a little action and was a page turner, but when the main character got to the island and a little before that part the book had a steep drop. After his grandfather dies the rest of the book is really boring until mabe the last five chapters!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I thought that this was a really really really really really really really really really really really really good game

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Book Three was great, very suspenseful and left me wanting more.  Out of the three books, Book Two was my favorite, but the triology was extremely entertaining; I hated for it to end.  Waiting for the movie, E.L., holla at your girl - I've discovered the perfect sound track for it!
0385738765|5.0|Great book #2 in the triology!  I love where he took Thomas, love the new cartures introduced in the trials.  Page turner.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I've spent the last ten years developing my writing style and attempting to get published.  When I read an author as gifted as Mitch Albom, I understand the difference between a good writer and one who was born with the gift.  I'll keep trying b/c I love the challenge and the feeling when a story comes together, but I'll always be in awe of the true masters.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|I'm not a morning person! So you can imagine the not so nice things I mumble when the alarm clock goes off. Not with this alarm! I love how it begins softly (with pleasant tones of my choice). And then crescendos louder and louder, yet gently, with the same pleasant tone. You won't be disappointed!
B003UYUP6M|5.0|This is a fascinating book, and I say that as a Professor of Comparative Literature, not as a techie.  It is extremely interesting to see all of the mathematical and conceptual problems that had to be solved in order to create the search engine that Google is today.  It gave me a whole new respect for the end product.  It is equally fascinating to see the founders and their idiosyncracies, and their insistence on bringing ethics to commerce.  One example is how they sell ads:  The top spot does not necessarily go to the highest bidder but rather to the most relevant ad;  it is possible for an ad paying 10 cents a word to \\"win\\" over an ad paying 50 cents if the former's content is more appropriate to the topic in question.  The user is always right as a corporate model is intriguing.  The book is also amusing, with Sergey Brin dashing in and out on his roller blades, and various other quirks that make Google fun for the reader as well as for the people working there.  Finally, it is rewarding to see two smart guys who had set out to get their PhDs, not to make money, succeed; it is also exciting to see a dedication to excellence, real quality control in hiring the best people available, and in their demands on their own product.  A fast-paced, interesting, and appealing book, even for someone who was not initially drawn to the subject matter.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I have become addictive to this game. I like the added challenges so not just matching 3 colors. Story line is fun too.
B008G12ERC|4.0|A couple weeks ago, the British rock band Muse released their sixth studio album - this by the title of \\"The 2nd Law,\\" as in the second law of thermodynamics.<br /><br />As is quoted from a song on the album - \\"The 2nd Law: Unsustainable\\":<br /><br />\\"All natural and technological processes proceed in such a way that the availability of the remaining energy decreases. In all energy exchanges, if no energy enters or leaves an isolated system, the entropy of that system increases. Energy continuously flows from being concentrated, to becoming dispersed, spread out, wasted, and useless. New energy cannot be created and high-grade energy is being destroyed.\\"<br /><br />Like all other Muse albums, this one takes a different turn in terms of sound. As a matter of fact, it takes several different turns, as I will describe below with a track-by-track breakdown:<br /><br />1) \\"Supremacy\\": What's Led Zeppelin's \\"Kashmir\\" + a dark James Bond theme song + Matthew Bellamy's falsetto? Muse's \\"Supremacy,\\" which starts their new album off with a bang of massive proportions. This is the perfect opening song for \\"The 2nd Law,\\" as it provides a grand reflection of the band throughout their history, yet with an expansion of that said history and with a hint of possibly what's to come.<br /><br />Grade: 10.00/10.00<br /><br />2) \\"Madness\\": The first single off the album provides for quite the change-up, as it directly follows the hard-rocking \\"Supremacy\\" with a slow, '80s pop/dance feel to it initially, before Bellamy breaks into a solid guitar solo and the building instrumentation builds up into a great climax, where Bellamy yet again shows off his one-of-a-kind vocals.<br /><br />Grade: 7.75/10.00<br /><br />3) \\"Panic Station\\": If there's going to be a #1 smash-hit off this album, this will be that song. The bassline would make Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers realize he no longer needed Viagra. It feels and sounds like an '80s dance song with a Muse tinge to it. When first hearing this song, I had to check the album information again to make certain it wasn't released in 1983. This is definitely a change of pace for the band, but as is typical with Muse, the experimentation paid off and I have a hunch this is going to be a radio hit in the States.<br /><br />Grade: 9.75/10.00<br /><br />4/5) \\"Prelude + Survivor\\": This was to be the theme song for the Olympics in London this past summer. For such an epic event, the song matched it on that front and then-some. Bellamy's piano prelude perfectly introduces the song and as is common with Muse songs, the song gradually builds until we reach an epic climax. The lyrics are a bit on the cheesy side, but lyrics aside, the song and all its components, sounds great. From the piano prelude to Bellamy's spot-on vocals to his guitar solos and beyond, it's yet another great epic rock song conducted by the band.<br /><br />Grade: 8.00/10.00<br /><br />6) \\"Follow Me\\": Like with \\"Madness\\" and \\"Panic Station,\\" this has an '80s feel to it as well. Believe it or not, but one can hear a Gloria Gaynor influence (\\"I Will Survive\\") just prior to the onset of the chorus. While there was worry amongst fans that the band was going full dub-step with this album, that certainly wasn't the case. It is included in this song, however, and to great effect. Like with \\"Panic Station,\\" it may be difficult for people to not start dancing when hearing this song, especially if they've been introduced to the three wise men that night (Johnny Walker, Jim Beam and Jack Daniels).<br /><br />Grade: 7.50/10.00<br /><br />7) \\"Animals\\": This has a very classic rock, almost bluesy feel to it. The song gradually builds into a catchy, grand climax, where we can hear clamoring Wall Street stockbrokers. The lyrics are some of the best and most topical on the album, I feel.<br /><br />Toward the tail-end of the song, Bellamy belts out:<br /><br />\\"Out of control,<br />We're out of control,<br />Crush those who beg at your feet,<br />Analyze,<br />Franchise,<br />Spread out,<br />Kill the competition, and buy yourself an ocean<br /><br />Amortize,<br />Downsize,<br />Lay off,<br />Kill yourself,<br />Come on and do us all a favor.\\"<br /><br />Grade: 9.50/10.00<br /><br />8) \\"Explorers\\": This is one of the slowest songs off the album, but one which continues to grow with me. Supposedly, lead singer Matthew Bellamy wrote this for his child - a lullaby of sorts. This may very well be the song most influenced by Queen on this album, yet as Muse seems to always do regardless of the influence, they make the sound all theirs.<br /><br />Grade: 7.75/10.00<br /><br />9) \\"Big Freeze\\": U2 appears to be the main influence for this song, especially with regard to the guitars. The song starts off as an '80s tune one may want to forget, yet a catchy chorus and strong second half of the song make up for it. I feel this is one of the band's weaker efforts on the album, but is still a decent song truth be told.<br /><br />Grade: 7.25/10.00<br /><br />10) \\"Save Me\\": This is the first of two songs written and sung by bassist Chris Wolstenholme - the first two he's written and sung for the band. Both songs deal with his personal struggles pertaining to alcoholism.<br /><br />In the song, he sings:<br /><br />\\"Hold me cause I'm sure I hated<br />Promises they are overrated<br />Wait just a while<br />While I'm drowning in denial\\"<br /><br />It's a very slow, almost '60 or perhaps '70s rock song, that eventually picks up toward the song's mid-portion. While I don't think it's a bad song by any stretch and I can completely understand Wolstenholme wanting to express his personal battle and accomplishment with overcoming alcoholism, I do feel this is probably the weakest song on the album. He does have a decent voice - James Maynard-esque perhaps - and there is a genuineness to his words, yet even taking those two components into consideration, I feel this is the weakest song on \\"The 2nd Law.\\"<br /><br />Grade: 6.00/10.00<br /><br />11) \\"Liquid State\\": This is the second of the two Wolstenholme-led songs and provides a stark contrast to the first. It's arguably the heaviest song on the album and carries with it an '80s heavy metal feel - Metallica perhaps. Like with \\"Save Me,\\" it delves into the bassist's battle with alcoholism, as he sings:<br /><br />\\"Warm my heart to remind<br />And hold my head up high<br />And help me to survive<br /><br />Kick me when I'm down<br />Feed me poison, for me till I drown<br />Wake me up before I get punched out and fall into the night\\"<br /><br />In the end, I feel this is a much stronger effort from Wolstenholme and should provide for a good live tune as well.<br /><br />Grade: 8.50/10.00<br /><br />12) \\"The 2nd Law: Unsustainable\\": It was due to this song rumors circulated the internet that Muse had gone dub-step. The dub-step doesn't kick in until a little before the midway point. The song starts in a tense, dramatic fashion, as the listener can feel, like in a movie, something bad is about to occur. The instrumental then hits a certain point of tension, where it can't go any further and breaks into dub-step. This is quite symbolic I feel, as the dub-step is representative of total and utter chaos - all the while a robotic voice utters the word unsustainable. While I love the opening to the song and appreciate the symbolism behind the dub-step, I still can't seem to completely warm up to that and due to that, feel it's probably one of the weaker tracks on the album.<br /><br />Grade: 7.00/10.00<br /><br />13) \\"The 2nd Law: Isolated System\\": Here's the second of the two instrumentals and in my opinion, provides a perfect close to the album. The sound is slower than the preceding instrumental, and slightly haunting. It provides the sound of a dark, dramatic film and the feel that chaos has struck and we're suddenly at a loss on where to turn next. In the second-half of the song, however, things begin to pick up and a sound of hope and optimism can be heard, signifying that while chaos has struck, we can still pull through it.<br /><br />Grade: 8.25/10.00<br /><br />Overall: While some may not like the fact that so many different musical genres have been presented by Muse on this disc and that it may disrupt the flow on the album, I think it's refreshing and more times than not, the band is able to pull off these experimentations in sound with seeming ease. One can't help but admire a band willing to continually alter their sound, expand their musical horizons in an attempt to take them above and beyond where they had ever been previously as musicians. From one album to the next, that is what Muse does - not showcasing any fear of losing long-time fans or of critical backlash. Every album, every song is a new journey with the band and while I and others may on occasion not like a particular sound experimented by the band, I have far more respect for musicians like Muse who continually push themselves than those like Nickelback who have seemed to master the art of legally ripping off themselves and for some strange reason, found success in doing so.<br /><br />Grade Scale: 50.0 - 59.9% = Very average - Siskel and Ebert would have given it one thumb up and even then, the thumb wouldn't be raised very high.<br /><br />60.0 - 69.9% = Above average - Siskel and Ebert would have given this one very enthusiastic thumb up. I don't believe they ever rated a movie in such a manner, but I'll do that for them now. You're welcome.<br /><br />70.0% - 74.9% = Good - It may not be a masterpiece, but is better than most. On the KA (Kick A**) scale, it'd cover one cheek and perhaps lightly graze the other.<br /><br />75.0 - 79.9% = Very good - About 4/5 of both cheeks would be kicked with this kind of score.<br /><br />80.0 - 84.9% = Great - Both cheeks would be fully kicked and while Siskel and Ebert may not have given it two very enthusiastic thumbs, the two thumbs would raise and with perhaps at least a skosh of enthusiasm.<br /><br />85.0 - 89.9% = Excellent - On the edge of being a masterpiece, but one key component is missing from it being called as such. This score would be deserving of both cheeks being kicked via the KA scale, with the kicker throwing in a \\"Hi-yah!\\" for good measure.<br /><br />90.0 - 100.0% = Masterpiece - This place is reserved for the best of the best. It's where the likes of Nickelback, Limp Bizkit, N'Sync, Kriss Kross, Vanilla Ice and \\"American Idol\\" winners will never see their names.<br /><br />My \\"The 2nd Law\\" Grade: 97.25/120.00 = 81.04% (Great)
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I have been anticipating this book for several months. The story was well laid out and the character development was good. I was not disappointed in this installment of the Hero's story. I am now anxiously awaiting the next book.

B000SEGUDE|1.0|I am a stickler for punctuation and when reading, I couldn't get past that within the first couple of pages. Several \\"&\\" replacing the word \\"and\\". Also did not care for the author's writing style. Just conflict of personal preference, might try the movie? :-)

1575666286|5.0|I have not finished it yet but I know that it is already good reading and I'm sure the rest of it will be great too. To know things that can help your body to heal is always helpful to us instead of all the drugs doctors and drug companies want to push on us.
B00511ONPG|5.0|This book is packed with actionable social tasks that anyone can do. I have so many thing highlighted in this book! I also like that it is focused on Facebook, but expands to Twitter a lot. This is a book I can give to any of my clients to read no matter if they are Boomers, Millennials or GenX. Very nice.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|Loved the game when it worked! Was impressed at getting such a great game as FAOTD as most are junk. Unfortunately it only worked on my Kindle Fire on the day it was free. Now it refuses to open, even after reinstalling. Major bummer!
0452289963|5.0|I'm learning much about myself, this book is quite intriguing and if highly recommended for everyone to read. Tolle gets really deep in his teachings on multiple levels which makes it difficult to put this book down.
B001L5J5GS|5.0|This was exactly as advertised and this is not to be taken for granted. I've had 2 items out of the lot I've ordered that, so far - there may be more -, I've wanted to or will return. It's refreshing to find the 'Diogenestic' honest seller.
B0079XNWQA|5.0|Saw Mraz w/Christina Perri....One of the best concerts ever attended. Don't miss your chance to attend. In the meantime....buy this & the Perri CD via Amazon!
B007THA4FI|5.0|I have never read a Potter book... That said, I found this to be a great read.  It was a bit difficult to grasp all the characters, went back a few times to reorient on who was who. Worth the effort. Not for kids, but that was made clear prior to it going on the shelves. It wasn't a happy story but you routed for the foul mouthed heroine all the same.
B007REW8AC|5.0|Every track is incredible from one of the best artists of today. Would highly recommend....don't miss her live if opportunity.
B007R21JJK|5.0|I have owned this motherboard for over a week. Used a 3570k i5 with 2x 4gb 1600MHz corsair vengance memory. It flys. Very happy, but there is one issue. Four of the six usb 3.0 ports are made by Via. They will drop usb 2.0 devices (like my USB sound card for instance) randomly. It needs a software update that is NOT on gigabytes web site. Im not sure if Amazon will allow me to post a link, but here is where I found the updated drivers: [...]  I found them by googling VL800 via drivers. It is on their homepage. Once this is done, the USB 2.0 support is back to normal.    PROS: Great overclocking. Precise voltage monitoring/execution. Nice bios interface (press F1 to get past the gimicky 3D bios).    CONS: Vl800 usb ports >:     Highly recommended. I only use Gigabyte for myself, family, and customers of mine. Every Asus motherboard I have ever used/built with has given me many problems.
B008AT71WI|5.0|The transfer is great - the colors are much more vibrant than on the DVD, and the picture is sharper.<br />The sound is incredible -- the best mix of this movie, I've ever heard in any medium.<br />It's worth the price just to finally see the cut original ending.<br />... and the little note from Frank Oz about the cut ending is pretty great.<br /><br />if you're a fan of this movie -- YOU NEED THIS.<br /><br />SPOILERS ALERT:<br /><br />... more of a point of discussion (the cut ending in great to finally see -- FIVE stars for this blu-ray)<br /><br />... Technically, the cut ending of the movie is the ending of the off-broadway show, it's the same song, etc -- but i can see why audiences didn't spark to the movie's end. For one thing - it's played much sadder in the movie than the show. The slow death of Audrey, the close-ups of her tears, Seymour being devoured sooooo slowly... it's sad. in the musical, it all happens pretty quick, and it's pretty campy.<br /><br />AND -- more importantly -- the musical ends on an UPBEAT note:<br /> Sure, seymour and Audrey die -- but they come right back on stage, to sing the final song. They're dead for thirty seconds, then they come out again, singing. And they're still together.<br />In Frank Oz's ending they die, and are gone forever, the monsters take over the world.<br /><br />In the SHOW's ending -- the last lines are:<br />\\"if we fight it, we still got a chance!\\"<br /><br />then Seymour and Audrey sing to each other (albeit, as flowers) \\"We've got tomorrow!!!\\"<br />\\"Don't fee the plants\\"<br /><br />Yes they die -- but they come back, sing a really fun song, and say that they have tomorrow...<br />the movie ends with their death, and the end of the world...<br /><br />I loved seeing it -- and i can kinda see now, after all these years, why test audiences responded the way they did. I was confused why they though the ending was a bummer... the end of the musical is fun, not sad. The movie didn't quite achieve that.<br /><br />that said -- it's AWESOME, and cool to finally see -- buy it, and see what you think.
B0098VYCCE|1.0|I love Charlize Theron but she was the only good thing about this movie.<br />The chick from Twilight is way too monotone. She put me to sleep.
B007TK77QE|2.0|I bought this book asap because i am a huge fan of J.K.Rowling, however this book was nowhere near as captivating as any of the Harry Potters, I know they are in no way comparable but to be honest i haven't even brought myself to finish it, its a struggle to read.
0385344333|1.0|I am a loyal fan and have read all the the Jack Reacher series. This by far was the biggest waste of my time reading this book. SELLOUT.... Tom Cruise is perfect for this crap.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I took this series at it's face value after hearing about it repeatedly.  It was a fun and entertaining read that one could zip right through.  (Read them all in a weekend) It made for a fun evening and discussion at our book club.  The author's style was cheezy and the characters a bit juvenile, but as I said, take it for what it's worth and enjoy an escape.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is a very solid game. Great graphics, pleasing soundtrack, and levels that are puzzling without being &quot;Nintendo hard&quot;. Also, it's addictively fun. 5 stars well earned.
B003B02O14|5.0|One of my favorite Grisham novels.  Full of twists and turns.  Masterfully written.  Having said that, I hated the ending.
B008I3R2VG|5.0|The Killers go retro, Springsteen vibe awesomeness on Battleborn! They kind of combined all of the sounds from previous records, to deliver a surprisingly fresh sound, topped off with Brandon's crisp tenor vocal, you can't go wrong. Worth every penny!
B009B50QOU|3.0|Who hasn't been a fan of green day at one point or another, this album seems pretty bland and nothing really catches you
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|OMG. I loved it. So much love between percy and annabeth and the end was so heart-wrenching. I just loved it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Awesome book... So well worth the wait! Can not wait for the next book to come out now! Must read!!
B005COO1X6|5.0|This book is really something else. I mean, just when I think that this guy can't top himself, he finds a way to do it.<br />I don't want to give away anything, except to say, read it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I cant wait till Dec.. This book has me @ the edge, Dec is way 2 long of a wait..
B004YM6JI2|5.0|The series definitely changed up big time when it involved the religious arc.  It's been interesting, but I love the introduction of the Leviathans!  It brought the old school \\"monster hunt\\" feel back to the series!  And it is WAY better than the lame, LAME, story arc involving Eve.  Thumbs up on this for sure!
1423165691|4.0|I was disappointed that there were NO credits of artists on these drawings.  Yes, on some of the older sketches the records of who did them weren't kept and it isn't known who did them, so in those cases say, unfortunately we don't know.  But sketches of The Beast?  Was it Keane or Dejas?  It is an insult to the artists not to credit anyone.  I understand the prefatory remarks that say that this book is about the beauty of the illustrations first and foremost.  But the illustrations wouldn't exist if it weren't for the artists.  It is an unforgivable corporate egocentricity to pretend that Walt Disney did all of these drawings himself.  Even after he was dead?  Please, in some way, maybe at least on the internet, tell us who did these classic drawings that have so deeply impressed all our lives.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Considering my daughter has read it 6 times already, I think it gets all five stars. She loves it and is waiting for the next one in the series already.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  It revealed how President Lincoln was able to analyze situations, wait for the right time, then deal with the situation. He was able to forgive people that had caused problems and not try to get even. I highly recommend this book to anyone that is interested in learning more about Abraham Lincoln.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I've watched many of the popular films about nutrition, and this one takes the cake. While consumer health is not the primary focus of the film (as in Forks Over Knives & Food Matters), it presents vital information about what happens before our food gets to the supermarket. This film highlights the corrupt practices of major food companies, including Tyson and Monsanto. Viewers get an insight into animal cruelty, GMOs, and the exploitation of farmers. To my surprise, it didn't advocate veganism, but I think that makes it more appealing to a larger audience. If you watch this movie, you won't be coerced by propaganda. You will simply be given information about what you pay for. This movie is excellent and even my boyfriend, who does not care about eating healthy, loved it. I highly, highly recommend it.
B003WTE886|5.0|I bought Speak Now because I liked the on \\"Mean\\", even though I'm not a big Taylor Swift fan. Surprisingly, I actually enjoyed the other songs, especially Never Grow Up and Enchanted. I ended up buying [[ASIN:B0014I4KH6 Taylor Swift]] and [[ASIN:B001EYGOEM Fearless]]. I'm also planning on buying [[ASIN:B008XNZMOU Red]] when it comes out next week.<br /><br />The tracks on Speak Now are:<br /><br />1. Mine<br />2. Sparks Fly<br />3. Back to December<br />4. Speak Now<br />5. Dear John<br />6. Mean<br />7. The Story of Us<br />8. Never Grow Up<br />9. Enchanted<br />10. Better Than Revenge<br />11. Innocent<br />12. Haunted<br />13. Last Kiss<br />14. Long Live
B0091XRL86|2.0|Was not as good as the previews. Pretty disapointed, all the funny scenes were in the previews, glad I didnt go to theaters to see it. The best part was David Tenant (10th Doctor, Doctor Who) played Darwin!<br />My kids didnt even want to finish the movie, they were as bored as I was.
B0064BWDRW|5.0|Jo Nesbo is a dangerous author who has no fear.  He is prepared to find the ugly, dissect it and leave its naked truth bared for all to see.  His writing is mind-blowing in his ability to draw you in.  His plots are intricate.  You need to concentrate when you read his books.  The clues are all there, but chances are you'll miss many of them.  At the end, you'll slap yourself on the side of the head and say 'of course!'<br />Phantom is raw, sick, sad.  You won't be able to put it down.  The end will have you reeling, but I reckon it's not over yet.  I think Harry Hole may come back.  I hope and pray Harry Hole comes back.
B007TK77QE|1.0|If this was supposed to be a book for young adults, it may grab a few of them, but if it was supposed to be for adults, the author failed miserably.  It is boring, discombobulated and hard to stick with...it may be the first book I don't finish.
B00846REIS|1.0|I thought the writing and story lines in Fifty Shades was better. This book had potential but left me cold. The characters were not flushed out enough to really feel invested in it.
0307592731|5.0|From start to finish I loved everything about it. She had so much determination five star from me and I know anyone else will feel the same.
B008XG1X18|4.0|This is so much better than using the web version.  The web version would take forever to load and would often freeze.  This app loads well on my Kindle Fire and has  frozen only a few times.  I like the &quot;tri-fold&quot; layout and how easy it is to pin items.
B000P0J09W|5.0|ain't that the truth!  A true Goonie will never quit!  that's what this movie taught me at a young age, if you believe with perseverance you can over come ANYTHING that life throws at you, this is a childhood staple, I pity the fool who's never seen the Goonies!  story line is fantastic, the child actors, so much goodness, there's not enough room to go through it all!<br /><br />HHHEEEEEEYY YOUUU GUUUUUUUYYYSSSSS!
B000FC0OOU|5.0|Good read.  The main characters in the book are almost alive.  Robert, Maria and Pilar keep the dialog alive but in some cases the details are too extensive.  Hard to not keep reading each night to find out what happens to Robert and Maria and, of course, the bridge.  Hemmingway is a favorite.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is awesome! fog dog  dog dog dog dog qi qi wi qi qi qi qi qi qi qi
B008673ZAQ|5.0|After reading 50 Shades I was looking for another series to bring me down to the real world again. At the time I hadn't realized the second book Reflected in You was not already out and dreaded the couple months I had to wait for its release. I was very excited when the release date arrived and read the whole book that day. I am on round two and feel the writing and story line is really picking up and taking you into a well rounded experience. Enjoyed it and recomend it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had seen the movie but prefer to read the books. so i had to start with the first one, and get to the second one before the next movie. this is one of the best nooks ever read.

HEY PEOPLE THE GAME IS EASY TO BEAT I BEAT IT ON HARD NO PROBLEM!!! its very easy and fun to play for awhile....AND THE CONTROLS ARE PERFECT I CAN DO COMBOS NO PROBLEM!!! over all its an good game i dont think i would pay for it though...
B008G12ERC|4.0|I can't say I have many complaints about this album. The second to the last track is pretty typical Muse from what I know; it's loud and somewhat grating. It's really not my thing though. There may have even been another track that I don't care for that I can't recall. However, the rest of the material was cool. \\"Madness\\" was different for them but I found that it worked. It's one of my favorite tracks here. \\"Panic Station\\" is also really subdued (for Muse anyway) and cool. There is still grander \\"rock\\" to be heard here in places. And I'm sure that's what many fans want. But Muse is anything but a typical rock band so don't expect that. Do expect variety. Like I said I enjoyed the album and don't see why some people don't. Overall it's pleasant to the ears and Matthew Bellamy has always had an interesting voice. On \\"Supremacy\\" when he yelps he actually sounds like Adam Lambert. Hehe.<br /><br />Anyway. Two thumbs up.<br /><br />4 stars.

B005LAII8A|4.0|The movie takes on some unique aspects. Perhaps the best way to describe the film is that it reminded me of &#34;Terminator&#34; without cyborgs. This is a film that deals with time travel. It addresses some of the paradoxes of time travel, but ignores others. In the near future, time travel is possible and outlawed. As the old saying goes, &#34;If time travel is outlawed, then only outlaws will time travel.&#34; Weirdly the outlaws use time travel to dispose of bodies. People are transported to the past where they are shot/killed/ and disposed of by people called Loopers who are well paid in silver.<br /><br />Something happens to the system as Loopers are rounded up and sent back to be killed by their younger selves. To add to the weird, there suddenly appears mutant humans who have mild amounts of &#34;TK&#34; or telekinesis powers.<br /><br />I liked the movie as it was a fresh approach to the use of time travel. Decent script. Decent acting. Good ending.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bomb, no real sex, nudity (Piper Perabo)

0553801473|3.0|It is understandable, when one considers the fact of how long a gap there was between \\"Feast for crows\\" and \\"A Dance with Dragons\\", that many people are going to be disappointed. When you're an author, you can't have it both ways - you have to choose/make compromise between what hard-core fans expect and your own artistic integrity and/or vision. Before the HBO show started, I wasn't sure that anyone still reading this series isn't a hard-core fan - you'd have to be pretty persistent to remain around Westeros for this long. Nowadays, things are a bit different. I don't consider myself to be a hard-core fan of this series. I liked what Martin did in first three books, I even liked the fourth one (despite angry mob being angry for no apparent reason) but the fifth one takes the whole \\"oh my god moment\\" to a new level. After waiting for so many years one can't but be disappointed. There are many good things in this book, Martin still knows his storytelling. Overall, though, it's a giant jumble in a dire need of a proficient editor.<br /><br /> Anyway, there are many things one can talk about concerning this book and it's hard to choose between them. Space on the Amazon is rather short and one should avoid technicalities and ramblings. I've yet to learn how to avoid latter. Let's try to think about facts we have at hand. \\"A dance with dragons\\" is 5th book in a series of seven. That means 71% of the Saga is completed. By the way, I won't be putting spoiler tags so tread carefully. So then, what is yet to happen? Eventually, Danny has to return to Westeros and conquer some towns. Preferably the one with Iron Throne in it. Of course, there are Others and impounding battle between forces of Ice and Fire. This is bound to have a lasting impact on an entire universe. Arya has to grow up eventually, return to Westeros as well, and do some avenging. Spider and Littlefinger have to hatch whatever plot they're hatching and so on. There are a number of open story-threads that need to be closed.<br /><br /> Average number of pages per book (up to this point) is around 850. \\"A dance with dragons\\" alone has 1056. That is almost 25% more than average. So we have the longest book yet in which several things happen. Many severals in fact. Most of them are people eating and parading around. There are bits of this and that scattered around as well. What is important to note is this. In this book, Danny had to assert control on Meereen (a single town), Stannis had to rally support of North (by conquering a single town), Jon had to build up his defenses, Victarion had to sail across the sea, and the other Targaryen had to be pulled out of the ass to further disintegrate the plot. Thousand pages later, nothing of this actually happened. Danny is no longer in Meereen (dragons magically grew up despite the fact that in some earlier book someone mentioned that this would require years) but battle there is far from over. Stannis got stuck in a snow storm beneath the walls of Winterfell. Arya had two chapters in which she did some killing but essentially run around in circles. Varys appeared, oh how conveniently, out of the blue to kill Kevan Lannister (because he can). Victarion just barely made it to the other shore, and Jon was stuck on the wall and ended up repeatedly stabbed. Oh, and Bran met some nice tree and had a little chat with him. Basically, in 1056 pages key characters moved few miles accomplishing meager things. It sort of reminds me of some conservative chess openings that I've seen people do just to irritate their opponents.<br /><br />Remember what is yet to happen? Remember that there are only two books left? What can we conclude from known facts? There are several options. If pace remains the same, upcoming books will be 4k+ pages mammoths with people running around avoiding to do things. If average page count remains the same we can expect the pace becoming lightning quick with people teleporting around doing things they should've beendoing all this time. Or, we can expect that seventh book won't be the final one. In any of these cases, when one has in mind the speed of Martin's writing and/or publishing of these books, we can assume that we will never see the ending of these series. If we actually do, it will be far from satisfying.<br /><br /> Martin needs an Editor. Martin needs and Editor which will beat him with a stick whenever he sees him writing another paragraph on honeyed locusts, roasted dogs, kidney puddings and Coat of Arms of some minor lordling with a complete history of his minor House. What we need isn't another \\"Wheel of Time\\". What we got with this book is something just like that - A giant filler full of random ramblings (Pretty Pig and the whole Tyrion story arc - seriously?) that make you wonder why are you still reading this book, and why will you read the next one when it comes out in a couple of years. I still don't know the answer to this.doing all this time. Or, we can expect that seventh book won't be the final one.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book, living up to the hype and expectation that preludes it. From the first shot fired against new Rome to the long fall to Tarterus, Rick has earned another years worth of subscription by me. Much worth the price, just remeber, nothing is the way it seems and sometimes the price for revenge is steep.

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I think this game is one of the greatest games ever. It has some flaws in it but only a few. Some of the things I like about it is all the powerups you get. Plus you get to spin for extra things but only if you get spin coins. So this is why I think you should get this game.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was as juicy and hot as the first book!  In addition to a hot love story, theres also a thrilling plot!!

It has the weight and detail of a work clearly aimed at adult/sophisticated readers. I highly recommend this book, and the seller who sold it to me.  The story is incredibly honest/insightful/unabashed/uncensored and the illustrations are original and quite striking.
B00005QIPH|5.0|This album is so unique in so many ways.  From the recording style, to the songwriting, to the play order, I will never get enough of this album.
B000VLE3GA|5.0|Fan's are gonna argue over this album for the next forty years, fighting over what should and shouldn't be on a greatest hits [of sorts] release.  And I use the term `greatest hits' lightly, because Led Zeppelin were never really a band who put out singles, preferring to let each album represent itself and the group at that particular moment in time.  If you ask a die-hard Zepper which compilation to score, most people will tell you that if you want a greatest hits release from Led Zeppelin, then you should save up and purchase all of their albums.  But that was before the idea of Mothership even existed, Mothership threw all the cards in the air, is a collection of twenty-four of Zep's most loved and timeless numbers, remastered and selected by the band's final three remaining members [Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, and John Paul Jones], and it must be taken seriously for that reason alone ... these songs where chosen by the band themselves, not a record company, not the industry, not simply Jimmy Page, but collectively by the chaps who laid down every single note.<br /><br />There's no bonus material to be found here, if anything, Mothership was designed as a primer for those who perhaps never heard of Led Zeppelin before, and want to get a sense of what all the hub-bub and fuss was all about.  There's not a single thing here for the long time fan, or for anyone who's ever listened to FM radio ... less of course you're a record completist, and then of course you'll need this to fill out that empty quarter inch on your record shelf.  After all, Jimmy Page has put together several compilations over the years, the first being what's come to be known as Crop Circles, a four disc collection, and then there was Early Days & Later Days Volumes I and II, released by Atlantic Records.  Never the less, if nothing else, Mothership will remind everyone that Led Zeppelin will not doubt remain one of the finest bands of all time.<br /><br />Though if you were asking me where to spend my hard earned cash ...

B007THA4FI|5.0|This book stands alone, bearing the mark of Rowling's talent without hearkening HP too directly. Yes, the end-of-chapter cliffhangers are still there, and so is the dark psychology of the characters; but this is no children's novel. The power of this book comes from its multi-voiced storytelling, through which the reader accesses the inner worlds of a web of community members, all of whom are inexorably self-absorbed, fearful, and suffering. You will recognize yourself in all of these characters-- the adults and their teenaged children. This book makes your heart race, your stomach churn, and your mind question. You will be caring about its characters long after you've read the final page. Flanked by funerals, this story is a distinct kind of 21st century tragedy that you won't soon forget.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|The Beach Boys are like an old lover I never quite got over, one I find myself thinking about, often at the most inopportune moments, smiling for all I'm worth as I watch my bright red toenails dry in the sun.  Yeah ... it's been sixteen years since the Boys [Men] have put out a collective album, and I tell you true, they haven't missed a beat, filling my head with echoing harmonies and reach-back Easter eggs, reminding me of 10CC's best efforts, though in todays jargon I should be referring to the hypnotic meanderings of Animal Collective, or Fleet Foxes, as they've created an easy going stoner wash that has me kickin' back on my deck as the setting sun warms my face, remembering when I was the girl in the tiny bathing suit, bopping down the beach with the radio on.<br /><br />The music is extraordinarily clean and bright, sounding at times like it's being beamed in from 1971, filled with boyish lyrics and bygone imagery that has my heart melting, wishing there was someone right here, right now to hold me in their arms, dance me into the evening, and smile a smile that swells my eyes with tears.  People will certainly look back and compare That's Why God Made The Radio to Pet Sounds, and even Smile, forgetting the personal trauma that brought those two elegant albums into being, when what they should be hearing is that everything the Beach Boys have ever done since Surf's Up has merely been a prelude to this adventurous dynamic undertaking.  Certainly the path has been trod before, but hey, that's why I drop the needle on a Beach Boys album to begin with, I know where it's gonna take me ... and for once, they've gotten it note for note, song for song, harmony for harmony, exactly right ... and this is why the Beach Boys have survived.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Kesler
B0054DFIIM|4.0|After finishing their brief two-year hiatus following another successful tour in 2008,         The Kaiser Chiefs blasted their way into the 2010’s with there fourth studio CD which         again prove they were ready to take on the future.   The Future Is Medieval, released         in 2011, gives another electrifying punch that’s mortified with an array of high voltage         rock and roll, Indie Rock virtuosity, top-drawer songwriting, outrageous solos and the         fast-paced high-tech production that made it such a chart-topping success.    Starting         with the Top Ten window blasting hip-hop style opening track Little Shocks, the track         set feature, such power rock songs like Things Change, Long Way From Celebrating,         Out Of Focus, When All Is Done, Man From Mars, the mystic Child Of The Jago, and         Heard It Break.  What is meant to be another crash course in Indie Rock, The Future         Is Medieval serves us with a slick combination of fresh originality done with charisma         and well-written melodies to spare, which The Kaiser Chiefs pulls off quite well.  De-        spite being a little heavy on the EDM-oriented music background and a little bit retro,         you will find this challenging tour de force a satisfying and highly captivating listening         experience, which ranks along the band’s best and memorable classic works.  Even         though you may find something a little slightly different about this high key recording,         but you will find this one to be a well-performed and upbeat listening experience.  Note: Make sure you rip the bonus track On The Run!
B007N85ZXY|4.0|I'm sure that we could debate for hours on end the need for an artist to cover a song, coming up with the usual answers ... they dig it, they want to honor the song, or perhaps they just want to spin their own take on a traditional number.  That can not be said of Neil Young, a man who's enigmatic career has shifted from album to album; at times turning away ardent fans, but if nothing else, Neil has remained true to himself and his musical vision.  Only once before in the course of musical history has an artist taken a number and made it passionately his own, a song that was so familiar that it went unnoticed, and that was at Woodstock, with Jimi Hendrix reaching out and rewriting the \\"Star Spangled Banner\\" so completely that we will never hear it with the same ears again.<br /><br />Neil Young's done the same thing here, he's taken a group of songs that are so much apart of our collective memory that we don't consider them anymore than we consider the next breath we're about to take.  Though with Neil and his crazy band of outlaws, my ears perk like I'm hearing these songs for the very first time, like shoes that fit my dancing feet, like they were fresh songs, songs just written for me to stand in front of the mirror strumming my mystical guitar to, spinning with passion and grace, while shivers run up and down my spin, walking my naive youth back before my reflection like a distant ghost strung out on black & white television, and an Indian Head test pattern.<br /><br />Americana is musical perfection, Americana is musical madness, Americana has reinvented the lexicon, Americana has given us a fresh starting point that will have you wondering what Neil heard and you missed.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Kesler

B008OB1QFK|4.0|Chris Knight has never been a man who's done much talkin', and to that end, on this his first release in nearly four years, he continues to let his music do the talking.  Good alternative country music is as much about a believable attitude as it is the heartfelt notes, and if it doesn't cause a buzzing in your ears, and an itching at the bottoms of your pockets, then it ain't the real deal.  Little Victories is nearly prophetic, it's filled with enigmatic truths, rural sensibilities, and visionary road weary enlightenments ... picking up right where Springsteen left off on Nebraska.  Though it wouldn't take much to convince me that perhaps Bruce was channeling something he hadn't actually heard yet, because there's no way music with this much power and dirt road honestly can conform to the physical laws or space and time.<br /><br />Knight's perfected his own organic approach to music, following in the footsteps of his legends, John Prine, Lucinal Williams, and Steve Earle, recording this outing, except for a couple of overdubs, completely live ... and to my way of thinking, laying it all on the line is the only way to capture an honest spirit, and breath life into a series of chords laced together by lyrics that conjure hidden magic.  Little Victories isn't about the usual country fluff, Little Victories is both a step back and a step forward, delivering urgent social commentary through songs with stance and character.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Kesler

B007L96SI6|5.0|Haley Reinhart \\"(born September 9, 1990) is an American singer-songwriter from Wheeling, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, Illinois, who placed third in the tenth season of American Idol.\\" Listen Up! is Haley's debut album; and I can't believe how talented she is--that she wasn't in the Hollywood round of American Idol's ninth season truly surprises me. Her talent is just that special! Haley wrote or co-wrote almost every catchy song on this CD which, overall, highlights Haley's retro-style, bluesy/raspy voice with her frequent nods to that old school flair; there's not a single bad cut in the lot. The liner notes include song lyrics; song credits and even the artwork is beautiful.<br /><br />\\"Oh My!\\" features Haley in her natural element; she and B. o. B. perform this and \\"Oh My!\\" makes a great start to the album; I love it! \\"Free\\" has a beautiful melody and Haley makes this awesome with her sensitive delivery and a musical arrangement that stuns me every time I hear it. Numbers like \\"Free\\" make me wonder why Haley herself didn't win first place on American Idol! \\"Liar\\" is very well done; Haley handles complex tempo and key changes like a pro on this poignant ballad about a love that \\"goes wrong.\\" \\"Wasted Tears\\" is equally moving yet that beat is great for dancing, too!  Haley Reinhart delivers \\"Undone\\" with all her heart and soul and listen for \\"Now That You're Here,\\" a song I really like. As always, Haley sings without every letting go of a single off note and I'm very impressed. \\"Wonderland\\" has Haley in the spotlight which is right where she belongs; Haley's keen sense of timing and sophisticated phrasing enhance her singing all the more. \\"Keep Coming Back\\" has a solid arrangement and after I first heard Haley do \\"Keep Coming Back\\" I knew I would never forget it. \\"Hit the Ground Runnin'\\" is about a woman who doesn't want romantic ties and \\"Walking on Heaven\\" is very memorable.<br /><br />There is also a deluxe version of this album with four extra tracks: \\"Follow Me (I'm Right Behind You);\\" \\"Spiderweb;\\" \\"What You Don't Know\\" and \\"\\"Let's Run Away.\\" These extra four tracks are also available from *pple's website and they display Haley's versatility. \\"Follow Me (I'm Right Behind You)\\" has an excellent reggae flavor to it; \\"Spiderweb\\" rocks between delicate piano intro/outro segments; \\"What You Don't Know\\" is an excellent disco/pop tune and \\"Let's Run Away\\" shows just how well Haley can do a reggae number.<br /><br />Haley Reinhart excites me with her debut album because she is so naturally talented; it will be wonderful to watch her continue to grow and release even more albums. Diehard fans should get the deluxe version or the four extra tracks on the web.

Seemed just lazy...Engineer chases the little Dr and the giant belly alien squid just HAPPENS to pop out at the exact right moment to \\"save\\" her? Really? Again, laziness...NO understanding or awareness of what is in the mind of the alien being, NOTHING. Not even a little bit to make us want to know more...how can we want that when we were given NOTHING...no desire, no glimpse. Great effects and visuals but story and execution? Big failure.

B000ELJBAK|4.0|This effort from Gilmour is a hidden gem in the canon of Floyd work. Produced while the Floyd were in between Animals and The Wall, it offers a tremendously creative and wide-ranging roster of songs, all with the signature guitar style of Gilmour.  Many of these tracks (check \\"I Can't Breathe Anymore\\") would have improved The Wall musically and lessened the Waters-driven cacophany that dominates that album.  There is not one bad song on this album and many are excellent. It's not a Pink Floyd album, but then again neither is The Final Cut, over which this recording towers musically.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Our family has read the entire Percy Jackson series (and Kane Chronicles) and couldn't wait for the Heroes of Olympus series.  We have not been disappointed.  Rick Riordan just keeps getting better. I love how he has drawn the Greek & Roman histories together.  Even with so many major characters in this new series, you still feel like you get to know them well.  The Mark of Athena brings all 7 together in an unforgettable adventure that's still not finished.  The House of Hades (next book coming out fall 2013) promises to be the most thrilling yet.  We can't wait!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|My whole family has enjoyed all of the \\"Percy Jackson\\" books!  They just keep getting better.  My sons read them over and over, after we read them as a family.

Gone Girl started brilliantly, and then 'jumped the shark'.<br /><br />I'm not going to rehash the plot, or spoil what's still a great book, but know this before you start it... your final enjoyment will depend on whether Gillian Flynn can keep you suspending disbelief to the last page - and sadly, for me she didn't.<br /><br />Judging by the reviews, others went with her and accepted Amy's er.. extravagant solution to a problem, and her and Nick's final stand-off - but I just didn't believe that Amy could do that, and that there wasn't another way out for Nick.

B003WKOU0G|5.0|I love to show this film to my highschool sociology students. I use it in our unit on socializtion.<br /><br />Very funny and sweet, I think all the kids end up with a favorite baby!
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Um, if you have not seen the Dark Knight Rises, I think you are missing out. I think you should go see it, too. If you have a cheap theater in your town that plays movies that our out of the big screen, but not on DVD, GO SEE IT! I personally have seen it three times, but by the 3rd time I did fall asleep. Haha. Nevertheless, great film.<br /><br />But there is this part that really stuck out to me, and I feel as a Christian (someone who follows Jesus), not Christian Bale, ha, it really had a profound impact! But, it did take three times to make the connection and actually understand what it meant. And I had to draw on other information in my life to make the connection (which I call The Web of Knowledge, when these connection happen). So, here is the seen, most of us probably missed it, but it is worth your time!<br /><br />Bane had put Batman in the pit, so quickly let's cover the pit, if you do not know what the pit is, it is a prison, that tortures a man mentally. The reason it tortures a man mentally is because he can see out of the pit, but can not make the climb (well, there is actually a place midway through or so that a person has to make a jump from one part to the other that is humanly impossible, so it seems, so basically a person can't make the jump) out to freedom because it is pretty much impossible, but wait, one person has (run on sentence)! As you can see, this is the perfect way to torture Batman, because he is not afraid of physical pain. So Batman not letting a challenge defeat him is determined to get out of the pit to go save his city that is being destroyed. (The climber wears a rope so he can't fall to his death) After he heals, he gives the-climb-to-freedom a try, and well, he falls, he does not make it, bust. We see in another scene he tries it again, and again on his 2nd try, epic fail, he falls, total bust.  =( Sad face. Then, this old doctor guy starts dialoguing with him and it goes like this:<br /><br />Old Man: Your afraid (to Batman).<br /><br />Batman: No, I'm angry.<br /><br />Old Man: You are, that is the reason you can't make the jump.<br /><br />Batman: (looks like he starts really listening)<br /><br />Old Man: Your fear of fighting Bane is the reason you cannot make the jump, if you make the jump, you will fall, because you have the rope.<br /><br />(My commentary: so what the Old Man is saying is because he has a safety net, the rope, to catch him when he falls, his fear of Bane is not allowing him to make the jump. Because deep down in the subconscious he is afraid to fight Bane and his body can't summon up the necessary strength to do it, it's a physiological infirmity, his fear of failure is keeping him in the pit, and his mind not letting him make the jump)<br /><br />Batman: (looks at Old Man and gives a nod to go on and tell him what to do)<br /><br />Old Man: You have to make the jump with out the rope<br /><br />So, when he makes the jump with out the rope, he will then be able to actually make the full jump, because now he has a greater fear, the fear of death driving him on. He can then summon that strength.<br /><br />So for me, it made me think, in our life what ropes do we have that keep us from doing something? What ropes are holding us back from our goals, our dreams? What holds us back from being all we can be, is it fear of failure? It is a job that pays well, but not something we enjoy? Is it how people see us and the molds and patterns they have us in, so we now we can't break out of the mold people have us in? I'm not sure what you are going through, but as a Christian, we can give God the rope, we can give God the rope to go forward, and let Christ live His life through us. God will give us the strength, through faith to make the jump, and go to freedom, and do what we were meant to do! Amen! Haha.<br /><br />Yea, I know, I did not see it coming either, it was just there...<br /><br />Anyhow, hopefully that lifts you a bit. Now let's review the movie.<br /><br />Ithought the movie was okay, it had some good parts, and overall was a good movie that is worth watching. Though having seen it 3 times, a person starts to notice some of the errors and problems. There seems to be a lot of leaps of logic, and to-close-of-calls for me, and some all-too-coincidental-parts, like when Bane fights Batman and Batman is defeated, and then they blow the bottom out of Wayne Enterprises where all Batman's gear is. C'mon, too coincidental. Then, was Bane super human, cause he was breaking cement at the end with his bare hands? And what about the breathing apparatus, what did that do? There are more, I will just have to watch it again.<br /><br />I did not get how Batman was alive at the end, I know there was auto pilot, but where did he eject and swim to safety? And stop the bleeding after we was stabbed, furthermore, the water would be so polluted from the nuclear fallout from the bomb it is ridiculous!<br /><br />Also, I thought there was some corny comedy in it, like when Catwoman leaves Batman, and he is like, \\"so that is how that feels.\\" And when he kicks the guy after Robin says he missed a spot, lame!<br /><br />Then the antagonist woman dies in the truck thing, that was terrible acting! Horrible! Awful! She died so weird, and fake!<br /><br />One thing, America can not get away from the sacrificial leader, even as anti God as society becomes, we still love Jesus to some degree, because a hero that dies for humanity is what Jesus did, that is the hero type we have as the West. I thought that was funny!<br /><br />Things I did really enjoy was the movie, I liked it cause I love Batman, he is a human, and struggles with life. But in his struggles he does the right thing, and makes a difference, and does not focus inward. Good message! Also, I love the soundtrack, I already got it! It is great, I really enjoy the that Hanz Zimmer brings to the table on this!<br /><br />But in comparison to the other movies, I give it an 8, with the other two a 9.5!<br /><br />It is worth your time, and is a great cinematic adventure, but there was to many inconsistencies for me, that I could not stand! I will have to re-watch and get back to guys to point them out! Thanks for reading, also let me your thoughts, I would like to hear!
030758836X|5.0|I loved this book. It was very interesting and kept your interest. Could not put it down !Would recoment this book to any book lover.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I couldn't stop until I read all 3 books.  I would say this is a suspense, love, mystery and romance all rolled into one and I highly recommend it to everyone!  But before you get mad at your spouse for not being as romantic and tuned in to your life and needs, remember this is fiction!!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Nice game. Good levels. There were plenty of obstacles to get through and it was challenging at each level. I recommend downloading it.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|This was a very ambitious film, and unlike most I found the best parts to be those of the understanding of how the aliens originated, as well as the performances.<br />The performances are superb, David the AI ( Fassbender)  the closest to HAL, from 2001  ever on screen, and the icy Theron character was also great.<br />Noomi, while a great actress, lacks the gutsiness of Ripley as the heroine.<br />The film is visually stunning and it begs for a sequel, I would love to see where David and Elizabeth end up and if they find the answers she is seeking.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Another great intense read by Sylvia Day.  It keeps you reading and reading for more.  Once you start reading you won't stop until your done.  Read Bared to You first, you will understand more.
B0041KKYEM|2.0|While I love most of Natalie Portman's films and was excited to see Black Swan I noticed almost immediately that it borrows heavily (at some points practically copies frame by frame) the brilliant Satoshi Kon film Perfect Blue. The only problem is that Perfect Blue didn't need feux erotic drama and pretty ballet scenes to deliver the same message that Black Swan tries to make. It seems that many American filmmakers are taking storylines from Kon as Inception admittedly 'borrowed' the plot of Paprika. Too bad Inception made a better homage than Black Swan does.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I have enjoyed all 6 seasons of Supernatural and this 7th one is an enjoyable and thrilling must see season too.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great characters, superb writing.  I love it.  Ordered book three, half-way through book two.  Cant wait for book four, but then it would not be a trilogy.  LOL

B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is amazing . James you are now my second fav author. right behind jr ward. she is amazing too
B002VHI8FE|5.0|I'm just going to say, I thought this book was awesome! Kick-ass characters with substance, lots of VIOLENT action, and intrigue. Also, Abercrombie has a knack for describing his world and its surroundings without droning on and on for pages.<br />Be forewarned, there's plenty of strong language. For me this is not an issue. After reading TBI, I have to add Abercrombie to my list of favorite authors, i can't wait to get started on book 2!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I was hesitant to download, I don't typically like the match 3 hands but this one has a fun twist which makes it challenging and fun. definitely not your average boring match 3. It's addicting!
B001N9BGGY|5.0|I just created a \\"my list\\" best; \\"pure dialog movie\\".  Wow! What a wonderful movie.  A pure beauty for those who appreciate a movie that is pure art.  Dialog, cinematography, continuity, story, pure delivery.  A beautiful love story.  Take your time.  It hits you 20 minutes in to the movie...  These two are incredible; they have been giving theatrically for twenty minutes and they continue awesomlly for the next hour.  A pure enjoyment for those who know a beautiful movie...
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love that I can now play on my Kindle Fire. I do miss the search feature from other versions. very addictive game. need more ways to get diamonds for free.
0316212377|2.0|I found this to be a very poorly structured and plotted book. It felt like three of four short story ideas were merged together and voila, a novel! The main plot had no pay-off at all. Come to think of it, the secondary plot had no pay-off either.<br /><br />The motivations of the characters were all wrong. The primary alien race did not behave even remotely like the mature and sophisticated elder race it was supposed to be.<br /><br />And the Minds! Once they seemed so cool. But now they babble and bicker like a smug little club of the smartest kids in High School.<br /><br />It's very important in Science Fiction to present an alternative universe that more or less hangs together with it's own logic. In the universe of the culture ships travel in the energy grid between parallel universes (or some such thing) and it can take weeks to cross galactic distances. But a gaggle of a dozen Minds can just chat away across the breadth of the galaxy as if they are on some magical version of Skype. It a little bit too unreal but it sure makes things easy for the author.<br /><br />Really disappointing that, out of the vast history of the culture, this weak little plot is the best that Banks could come up with. How about some stories of the early days of the Culture when actual people were a little more important and Ship Minds did not come across as a bunch of Greek Gods sitting on Mount Olympus meddling in the affairs of mortals?
B008FSCNTK|4.0|I was a little surprised when I first started listening to the music, but I think some of the songs are interesting.  She has taken her music in a different direction and I like the change.  I hope it is not a permanent change, but if it helps to expand her musical range I am all for it.
0425263908|3.0|First in the Crossfire erotic romance series revolving around Gideon Cross and Eva Tramell in New York City.<br /><br />My Take<br />This is the better-written, adult version of the Fifty Shades series. Gideon is also from a tormented childhood and Day is much more subtle about the BDSM. So subtle that it's barely there. I suspect [[ASIN:0425263916 Reflected in You (Crossfire, #2)]] will introduce it a bit more (the original title was to have been \\"Deeper in You\\"). We'll have to see when it's released in October 2012. Gideon and Eva also observe the formality of addressing each other as Mr. and Ms. throughout the story.<br /><br />I do like that Eva tries to resist him and insist upon getting to know him, to like him before leaping into bed with him. He's certainly a pushy bugger! Almost too much. It's like Day wants an alpha male but hasn't quite got the knack of it. It's curious that Gideon is insecure outside of the role he has set for himself. He's totally confused about Eva and blows hot and cold which drives her nuts. A \\"love life\\" has also been too easy for him and he hasn't a clue about how to treat a woman who isn't interested in his wallet. Of course, Eva has her own immature reactions.<br /><br />Yes, it revolves around sex, but Day does create a story with complex, yet shallow characters. I do wish that Day had made it more believable as to why Gideon wants Eva so badly. I'd like to think that he's so intense in his pursuit because she's such a challenge, but he's overpowering from the start.<br />Gimme a break. The \\"violently sexual dreams\\" that Gideon has scares the hell out of her? I could understand worry, but fright? Why does Eva need to know every last detail about the poor guy? She has a point that she laid it all out for him, but can't he be allowed some space?<br /><br />The Story<br />It's an unexpected encounter with a pair of black oxfords as Eva is helping a lady retrieve the contents of her spilled handbag. A meeting that leads to Mark getting a request to present an RFP for an ad campaign for vodka. To Gideon Cross. He'll do anything to get Eva into bed.<br /><br />Her mother, well, her mother will do anything to ensure her safety including spying on her and running her life.<br /><br />It's a constant push-me/pull-me as they take it in turns to blow hot and cold. They each have their traumas that make it difficult to be close and together they work on them with all the drama and tension it requires.<br /><br />The Characters<br />Eva Tramell has come to New York City with her best friend, Cary Taylor; they met in therapy. She plans to work in advertising while he's pursuing a career as a model. Eva has her own psychological issues from a part of her childhood. Cary is very responsible in his work and a totally sleazy jerk in his romances. Her stepfather is Richard Stanton and he'll do anything for her mother, Monica, who is in an almost constant panic about how Eva is coping. Nathan is the stepbrother who abused her. Martin Stanton is Richard's nephew. Victor Reyes is her cop father who lives in Oceanside, California. No, her parents never did marry. Clancy is her stepfather's chauffeur. Dr. Petersen is her mother's shrink.<br /><br />Mark Garrity is her new boss, a junior account manager, at Waters Field & Leaman, a major advertising agency located in the Crossfire Building. His life partner is Steven Ellison, a contractor. Megumi is the receptionist there. Michael Waters is the CEO and president; Christine Field is the executive chairman; and, Walter Leaman is the vice chairman.<br /><br />Gideon Cross is a billionaire and the owner of Cross Industries. And the Crossfire Building. Scott is his personal assistant. His mother married Christopher Vidal, a music executive and they have two children, Chris, Junior and Ireland. There's some intense story involving the half-siblings of which we learn a bit here. Magadalene Perez is an old friend who has her eye on the wedding ring. Corinne Giroux is an ex-fianc&eacute;e who wants back in.<br /><br />Trey, working part-time as a photographer's assistant while pursuing a degree as a veterinarian, is the guy Cary is in love with even as he sabotages the relationship.<br /><br />Parker Smith is a Krav Maga instructor she meets at the gym. Dr. Terry Lucas is not one of Gideon's friends.<br /><br />The Cover<br />The cover is similar to the Fifty Shades covers with its range of greys creating the background and a single object on the front. In this case, it's a set of gold, black, and silver cufflinks in a pattern of crosses. Hmmm, is there a theme here??<br /><br />The title certainly does end with Gideon Bared to You. To we readers and to his love interest, Eva.x-fiancée who wants back in.<br /><br />Trey, working part-time as a photographer's assistant while pursuing a degree as a veterinarian, is the guy Cary is in love with even as he sabotages the relationship.<br /><br />Parker Smith is a Krav Maga instructor she meets at the gym.

1607066017|5.0|For many years, Brian K. Vaughan has been dazzling us and making our heads spin with his wordsmithing and storytelling on some of the greatest comics of the last decade or so. Books like Y: THE LAST MAN, EX MACHINA and his initial run on RUNAWAYS are the stuff that comic book readers' dreams are made of. Alas, since the devastating finale of EX MACHINA, he took some well-deserved time off, but when he announced a new creator-owned series for Image Comics that was apparently going to be \\"STAR WARS meets ROMEO AND JULIET meets GAME OF THRONES\\", people's heads started to explode with anticipation. But would it live up to the inevitable hype surrounding a work by Vaughan and artist Fiona Staples?<br /><br />Short answer: Abso-freakin'-loutely.<br /><br />SAGA is the type of space opera that only someone like Vaughan could do, and do with enough smarts, fun, emotion, action and surprises to keep the audience wrapped around his finger. It's the story of Marko and Alana, a pair of star-cross'd lovers from different sides of warring planets. Alana is from the planet Landfall, a place of great technological advancement, and their planet is in constant conflict with the magic-wielders of that planet's moon Wreath, where Marko hails from. Marko was captured after a battle with Landfall where he threw down his arms because he is a self-proclaimed conscientious objector, and he was imprisoned, where Alana, who was also somewhat disgraced in her military service, is his prison guard. Fast-forward several months, and Alana is giving birth to their child, Hazel, the actual narrator of the series. The very beginning of the series is dedicated to her actually giving birth, and it's hilarious and beautiful and suspenseful since they are being pursued from both sides of this galaxy-wide conflict. In the midst of their pursuit, where they are in search of a legendary (and perhaps fictional) Rocketship Forest so that they might get off the planet with their new baby, we are introduced to all sorts of new, strange, frightening and wonderfully rich characters. We meet Prince Robot IV, a humanoid being with what appears to be an old-fashioned TV set for a head, who is the one primarily tasked with the elimination of Marko and Alana. We also meet two of the bounty hunters that have are in a bidding war to get the fugitives, The Will and The Stalk. The Stalk is a somewhat frightening-looking spider-like alien who carries weapons in all of her additional appendages, and The Will is humanoid, but has with him what might be one of my favorite characters EVER and that is the character of Lying Cat, who is a talking cat that can tell when someone is lying. Also characters in their own right are a legendary group of terrifying killers called The Horrors, which, like all characters in this book aren't quite what they seem.<br /><br />Alana is much more prone to using violent means to protect her husband and new baby, but Marko is hesitant, despite that he carries a sword chained inside its sheath that he has vowed never to unsheath. Prince Robot IV is less than pleased with the notion of having to track this fugitive couple down, feeling that it is beneath his aristocratic sensibilities. The Stalk and The Will obviously have a romantic/sexual past but both of them are fearsome, amoral killers, or as one might think, until The Will goes to the pleasure planet of Sextillion and his unethical code is put to the test.<br /><br />Vaughan's writing is as strong and natural as it's ever been, and he uses a great deal of English-Speaking slang, because... why not? Whatever language these different races might be speaking to each other is still going to be translated to our language, and Vaughan, if nothing else, is masterful at the art of language. Each issue moves along at an incredibly even pace, allowing for moments of great suspense and violence, but also allowing for great humor, character beats and texture to the worlds around them. If there is a science fiction-fantasy comic out there that is so adept at creating its own universe, I have yet to read it.<br /><br />Fiona Staples' art is an excellent balance of extreme detail to abstract lines and shading. It is exactly the feel that the book demands, and once again, Vaughan has found the perfect person to illustrate his work. Her amazeballs work is absolutely suited to this book and is absolutely one of those artists that demands following in this and other titles.<br /><br />The thing that this book may bring up for some people is an age-old argument about Art vs. Pornography. The book as a whole is certainly not for the kiddies, but it's hardly packed with sexual activity. However, there is a book in this collection that broaches that argument because it does take place on the planet of Sextillion and as The Will goes walking down its streets, there are several rather explicit sexual acts going on in the background. The general way of defining \\"pornography\\" is showing sexual acts that are designed to titillate or create a general state of sexual arousal. That is very much not the case here. This is not a comic that is somehow designed to sexually excite its readers, but I can imagine perhaps a less open-minded reader or someone who is new to reading mature-themed comics being a more than a little taken aback by some of those panels. But really, it's parsed down to no more than three or four panels. It's not gratuitous and it's not in your face, but it's there, so new readers may want to be aware. That's all I really wanted to say about that.<br /><br />When it all boils down to how this book is and how it makes you feel, it's an beautiful and massively entertaining book that keeps you invested in all of its characters, creates a incredibly rich universe for these characters to exist in, never fails to please the eye or the intellect, and really, like Hazel, SAGA is something of a small miracle.-fantasy comic out there that is so adept at creating its own universe, I have yet to read it.<br /><br />Fiona Staples' art is an excellent balance of extreme detail to abstract lines and shading.

B003BVK36Q|5.0|I have all of Le Carre's books in Penguin's colorful trade paperback format, a prized collection.  They're all the same SIZE, yet now with the latest release, \\"A Most Wanted Man\\" Penguin decides it needs to trim the size of the trade paperback format on this one, making it shorter and less wide.  What a bunch of lousy idiots!!!  Now my collection looks unsymmetrically lopsided on the bookshelf.  Nice going Penguin.  Which one of your top-level managers was responsible for this one?  Did he/she demonstrate a PowerPoint slideshow showing how much you save on paper costs???  How about the loss of revenue from people like me, did they have that on the presentation?  IF YOU WANT TO USE LESS PAPER JUST GO TO E-BOOK FORMAT, EVER HEAR OF KINDLE? HELLOOOO!!! Don't mess around with the paperback.

Highly recommended.

B005MMJ84K|4.0|I KNEW it!!!<br /><br />That's all I have to say about the ending of this book. In a good way. It's one of those endings that has you saying \\"No way!\\" while at the same time you were secretly hoping for it to happen the whole time.<br /><br />This second book in the series started off slow for me. In terms of plot, things move a little slowly in the first half while we find out what happened to Lena in the time after she escapes Portland. We learn more about the \\"Invalids\\" and how they live. There is more world-building. All of this is interesting and necessary but the book really gets going in the second half which has a lot more action.<br /><br />In terms of character, we see a lot of Lena's progression from soft, sheltered, whiny girl to hard, competent, strong and smart. She still has an emotional vulnerability that draws the reader in without being too angsty. I loved Julian! It was refreshing for me to see a male character who is vulnerable and emotional while still remaining masculine. He really became a favorite of mine.<br /><br />I started off thinking I was going to rate this about a 3 but after finishing I give this a solid 4 stars. I'm very much looking forward to the third book in the trilogy!

B008Y5OW20|2.0|22 years after his last solo album, and 11 years after the last ELO album... that's plenty of time to come up with original material, which none of it is present here. This is a covers record of songs known only to kids back int he 1950s and 60s, very few of which resonate today - and before I get hit with \\"lady kaka\\" comments - let me inform you I am a long time ELO and solo Lynne fan. Albums covering old songs are vanity projects. Paul McCartney released one not too long ago, to poor reviews (save for the shill input to boost sales). The production on these songs are Jeff Lynne quality - the standard Lynne produced sound of castrated drums and bass, as various Tom Petty, George Harrison and Traveling WIlbury albums have suffered. Just like Lennon's sub-standard and ill-fated \\"Rock And Roll\\" (1975), hopefully this will get Jeff Lynne back to composing decent tunes now that he's had THAT out of his system and taken care of for good. I hope we won;t have to wait long for the next ELO or solo album of original songs.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I loved this movie, even with multiple viewing the avengers never fail to impress. The avengers even took me back, making me feel like I was a kid all over again and watching my very first movie with characters that I had only seen in cartoons or comics.
B000005RXH|1.0|... as the music is not as good as you may want or wish it to be. It took another 2 or 3 albums before they got the message that the purpose of making records is to sell them, not to feed their egos. Incredibly enough, thought this album was released in 1971, the cover with the tattooed woman who would have been shocking at that time, barely gets noticed these days when anyone that looks at least 16 in this country can get their entire body permanently tattooed for the price of a good pair of speakers.

B004LWZW42|2.0|A lot of people seem to like this movie, so I guess that puts me in the minority who really don't like it. I didn't care for hardly any characters of the story, and I thought most of the mutants were kind of lame. I liked the idea of the film, going back and showing the origins and all, but it just didn't seem to pull it off all that well to me, I think the story could have been better. And I was also a little confused as to whether or not this was a REBOOT or a PREQUEL, they weren't clear enough in that regard, at least not in my opinion.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I could not put this book down.  A slow burner that will have you guessing the entire time.  Do not hesitate to buy this book - I promise you will not be disappointed.

B005LAIHYU|2.0|Most people I know who read the book loved the way the author seamlessly blended historical facts with fiction to make a really fun story. I could not put the book down.<br /><br />Not only did the movie leave out most of the back story that could help you understand why Abe was driven to hunt vampires, it reduced it to a large train explosion. I had a hard time believing the same author who wrote such an awesome book wrote this crummy screenplay. It even left out Abe's assassination and the twist at the end of the book.<br /><br />I love action movies and escapist entertainment as much as the next guy, but this movie really dumbed down a great story to something not really worth your time to watch.<br /><br />Read the book. It's way more fun.

B007S3S8HO|2.0|As indicated, this game is not for children under 3, and recommended for children 5 and older. My daughter is about 3 and a half.<br /><br />When I first opened the box I felt a sense of dread. I asked myself, why did I order this? They weren't kidding when they said not for children under 3; there's more tiny pieces than I wished to count (see bag image I uploaded in the photo section). In other words, setting this up was a chore. And one I found wasn't really worth the time.<br /><br />My wife, daughter, and I put most everything together--OK, so my daughter didn't really help, she was more of a distraction than anything. From the ramp to the vehicles, we got most everything set up. There are three pigs and two birds. The slingshot doesn't, well, slingshot. Instead, you put the bird between the two plastic clips and squeeze them as tight as you can--something my daughter wasn't strong enough to do (granted, she isn't the recommended age).<br /><br />The lego-like blocks do not hold together very well. Where this makes it easier for them to fall apart upon impact, it also makes getting them to stay in place a big pain. In the end, my daughter had more fun playing with the birds and pigs as if they were toys that came out of a Happy Meal.<br /><br />Overall, this is really nothing more than a novelty for Angry Birds fans. Your money is better spent elsewhere.
B00914JWSW|4.0|Seventy years old and still keeping us in her thrall!  She is a great lady and there is no one else even remotely in her sphere.  Adele, Lady GagGag, Rhianna...HA!  In 50 years they won't have touched Barbra's legacy.  My only slight disappointment on Release Me is her version of \\"Home,\\" which I think lacks the wonder and determination that is present in the Diana Ross version, which I love and which I believe might be DR's best recording.  Otherwise, I agree with all the praise others are paying to this great collection, and I too hope there's a RM2.
B0053O89WY|5.0|This is one of the best shows on TV in the last decade and it seems to just keep getting better.  The ordering and shipping was, as usual, a breeze.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I did not have any of the Harry Potter movies in my possession and was looking for a complete collection that didn't cost an arm and a leg, and this fit my qualifications perfectly. If you want \\"the\\" Harry Potter movie collection this isn't it, but if you're like me and just want the movies and aren't interested in any of the extras than this works just fine. All the DVDs are in one plastic case that seems fairly durable and which was stuck inside a cardboard sleeve that I went ahead and just tossed. I've watched four of the movies so far and haven't had any trouble getting them to play or any related problems of that nature. No problems with delivery or packaging either. All in all a big thumbs up.
B000HWZ4A2|1.0|There's much that is amusing -- all unintentionally -- about this movie.  The acting is particularly wooden, but given the dialogue that Ayn Rand wrote, it's difficult to see what options the performers had.<br /><br />  I have to say that the strangest scene revolves around Howard Roark's trial.  After all, his destruction of the buildings can only be described as an act of terrorism, and his defense of his actions reminds me how the Weather Underground described their use of violence in the 1970's.  And yet many in the Republican party have come to deify Ayn Rand and her ideas.  I never would have believed I would have lived long enough to see such a strange transformation.  All hail the revolution!
B003B02O14|5.0|This book is so intriguing from the first chapter. The hindsight John gives his character Patrick is so amazing that with each step Patrick takes, he is clearly the Puppet Master of the whole book. Mystery and intrigue are bursting at the seams! The detail the author goes into, and backsplashes to the past to explain a little something in a previous chapter is genius. A million questions come to mind with each revelation, and John Grisham answers those superbly, without question. This is definitely a mind-thriller at it's absolute best. If there were a 10 star rate system, this book would get 11! The Partner is my favorite of all the John Grisham books. A+++++ across the board!

B008AT71WI|5.0|I was lucky enough to nab one of the DVD's with the original ending that were quickly pulled from shelves many years ago.  If you've been unwilling to pay a premium for that rare disc, there is no longer any need to do so with this fantastic blu-ray release.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite musicals, as well as one of my favorite movies.  All of the performances are absolutely perfect here, from Rick Moranis' dorky character to Steve Martin's sadistically hilarious performance as a totally twisted dentist.  When the titles start on this show, you can now hear the music coming from all around you, and the picture is absolutely fantastic!!!!!  Of course, the music plays a vital role here, and it's nice to hear it digitally remastered and in full surround sound.  I really cranked up the volume when I watched this, and thoroughly enjoyed singing along with every song in the film.  The sound is not the only thing improved here.  The picture just sparkles and shines like a brand new car right off the showroom floor.  I've never seen the detail and colors that are now evident in high definition.  The puppetry of Audrey 2 is truly stunning, even in standard definition.  But in hi-def, I noticed little details in the plant that I had never seen before.  The colors are so vibrant as they contrast with the dull scenery of skid row.  Warner did a bang-up job getting this one ready for its hi-def premiere.<br /><br />There are also some good bonus features here too.  You get a great commentary from Frank Oz from the 97 release.  There are also two short features; One new one about the Director's Cut, and another about the Story of Little Shop of Horrors.  You finish out with some deleted scenes and theatrical trailers.....but hold on.....there's one MAJOR bonus with this blu-ray release.  YES!!!!  You guessed it......you finally get to see the entire original ending completed remastered and incorporated into a Director's Cut of the film.  Having owned the rare DVD release with the original ending as a bonus feature, I can tell you that this makes that title totally useless.  Now you have two completely different versions of the film, with the original ending seamlessly added back into the film.  The producers reworked the sound in order to make it blend in flawlessly with the hi-def sound of the original cut.  Once big difference about the original ending in the original DVD release and this Blu-ray is that in the DVD version, they were simply in the supplemental section in black and white.  While it was quite a treat to see that back in the day, that doesn't compare to the thrill of seeing it in high definition and full color.  I will not spoil it for those who are not familiar with the original ending, just know that it is two TOTALLY different endings.<br /><br />One other extra is the digibook.  It's your typical back story and trivia, with a really cool design.<br /><br />Little Shop of Horrors has always been on my list of titles that I would love to see on Blu-ray, and while it's been a long wait, let me tell you what you get is well worth the wait.

B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app. I'm not the best at it right now but I'm getting better. it is a lot of fun it is well worth the download.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This is another book that I picked up right before the movie came out and only picked it up because the movie looked like one I'd want to eventually see. It's the second time this year that I've done that (Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close was the first time), and it's the second time I've been well pleased and satisfied by a great book.<br /><br />I'd heard of the book before. Shortly after it came out, a coworker was reading it on her lunch break many years ago and laughing out loud.  I'm not sure why I never read it until now, but I'm certainly glad I did. Another friend says the book chooses you when it wants to be read, and if that's true then this book came at an opportune moment when I needed it most.<br /><br />You could say this book helps to define its generation. Stephen Chbosky, the author, tells the story of an introverted boy named Charlie about to enter high school.  He is quickly taken under the wing of two sibling seniors, Sam and Patrick, and accepted into their group of friends. Making mix-tapes for each other, reading good books, going to parties, first kisses, drinking and smoking, writing essays in English class, going to football games, riding around; the list goes on and on of the things that define a teenager's life and become important to them while an \\"adult\\" future seems so far away. Numerous songs and books are mentioned throughout the book (I was pleased to find a mix tape-like CD for the soundtrack to the movie) and whether you've heard them before or read them, you instantly connect to Charlie and start reminiscing of your own glory days.  I know I did.<br /><br />It's the way the story is shaped and told that makes it even more special.  The entire book is a series of letters that Charlie writes to an unnamed friend. Each is dated from 1990 through 1992 and starts out \\"Dear Friend,\\" and ends with \\"Love always, Charlie.\\"  So, you almost feel like you've found Charlie's letters in a trunk and you are spying on his past, or maybe you are the friend he wrote them to.  Either way, they are poetic and haunting at times, but always innocent and frequently humorous. The tone is very passive and friendly but through his words, we see Charlie worrying about his friend's love interests, discovering Patrick is gay, experimenting with drugs, taking up smoking, going to see and participating in the Rocky Horror Picture Show, breaking a girl's heart, getting his driver's license, and much more.<br /><br />As someone who prefers a deep absorbing book I easily suspended all expectations and accepted the lack of details. Charlie is a true teenage voice, filled with all the angst a kid at that age experiences.  I entered high school around that same time and experienced the same roller coaster of emotions Charlie found himself going through.  Charlie was someone I knew, and at times while reading, I was Charlie.<br /><br />While the book focuses mainly on Charlie's friendships with Sam and Patrick, we are introduced to an array of other characters that easily represent the typical stereotypes that define your peer group - the jock, the girl who talks too much, the hip guy that graduated last year who still throws parties for everyone, the cheating boyfriend, and so on. I also found myself underlining numerous heart-felt quotes in the text that I'm sure were and still are destined to be found in someone's high school graduation speech.<br /><br />While it is a book that has been frequently challenged for its mention of drug use, bullying, sexual identity, and so on, I think this is a book that is very true to real life. I know if I was a teacher, I'd want to see my students reading it.<br /><br />THE MOVIE:<br /><br />Concerning the film, I'm looking forward to seeing Emma Watson shine as Sam. Most will know her as Hermione from the Harry Potter series, but I have a feeling she will become known for much more as she matures as an actress. I could have easily seen Drew Berrymore in this role years ago. Ezra Miller (We Need To Talk About Kevin and Californication), while not known extremely well will surely do well as Patrick. And let's not forget the adorable Logan Lerman as Charlie. You'll recognize him as Percy Jackson from the 2010 film.  The three together look marvelous on the movie poster as a possibly new 80s-esque bratpack? Only time and film will tell.r (We Need To Talk About Kevin and Californication), while not known extremely well will surely do well as Patrick.

You can press the OK button to wake up camera.  that's why the camera's power assumption is so 'power-saving' which can last than what we have expected.  i wasn't going thru the manual in the beginning.

B008YWY0HK|4.0|What if you'd been told your whole life that you were destined for something you didn't want? Worse yet, something you hated with almost every fiber of your being. How far would you go to change it?<br /><br />  King Fergus and Queen Elinor (voiced by Billy Connolly and Emma Thompson, respectively) have four children. Their triplet sons Hubert, Harris, and Hamish, and there oldest, a daughter, named Merida (voiced by Kelly Macdonald). Before her brothers were born Merida (Macdonald) bore witness as a bear attacked her family and took her father's leg. Subsequent to the attack, Merida, much to her mother's dismay, has grown into a free spirit who rejects her mother's influence. This doesn't stop her mother from offering tips as to how a princess must behave on a near constant basis, however. And when Merida hears the ancient tale of a prince who broke off from his duty and caused his kingdom's downfall, she rejects it without a thought. So, even with her daughter's objections, the Queen holds a contest for the first-born sons of nearby allied clans. The winner will receive her daughter's hand. As the first-born of her clan, Merida competes and wins, causing a rift that is exacerbated when Merida destroys a tapestry and the Queen retaliates by throwing Merida's bow in the fire. Merida flees to the forest in anger and follows a will o' the wisp to a cabin. The old woman inside first insists that she is a wood carver but changes her tune once Merida offers a family amulet in trade for the witch's services. The witch gives Merida a cake and tells her that it will change her mother, leaving out a few minor details as to the nature of that change and telling her only that the spell becomes permanent after the second sunrise.<br /><br />  Kelly Macdonald is tragically underrated as an actress. I first saw her in Two Family House, an independent film released in 2000 and then in the 2005 BBC film The Girl in the Caf&eacute;. She had some recent success thanks to Boardwalk Empire, but nowhere near what she deserves, in my opinion. She does a great job as Merida, and I feel similarly about the job Connolly does voicing King Fergus. Thompson does well, but the role doesn't have anywhere near the same number of lines, for obvious reasons. The story is highly entertaining, as is the music. I will say that the ultimate consequence of the main character's actions leave a little something to be desired. Still, a great time.but nowhere near what she deserves, in my opinion.

B005LAII62|4.0|Did you fit in growing up? Did you have lots of friends, play sports, and go to parties? What about seeing dead people? Did you do that? Probably not. Norman Babcock, on the other hand, sees and speaks to dead people all the time.<br /><br />  Babcock (voiced by Kodi Smit-McPhee) is an outcast at school and an embarrassment to his family, thanks largely to his \\"gift\\". Norman's father Perry (voiced by Jeff Garlin) doesn't believe Norman is talking to anyone and makes no effort to explore the possibility that he's wrong. Norman's mother, Sandra (voiced by Leslie Mann) is more tolerant but, by no means, a believer. Courtney, Norman's older sister (voiced by Anna Kendrick) is a cheerleader who thinks Norman's a freak and has very few thoughts on any meaningful subjects. The only companions our main character has are his deceased grandmother (voiced by Elaine Stritch), other ghosts in town and a fellow student named Neil (voice by Tucker Albrizzi) who is bullied because, among other things, he is overweight. The town they all live in is named Blithe Hollow and it is best known for its execution of a witch 300 years ago. While rehearsing a play on the subject, Norman has a vision of the past and being pursued by an angry mob. Not long after that, Norman and Neil are confronted by Norman's estranged uncle, Mr. Penderghast, (voiced by John Goodman) who tells them that they must perform a ritual that evening to prevent the dead rising from the gave that evening.<br /><br />  I enjoyed this movie a lot more than I expected to. Yes, the notion of a child who can \\"see dead people\\" is right out of The Sixth Sense but that's where the similarities end. Norman accepts his abilities, in spite of the scorn he receives as a result. Another difference between Norman and the character portrayed by Haley Joel Osment is that Norman is a very optimistic, upbeat; individual who just doesn't have any friends. The supporting cast is chock-full of talented people who add to the story. If you haven't seen this movie yet, and judging from the box office you haven't, please do.haven't seen this movie yet, and judging from the box office you haven't, please do.

B008WCP2PG|4.0|You have women screaming for you every night; you make great money, and have the time of your life every night. But there is a clock on your career and it's running out. What do you do?<br /><br />  Mike Lane (played by Channing Tatum) is a part-time roof tiler, aspiring furniture designer, and auto customizer. While working a roofing job, he meets Adam (played by Alex Pettyfer). Adam lost a football scholarship after fighting with his coach and was forced to move in with his sister Brooke (played by Cody Horn). Then, at the end of his first day as a roofer, his boss fires him for taking too many sodas from the company cooler. On top of that, Adam (Pettyfer) can't get his car started and so Mike gives him a ride home. In return, Mike asks Adam for a favor and Adam learns how Mike spends his evenings. By day, he works construction and by night he is Magic Mike, a male exotic dancer at Xquisite. Other dancers at Xquisite include Ken (played by Matt Bomer), Tarzan (played by Kevin Nash), Tito (played by Adam Rodriguez), and Richie (played by Joe Manganiello). Shocked at first, Adam (Pettyfer) begins working at Xquisite after being hired by the manager Dallas (played by Matthew McConaughey). During this time, Mike applies for a loan to start his furniture business, is rejected, and maintains a friendship with benefits with a fellow dancer named Joanna (played by Olivia Munn). Meanwhile, Brooke (Horn) worries about her brother's descent into a life filled with drugs, booze, and one-night stands.<br /><br />  Now, as a man, it's clear I am not part of this film's target demographic. Also, Horn and Pettyfer are almost completely unknown to me. Horn appeared in one episode of the USA series White Collar which I know I've seen, because I've seen all of them, and Pettyfer was the lead actor in a terrible sci-fi movie titled I Am Number Four. Very entertaining film, as Soderbergh films typically are.

B004LWZWGA|4.0|You sacrifice your name, your body, the love of your life to achieve one goal. You achieved it, but someone later puts those achievements at risk. What do you do? Come out of hiding or run?<br /><br />  Bruce Wayne (played by Christian Bale) has abandoned the cape and mask so that Batman could never be arrested and prosecuted for the crimes committed by Harvey Dent that he took the fall for. He's been living like a recluse for eight years while Commissioner James Gordon (played by Gary Oldman) has all but extinguished violent crime in Gotham. Gordon wants to reveal the truth during a celebration honoring Harvey Dent but decides the city isn't ready for it. At that same celebration, a congressman is abducted and, while investigating the crime, Gordon is shot. The patrolman who rescues him, John Blake (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is promoted to detective and told he's to report directly the Commissioner. Blake (Gordon-Levitt) knows Batman's true identity and pleads with Wayne to once again don the cape and mask. Commissioner Gordon echoes those sentiments when Wayne, incognito, visits him in the hospital. The kidnapper, a terrorist and mercenary intent on destroying the city, is Bane. Bane (played by Tom Hardy) was once a member of the League of Shadows before being expelled by his and Bruce Wayne's mentor, Ra's al Ghul. Bane was hired by a competitor of Wayne Enterprises, John Daggett (played by Ben Mendelsohn). We're also introduced to a master thief working with Bane, Selina Kyle (played by Anne Hathaway) who is, of course, Catwoman, though she's never addressed by that name.<br /><br />  I was a latecomer to Nolan's new take on the Batman story. I saw The Dark Knight in theaters, but I didn't catch Batman Begins, the first film in the series, until it began airing on cable. Once I did, I bought the DVD. I bought The Dark Knight on DVD the day of its release. Bale as Batman was amazing in the first two films and he is just as good, if not better, in the third. Hardy as Bane is nowhere near as mesmerizing as Heath Ledger's interpretation of The Joker, but he is far more intimidating. Hathaway as Catwoman is the best version of this character that I have seen to date. Of course, the other versions, portrayed by Michelle Pfeiffer and Halle Berry, were beautiful but one-dimensional. I was hoping this film would be better than its predecessor. Perhaps it's the notion that this means the story is over, but I thought The Dark Knight was the best in the series. That said, Rises is brilliant and anyone who's seen the previous films should see this latest one as soon as possible.Hardy as Bane is nowhere near as mesmerizing as Heath Ledger's interpretation of The Joker, but he is far more intimidating.

B005LAII94|3.0|Can two men share a woman and stay friends? Can a small, independent group of marijuana dealers take on a Mexican cartel? Has Oliver Stone lost his touch?<br /><br />  We are given a brief history of two of the lead characters, Ben and Chon (played by Aaron Johnson and Taylor Kitsch) by their girlfriend and the film's narrator O (short for Ophelia, played by Blake Lively). Ben (Johnson) is a college graduate who majored in business and botany. Chon (Kitsch) is a veteran who returned from Afghanistan with the seeds that became an extremely potent form of marijuana and the foundation of their successful business. Ben contributes a great deal of his income to worthy causes and travels extensively. While he's away, O and Chon receive a video containing numerous severed heads and chainsaw. They fear Ben has been killed until he returns home a short time later. They had a scheduled meeting with the cartel and so, they go ahead with it. The cartel representatives propose that Ben and Chon join their organization, but rather than consider their offer, they say they take the time they've been given to consider it and make plans to flee the country. A DEA agent named Dennis (played by John Travolta) tells them that the partnership is the best option. They disagree but, before they can leave the country, O is kidnapped. Ben and Chon hear this directly from Elena Sanchez, the leader of the cartel who ordered it. Elena (played by Salma Hayek) tells the two men that she intends to hold O hostage until they honor the terms of their agreement. During that time, she's held prisoner amid miserable surroundings and guarded by a cartel henchman who goes by Lado (played by Benicio del Toro).<br /><br />  Now, regardless of what anyone might say about its historical accuracy, or lack thereof, I greatly enjoyed JFK. Same goes for Wall Street, Nixon, The Doors and Born on the Fourth of July. I thought Any Given Sunday was alright, but nowhere near as good as the others I've mentioned. I don't know if this movie's failure is something to be blamed on Stone, the actors or the source material, but the story didn't really go anywhere and the characters were completely unrealistic. I'm not saying I won't watch it again, but I certainly won't pay for the opportunity.n't know if this movie's failure is something to be blamed on Stone, the actors or the source material, but the story didn't really go anywhere and the characters were completely unrealistic.

0385742886|2.0|WARNING: Some spoilers here from the trilogy and a few details from this book too:<br /><br />Just read The Kill Order and I totally agree that the violence/fighting was a bit over the top.  I've read other reviews that call it \\"real\\" and \\"honest\\" but, I struggle to understand the \\"real and honest\\" physiology that enables an under-nourished kid and old man on the brink of exhaustion to keep fighting and functioning the way Mark and Alec do after they get their behinds kicked all over the place time and time again.  I think I'd probably be dead after fight number one.  That said, I've never been in a fight so, I guess I don't know.  Maybe I would keep going like a zombified Energizer bunny after having my vital organs crushed by repeated punches and kicks, my limbs smashed in doors and pulled out of socket after hanging on to an aircraft in mid flight, and my head consistently bashed in by pieces of metal and other blunt objects. I have a student who missed three days of school because he got a concussion heading a soccer ball.  He still can't look at a computer screen nevermind get into an all out death match fight with a gaggle of cranked out zombies.  He would never survive in dystopia.<br /><br />My having never been in a physical altercation of any kind had another downside as I read The Kill Order.  I had a super hard time visualizing what was happening in the fight scenes.  I couldn't always figure out whose fist was hitting what and which body parts were swinging around to where.  There was one scene where someone hit Mark who I was sure had already been killed.  It was all pretty much a gory, violent blur that I skimmed through until I got to the part where someone died, passed out, or ran away.<br /><br />***POSSIBLE SPOILERS FROM HERE ON***<br />I was also left really unsatisfied with the account of what happened in the year after the flare; I wanted more details about how they made it to Ashville and what everyone elses' story was.  How did so many peoplesurvive and how did they make it to the camps?  The Thomas and Teresa part seemed confusing too.  Why did Dashner bother including the tidbits he did about them (assuming that's who the epilogue was about . . .)  I have a theory about who Deedee is but, then again who cares if we don't get a sequel/prequel to Kill Order.<br /><br />And lastly, I guess I am just a little confused about the Kill Order itself.  Why did the Post Flare Coalition decide it was necessary?  It seemed to me like folks were just sort of plugging along in small settlements, eating food they found in old factories, hunting, keeping cool in the shade and mud huts or whatever.  Were there really soooo many people in those little settlements being self-reliant and not bothering anyone else that Earth's resources were being depleted?  By the sounds of it, New York City was pretty well wiped out.  That's like 10 million people GONE right there!  Where are all of these resource depleters and what resources were they depleting?  I didn't even realize any of the settlements knew about the other settlements near-by.  Why didn't they have socials or dances with each other or something fun!?  Dashner made it sound like Mark's peeps were there all alone, but according to the Post Flare folks, there were tons of settlements all over Appalachia and the world?!  I'm just not sure I buy that . . .<br /><br />All in all, I liked The Maze Runner and The Scorch Trials ok.  I tolerated the Death Cure because it was the last in the series and I was totally underwhelmed there.  I probably just should have moved right on past this one but, it just looked so good and I really did wonder about WICKED and was always confused about what the pre-teen darlings T & T actually did before they got old and went into the maze.  But Kill Order was sort of lame.  If you love gore and fight scenes, enjoy obsessing about what supplies you may want to stock up on or skills you'd like to hone before the apocalypse, or if you're a gambler and are betting that Dashner is going to write a pre-prequel or sequel prequel or whatever and actually answer some of the questions you had after reading the Maze Runner books or answer all of the new ones that popped up after Kill Order, than this book's for you.
B005QYKE2Y|1.0|I wasn't expecting this to be a great movie, but figured it would be a fun enough way to zone out for a while. Wow was it ever worse than I thought it could be! Full of \\"clever\\" one-liners, bad characters (both humans and robots... really? There's an old British autobot named \\"Q\\" who designs fancy gadgets and weapons?), and action that was at times fun, but for the most part incredibly drawn out and ultimately just boring. Basically this was 2.5 hours (and it feels like 4) of unpleasantly spent time.
0345536886|4.0|A great novel by an accomplished author.  I love the premise of the guy who says \\"enough is enough\\" and leaves his soul-destroying existence for something better, something more satisfying. Legal jargon is quickly explained in terms that those of us without a legal degree can understand easily. The two main cases in the book are both deserving of sympathy while the book takes a great swipe at the shadier end of the legal fraternity and the big firms looking to make money without having done their due diligence in search of a quick buck (or a few million the them).

0345803493|3.0|Okay, I admit it, I read Book Two after being doubtful about Book One in the series.  Sadly, it didn't change my thoughts.  The best part about the book is the emails - some are quite witty, but for the main part, it is poorly written, predictable and the sex becomes monotonous.  The reader is supposed to be thrilled and turned on - every women's fantasy!  Er, I don't think so.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I could spend hours on this app if I didn't have other responsibilities! I have found many useful tips, recipes, craft and wardrobe ideas that I use often. It's definetly my go to place when I need something. Thank you Pinterest!
0345803507|3.0|Okay, so after not being impressed with the first two books, I admit I read the last in the series too. (In my defence, most of the books I read are series).<br /><br />Book Three has nothing new to offer; it's just that SM B&D wasn't \\"out there\\" much before (other than to those who specifically read erotica).  This series has put \\"kinky\\" sex into the mainstream and it has created a lot of hype - a storm in a teacup.<br /><br />It's not great reading, it doesn't have a wonderful plot snd it's monotonous and boring in places - yet I read all three books in the series!  Mmm, there might be a little something of \\"value\\" (written in HUGE inverted commas)there somewhere.
0761169253|5.0|I have love for this little manual of creativity. So much of it is very obvious yet the best stuff usually is, especially when a smart writer explains.
1455519006|4.0|A great read with interesting characters, fast-paced action and natural dialogue.  It's a work of fiction, so there's no need to get into a debate about now believable it is and it's not 1000 pages long so the author doesn't have the \\"space\\" to create in-depth multi-dimensional characters, but the result is an easy to read action thriller (with an ending that's not too difficult to work out).  Definitely worth the time it takes to read it.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Didn't want this book to end!  Morton's one of my favorite authors (second only to Carol Goodman) and her latest certainly didn't disappoint - love story, mystery - all wonderfully written!  Now when does her next one come out :)
0345803485|3.0|Sorry, I don't get what all the fuss and excitement is about.  Lots of people have alternative lifestyles and the erotica in this series is mild and fairly boring after a while.  The main male character is SO unbelievable!!  He is supposed to elicit your sympathy because he was a neglected and abused child.  But then, at a very tender age, he gets adopted by an uber-wealthy and loving family who give him every advantage in life (oh, don't forget the sex lessons from the cougar when he's a teen - that's also supposed to make you feel sorry for him).  He can fly helicopters, play the piano like a pro, runs a billion-dollar business, has the sexual prowess that puts any super-stud to shame, all manner of contacts and resources and he's just 26!  If the main character had been a middle-aged, balding, slightly over-weight plumber, this book would have been labelled \\"disgusting and perverted\\".<br /><br />It's the assumption that youth, good looks and tons and tons of money makes anything acceptable that is the basis of the excitement over this series. SM B&D has been going for generations, it's nothing new, so get over it already.
0446580848|5.0|John Corey NYPD retired and Kate Mayfield FBI have more in common that marriage, they work together for the multi-departmental, Federal Anti-Terrorist Task Force. They've been through a lot together and fighting terrorists is nothing new. A past threat has risen, an American born jihadist and al-Qaeda top guy known as The Panther. He's the suspected mastermind of the USS Cole bombing plus any number of atrocities against innocent victims and men-at-arms in the name of radical Islam. Kate and John are offered an assignment to go to Yemen and apprehend this monster and being on the al-Qaeda kill list, because of their killing the terrorist known as The Lion, makes them great bait to use to lure The Panther into a trap. In Yemen they are paired with associates from various lettered agencies to help get the job done. There are many dangers in the Yemeni desert, John and Kate hope to be able to count on their partners in arms and that the only homegrown threat comes from The Panther and not from the one lettered agency that they have a troubled past with, the CIA.<br /><br />Nelson DeMille delivers an explosive new novel staring our old friends John Corey and Kate Mayfield with an added bonus of Paul Brenner from \\"Up Country\\" &\\" The General's Daughter\\" novels. This is one of his best Corey and Mayfield novels. His fast paced, action filled story takes place in the near past, the country is still reeling from 9/11, the citizens are still flying flags and the terrorists are just getting infamous. My heart rate tripled as he took me deep into enemy territory and I, like our heroes wondered whom I could trust and who to doubt. It's not just his story-line that get's A pluses, his characters are unforgettable both the good and the bad. As far as his stars go, Kate is the true professional and a real hero of mine and as for John, well in a recent interview I did with Mr. DeMille he said \\"The male readers enjoyed John Corey's sarcasm, cynicism, and offbeat humor, and the female readers loved John Corey for reasons that I can only guess at.\\" Well I'll answer that question personally, John Corey is this married woman's worst nightmare and fondest desire in one all male package, he's my husband every time he's embarrassed me in public but who's honesty, and loyalty are my dream come true. And Kate is his true match in every way, quip for quip and glib for glib but all done in a love that comes across to me as very authentic.<br />If you're looking for a read after heart surgery, you may want to wait until you're stronger. But if it's non-stop, pulse-pounding from page one to the end action you're looking for, if you need a hero to look up to, or an evil doer that's par-none and worth every one of it's 640 pages. Then it's \\"The Panther\\" that you want to make your next Must Read.<br />Mr. DeMille thank you for this incredible journey, I'll have my bags packed and ready to go in time for the next one.readers loved John Corey for reasons that I can only guess at.\\" Well I'll answer that question personally, John Corey is this married woman's worst nightmare and fondest desire in one all male package, he's my husband every time he's embarrassed me in public but who's honesty, and loyalty are my dream come true.

0446580848|1.0|This is a first person narrative by someone who thinks they are funny with a continuous litany of lame jokes.  This is OK for awhile but gets to be annoying and boring in short order.  Have you ever spent time with someone who thinks they are really funny and can't stop with the stupid jokes which they laugh at themselves?  If you enjoyed that, you will love this book.
B007PVHMCG|3.0|I was shocked when I received this item at how miniscule it was.  If you paid more than the $34.99 retail price you would be very very disappointed. This is probably worth about $20.00, but the Minecraft Hype has driven the price up.  I purchased 2 because it was the \\"have to have\\" present for my grandsons, but don't feel I got my money's worth
8877546468|5.0|There is really no point in my leaving an extensive review about the content of the book; I will address the edition itself. The text was a little small, but very readable. The binding was tight. However, the pages are the type to yellow after a while (the paper isn't the best quality). It's still a very sturdy and well-made edition (Dover).

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I just returned this book to Amazon Kindle, unable to tolerate it for another moment. It's hackneyed, the characters are obnoxious, and I found myself shaking- upset with the female protagonist for being so stupid that she would willingly set herself up into a situation with an abuser, thinking it's \\"hot\\"... but then all her relationships were based upon passive-aggression.<br /><br />There's a huge difference between consensual D/s play and dangerous sociopathology, and this author is unaware of it.
B0042816YK|1.0|I've read some excellent spot-on 1-star reviews here of \\"Eat Pray Love\\" that I couldn't really improve upon. The shallow, self-centered Julia Roberts character certainly deserves all the vitriol and criticism thrown her way in these reviews and I'm happy to see many are women. The sad thing is, this type of self-entitled solipsistic person really does exist. Don't think so? For a dose of grim reality, just read some of the 5-star reviews in which Roberts' character is seen as inspiring. What a sad existence it must be which leads one to see this character as a role model.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|This book is very well written and easy to understand. The author does a nice job of summarizing the primary literature in a way that retains the details, but does not get overwhelming. I would recommend this book for those interested in what influences learning and success as well as for parents who are trying to help their kids succeed.

B007THA4FI|4.0|JK Rowling has mastered another literary genre in \\"The Casual Vacancy.\\"  She provides the reader with a powerful and compelling look at poverty, class structure and small town life in modern day Britain.  Her story combines drama, social commentary, dark humour and ultimately a message of optimism about the human condition presented through a cast of fascinating, flawed, complex characters whose lives are entwined in the web of English village life.

0446619078|4.0|The Last Coyote is more focused on Bosch' mental health than the previous novels. He spends quite a bit of time on the psychiatrist's \\"couch\\". The reader learns more about him and yet it slows down the action some. However the thriller is a good one. Bosch investigates the murder of his own mother and uncovers many nasty connections he is eager to expose. There is a minor romantic interest that seems contrived but overall this is a fine thriller.

0738212415|5.0|Even my stick men drawings were pitiful before I started reading this book. I couldn't do anything, and just believed that I hadn't been born with the talent to draw. I bought this book because I want to learn to draw light comics, though I wasn't too optimistic with my expectations.<br /><br />The first few lessons weren't that exciting, but the author's enthusiasm is such that I kept plugging. It didn't take long to see that every lesson built on the one before, and suddenly I saw strange things happening. My hands knew how to sketch out lines. I was learning these little pencil strokes and pencil angles to draw shading. And the exercises were becoming more fun because I got to see something on the paper that didn't look like broken stick figures.<br /><br />I have been finding myself drawing for fun during meetings, doodling while watching TV, and looking forward to the next exercise every day. My daughter took one of my drawings and insisted on putting it on the refrigerator. A friend at work saw one of my drawings and told me it looked professional. This book really works, and I'm very grateful to the author.<br /><br />At this point, my expectations have grown. I'm not just going to learn to doodle out comics. I'm going to learn to draw anything I want to draw.

And YES, you too will be cheering at the final battle scene.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great lead up to this movie with the hulk, Iron Man, Captain America and Thor.<br />I suggest watching all those before watching this; especially Captain America as it contains the same energy source cube.<br />My all time favorite super hero movie is Superman with Christopher Reeves but the way this all came to a head made this another great in the genre; one of the best.<br />The Blu-Ray looks great, 3D was not too exagerated but added a nice depth to the picture.<br />After seeing this I think we can all guess there will be a part 2, if it wasn't already mentioned, I don't pay attention to media.<br />Bought this for $19.99 and it was a great price.

B009FOBMBI|5.0|Awesome. That just about sums it up for me. I started listening to 3DG with their last release and quickly came to appreciate all their previous work. I was really looking forward to the new release, and it had not disappointed me. Some new experimentation with sound and style, but nothing shocking that takes away from the experience of what a good 3DG release should be. Buy it.

0812550706|5.0|I am not going to write a very lengthy review, but wanted to add another positive note.  I was recommended this novel based on my love of a few things:  the novels of Ray Bradbury, dystopian novels and films, Star Trek, and Battle Royale (the Japanese novel).  I hesitated for a few years because of the Last Starfighter looking cover and the 6-12 year old protagonist.  I admit I was judging the book by its cover.  But finally too many folks told me to read it, so I did, and I am very happy that I did.<br /><br />In this innovate work of science fiction, Ender, a young boy called a '3rd' (because he is the 3rd child born to the couple despite the limit of 2 children) is taken in by the military to be trained as a soldier from a young age.  Early on the reader discovers that Ender is special, and that a nameless narrator of sorts speaks of grand plans for the boy.  We follow Ender through his years of training and the 'games' he must continually take part in as part of his training.<br /><br />There are a few things that make this novel a breakthrough and relevant even today.  The fact that this 1977 novel was published the same year as Star Wars is pretty amazing.  In the novel folks use the 'nets' quite a bit.  The author even makes references to people creating online accounts and changing their personality profiles to hide their identities and such.  Pretty amazing for a 70s novel!  Like Bradbury with his earlier version of Facebook (seriously, read Fahrenheit 451 and pay attention to Guy's wife!), Orson Scott Card had a somewhat reasonable view of the future, albeit with space travel and aliens.  But the virtual reality games and other little additions are intriguing and enjoyable to read about.<br /><br />Despite some obvious 'childlike' moments such as people calling each other 'fart eaters', the book has a more adult style that I found appealing.  I could really imagine the book originally being targeted to the teenage to 20 something crowd.  But the depth of the writing, the engaging characters, and the complex themes are appealing even to someone older.  It's not on the same level as, say, 1984 or Brave New World, but this is one of the standouts of science fiction.  I do prefer the style of Philip K Dick to that of Orson Scott Card, but once I'm done with Dick's works, I plan on spending a little more time with Card's other works.he writing, the engaging characters, and the complex themes are appealing even to someone older.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Compelling and wonderfully written! i would recommend this to anyone. very descriptive and personal. please read this book! just amazing
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I still liked the book--hence the 4 stars--but I wish the story would've been developed more. It seemed like it was in a rush to finish, and there should have been some more detail about how everything was resolved. Still a good purchase though and a great series.
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|A sensational and suspenseful book, technologically up to date for the 21st Century.<br />Once started, there is no way you could put it down before the end, it is well written (and well translated from Swedish), and as gripping a story as I have ever read.<br />Note though that it is the second book in a trilogy, one would be well advised to read \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" first, although it is readable as a stand-alone book. And I am sure one would then eagerly read the third book too.
B0096DFBZQ|2.0|Well first of all it takes up quite a bit of space on a kf. I want the kf hd! but its such a stupid app! acceleration is horrid!

0451232852|5.0|FALL OF GIANTS is a masterful historical novel of the early years of the Twentieth century from the build up to World War One through the Russian Revolution to the women's suffrage movement in England. The book follows several families across several continents, the Dewars in the U.S., the Fitzherberts in England, the Von Ulrichs in Germany, the Peshkovs in Russia, and the Williamses in Wales. Follett does a terrific job of keeping the plot moving and intertwining the lives of the main characters. It is intended to be the first of a trilogy covering the century.<br /><br />The touches of history were fascinating, and I especially enjoyed the scenes showing the madness of warfare during the Great War. Near the conclusion of the novel, the mention of Adolph Hitler, foreshadowing the next book, was well done. The theme, encapsulated in the title, of the fall of the Tsars and of the ruling elite in England and the rise of the working classes was engaging.<br /><br />Mr. Follett is a top-notch thriller writer, but I feel these historicals are his strong point. To me THE PILLARS OF THE EARTH is one of the best novels I have ever read. It was so good that I was hesitant to read its sequel, WORLD WITHOUT END, because I feared he could never come near it. In truth, I was disappointed in the sequel, but only in comparing it to PILLARS. How could I expect him to repeat a masterpiece? For the same reason I was hesitant to tackle FALL OF GIANTS.<br /><br />But Mr. Follett has produced another winner; well-researched and well-written. The characters are well drawn and engaging.<br /><br />But let me be clear. This novel is not a thriller nor is it meant to be. But as a historical saga, heavy on the history, it is excellent.
B007THA4FI|4.0|A very enjoyable read. I enjoyed how each character was woven into the plot as they interacted and influenced each other. Very reminicent of Maeve Binchy.

B0092SPYQG|5.0|Definitely in the top 2 of my favorite albums from Papa Roach!!! The songs are very relatable in life. Personally, \\"Give Me Back My Life\\" is my fav song. All around great music!
0316228532|5.0|Most of the negative reviews complain of a lack of story line / plot.  I agree: there really is no \\"plot.\\"  However, that said, this is an excellent read-it is absorbing, entertaining and contains fantastic dialogue and character development.  Congratulations to J.K. Rowling on a work well done!
0060775858|4.0|I've read both the negative and positive reviews about this book.  For those who do not like this book, I understand why because I too did not like it at first.  I received it as a baby shower gift, and wasn't sure why the person who gave it to me raved about it so much.  I thought the illustration is, for lack of a better word, \\"ugly\\".  I also didn't like the black and white pages in between.  When I first read it to my 3 month old daughter, I thought the book sounded so odd, and the wording did not make any sense.  I put the book away, thinking perhaps my daughter will enjoy it at a later age.<br /><br />When she was 11 months, I gave the book another try.  To my surprise, she paid attention and sat very still on my lap.  I started reading it to her every night after that.  The more I read it, the more I learn how to read it \\"creatively\\".  I read the book to her with different tones and at different paces, switching between slow and fast and soft and animated depending on the line.  She is now almost 1 years old, and she's starting to reach out to touch the different objects in the book.  Sometimes when she's fussy, I'll just recite the first couple of pages from memmory and she'll immediately SMILE!<br /><br />Overall, I wouldn't recommend the book for a small baby.  Also, the book takes a little getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes magical.
B008GVD6D8|3.0|I was slightly disappointed by this book - I was so hooked by the first book and this one dragged and was no where as interesting. He ignores her for half the book?! I found that very frustrating.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great book. Couldn't stop reading it. The ending drove me nuts. I hate it when authors do things like that. All though I secretly love it.
B008P76UKE|5.0|The music has been covered by reviewers better versed in critiqueing Wagner than me, I am a casual classical listener and love showpieces. This is a reference quality bluray audio and video recording, more amazing that it was recorded 12 years ago. This disk has given me a greater appreciation of Wagner, Maazel the BP orchestra and this piece than ANY other classical music I have purchased for one big reason, I can see which instrument(s) are playing to make the music I am hearing. Highly recommended. This is the best $9 I have EVER spent on clasical music.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire was a good, quick read. I enjoyed the story just about as much as the first book. I would recommend the series to anyone... even my grandparents.
B000J103WK|5.0|Not only is this a great show but the HD DVD version has a phenomenal lossless audio track (NOT indicated on the box, but my receiver says so) and the video is stunning. If you still watch HD-DVD disks, this is a reference disk. I bought a 2nd disk for a backup. Still no bluray available.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Before reading this book someone told me it was similar to The Help.  I found it very different.  This is an interesting and informative book and one feels the emotional bond that exists with the characters.  I think it is historically accurate and the subject matter presented fairly and in interesting manner.
019959533X|5.0|ONCE MORE UNTO THE QUANTUM-<br />FOR THE TENTH TIME!<br />THE JSB GUIDELINES UPDATED FOR INFLATION<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />When this excellent work first appeared in 1992, Lord Donaldson wrote that there could be no doubt about the practical value of this slim volume... and how right he was as we now celebrate the tenth edition which has been updated to take account of inflation and judicial decisions.<br /><br />The guidelines have become essential for practitioners and now we would not dream of advising on a personal injury matter without referring to the JSB Guidelines first as we will certainly see this book in court each time we argue quantum and be expected to know its worth to the bench.<br /><br />The guidelines are always well received, and they have a clear and well received influence on the judiciary, too, today.  The hard work of Colin Mackay and his team explains the current need for this book as a record of the levels of awards and settlements which we use as a starting point for our advocacy in court<br /><br />Updates are always difficult but we believe the team continues to maintain the level of consistency needed for the making of awards which serve the interests of justice as well as any person can. Lord Neuberger MR, in his Foreword, welcomes the work as `ever more authoritative'. He also rightly highlights its usefulness from the comments the book's readers have made together with all the different areas where reports are to be found which does make the working party's job so difficult.<br /><br />This is not, however, a `ready reckoner' but, as Mackay has said, it distils the conventional wisdom contained in the reported cases, and supplements it from the collective experience of his working party, presenting the result in a convenient, logical and coherent form.<br /><br />The work is now widely and more frequently adopted as the starting point in negotiating levels of payment for general damages in personal injury cases. Contents cover the following: Injuries Involving Paralysis; Head Injuries; Psychiatric Damage; Injuries Affecting the Senses; Injuries to Internal Organs; Orthopaedic Injuries; Facial Injuries; Scarring to Other Parts of the Body; Damage to Hair; Dermatitis and a useful index.<br /><br />The publishers send copies of these guidelines to all hearing PI cases, and it is an indispensible tool for all legal professionals involved in PI litigation, from lawyers to insurance companies, trades unions and medical defence organisations.<br /><br />Today, we cannot be without our copy of the JSB guidelines for quantum advocacy, and we know the clients appreciate the user-friendly wisdom they give- just make sure you have the red cover and not the grey cover for 2010!

B000JMKTLO|5.0|This book blew my mind! I read Gone Girl and I figured this book might be just as good.<br />I was wrong, it's better! It is a bit shocking at points, and that's exactly what I needed was a little suprise. I'm about to start Dark Places and I hope its even better:)
B008GVD6D8|5.0|I got this book on the Tuesday night Australian time and started it first thing Wednesday.  Could not put it down till I finished it Saturday morning.

1439152802|5.0|Kate Morton's \\"The Secret Keeper\\" takes place in London in the 1940's, rural England during the early sixties, and Suffolk in 2011. At the heart of this complex work is a shocking event witnessed by sixteen-year old Laurel Nicolson. Should she reveal what she saw or remain silent? If she decides to tell the authorities the truth, the consequences could be devastating.<br /><br />Fifty years pass. Laurel, who has had a successful acting career, takes a break from her busy schedule to join her siblings at the bedside of their ailing mother. It is a time not only of joy (the three sisters reminisce about their happy childhood), but also of unspeakable sadness. Dorothy Nicolson is dying, and as she lies in her hospital bed, bits and pieces from her early life come back to haunt her. Laurel, who senses that her mother has hidden important facts about her past from her family, embarks on a mission to learn the truth. What she discovers will shed new light on the personality of a good-hearted wife and mother who cared for her husband and children with tenderness and devotion.<br /><br />The flashbacks to forties London are spellbinding. Dorothy Smithson, nicknamed Dolly, is an orphan who is obsessed with attaining a lovely home, nice clothing, and social status. She has a handsome but impoverished boyfriend named Jimmy. In addition, Dolly meets Vivien Jenkins, a wealthy married woman who appears to have it all. Dorothy's envy, Jimmy's adoration and loyalty, Vivien's hidden demons, and German bombers during the Blitz will help determine the fate of these three people.<br /><br />The author's gorgeous descriptive writing and meticulous character development draw us into a world far different from our own. In 1940s London, citizens used ration cards to purchase groceries, listened for air raid sirens to warn of impending attacks, and wondered if they would survive the war. They longed for a future free of bomb blasts, anti-aircraft fire, and perpetual fear. Meanwhile, Dolly, Jimmy, Vivien, and her husband, Henry, are on a collision course, their fates intertwined.<br /><br />At times, the novel is sluggishly paced and the conclusion is weakened by contrived elements that strain credulity. Still, readers will find much to like in this heartfelt exploration of love, loss, and redemption, set against the backdrop of a country in turmoil. Morton's startling revelations in the book's final pages force us to reconsider everything we thought we knew about Dorothy and Vivien. \\"The Secret Keeper\\" casts an undeniable spell and Morton's central theme is one that we would all be wise to embrace: \\"Don't wait too long to realize what's important.\\" (Four and a half stars rounded up to five.)Jimmy, Vivien, and her husband, Henry, are on a collision course, their fates intertwined.<br /><br />At times, the novel is sluggishly paced and the conclusion is weakened by contrived elements that strain credulity.

B0098VYCCE|2.0|I bought the DVD version, and I wished I'd used my money on something else. They took all the best bits to create the trailer, and that made the movie look like it was going to rock. It didn't. I considered this a huge letdown. I've always loved Theron's acting, but she was just this side of campy trying to fit into the fairytale genre. The movie literally drags in many places...I wondered to myself if I was going to make it through it without falling asleep.
B008578PMU|3.0|I was looking for a more factually accurate, less pandering, account of these heros and their missions.  The air battle scenes are all that kept it from a two-star rating.  Too bad, would've been a great story.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This product works fine. After about 3 years my old cable was rotting away, so it was either buy a new e-book reader or just get a new cable. To save money I just got the cable.

Usually Amazon delivers more quickly.

B008XBCJ34|1.0|Lets break down the release of Avatar for all to understand. The Avatar 3D blu-ray was eagerly anticipated by everyone who spent good money on a 3D system. Even with high prices, little content worth watching, and uncomfortable, goofy glasses we looked forward to the blu-ray release that put 3D technology on the map. First slap in the face, 20th Century Fox strikes a deal with Panasonic for an exclusive release of Avatar 3D. All you have to do is buy a Panasonic Blu-ray player or 3D glasses kit and a bare bones copy of Avatar in 3D is yours. What about people who already own a Blu-Ray player not to mention a better performer than Panasonic? Unless we spend well over $100.00 we don't have access to the movie. So we grit our teeth, and wait. Then what happens? Fox releases just the Blu-ray version of the movie to the public. For those who don't have 3D TVs, this release makes sense, expect once again, no additional features. No problem, Fox will just wait a bit and release another version of Avatar. This time, a wonderful 3 disc version with the extended movie and loads of extra features. This would be the perfect version to buy, except its missing one important detail. 3D! So we continue to hold off for many months and then the announcement we are waiting for. Avatar: Blu-ray - 3D for sale October 16th! The complaining would end here, unfortunately Fox just loves pissing people off. I go to buy the movie and discover it is once AGAIN, just a bare bones version. WOW, you couldn't just release the movie with the extra features that have already been produced. Even it if cost more at the cashier, don't you think people who waited for the 3D version would want to watch extra features that show how the highest-grossing, most technically advanced movie of all time is created? What's the likely response, \\"Most fans probably own the 3disc version, you can simply buy this release and have it all.\\" Sure, I enjoy wasting my money by buying multiple versions of a movie. It's a complete waste of resources and unbelievably greedy on the studio's end. Even if you get this newest release, you still don't get the 3D extended version of the movie. We can't win. I'm sure yet another version will come eventually. The 5 disc, extended, multi-Platium, limited edition, collectors series with every feature under the sun. It will be glorious, and it only took three years to get it. Is it so hard to understand why people pirate movies and music? Fox, I would love to unleash a whirlwind of profanity laced commentary on you, but for the sake of not making me look even more pathetic than I already am, I will simply say I'm a grossly disappointed.
B0058O84G0|3.0|I was hooked right from the start. Five different families, flung across different parts of the world, all their lives caught up in the politics of their times and countries, and obviously about to come together in some way. My blood boiled when I read about the miners' strike in Wales. I was outraged at the way women were treated in practically every part of the world. I was disgusted at the hypocritical and self-serving reasons countries up and go to war with each other. And equally, I was drawn into the lives of the people who populated this book, their relationships and troubles with each other.<br />And then the book seemed to fall off a precipice. I'm not the sort to skip pages, but here I found myself just flipping past entire bunches - and there are many: about 1000. I read an ebook so I can't be sure, but it says over 1000 for a paperback version. It was almost as if Ken Follet didn't want to write a fictionalization of the events leading up to and after World War I, the Russian Revolution and the changes that swept Germany. This book is obviously well researched and I would in fact be no judge of how accurate it is to real life. But somewhere it forgets to be fiction and doesn't have enough of the stuff of stories to hold your attention if your expectation is to read a great story. I skipped a lot, keeping track of the characters that mattered to me, but glossing over endless debates and recreations of political maneuverings and talks.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I found it better than the first one. The intensity amongst the characters is very much felt.
0345803485|1.0|Bestseller?  Really?  Why???  Horrible, repetitive writing mixed with absolutely zero plot and the most unlikeable characters you've ever had the displeasure of reading about make for a painful reading experience.  Please do not buy this book. Do not support this \\"author\\". If you must read it, check it out form your local library.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is amazing. I pull out my kindle to read a book but can't concentrate because I'm thinking of the next level in flow. I seriously love this app. I would marry it if I could.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|Very pleased with the case and the protection it will provide. It turns off like they say it will when you close the cover and turns on by itself when you open the cover. It stands alone without sliding in several positions making it hands free. With the Kindle inside the cover, the thickness when closed is about 5/8\\" which is fine with me because the firmness gives me the feeling that if I dropped it, the kindle would not get damaged. The outer strap slips over easily and keeps the cover closed. There are only 2 things that I can see at this time that I would recommend to add to this case. 1. Add a strap or something to this case to hold a stylus pen. 2. Add a cut out on the folded edge of the case so you charge the kindle with the case closed.
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|Acemoglu and Robinson made a fine piece of political economy work that emphasizes what we learnt in \\"Moral Sentiments\\" about the importance of instituciones when societies look for an inclusive political system that would give basis to an inclusive development process. A must read. full of histories and cases, the lesson is one: freedom having powerful people under strict vigilance.

B009OYTIXS|5.0|I think I may have a new favorite show along with Grimm, this has potential to be great if the writers are good and they don't get caught in too much Politically Correctness
B004QX07G4|1.0|This book was awful, she tries too hard to be funny, i hated this book, I don't recommend it..Waste of money.<br />I like Ellen but this book was very disappointing.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|This book should be required reading for all teachers! It gives an added emphasis to the phrase \\"in loco parentis.\\"  If we are really serious about reducing the achievement gap, then we probably need to examine how we approach working with children, especially those who come to school from tough circumstances.
B006RXPTNM|4.0|Dark subject matter.  Acting is superb.  Church needs to be exposed. The issue of sex abuse in the Catholic Church needs to be brought to the consiciousness of the public.
B008Y7Y0AM|4.0|Fans of My Dying Bride will feel right at home with this album, it has everything you expect and want from the masters of Doom Metal. Powerful guitar and drum combos as well as lamenting violins. The vocals are mostly Aaron Stainthorpe's classic half-spoken words, but there are some death growls too.<br /><br />If you have heard the opening track \\"Kneel Till Doomsday\\" online already, it will give you a pretty accurate taste of the whole record. Compared to previous (at least more recent) albums from the band, there are parts that seem more raw and brutal here, not unlike the EP \\"The Barghest O Whitby\\" (2011). So I'd call the sound a more beastly version of \\"For Lies I sire\\" (2009), the latest full length.<br /><br />The tracks that stand out are \\"Kneel Till Doomsday\\", \\"The Poorest Waltz\\", and \\"Hail Odysseus\\". I found parts of a couple of the other songs somewhat too slow and uneventful, but they grow on you after hearing them a few more times. And mostly they turn into something really interesting after a while. There are definitely some cool new melodies and sounds in these songs. But like I stated from the start, it's very familiar as MDB.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|I'm a huge Lee Child fan.  I've loved almost all of his books until this last one.  It was very disappointing and a boring read.  Far too much commentary about everything.  There was hardly any dialogue between the characters.  Where has the old Jack Reacher gone?  That's what we all fell in love with from the first book. There was zero suspense or action in the entire book!  Well we can only hope the next one has Jack back on track!
B009CPJHY4|2.0|Friends recommended this movie, so we saw it.  I was disappointed.  Not funny.  The setting was a retirement community in a formerly luxurious hotel in India.  The script had the aging characters cavorting with one another like college kids in a dorm with horny oldsters bed-hopping like the \\"hook-up\\" generation.  Stupid fantasy.
B0072HXVRS|5.0|Got this one to put up for one of my Daughters Christmas presents,at such a \\"Great Price $6.99\\" and \\"Free Prime Shipping\\".All other sites wanted  way too much. Its not identical to picture but pretty Close, durable and well made.I Love these Toys myself Anything that sparks Childlike, or Creative imagination. Mine will go up on a shelf of course, but they are strong enough to take a beating if bought for child, and the paint usally takes Alot to wear off. Will Be Buying many more as gifts in Future.Look forward to whats new, and if Prices stay reasonable definatly look forward to purchasing from Amazon.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I know alot of reviews have been written about this book. I don't want to reiterate the same stuff over. This is a great book and I have to say that Ms. Flynn is a very imaginative person. I don't know how she even came up with a plot like this.

B001TH8UUA|5.0|This product is exactly as advertised.  I could not have asked for more.  Good quality.  Durable.  Well priced.  Absolutely zero problems with any aspect of this purchase.  I actually ended up buying additional cables.  Not because of any problem with the original, but because the cost was so far from prohibitive that it seemed preferable to plugging and unplugging one cord to switch devices.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is a well-crafted, intense book with enjoyably unpleasant characters and an edge-of-your-seat intensity that literally kept me up until 4am finishing it. Unlike some others, I found the ending satisfying; basically, (minor spoiler alert) everyone seemed to get what they deserved. Not pleasant people, the Dunnes - except perhaps for Go. I'm eager to read the other books by this author.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Short enough to read over a few days but long enough to capture detail. Story was entertaining and kept me wanting to read more. Had me guessing the entire book what was taking place and just when I thought I'd figured it out the story surprised me again.  If you like a chilling tale similar to a Twilight Zone-like show than i think you'll enjoy Pines.
1607066017|5.0|You ever hear of Brian K. Vaughn?  No?  Well if you haven't, then I think it's time you decide to give his name a try.  Vaughn has done the great work of Y: The Last Man, Ex Machina, and Runaways to great acclaim.  But after taking some time off, Vaughn is back in the comic-ring with Saga, a sci-fi/fantasy story inspired by Star Wars and the birth of his second daughter.  And what do you get?  One of the most unique, epic, fresh, and odd comics on the market.  I will try to keep it spoiler free.<br /><br />SAGA VOL.1 collects the first issues, #1-6.  A never-ending galactic war that has been happening between a planet by the name of Landfall, a planet filled with technologically advanced beings who have wings to fly, and its orbiting moon Wreath, a moon full of goat-like humans who are great warriors and wield magic.  Alana (a being from Landfall), and Marko (a being from Wreath) do the unthinkable: they conceived a child named Hazel on a distant planet named Cleave.  Both Alana and Marko forfeit their positions from their planets and decide to try to get away from the war effort.  But both home planets find out about this and want them eliminated.  Landfall has an agent from the Robot Kingdom, named Prince Robot IV (a humanoid-being with the head of a television set) go after them, while Wreath hires paid killers The Will (a morally complex being) and The Stalk to do the same.  What will happen next?<br /><br />Brian K. Vaughn wanted this book to match the title itself, in that it encompasses all aspects of a long and arduous space epic.  It has drama, romance, humor, suspense, action, violence, charm, zany science fiction, abstract fantasy, the supernatural, politics, morals, sexuality, and just plain weird stuff.  This book has it all.  And it's only 6 issues in.<br /><br />The actual story plot might not be the most original, but the narrative on character building is phenomenal.  The story jumps between Alana and Marko's journey to escape Cleave, while there is the investigation of Prince Robot IV into the lovers, and The Will's complex exposition from hunting Alana and Marko or going to an orgy-filled planet.  This would fumble for most writers doing this much at one time, but Vaughn holds it together, and does it a pace at which the book moves just right.  Not too fast, not too slow.  The story and character building work so well together, it succeeds at world building and creating an intrigue.  And Vaughn creates enough status quo changing twist that you can't quite put down the book.<br /><br />But the main theme and narrative here is parenthood, or more precisely: love.  The main narrative is told from Hazel (most of the time), which describes her parents Alana and Marko with such written quirkiness and humanity; you can't help but feel for their plight and feel like their one of us.  Even in a distant galaxy, these characters feel human, and Vaughn hits the nail just right.<br /><br />But Vaughn can't take all of the credit.  Fiona Staples draws thick character lines, while having water color-type backgrounds to bring attention, as well as make a odd, alien world come to life.  But she stays on the emotional expressions the most, keeping in-line the characters mannerisms to the theme of parenthood.  But Staples also does a commendable job at the more risqu&eacute; content here to make it applicable to art form, and not gratuitous material (though I think there will be some who think otherwise).  But overall, Staples art fits perfectly for this book.<br /><br />Now if there are possible problems, they lie in the content.  This is for mature readers only.  This book has some strong language (you'll hear the occasional F-bomb), male and female nudity, sexual innuendos, and like mentioned before: Some weird imagery and concepts I can't list without giving things away.  If you're not prepared for this, this might not be for you.  But considering the material, as well as Vaughn purpose of using all aspects possible for this space epic, I think it works very well.<br /><br />SAGA VOL.1 truly is the next big thing in comics that truly looks like it will live up to its title.  Vaughn has said he wants to make this series be big and long, to really personify an epic space opera/drama worthy of the word, \\"saga\\".  And if this keeps ups, we can expect another great chapter under Vaughn's career.  And only $10, you have nothing to lose in trying out this book.  Nothing.  So get on it while it's still just starting, because it's going to be a long journey.ce epic, I think it works very well.<br /><br />SAGA VOL.1 truly is the next big thing in comics that truly looks like it will live up to its title.

B007THA4FI|2.0|First, I would like to preface this review by stating that I am an avid Harry Potter fan (I'm in Ravenclaw, if you must know), and maybe that was my problem -- my expectations were too high.  In HP, I genuinely cared about the characters.  I felt for them -- I felt connected or impacted in some way by each of them.  Even as an almost irrelevant character, I felt compassion and sadness for the father of Cedric Diggory when he was murdered.  Unfortunately, I cannot say the same about A Casual Vacancy.<br /><br />This book details the mundane lives of several families - the Mollisons, the Walls, the Weedons, the Jawandas, the Prices, the Bawdens, and the Fairbrothers - none of whom have any real depth, except perhaps the Weedons.<br /><br />The problem with this book is, Rowling didn't make me care about the characters.  I felt nothing for them, to the point that I actually started hoping she was going to kill them off one by one so I didn't have to read about them anymore.  The plot (if you can call it that) was extremely weak:<br /><br />The story begins with the death of Parish Councilman Barry Fairbrother and the entire story is about who is going to take his seat on the council.  The thing is: who cares?  Without giving anything away, should you still attempt to get through this tragedy of literature, I didn't care that the council seat of this 50-person town was empty.  I didn't care that some people wanted to include the \\"Fields\\" (essentially the ghetto of the town) into another town and some didn't.  Rowling just didn't make me understand why it mattered.<br /><br />Further, I was finally forced to admit something to myself that I have been avoiding for years:  at a literary level, Rowling is just not a good writer.  Her sentences are short, meaningless, and lack depth and perceptive.  I happily ignored this in HP because they are, after all, young adult books, but now that she is writing for us grown ups, her writing style needs to reflect that, and sadly, itdidn't.<br /><br />A Casual Vacancy just did not live up to my expectations, which admittedly, may have been too high.  I am truly disappointed.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|I love this game and would absolutely give it a 5 star rating except that it doesn't work on my Asus Transformer. It works wonderfully on my S2 Skyrocket, but it crashes and closes all the time on my tablet, regardless of how many times I reinstall.<br />Were that fixed, I would absolutely change my rating to 5 stars.<br />The story is great, the graphics are very well refined, and it's quite a rich game for being a little match-3.

B000OVLBGC|4.0|The Lives of Others is a very good German Movie set during the East German Communist era and the former Spy Agency the Stasi spied on just about everyone and on everything. The Movie is about a couple who are suspected of being treasonists to the State and are being spied on around the clock without them knowing for quite sometime. Their Apartment is wired for sound and they are being followed every step they make outside in public. This was a typical day in the life for a lot of East Germans during the Communist era and how the Stasi went about on it's business.

0385536828|5.0|Ian McEwan has done it again.  He has written a brilliant novel from a woman's point of view, similar to the style he used in Atonement.  The story is about Serena Frome (rhymes with Plume), a young woman who finds herself recruited for a post in the M-16, England's variant of the CIA.  She gets a lowly post there but finds herself involved in an interesting project called `Sweet Tooth'.<br /><br />Sweet Tooth's primary function is to channel money through various non-profits that cannot be traced and provide stipends to artists who they hope will produce work sympathetic to the cause.  One of the artists is a writer named Tom Healy and Serena is chosen to be the one to court him.  The writers get 20,000 pounds per year as a stipend, which is quite a lot for the 1970's which is when this novel takes place.  Serena is beautiful, Cambridge educated and she and Tom Healy quickly fall into an exciting love affair.<br /><br />In the 1970's, and even now for all I know, those recruited for the M-16 needed to come from the right schools, have the correct background, and be from upper class families.  Most were male, and females were the exception, left to lowly jobs like clerks or secretaries.  There were the one or two affirmative action employees but they were the minority.<br /><br />Before coming to M-16, Serena was involved with an older man named Tony Canning who groomed her for the position and put in a word for her.  He had connections with the agency which opened the door for Serena.<br /><br />The novel is filled with twists and turns.  It is not exactly a spy story, not exactly a love story, and not exactly a political novel.  It combines the elements of all three in a wonderful way.  The book is a literary page-turner in the best sense.  I had trouble putting it down once I picked it up and it gave me a lot more than I ever expected.<br /><br />I recommend this for fans of McEwan, of which I am one, for those who have never read McEwan before and want to start - this is an excellent first peek into his writing, and for anyone who likes literary page-turners that are filled with fine writing  and make it difficult for you to come up for air.- this is an excellent first peek into his writing, and for anyone who likes literary page-turners that are filled with fine writing  and make it difficult for you to come up for air.

B003WC5EQI|4.0|This series is not for someone looking for a light hearted story with a happy ending.This is based on the very talented author Thomas Hardy's novel. Like the novel it is dense and sucks you in. The truth is sometimes bad things DO happen to good people especially women.During that time and her social standing there were probably many young women like Tess. Is this a bit dramatic and horribly depressing? Yes. But you should still watch it because it has great acting and you get to think about how both strong and weak people really are.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|An amazing read to carry on a great series of books. Ricks writing is just getting better and better. The whole series is a great modern day twist on the classical myths.
0143120530|4.0|Initially, I thought I was going to be able to learn some systematic methods to improve my memory from this week.  As I finished half of it, I realized I wasn't going to.  There are still some vague methods I learned from the book.  I'm not sure how useful they'll be without the detailed explanation.  Despite that, I still enjoyed the book.  The author's experience is interesting.  It is also inspiring in that it showed expertise can be gained through effective training.  It gives people hope that everybody has the potential to develop some sort of unusual ability.
030758836X|4.0|I read this book and then made my family read it. That's what I do since I come from a family of readers.<br /><br />My mind kept turning as I was reading this book, trying to figure out what was going on, who was right, who was evil. At one point in the book (no spoilers), I actually gasped out loud when the story switched up.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. It was crazy and fun and made me appreciate my husband!
034580404X|5.0|Fifty Shades is a great read...Not as XXXX rated as I was told. Love the romance between Ana and Christian. It really is a fairy tale in the modern world with a little sizzle to it. Now reading the third book the second one I really loved. Hope to finish the third one soon. Can't wait to see how it all ends.

B0092G1O8A|4.0|A great movie, very well done. Though I was thinking \\"this is really sick\\" half the time I was watching it, I enjoyed it overall and recommend it to anyone who liked (it via) the previews.
B0083EW97W|5.0|I'm so glad I got this album.  I like all the songs on it.  It's just nice music to relax to and to listen to.  I listen to it every morning to start my day.  It seems to have a calming effect.  It reminds me of nice rainy days which I love.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|In the beginning, I was thinking, \\"This movie could have a better (musical) score,\\" but in the end I was not disappointed.<br /><br />This is a great movie if you're interested in the evolution and telling of fairy tales or if you just want to spend a couple hours in enchantment.<br /><br />The ending left me in awe, wanting more but knowing that having it would ruin the effect. I just sat there watching and thinking about the movie afterward. Just wow. I highly recommend.
B005GYY0GA|5.0|I love the blues so you know I love Johnny plus this one has great guest artists, Susan Tadeschi, John Medeski, Edgar Winter, Sony Landreth, John Popper. He just sounds good and makes the sadness feel good.<br />Yes I love Johnny and I love the blues.

1609611543|5.0|Read this with an open mind and you might just be very surprised if you were not aware of the effect of wheat on your health and body. Dr. Davis presents the case for avoiding wheat clearly and explains the whats and whys of how it affects your metabolism/body. If you are looking for solid information on this topic, Wheat Belly is the best book I have found yet on the topic. I am in the process of applying what I have learned in this book to my eating habits and already am feeling better physically than I have in some time. Energy level is much higher and my blood sugar numbers are coming down. Definitely worth a read!!

B007THA4FI|4.0|This book delves into the minds and motivations of the residents of a small town. JK Rowling's talent for creating full, three-dimensional characters truly shines. The people are in turns generous, flawed, tortured, selfish, damaged, intelligent, and loving. Getting into the story is a bit slow until you get the hang of who's who, but soon you feel yourself being pulled into their lives. You'll find yourself chewing on the resolution for days. It's not a happy-go-lucky story by any means, but more a story of humanity and what we choose to do with our fragile human lives.
B009AJDDQU|1.0|I'm not sure what's more disappointing:  how terribly awful Prometheus was, or how sad it is that so many people think this was a good movie.<br />For a Ridley Scott film, supposedly in the \\"Aliens\\" genre, this film is a complete embarrassment. The plotline is absolutely preposterous.  Unlike the first 3 of the Alien series, which were great SciFi films and had overall believable storylines, the Prometheus plot line is downright offensive to an self-respecting, intelligent viewer.  Pathetically idiotic. The supposed \\"scientific\\" reasoning behind the expedition is preposterous, and the \\"scientists\\" which compose the bulk of the crew and characters display all the charm, professionalism and reasoning ability of a second-grader with untreated ADD. The dialog is awful. The explanations they provide for everything and anything are mind-numbingly stupid.  The movie somewhat improves during the last half, when they start running around in a panic, things start exploding and people start dying.. but its still pretty bad.  Again, the fact that so many people think THIS garbage is a decent SciFi flick is a sad testament to the abysmally low standards of the average movie-goer.<br />This was a horribly bad excuse for a Ridley Scott/Alien-esque flick, and a really poor movie in every other regard.
B001QWBM62|5.0|You know how you buy a product and eventually say, \\"Man there's a bunch of stuff they could've added pretty easily to make this way better.\\" That is not the case here. This thing is amazing, it never fails to amaze me.<br /><br />I got it just for recording from my shotgun mic. Turns out this thing sounds way better than my mic. I didn't realize until later on how much cooler this thing is than just a 4 channel mic.<br /><br />It's the little details. The SD card access isn't some crazy interfacing driver bla bla bla, it's just a normal mass storage device reader. It COMES with an SD card! Even if it's small, who else does that? External power adapter too. Guitar tuner and effects... I didn't even play guitar! I guess I do now, I have a really sophisticated guitar effect, tuner and computer interface.<br /><br />Oh yeah it just happens to interface with any software in real time. Giving you live recording or instrument recording into music software. And it powers from the USB all the while.<br /><br />MP3? WAV? how about 10 bajillion different options of each.<br /><br />Tripod mount, grab a little hotshoe adapter to mount it to the top of a camera.<br /><br />Only cons: Would be nice if it had a rechargeable battery and wind picks up bad without the windscreen that it comes with. That's about it.<br /><br />I can't even use all of the features if I tried. Just buy this thing, you won't regret it.
B007QPFGJW|4.0|Not quite as good as Snowman,But the ending makes you wonder what's next.Also dead person narration very novel.Worth the time.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I picked this book based on the rating and brief description and it really surprised me  how good it was and cant wait for more.
B008MG1E4A|1.0|Dull book that covers basic Seal training with few interesting anecdotes.  No surprises and little genuine emotion.  I wish I had my money back.  Book wanders aimlessly while providing little in way of detail or revelation that is not already covered in news reports.  Bias toward current administration is revealed, but just as always, no depth of feeling is evident because of poor writing.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is great if you love different kids of game if you like kinds getting money then this is the game for you get it now
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett is a master at weaving a great story around historical facts in a way that entertains and informs. This is a brilliant piece of work which involves players from all sides of the complex events before , during and after WWII.I was mesmerized by the story and it has energized me to take another look at the history and differing opinions about the players in our World Wars.<br />A great read!
B008O9V4C2|5.0|Call me old fashioned or maybe just plain old, but in listening to the new Donald Fagen album from files that were e-mailed to me a few weeks ago, I really got into it, but something was missing. That \\"something\\" was the tangible aspect of my usual listening experience. It really makes a difference to have things like the cover art, the lyrics and the liner notes to explore while I'm hearing an album for the first time. It's a feeling of being as immersed as possible into the journey it took to create what I'm listening to. After all this time, it still matters. It's a ritual of appreciation and essential for a project of this magnitude. It's also something younger devotees of downloading will have no connection to whatsoever, but I swear that the music got even better once the real thing hit my hands and came through the headphones for a few passes with all of my senses on board.<br />While not breaking any new ground, it's fantastic to have Fagen gracing us with another solid album and giving his devoted base exactly what we love about his music.<br />The track that jumped out from the pack for me on SUNKEN CONDOS has to be \\"Miss Marlene\\" with its shuffle groove and chill horn arrangement; Fagen sounds great as Jon Herrington's guitar dances in and out of the action. The background vocal arrangement is also outstanding. \\"The New Breed\\" brings that classic Fagen attitude back in the pocket as he comes to terms with the \\"dotcom slash life\\" that surrounds him. The opening track \\"Slinky Thing\\" struts out of the gate cocksure and ready for action complete with the warm harmonies and layered production. I love the pace on \\"I'm Not The Same Without You\\" with its upbeat story of evolution following a breakup. \\"Out Of The Ghetto\\" gives Fagen a chance to flex some of his \\"Dukes Of September\\" muscles with this funky Issac Hayes cover from the 1977 platter NEW HORIZON. The bluesy \\"Weather In My Head\\" provides biting social commentary with extended musical space for another Herrington guitar exploration with sax accents from Walt Weiskopf. And just when you think they might be phoning one in, the bad ass lyric and bridge with the melodica and xylophone take it high on \\"Good Stuff\\".<br />This is a smaller, tighter sounding Donald Fagen and I think it fits his current space and time. His observations and delivery are as sharp as ever. Kudos must go out to co-producer Michael Leonhart for his huge contributions on the album.<br />In this day and age of music acts clamoring for attention through their street rep & style while leaving the music to come in somewhere down the line, it sure feels great to have a seasoned cat like Fagen calmly step up and just lay it down again.<br /><br />Scott Gross<br />Inside Musicast.com
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|Let me just start by saying that this book is my favourite in the series. This series gets even more complicated as Rick Riordan incorporates the individual storylines of 7 different MAIN characters into this one book. Readers will have to follow the stories of Percy,Annabeth, Jason, Piper, Leo, Frank and Hazel from their lives before the book and during. Of course as usual riordan never fails to deliver on the humour department! (I mean seriously, what would our lives be without Percy's sarcasm?)<br />  Speaking of Percy, I've heard a lot of people complain that he is \\"a different person!\\" and that \\"riordan screwed up his character!\\" but I'd like to inform you that this is perfectly normal! In fact it is encouraged!  Its called  character DEVELOPMENT!!<br />  And as usual this book ends in a riordan style cliffhanger. Or to quote the great, CassJayTuck \\"a liferuiner.\\" and I mean a serious life ruiner. I cried.<br />  So to sum it up, this book was FABULOUS! characters, plot, ect. All A-okay! but the ending!! I mean don't get me wrong it was genius! But I cried. You have been warned.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|This app keeps getting larger but not for the better. Now for some reason when I want to search for books, it wants to use the phones browser. If I use anything other than Chrome, it then doesn't let me buy books. Why not just let me search for books via the app like it used to be?
160774273X|5.0|Even if you own dozens of bread books, as I do, you will find much to love about Ken Forkish's \\"Flour, Water, Salt, Yeast.\\" One of my biggest difficulties in making bread at home has always been scoring the top of the loaf before baking it. Even when I use an oiled razor blade, I can't seem to make a clean cut in the top of the bread. The blade tugs at the dough and causes it to deflate. Ken Forkish solves this problem by recommending that you bake your bread with the seam side (as opposed to the smooth side) up and not scoring it at all. The natural fissures in the seam side of the bread will open up in the heat of the oven and create the same kind of effect you'd get from successfully scoring the top of the loaf. This information alone made the book worthwhile to me. The critics who complain that the book contains only a handful of recipes are correct but they are missing the point. This isn't one of those \\"1000 Ways To Make Bread at Home\\" books. This book is about the fundamentals of good home breadmaking.It is well-written, well-illustrated, and bursting with good advice. I recommend it heartily.
0385344333|4.0|Look, I did not read the over 1000 reviews already existing, so I do not know if someone already commented on this. But in the story, the narrative remarks about a 100 megaton atomic bomb. There is no such thing. A 100 megaton bomb would, if it even existed, be a hydrogen bomb. An atomic bomb, or fission bomb, is much smaller. Like 10 or 20 kilotons.<br /><br />On some things, like firearms, Child is usually very careful and accurate in his descriptions. Inexplicably, he slips up here.<br /><br />Having said this, I found the story quite enjoyable. It was different enough in some ways as to be a little unpredictable compared to the earlier Reacher stories. Notably the female love interest, so to speak. A plot spoiler is that here, Reacher does not get laid. Child is subtle, playing the reader along but refraining from taking the default route of having Reacher be successful in every novel.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I am about 20% through this book and find it tough to read due to the incessant wisecracking of its protagonist. I have read all of DeMille's books, and have found most of them engrossing (even I became aware of my distaste for the Corey books due to excessive wisecracking.) This one not so much.<br /><br />I may update this review when/if I finish the book. Right now I'd say it is 50-50 that I will.<br /><br />I have now finished this book, almost a week after I started it. I stand by my 2 star rating. The incessant wisecracking made it tedious. I started to count the paragraphs that began with \\"Right.\\" but gave up when I found three or more on a page.<br /><br />The last third (perhaps) was an ok read, but not up to DeMille's previous books.<br /><br />Update: I have now read the one star reviews and agree completely with most of them. The only reason I gave this book two stars was to differentiate it from the \\"this Kindle book is too expensive\\" garbage reviews.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I could not put it down! more detail and intriguing than the show. cant wait to start the next book.
B00001OH1S|5.0|I bought this album largely because of Sting's arrangement of \\"Windmills Of Your Mind\\", which is heard over the closing credits of the movie. Happy days, it is the first cut on the CD. I think it is one of the best arrangements of the song I have ever heard. I wish I could come up with a good arrangement for solo fingerstyle guitar.<br /><br />Nina Simone's \\"Sinner Man\\" is the second cut, so the two best tracks from the movie are right up front.<br /><br />The rest of the treacks are pleasant listening, so if you enjoyed the movie as much as I did, I recommend this CD.
B008G8SFGO|4.0|For almost four decades, Kiss have been touring and making music. Their new album, Monster, is their 20th studio album and their first album since 2009's Sonic Boom. In recent years, critics and even fans have criticized for the band choosing to continue instead of calling it a day. Some are not comfortable with the fact that the new members are wearing the make-up of previous members. Nevertheless, Monster is a great album from Kiss. While Sonic Boom was an attempt at capturing the band's sound from the 1970's, Monster can be seen as Kiss taking on the music world in the 21st century.<br /><br /> Kiss formed around 1973 by bassist/singer Gene Simmons and guitarist/singer Paul Stanley. Along with guitarist Ace Frehley and drummer Peter Criss, Kiss were one of the most successful rock bands of the 1970's. In their forty year career, the band has been through several line-up changes, with Simmons and Stanley being the two sole original members. There was even a part of their career from 1983 till 1996 when the band decided to take off their iconic make-up. Kiss currently consists of Simmons (the Demon), Stanley (the Starchild), guitarist Tommy Thayer (since 2002, replacing Frehley and wearing the Spaceman make-up), and drummer Eric Singer (1992-1996, 2000-2002, 2004-present replacing Criss and wearing the Catman make-up).<br /><br /> Monster opens with the strong rocker \\"Hell or Hallelujah\\", which is the lead single for the album. The song has \\"Detroit Rock City\\"-like lyrics and great guitar work from Thayer. Stanley's voice sounds pretty good and that's saying a lot considering his voice has been shot for the last few years (Stanley had vocal surgery about a year ago so it seems to have helped). This is followed by the stomping beats of \\"Wall of Sound\\", which is the first song sung by Simmons on the album. The song is okay as the lyrics tend to fall on the weak lyrics. Luckily, the same can't be said for Stanley's \\"Freak\\". The song is a brilliantly written anthem ofsorts. \\"And I love the clothes I wear/Let them laugh `cause I don't care\\" sings Stanley. \\"It's my cross I'm proud to bear/I'm a freak\\". \\"Back to the Stone Age\\" might have a corny title but the music sounds like something the MC5 could churn out back in the day.<br /><br />Thayer and Singer also get to sing on the album. Thayer's \\"Outta This World\\" is probably my least favorite song off the album while Singer's \\"All For the Love of Rock N Roll\\" is slightly better. Other highlights off the album include Simmon's hard-hitting \\"The Devil is Me\\" and \\"Long Way Down\\" which might be my favorite song off the album. It's a Zeppelin-sounding rocker with chugging guitars and great drumming from Singer.<br /><br />Monster is just simply a great album from Kiss. They did really work hard on this album. Kiss fans will definitely want to check this out (if they haven't already) but I think people who are fans of the material Kiss came out with in the 1970's might actually like this album.
B00559BT06|3.0|I've been a big fan of Toto for a long time; anyone who is will certainly not fault these (first) five albums for inclusion.  You either like them or not, and I think \\"Isolation\\", \\"IV\\", and \\"Hydra\\" are the best albums of their career.  I think the packaging is cute, utilitarian, and sure saves a lot of space (that's why I bought them).<br /><br />The down side, though, is that they are recorded at a much lower level than the original albums/CDs.  I don't like to have to turn up my player to hear them more adequately.  Buyers should be forewarned about this...
B008UTV6S8|4.0|I think that these living performances of the Greats ara usually, more of the same. Paul Simon is ever great and<br />sound very well, but one expected something more.
B009B50QOU|4.0|Similar to earlier Green Day albums, Dookie and Kerplunk!, but does seem to veer from their political or social commentary like American Idiot.  Recommend if you miss old Green Day.
B004EPYZOO|4.0|Great movie for Nicholas Cage fans and for lover's of classic cars, chases, crashes, gore and more. The script is not much but the action is great. Not to be missed if you are a Cage fan.
B006VGGAC4|5.0|I purchased the book for my wife's Kindle for the text to speech and forgot to look for the disabled.<br />I an having to read it to her (she is blind) and must admit I like it too.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007XKEY6Q/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title This is a fun, non-competitive game for all ages, (though kids may need the help of an adult.) The goal is not to beat the person you are playing with, but to communicate a word through pictures.  When the word is an idea or famous person, not a simple object, it calls on your creativity.
B00992CF6W|5.0|great app!! i have it for my computer and i got it for my kindle fire and it works great! the only downfall is that there isnt water or lava blocks, and there are no animals in creative and no structures in the game at all. those are things that need to be added and probly will be in the future, but otherwise, it is a great app, and is a must have for anyone that likes minecraft or is just thinking of trying it.
B008XG1X18|4.0|This is a great app for the kindle fire. It does lock up sometimes or not boot up right away but iwhen it does work it is amazing.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is like having ice age in ur hands. I totally recommend it.:) :) :) :) :) :)<br />I love ice age the movie get it at walmart. u will laugh ur pants off
0345803485|3.0|Pretty much what the other reviews said. It's readable, but definitely an immature book. Reads like a 15 year old sex deprived girl wrote it, etc. Probably wouldn't buy again. The buyer I purchased from probably should package the book a bit better. Came bent in half, cover was scratched to the point that it looked used, but could tell it was new because the pages looked flawless and they weren't sticky.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|it is very smooth and responsive to the touch, and I enjoy playing this match game.  I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys matching games.
B001AW156U|4.0|plain and simple the ps3 controller should have altered the dualshock design to be more like the xbox 360 controller by giving it real triggers and altering the shape a little bit, but this is the best you can get without doing some serius modding on a wired xbox 360 controller or using a cross battle adapter. im just happy i dont slip off the trigger and accidentally throw my tomohawk at the rong time anymore.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Really great book! I just kept reading and reading. It's a little slow at first but it picks right up after a little while. I really liked the peeta character, he was my favorite.  This is a really great book
B009B50QOU|4.0|Been a fan since Dookie, I think if you like Green Day, you'll like this album! Can't wait for the other 2!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is full of action. Really great story and a great story line between Catnis and Peeta.  I loved this book.
030758836X|4.0|Entertaining=yes, believable=somewhat, disturbing=totally.  This book is good and keeps you guessing like a real \\"who done it?\\" until you realize what has happened and watch the story unfold.  Amazing detail of Amazing Amy and Nick and their not so perfect marriage.  Few marriages are perfect but this one reaches a whole new level of disturbing.  Amy's vindictive hatred plays out through the entire book toward multiple characters but most she saves for one man.  Wow I sure hope nobody \\"loves\\" me like that.  The ending?  Inconclusive, still waiting for the other shoe to drop.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Everything they said it would be.  Great characters.  Engrossing. Never dull.  Clever.  Whenever I thought I had it figured it, I was surprised anew.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it doesn't. say this but you get both creative mode and a survive mode and there the perfect replica. of the computer one.  one more thing mine did a thing where I had my stuff but my house was gone don't worry its not permanent. I say 100% buy it
B004TTHLBE|5.0|Read this one in print, not Kindle, but it's great.  My all-time favorite Gaiman remains _Neverwhere_, but this may be second-place, and we keep an eye on him as a consistently good author!
0470901071|4.0|Though the thickness of the book seems daunting to many, it is quite an easy read. Previous to reading it I had little to no networking experience. Afterwards, I felt more comfortable taking a certification test.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I like this game because it reminds me when I was a kid. there was a arcade next to my house and this was my favorote.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love this its very interesting...I'm planning my wedding its perfect!! you get to see lots of different ideas and colors!! love it...omg the food is too die for also!!!!
B006ZOGM2A|5.0|This concert early in Bruce Springsteens career is live at a small club.  This performance is just before the Born to run album was released.  Quite a few songs from the album sound quite different from the final versions. Thy also are using a violin player on a lot of songs.  This is certainly of the the top 5 live recordings made of rock music.  It almost brings tears to your eyes.  Its that good.
B006UG909U|2.0|This is by far their worst album with David Lee Roth.  With the exception of She's the Woman, the rest of the album hardly sounds like Van Halen.  It sounds more like the David Lee Roth Revue.  Highly disappointed.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|What a great way to read the Bible every day! I highly recommend this product and thank the people who put it together!
0525952926|4.0|Winter Of The World is the second mammoth-size work of historical fiction in  Ken Follett's The Century Trilogy that kept me very engrossed. Winter Of The World follows the lives of five main characters, each the child of the five families featured in Fall Of Giants, as they move through events beginning with the rise of the Third Reich, through the Spanish Civil War and the great dramas of WWII, up to the explosions of the American and Soviet atomic bombs.<br /><br />Follett's characters are developed well enough and his narrative abilities are  strong enough to enable me to feel that that I was right along side each of the main characters as they move through the major events in their lives. I recommend Winter Of The World to those who enjoy historical fiction and think they would enjoy traveling with Follett's characters as they move through the years that were filled with social, political and emotional turmoil.<br /><br />Is Winter Of The World a perfect book? Of course not; it has its share of limitations. For example, Follett's dialogue, at times, does not ring true and the historical situations in which he involves his characters often appear to be too coincidental and expected. These limitations, however, are mostly outweighed by the excellent job Follett does in pacing his book and in creating a \\"you are there\\" atmosphere for the reader.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure you'll find Winter Of The World to be a very entertaining, well-researched and memorable book. But be aware that your enjoyment won't come cheap -- the retail price of Winter Of The World is $36 in hardcover and $19.99 electronically. I think, however, you'll find that it is worth the money and your time investment.
B00280LYIC|5.0|great book I kept reading and reading it<br />I loved   this  book very, very much.  Recommend for young readers - good and entertaining
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Especially if you can sleep when you hit the snooze button. I keep this set to do 1 math problem to snooze 2 to dismiss and each time I snooze those numbers go up by one.
B0078XFYDA|5.0|Another fascinating book by the great Richard Dawkins.  I loved all the book, but what I loved most is his willingness to say things like, \\"I don't understand this,\\" or \\"some scientists understand this, but I'm not one of them,\\" and \\"I know my limitations.\\"  Only great minds can do that, especially when addressing a supposedly younger audience.<br /><br />I also like the thorough effort of the publisher.  There is not one spelling or grammatical error in the book, and (listen other publishers and Amazon.com) the \\"--\\" sign is separated by a space from the word before it and the one after it, making it easier for highlighting without including words you don't want to be included.  This is true of all of Richard Dawkins's books that I read as an e-book, a feature lacking in many if not all the other Kindle books.
B0013TTLDE|2.0|I loved The Forgotten Garden and so was excited to read this. Oh I found it so boring. I started to enjoy it once it was at the about 80% read point but all the build up to that point was just too wordy for me to enjoy. It was like a huge setup for the final \\"twist\\" which was not that shocking because I was so bored by the book in general. I will probably try another book by this author but this one didnt do it for me.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is the most awesome set of tools. I keep my grocery list up to date regardless of where  i am &amp; can access my quilt patterns to see how much of what is needed, attach pictures, use skitch to draw some idea i have &amp; save it in one of my notebooks. i keep a list of prescriptions for my family in case of emergencies, as well as family address, phone numbers,etc.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed the book, then read the last 2 and kept my attention. Could not put them down. The price at Amazon was a great introduction.
B007THA4FI|4.0|It took me a substantial amount of time due to visual impairment and no dedicated long uninterrupted periods for reading.Good character development. Clear setting descriptions.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|I could barely stand reading about his life in the orphanage, it was so brutal.  Other parts were comical; he was so inept you just wanted to hug him. The story skipped around a bit and seemed drawn out but I enjoyed it and was so pleased with the happy ending.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I had never heard of Blake Crouch before this book. I decided to take a chance on reading Pines when it was running as a kindle special. I have to say that I very much enjoyed this book. His writing kept things interesting and I did not find myself getting bored at any point.  The ending was suspenseful and not what I was expecting.  Looking forward to checking out more of his novels.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I loved this video.  I read the books and found the video to be true to the book.  It was so nice to see the characters come to life.  Most were very cose to my imagined characters.  Loved the whole season, can't wait for the next one.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wow.  Held my interest and my heart through every page.  Not your typical \\"trite\\" cancer story as the characters are utterly \\"normal\\".  Loved it.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I have to admit, I couldn't put the book down ... Simply because I just wanted to really get it over with and figure out where it was going to go.  I think parts of it were really slow.  There were a lot of questions that I felt we're never addressed.  All in all, I was disappointed with the outcome.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|nice game<br />I really enjoyed this one<br />nice graphics easy to play fun too. can play this over and over again.
B008KMHFJY|5.0|This book is so full of emotional heart stop moments. I couldn't put it down & then re-read it again immediately afterwoods again, it is that good. Both characters are so well written that you feel for both of them.<br />can't wait for the next book to be released!!!!
B0053O89YM|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD.  I could hardly wait to view the \\"Third Season\\" and it met all my expectations to the point where I have viewed some of the parts a second time. Each series gets better.  SDavis
B008GVD6D8|5.0|This book is even better than fifty shades, so addictive, hotter sex scenes & heaps of mind games. The lead female character is also much stronger than Fifty shades

0345803493|1.0|In the second installment of this unholy trinity, E.L. James somehow finds a way to take what was tolerable in the first novel and completely replace it with a giant steaming pile of crap.<br /><br />The entire \\"plot\\" consists of the same interaction between Ana and Christian except that the author mixes it up by putting the characters in different physical locations. The routine is as follows:<br /><br />Ana: OMG Christian is great but I am just a mousy blob, will I ever be enough for him?<br />Christian: Seethe. My past is dark but I will explain my issues to you because they are straight out of a freshman psychology course.<br />Ana: OMG those are all terrible qualities that you possess but I will overlook them because you had a bad childhood and I am going to rescue you with my love.<br /><br />Then there is a perfunctory exchange where Ana tries to pretend that she has free will because it gets Christian hard. And then they run off somewhere and bone.<br /><br />This same pattern occurs in any number of interesting places: a boat, Ana's apartment, Christian's apartment, the bathtub, probably another boat, a fancy-pants masquerade ball. Our author seems to equate a change of scenery with a change of subject matter, and that if she makes these people go to enough interesting places then the people reading this tripe will forget that neither Ana nor Christian has developed one iota as a character or a human being. By this point, all the secondary characters have all but disappeared except when they show up to either a) cause Ana to feel possessive/triumphant/vindictive because every straight lady in the universe either wants to do it with Christian or has done it with Christian (there are no other options); b) incite Christian's irrational jealousy because every straight man in the universe wants to do it with this insipid blob of a woman he calls Ana (there are no other options); or c) to cause the happy couple inconvenience and/or extreme pain (because when you're rich and beautiful everyone is out to get you). It seems like other people are only there to prevent these two from doing it, even those who are family and friends. BECAUSE ALL THAT MATTERS IS THAT THEY ARE DOING IT ALL THE TIME.<br /><br />And speaking of doing it, even though the boning scenes are frequent and often lengthy, reading them became less of a thrill and more of a chore. Maybe it would be more entertaining if the prose didn't read like a 14 year old's journal. Ana has this weird pattern of blending sterile, almost scientific terms with giggly little euphemisms. No. One. Talks. Like. That. I guarantee that you could find more risque material on the iPhone of any given sexually active 20-something. The worst, and I mean the absolute worst, is Ana's internal monologue. Or dialogue, if you buy into that inner goddess crap. She sounds like she is six years old and has just discovered shiny things. Every time she said \\"Holy crap\\" or \\"Jeez\\" I wanted to slap her across the face. Christian is only slightly better, though I suspect that's because his internal thoughts remain a mystery. If the author has such a hard time writing for someone with the same type of reproductive organs that she has, then I shudder to think what she thinks a man sounds like.<br /><br />Another point at issue here is that this book is simply unbelievable, even for a work of fiction. Normally every good story has a central plot and conflicts that are tertiary and reasonably related to the central struggle at issue. However, this book seems to completely ignore that trend and instead insert a thousand different phenomenal side plots. It would have been fine if the story had focused on the relationship between Christian and his now-stalker ex-sub and saved the stupid helicopter crash business for the next novel. NO. She had to smash it all into one volume so that she would have room to write even more ridiculous crap in the next one.<br /><br />Between the parties, the boning, the running away from crazy stalkers, and Ana's insufferable internal dialogue, I am surprised that either of them have any time to be contributing members of society. But wait a minute! They are not. Christian runs a vague business that makes tons of money but for some reason doesn't require him to show up to the office ever. Ana is supposedly some kind of deep, literary wunderkind but she spends all day getting bent out of shape over Christian and being sexually harassed by her boss (SPOILER: every man in this book who isn't Christian or any member of his family is up to no good). The world is effin awesome because Christian can buy anything he wants and can shower Ana with ridiculous gifts that she claims she doesn't want but never refuses. Also, the brand-name dropping in this book bugs me for some reason. I understand that certain products denote luxury and thus the presence of said products is consistent with the theme of the generous lover. However, it seems that the author is name-dropping so much because she couldn't be bothered to actually put any thought into the description of the items. We all know what Macs, iPads, and Louboutins look like so the author doesn't have to go through the inconvenience of actually describing the thing. It's lazy but it's consistent with the theme of telling rather than showing. The same is true of Ana's description of the various humanoids in her life, especially Christian. She is the one who tells us if they are attractive. When someone asks me to intimately describe the man I love I say that his nose is rounded and a little downward sloping like his father's and that he has worry lines on his face from years of combat but when he smiles they disappear. Apparently all Ana can come up with is \\"Holy Moses, Christian is so hot!!!\\"  Her descriptions are basic and sterile and immature and make for a terrible, terrible read. When I read all her hackneyed attempts at poetic descriptions I almost felt embarrassed for her. If this woman isan English major then I weep for the arts.<br /><br />But E, you say, why does it bother you that this book is a pantload? Can't you let it be crap-in-a-vacuum and do something more constructive with your time than write this review? The answer is, it bothers me because this is not crap-in-a-vacuum. This is a global phenomenon and it is bound to make an impact one way or another. I am also not opposed to people creating works that have have no real philosophical value. The danger occurs when hordes of impressionable adolescents are exposed to this garbage and walk away thinking that the relationship between these two cardboard cutouts is something to be admired and sought after. It's not that we should be afraid that teenagers or anyone with an impressionable mind will get caught up in kinky sex and end up as someone's love slave. The dysfunction is in the psychological relationship.<br /><br />Christian is controlling and manipulative but those qualities are touted as virtues and we are supposed to believe that this is simply heightened concern and ultimately love for Ana. This is not love. A little bit of jealousy is any relationship is pretty common, and there are situations where it may be right to take a stand when a partner is behaving recklessly. However, this does not extend to things like: preventing your partner from working if that's what they want to do, dictating how they dress, telling them who they should and should not associate with. I have known people in abusive relationships and all this behavior sounds eerily familiar. Christian is controlling every aspect of Ana's life without giving her any real say in his. She can't hang out with any male friends, but he is allowed to have his ex-dom as a business partner. Any protests are dismissed and I can't help but feel bad for Ana. I feel less bad when I hear all the terrible excuses she makes for his behavior. He was abused as a child. His formative sexual experiences were sort of traumatizing. WE GETIT. This is no excuse for him to grow up to be a controlling and manipulative jerk. He may be a terrible person but you are the one who is enabling this unacceptable behavior. Now we have millions of girls and women reading this who are going to think this kind of crap is okay because some handsome billionaire in a cheap novel does it. This just goes to show that anything can be done in the name of love and people will swallow it whole. This not only undercuts women who have fought long and hard to make it in careers and to take care of their families without constantly being rescued, but it also does a giant disservice to the Joses of the world: nice guys who are a little misguided and are kicked to the curb because of handsome monsters like Christian.<br /><br />I can't believe I wasted my time reading this abortion. Not only is the writing terrible, the sex repetitive and boring, and the plot completely unbelievable: this book also sends a really dangerous message to anyone who reads it, namely it is okay if he abuses you, as long as he says he loves you.
B00004RHZU|3.0|I would have liked to know it was the 'clean' version - I wanted the explicit, other than that it's all good.
B009B50QOU|4.0|Its not a perfect album, but the songs are fast paced and filled with high energy. Plenty of them are memorable as well, like \\"Oh Love\\" and \\"Fell For You\\". It is closer in style to their 90s albums. We'll see how Dos and Tre match up with this one, and how the three compare. I love \\"American Idiot\\" and \\"21st Century Breakdown\\", but its nice that they didn't try to make another album in that style.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|The third installment in the Heroes of Olympus series, Riordan has an ensemble of old characters from the original series and new finally joining together. Action packed, the pace of the novel clips along, with various mini-quests and run-ins with gods and monsters. There are some nice throw backs to the previous series with Percy and Annabeth both narrating chapters. There are some memorable moments in this book, and the ending is definitely a cliff-hanger. In my opinion, it is the best book in the new series.
B0083GDLL8|5.0|Do your ears a favor and get this album. Ziggy Stardust is like an experience from top to bottom, the definition of how to make an album full of songs that go together yet give something different for you to hear in each one. Apparently this is an underrated album also, because it only peaked at number 75 on the Billboard 200.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The book was awesome and I loved the convenience of having it on my phones Kindle app. I will purchase all my books for Kindle in the future
B0098VXBIA|4.0|Great chick flick with awesome actors; there were tons of hilarious parts as well as a few scenes that were really sweet and sentimental. Would definitely watch this movie again.

0515149489|2.0|I'll be the first to admit I'm not a huge Nora Roberts fan, as all her books tend to read the same. But, I was given a free copy so I figured what the hell, I'll give it a shot. To be honest, the only redeeming quality was the dogs. The explanation of training was overdone, the bad guy was boring, the love interest sparkless (I actually liked Simon as a character, but their relationship really seemed baseless), and the conclusion a bit rushed.<br /><br />Add to that, the writing style. Normally I enjoy Roberts' writing style. I like her use of syntax and language, perhaps because it mirrors my own in a way. But in this book, compared to her others that I have read, it was way overdone. Far too many sentences read as useless fragments or were worded in a way that I had to read three or four times to understand what she was trying to say. It also made it hard to figure out who was talking at times. I was expecting better compared to previous books and this just wasn't up to par (and I'll say that despite not being a huge fan, Dance Upon the Air is one of my all-time favorite books, so apparently I'm conflicted in my love/hate).<br /><br />All that being said, I did really love the dogs. I love dogs and animals in general, and got a kick out of their behavior and interactions with their humans. I also particularly liked Simon's reaction to Jaws, the love/hate/I guess I'll tolerate you relationship (which, oddly enough, mirrored how he viewed Fiona). I think Roberts was spot on with her descriptions there.
0307744434|5.0|It was a gift for my daughter (a librarian) to take to an author program/book signing. She loved the book and Erin's program. My daughter and all of the library staff are raving about [[ASIN:0307744434 The Night Circus]] and recommend it as the best book they've read in awhile.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is very fun and addictive and I think you should try easy to get free coins and 100% free
B00006FDCD|5.0|I thought you sent me half of the movie but I didn't know you had to flip the dvd and watch it on the other side.  Overall it was nothing wrong with the dvd and I enjoyed watching it again.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I like these match up games fairly well, but I love Call of Atlantis. This is by far the Best FAOTD I have ever seen offered and it doesn't even have any excessive permissions......Awesome. I have been playing this game every chance I get since downloading it as the FAOTD as I already mentioned I 'm in love with it and would highly recomend it to anyone who even slightly enjoys match up puzzles. It a match up game with so much more going on. It IS Worth paying $4.99,but free is always better.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I like the plot with this book and enjoyed the ending kept me reading intensely.  The beginning took a little while longer to grasp my interest but once past that enjoyed the book a lot
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I think this was a good follow up to \\"Fall of Giants\\".  I enjoyed following the families through the next generations.  I thought the sections covering the rise of Hitler and the life during the blitz were especially gripping.  I have always loved history and this is a great way to see history portrayed through a mix of fictional characters and real historical figures.<br /><br />I anxiously await the last book in the trilogy.
B001QB5S3G|4.0|Once again it is greed and save yourself. Run out on those you have converted and the big mans lives for another day.Almost seems like Geo. Bush had something to do with this.

0316212377|3.0|First up, here's another Kindle edition that cost more than the hardcover! I really can't wait for ebooks to fully take over the world and prices to align with delivery costs...<br /><br />But that gripe aside, 'The Hydrogen Sonata' is another Culture novel and for me, as with '[[ASIN:0316123412 Surface Detail (Culture)]]', it seems that Banks is running out of meaningful things to say in this milieu.<br /><br />Of course, Banks can write and his output is prodigious!<br /><br />So I've no qualms with how he tells a story and he is deft with emotional content and descriptive prose. But I think back to earlier, tighter Culture novels such as '[[ASIN:0553575376 Excession]]' and 'The Hydrogen Sonata' seems overwrought in the words per plot arc metric.<br /><br />In particular, the underlying question of whether religious truth would cast enough doubt for a whole society of billions upon billions to change their collective minds about Subliming seemed a shaky edifice to support all the activity as various characters - Minds, Human and Alien - jostle for their little slice of control.<br /><br />Plus, the motivations for the somewhat bad guy were a hazy for me. Indeed, quite a few of the motivations were hazy, but instead of setting up tension in the novel, it was just annoying because I could not get with the program and cheer the characters on.<br /><br />And some of the calculations seemed a bit off. A 200km long ship housing more people than a planet? Or the continual references to how unknowable the Sublime is and how if you Sublime even hours late you'll be out of sync with the rest of your culture because things change so radically. Given that a single universal clock is not possible, I did not understand how a whole species wouldn't be out of sync on that basis. And one Mind comes back (kind of) to live an enigmatic life within the substrate of another Mind. Why exactly? I really missed the point of that little subtext. Then there was a terrible continuity gap about 50% in which was the result of missing text. It used to be that occasionally you'd read a book and some pages had not been bound...this was the Kindle equivalent and I'd guess a couple of paragraphs to a page were left out!<br /><br />Still, there's a lot of funky technology and I esp. liked a concluding comment about the Culture's breadth of fire-power by one of the ship's Minds - it was something I was thinking and to have that thread played out so neatly and unexpectedly was fun.<br /><br />But overall it seems the fire behind Banks vision for the Culture is down to embers and the verve of previous Culture novels is missing in 'The Hydrogen Sonata'.<br /><br />Still, if you've read previous Culture novels it's worth buying because you'll mostly know what you are getting. And if you've not, there are no 'spoiler alerts' of earlier novels such that you have to read them in sequence, so it's actually a good place to start. But honestly, it's not that compelling that you can't wait until you see it on the shelves of one of those discount book shops (sorry Amazon.com but really Banks' publisher, this is down to you) and you can pick it up in paperback for $5 or so.out 50% in which was the result of missing text.

0071752854|4.0|Pitch Anything is great.<br /><br />It's one of the few books that are true to its title -- you can actually use it to pitch anything.<br /><br />While Oren's background is in the high-stake world of capital investments, I'm actually using the book to help land and negotiate my dream job, and am getting incredible results.<br /><br />I've done sales in the past and the framework presented here is quite different than what you would expect. It's counterintuitive, but shockingly effective. It's a fresh approach, and the frames, or the roles we all play at one time or another, Oren describes are true to life. Once you recognize them, you'll start picking up on them everywhere.<br /><br />If you've studied social dynamics in the past or Clotaire Rapaille's reptilian marketing, you'll be familiar with where some of the concepts in Pitch Anything come from. What this book does is that it has applied them to the business world.<br /><br />The stories in the book are really great. They resonate deeply with situations I've been in and I'm sure you'll identify with them as well. If you've ever wondered why office lobbies are designed the way they are, you'll find out in this book.<br /><br />The only downside to the material is that it can be difficult to assume some of the frames just from reading. It will take some practice and it's helpful to see if you can find personal or fictional examples to see how they operate in the wild to model the tonality and body language.<br /><br />All said, I can see this becoming one of the classic sales books and its no surprise that it has been added to the Personal MBA reading list.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I could not put this book down. I loved it and it held me in suspense all the way until the end.
B000W1V5OC|5.0|I have been and am a HUGE fan of Nightwish, I love the grueling guitars, systematic drumming, beautiful keyboards and Taraj's operatic vocals.  Now, I really despise opera and most operatic music, but holy s***, Taraj just blows my mind.  This DVD is an amazing testament to how good this band is in concert.  This makes me want to catch a show sometime.  Their soothing music mixed with occasional gut wrenching metal riffs; Nightwish has an unmistakable combination of both worlds!!  Toumas (don't know how to spell his name) is an absolute genius at writing music!!!
B008DM4OTA|5.0|absolutely adorable. my 3 yr old loves it and can do it by herself. great app! great series of apps as well. definitely recommended
B008GVD6D8|3.0|The follow up to bared to you was just an ok read,wouldn't recommend you rush out and buy it.But just passed a couple of hours

0345803485|5.0|for all of you bashing this book, quit being closed minded and look passed the sex in the story. there is a story beyond that, the story behind the sex is sad, funny, amusing,keeps you guessing, erotic in some ways, keeps you drawn to the book, makes you smile, makes you blush, makes you think about possibilities, can bring you or your spouse closer together, makes you think in general, and so much more. the story and sex just bring the book together. but for me, the story is the best part. its by far the best books i've read since twilight. and coming from me a twilight fan, thats a a very huge compliment. some people say its sounds like a 16 year olds fantasy. what teen would fantasize about all this erotic stuff in the book? this book is for adults and open minded people. im 22 year old female. you closed minded people dont know whaat your missing from these books. i have began reading the bookes 4 days ago and i am almost done with the third. and i hope that the author will make a few more books out of it. because it would be amazing. the author did a great job, and i am a proud supporter of this trilogy just like i was with the twilight series. thank you for all who read :( if you have any comments or questions just ask me. ill respond back :)
B0098VYCCE|3.0|The movie took a while to get going and ended sort of quickly. They tried building a romance and then didn't follow through with it. Ok if you're just looking to watch something to pass the time
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Flow free starts out simple and then builds in difficulty.  I love the interaction the player uses when having to drag the line to connect the dots.  It is easy to understand, yet challenging to complete.  I think this is a great use of my \\"free\\" time -- not some mindless form of entertainment.
B004A9F9ZI|1.0|The Good:<br />This is an excellent series, a must watch. Even if you are not into zombie flicks. It may sound odd to some, but the personality story lines reminds me of Twelve Angry Men.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />Normally I rip my own Blu-rays but I figured I'd give the digital download a shot since Amazon's MP3 store has been so good in regards to the digital market. Big mistake. I have my library cataloged using a Plex server. I downloaded these only to discover that they are DRM'd so that if you try to access them via a personal media server it crashes the server and client applications. This is lame and should be disclosed more readily; I'm sure if you read the fine print some where along the line it'll say as much.<br /><br />So bottom line is if you are a media junkie just buy the Blu-Ray hard copy and rip it. Commercial digital video downloads, even on Amazon, are still a hassle in many ways which is unfortunate.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to read, easy to see, easy to use, and good functionality.  Better then other calculator apps I've previously tried. A good recommendation for sure.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I think finding things is very very fun! and the manchain is so so big! and it is so so so pretty!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This was the best one yet! It answers so many question from the first two books. It also has very exciting parts and is not only suspenseful but because of the BIG ending it makes me not want to wait another year.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love the app so much, it is great. When I first got it, it was REALLY slow. Now that I use it everyday, it works fine. So don't stop using it when you first open it because it works slow, give it some time.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|As a Beatle fan, I have never seen a more concise and inclusive as well as entertaining documentary in my life, so far.  There were not many stones unturned, and would be a great intro into the the impact of the Beatles for any young person wondering what all the hype was REALLY about!!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|its fun and worth getting.  soooooooooo I regimens geting it so yeah stop reading this review and get the game Jesse its not that hard and its free so why not get it
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use this app when I help her with her homework.  so far it has worked great.  highly recommended.  would get it again.
B0086700CM|5.0|wow.  this game is REALLY addicting. I love it. buy make sure to not spend hours on it like me. lol... #goingnowherewiththisgame :p
B001AU8ZLK|4.0|I love Coldplay and this is a great cd with slow ballads as wells as upbeat songs such as Viva La Vida and Lovers in Japan.  Get it when you can!
B008TMA1LY|5.0|actually a great time management game; if you're into that genre. don't be fooled by the simplicity of the characters.  excelling at this game takes a great deal of organized thought. young children will not do well at this, and will probably become bored very quickly. I am not a Hello Kitty fan at all; I do like challenging time mgmt games. this one is interesting  enough<br />_
B007THA4FI|2.0|I loved all the Harry Potter books.  So I was eager to see how JK Rowling would do with an adult novel.  I have not finished the book.  Not sure I will.  There are endless characters--too many to want to keep track of--especially with no real dramatic point as far as I can see.  Perhaps there is a surprise ending.  But right now close to 50% of th book read, I am still wondering what it is.  Small town English politics may be of interest to some--but I have not been hooked half way through the book. Usually, books I choose grab me in the first chapter--this book has gone way beyong my grab factor.
B0001ARCFA|4.0|When my Dad first brought these home from a co-worker who had left the company, I didn't like them. The sound was flat, and I couldn't get over the fact that the bass had been reduced so much compared to the headphones that I had been using earlier. I lost the other headphones a few weeks later and began to use these. When I did find those headphones again, I couldn't believe I had been listening to them for so long. I never knew that I had been using headphones that exaggerated sounds so much. I don't think I could ever go back. The only problem I have with these headphones is the fact that I can't take them outside, they are terrible at blocking out ambient noise. Can't hear them on public buses and cars with loud engines, and turning up the volume will only hurt your ears. All in all, these are excellent for indoor use, I couldn't think of any others at this price that would do the job that these do.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great book... I was a little disappointed with the ending. But overall a very enjoyable book. Hope she writes a second book to this one.<br /> I'm looking forward to the movie when it comes out.
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|What an interesting twist on an established Fairy tale. If it's one thing I  have always been inpressed with is, originality, and for me this one hits the mark . However ,make no mistake this tale is not for children of a young age, it's dark and bruding at times. The acting is great and there are some outstanding spectacular visual effects. If I could tweek it a bit,I might just make it a bit shorter.To sum it up,I must say I really enjoyed it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I am addicted to this series. I have read the Fifty Shade Trilogy and hands down the Crossfire Trilogy is twice the book.
0385720920|4.0|Enjoyed this book just because it was so different from anything else I've ever read. Bizarre fun story that was maybe a bit racy for my work lunch hour! Quite unique humorous style of writing that I enjoyed. With just one simple sentence I able to understand what the main character thinking. I look forward to seeing the movie.
B002361MLA|1.0|Honestly, I got this book because I'd heard good things about it.  After reading it for about 15 minutes I was so annoyed by how much preaching there was and how little valuable ideas it had that I returned it immediately.  If you want a new belief system, give the book a try, but if you are just simply looking for a way to improve on the belief system you already have, this isn't the book for you.
B008FDP7AW|2.0|I love Skynyrd and Johnnie Van Zandt is an awsome song writer and front man, this effort has good lyrics, but its every song with the same sound throughout. They have a distinct musical rythym, I get that, but I believe they missed the mark musically here. Very possible that they rushed this one out of the recording studio.
B005ZMTYTQ|5.0|This movie was amazing! Alex Pettyfer was amazing! He really acted like John Smith. All the actors were amazing and the director really followed the book. He left out a couple scenes when John was practicing using his powers.<br />One thing I DIDNT like was Johns guardian, Henri, died a different way. I wish they followed with the book in that part.<br />But it was really good! I recommend getting this movie!!!
B0013TTLDE|4.0|This book was a classic Kate Morton book.  It was good, but not as good as the forgotten gardes.  This book read a little slower for me but still a great story...I love how she puts everything together!
B008ACC9CM|5.0|If you haven't watched their Britain's Got Talent audition on You Tube yet, please do so now. I'll wait for you. Make sure you watch the semi-finals and the finals too.<br /><br />Now that you've got a preview of what is to come, IMO Jonathan and Charlotte are vocal prodigies by any standard you may wish to apply. In just a few short months, they have created an epic treat for the world to enjoy. They took a random chance on what amounts to a talent show. The curmudgeon otherwise known as Simon Cowell took a look and didn't have anything kind to say, until they opened up and sang. Then, the world stood still for a moment. The audience was in shock. Their mouths dropped wide open, their eyes belied the surprise in their hearts. These unassuming young people took the world by complete surprise. The audience got to their feet, they could not help it. Tears came to their eyes. They applauded and they cried.<br /><br />I've watched that same audition video a hundred times, and I cry EVERY time I watch it.<br /><br />After joining the standing ovation, Simon's first words were \\"Oh my god.\\" No one gets a reaction like that from Simon Cowell. Later he said, \\"Jonathan, you are a future star.\\" Well folks, the future is now. Jonathan IS a star, and so is Charlotte, who was initially dismissed by Cowell.<br /><br />I find myself wishing I had known a woman like Charlotte Jaconelli when I was that age. What an amazing friend she is. She has really stepped up to the challenge as well. She started out really good, and she has become even better. These two young people are a gift to each other. The magic in this friendship clearly lies in the good hearted nature they share and show to the world. The duet is essential to the magic in this album. If only everyone could have friendships like this one.<br /><br />Let me just say that I am biased. I identify with Jonathan in a lot of ways, except in my case I didn't do anything with the talent I had. Then again, when I was young, we didn't have the Internet, TV talent shows, iTunes, Amazon, or even MTV. And I wasn't nearly as good as this young man. Is this a Cinderella story? Yes. And I am privileged to be witness to it. I am tremendously happy for these young people, and wish them every success in the world. I pre-ordered the UK version some months ago, so I've been listening to this for a couple weeks now. I still can't decide what my favorite song is. All of the ten songs are equally strong.<br /><br />Of course The Prayer is here, with Only Boys Aloud backing them up. Caruso will make you wonder if Bocelli put out a new version. Vero Amore is a \\"crossover\\" version of Elton John's Your Song, sung in Italian. It is beautiful, even if I can't understand a word of it. I like this version of Ave Maria better than Pavarotti's rendition. Yeah, I'm not kidding, Pavarotti has nothing on Jonathan. Forse is a curious redux of Muse's Unintended, and honestly I think J&C have done that song more justice than Muse did. Il Mondo e Nostro is a \\"crossover\\" version of Take That's \\"Rule the World.\\" I like both versions but for different reasons (and they really are two totally different songs.) Canto della terra is another Bocelli cover, which is done with just as much majesty as the original (and it really begs for a duet with Jonathan and Andrea!!)<br /><br />Ognuno Soffre is a crossover version of REM's \\"Everybody Hurts\\" - Jonathan and Charlotte again turn this into a completely different song sung in Italian. Chi Mai Vivra Per Sempre is a crossover version of Queen's \\"Who Wants to Live Forever\\". If you watch the old Queen video, Freddy Mercury makes it epic and grand, but Jonathan and Charlotte make it pretty, melancholy, and graceful. Finally, La Prima Volta is a crossover version of \\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\", probably most famously covered by Roberta Flack. J&C do every bit of justice to the song, making it just as delicate and loving in Italian.<br /><br />Listen to the last notes in The Prayer and Forse. That is an industrial strength voice. And he's 17.<br /><br />This is one of the few reviews I've ever put on Amazon, but I think this highly of the album and of the two people who made it. If you're looking for something new, something different, something wonderful with magic in it, give this a shot. It gets 5 huge stars from me.<br /><br />rmer and Forse.

0545265355|3.0|Amongst all the three books, book #1 was the best. I personally loved it with a lot of twists, everything being fresh and new with an excellent ending..<br />Book #2 wasn't as good as the first one as there was a lot of repetition from the first book which kind of killed it. Also, it seemed like I was reading the first book again until I was half way through.<br />Book #3 was good but not as interesting as the first one. Although it is written in an interesting way and makes you want to find out more and more but the story doesn't give enough and seems like the author had enough..Also, the way its been ended did not meet my expectations at all..
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series of books is simply AMAZING!  I nearly passed on a free download of Wool 1, but I'm eternally thankful that I didn't.  Wool 1 led me to an unbelievably rich world that will stay with me forever.  The story hooked me immediately, took me on a roller coaster ride of cheering and nail biting and holding my breath, and has left me greedily wanting more.  (Note: I've just downloaded #6 and can't wait to start reading it!)<br /><br />Reading Mr. Howey's Q&A at the end of Omnibus I strongly believe he has a humbleness that is completely unwarranted.  (And gawd but he made me laugh!)  Mr. Howey, big fat nobody's don't create what you've created here.  As another reviewer wrote, this story is destined to become a classic.
034580404X|3.0|50 Shades Trilogy - interesting books but not as good as I thought they would be. The books esp. 50 shades of grey and 50 shades darker have a lot of sexual stuff which goes on and on, pages after pages.. It gets to an extent where you are forced to skip those pages!!!<br />Although, the books overall are interesting to read, I didn't want to put them down but the third book left me with a lot of gaps!!! For instance, there is not enough information about Grey's childhood, although it was mentioned a lot throughout... Information on Christian's birth Mom and Mrs. Robinson, all seemed unfinished. I was under the impression that there would be a twist on these characters in the third book but nothing like that. Moreover, the ending was too plain, I felt dissatisfied and incomplete. The only reason I would give it 3 stars is because I did want to keep reading it minus too much repetition on sexual stuff and the sexy looks of Christian Grey !!!
0525953728|3.0|The raid that killed \\"UBL\\" is amazing.  The couple of chapters dealing with that event are worth the price of the book.  The rest of the book is about the author and the SEALS.  That part of the book will help recruit lots of SEALS, but does not make this a great book.  The book is ok; the story is phenomenal.
B007U4DIM6|5.0|My Grandson wanted this movie as we have watched Chihuahua 2 500 times this year. So we enjoyed this movie. It was a fiesta good movie!
0060557818|3.0|I nearly gave up halfway through. I'm not a fan of Gaiman's casual writing style, but the book is fun in some parts. Unfortunately, it resorts to too many cliches, especially in the finale. And there's one plot thread left dangling for some reason. It almost feels like a setup for a sequel, but as far as I know this is a standalone book. Correct me if I'm wrong.<br /><br />The book doesn't stand out in any way, but it's fairly fun and worth at least one readthrough.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The entire trilogy is the BEST romantic books I have ever read; nothing compare and I am not a romantic novel reader. I am more into MYSTERY books.  I hope the movie will be great as well
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game! good for when your bored. p.s. one of the reasons that im writing this reveiw is to get points but still, great game

0316228532|5.0|I enjoyed the story, and the way this book was written; simple as that.<br /><br />I can see that the darker side of everyday life that this book portrays may not appeal to everyone, but it's true and accurate portrayal appeal to me.<br /><br />I rarely read a book twice - I think I will with this one.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I love this app. I'm 14 and I didn't have that much money to by ALL the songs I wanted. I found this app it was like a lifesaver I LOVE this app

B008SVS3FC|5.0|What awesome writing and musical consistency this extremely talented and comical man has.Hiatt never dissapoints.He is one of a kind in his own genre. If you don't get this one you are missing out on one of the great albums of the year.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Not a bad little app.  Several levels but the initial ones are very easy. I would give it 4 thumbs ups!
B0058SNI58|4.0|I bought these after my ankle doctor and physical therapist recommended them. I had ankle and achilles surgery and I'm almost back to wearing a shoe full time. These are perfect for wgdn my ankle swells up. Also great around the house. I think they look nice with pants. I've never been a fan of how original crocs look. But these are great!!
B007THA4FI|2.0|I was looking forward to a captivating read. Very disappointing - boring! It reminded me of a soap opera.  It went on and on and on with no pizzazz.
B0043VDIAG|5.0|Just recently discovered Nicholas Sparks and now I'm hooked!I started with The Rescue and was struck by the sensitivity and creativity that went into weaving the reality of the learning challenges the child had with the romance.It was definitely an all nighter,I just wanted to know what came next, just could not put it down.<br />Safe Haven was even more emotionally wrenching.What was especially unique was the way the couple across the road helped Erin.The way how Erin was portrayed as a strong woman, a survivor,who refused to allow her psycho husband to kill her physically or psychologically.I felt that allowing him to gain the clue from the neighour's daughter was an inspired way of taking the suspense up by several notches but felt that such a sick individual turned out to be too clear-headed in the execution of his revenge.I was happy that in the end Erin was free totally and did not marry under her assumed identity.Safe Haven was gripping, a real page turner!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I'm addicted. It takes me less than a full day (if I added it up) to read each book, but it takes a year for the next one (House of Hades) to come out =/ .... guess its good Riordan has other books series to fill the void.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|The book was good. Kind of left you hanging for the next book. Can't wait for it to come out in December.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Ive read some reviews and find so many of them comical. Its madness how this trilogy has made it to number one. Im halfway through the last book and Im suffering. I dont like to leave bad reviews, and I think this is my first, but the world should be informed. This book could easily have been only one. The writing is sub-par, the charcters are rediculous, there is so much repitition that it really robs the underlying storyline of value and its just boring. Save your money and time.
B00005MK9Y|5.0|Bob Marley & The Wailers reggae sound and Rastafarian message had carried over extremely well on his first few solo albums.  Than they deliver their first album,simply called [[ASIN:B00005KB9W Live!]]. The response to that was so strong,it was clear they'd be delivering another. Though his music and message of Bob Marley had already gotten the attention of millions of people already his audience increased ten fold with reggae's wholesale embrace from the UK punk rock scene. That and the overwhelming crossover success of the [[ASIN:B000PC1JKS Exodus]] album meant that,through record sales,the message of global unity Marley embraced would reach the people even more than it already had. So the second live album he did with the Wailers very much reflected this.<br /><br />  Rather than presented his songs as separate entities as the Wailers' studio albums often did,this album presents Bob Marley's music as separate parts of a much larger whole. That often seems to be the intent of reggae music and the humanistic message it carries. Yet the live setting,with Bob and the audience occasionally exchange call and response messages between each other,really brings  elongated versions of classics like \\"Exodus\\",\\"Concrete Jungle\\" and \\"Rat Race\\",a song composed by Bob's wife Rita to life. Of course one of the main highlights here is the medley of \\"War/No More Trouble\\",where the earnestness of the songs and the value of peace to humanity is firmly articulated to a willing and wanting audience.<br /><br />  On \\"Punky Reggae Party\\"? Well there Bob may in fact be illustrating the most important aspect about this album. Punk followers of the day had as much to say about racial,economic and arms conflicts as Bob Marley did. But most punks were very angry and often hopeless that the conditions they disliked could ever change. So they became loud,aggressive rebels. Alas Bob Marley and the Wailers were,in their own culture just as socially rebellious. On the other hand in Rastafarianism they had a spiritual back round illuminating their way,one that gave them a more positive outlook that the conditions they disliked could be changed for the better. The connection between the band,and the audience who were more than likely consisting mostly of punk fans,created a musical dichotomy that not only resonated musically but perhaps gave some of these angry young people more of a mission regarding their cause.hey had a spiritual back round illuminating their way,one that gave them a more positive outlook that the conditions they disliked could be changed for the better.

B003I55BIA|5.0|This story is kind of heart warming and just a really fun book to read over and over even if you know how it ends.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Mitch Albom never disappoints the reader.  I found the Time Keeper to be an easy, thought-provoking read, leaving one with an appreciation of life.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|It was actually better than I had expected. By this book I just wanted to see where the characters went.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|Spartacus Vengeance is an awesome series that holds to the previous seasons, while introducing a new Spartacus for the unfortunate reasons we all know. I think Liam did a great job of forming his own version of the character and the whole series is great. Lots of plots, surprises, action and sex. GREAT!  I just hope the producers extend the series for at least two more seasons.  Keep it up!
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|Rick Riordan successfully wrote another great book. The Mark of Athena is worth to buy and read! You won't be disappointed!
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|This movie was absolutely terrific!  I watched it two nights in a row, because I enjoyed it so much the first time.  You don't even have to be a fan of MMA to enjoy it (I'm not a fan).  I have recommended Warrior to all of my friends as a must-watch!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|omg!!!!  this is so fun I just adore it; my little 6 year old showed me this app on her dads phone it is so much fun I thought it was boring but this is incredibale!!!!!! :)
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is more addictive than crack, meth, and heroin combined. But unlike Crystal Herocrack (which is what I will call my imaginary super drug hybrid) I couldn't always bring Pinterest with me everywhere I went. While pipes, syringes, and other paraphernalia are easily concealed and can fit in even the smallest of crackwhore cleavage, a laptop is not so easily hauled around. But then, my prayers were answered and Pinterest came out with this wonderful app. Now I can pin stuff when I'm on the go, at the gym, the mall, or even the local meth lab! Thanks Pinterest!
B009QW7HMC|5.0|The cast, the special effects, the Animatronics , the writing and the developing of the cast and new additions to TWD..............keeps getting better with every season! Can't wait for the next episode.....what is going to happen with Andrea and her new savior? How will they pull off taking over the prison? What the h*ll is Rick going to do with the prisoners who are NOT infected? Que suspenseful music.<br />Other postings are giving a play by play account of The Walking Dead from Season 1 up to the first episode of Season 3.<br />Well for us fans we know how exceptional The Walking Dead is ALREADY.<br />For people who are not fans (yet)lol.............if you do not have cable/AMC to catch TWD:<br />1) Rent the 1st Disc from Netflix Season 1 (YOU WILL BE HOOKED!)<br />2) No Netflix.....No problem! Amazon has you covered.........you can purchase from Amazon Instant Video.<br />You do not have to be into zombies to enjoy this show. There is a lot more to TWD then people infected with \\"the walker\\" disease.
B004P1JEXE|3.0|The book adds in a number of new characters and it's hard to follow who's who.  Also, some of the characters from the other book are not included which I found disappointing.  I think it's probably a transition book and not as good as some of the other ones in the series.
B008K8H9C6|1.0|It is realy bad policy to forbid people from my country (Serbia) to purchase this particular app! I purchased at least 5 other apps so far with no issues.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really feel close to these charaters. I feel like i am transported to that world when i am reading these books. I like how this being the final book did very well at closing it up in a nice little package. There was no guessing at the end. I have acctually read all three books twice and plan on reading them again each time a movie comes out.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is cool, but you have to do a lot to open new games. Some games are a little hard too :)
B007A4SDCG|5.0|I have read countless books on creativity, song-writing, and spirituality.<br />This is quite simply the most helpful and life changing book I have ever read.<br />I have since written 100+ songs since reading and am thankful I had the opportunity to be inspired by this wisdom.
0061537969|1.0|If I could give this book a minus star, I would do so.  First few pages ok and thats it.  Totally illogical and probably pushes the author's weird beliefs in God and reincarnation.  I love dogs and Formula One (which seemed to be the main items featured in this book) but could not find any redeeming qualities in the book.  Ditto the comments about being thankful for the small word count per page.
B005H0CBZ0|4.0|I've not read anything from this author before but have had friends rave about her series. it's been very un-put-downable and I'm racing through the books.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|Every few years this artist brings us back with great music and brings along the Steely Dan family sound.  Its no exception that \\"Sunken Condos\\" provides that same sound and is proudly welcomed into the Fagen archives of good music.<br />  The Nightfly Trilogy was scattered in years but overly successful in keeping the music relatively close, giving no hint of adaptation to current music fads or styles.  Fagen always stuck to the basics, satisfying all fans alike regardless of the time period.  \\"Sunken Condos\\" is equally achieving as each song is produced with strong elements from Fagen and Leonhart alike.<br /><br />  \\"Slinky Thing\\" opens the album with an armed funk session that would have even Gary Katz moving his hips. Good bass lines here and the guitar solo by Jon Herington provides a \\"Two Against Nature\\" vibe.<br /><br />  \\"I'm Not The Same Without You\\" speeds it up a little with good lyrics and a touch of \\"Nightfly\\" with the harmonica session.  \\"Without you, I now have eyes to see.  Some other destiny, a futurescape of bright arcades.  Definitely Fagen back at it! This song could clearly but missing from the Gaucho sessions.<br /><br />  \\"Memorablilia\\" is has a strong sound that could insert itself to the \\"Everything Must Go\\" album and the chorus here is a plus.  The horns are very appropriate on this track and are hardly noticeable but makes a statement when the horn solo arrives.<br /><br />  \\"The New Breed\\" is a wow of a song, good crooning guitar riffs, soul vibes and echoing backing vocals.  Amazing how Fagen's voice is still keeping it's touch!<br /><br />  \\"Miss Marlene\\" would probably be a highlight for me as the track is kept smooth, jazzy, and tips the hat to the Kamakiriad days.<br /><br />  Donald Fagen proves that he hasn't lost his touch and isn't afraid to step away from the Nightfly Trilogy tone as this one is a little more soulfoul than the previous ones.  Even though it's different from the previous days, it's definitely a strong album to fit with Steely Dan albums.  All tracks are evident with a wide range of instruments once again provided with backing vocals to give it the Fagen feel.  Do not count the album short.  The sound is respectfully close to Gaucho and Babylon Sisters would clearly make this sound its sibling in many ways.  A must purchase and would test any surround system any day.
B008IZYWXU|5.0|Nothing to add to the other reviews, except this: Freddy died much too early, how much splendid music could he have produced ? Such a tragedy.
B009IJJ712|3.0|I would strongly have preferred that this new show stand on its own rather than claim kinship to the historical series. There are a few links between the past depictions of Sherlock Holmes and this quirky new detective. Watson, however, isn't recognizable. As a fan of other Sherlockian offerings, I was left with a bad taste at what I felt to be a try to cash in on name recognition.<br /><br />JLM was watchable, tho distressingly scruffy, and LL is always gorgeous.<br /><br />Now, the premiere episode of Elementary did turn out to be better than I expected. I was moderately entertained. There were a few hiccups, the acting pretty good instead of super, the actors not meshing comfortably. Being fair it suffers in comparison to the modern Sherlock BBC's two leads, but is still worth following. Gregson didn't do it for me. Again I think I'm comparing the actor to BBC's Lestrade.<br /><br />The case wasn't the best, nor was it the worst. I'd say give it a try, watch a few episodes, that is my plan. Do I rec this episode? Yeah, ok, I do. With reservations. It isn't SH.
B008MEM24S|5.0|im a grown woman and I love this app. super fun puzzles. i spent the dollar and got hours of fun for it.
B009LZDGSI|3.0|Still having trouble with the lack of chemistry between Sherlock and Watson. A friendship is utterly necessary here and sorry, the connection is a huge fail.<br /><br />Adrian Quinn does have presence, I am utterly convinced his Gregson is both long-suffering and bored, with expectations that he will be disappointed in people. That sounds bad but it really isn't. He is world weary and interesting.<br /><br />I like Det. Bell, always insisting on proof. Love his argumentative side. He does a good job of challenging Holmes. And is nicely sarcastic. After the hospital fight scene...I hope he sticks around.<br /><br />I still cringe at slovenly Holmes, I have a nearly overwhelming urge to reach for a razor and bar of soap, with that caveat JLM is a scene stealer. His quick beautifully delivered mini-speeches..fabulous. Thank goodness Holmes was left British, and diagnosable. JLM as Holmes is impatient, intense, occasionally hilarious despite his occasionally flat affect.<br /><br />LL hasn't captivated me yet, disappointing as she is very capable of doing so. Right now Watson manages more of an interfering/judgemental vibe than anything else. I don't like Watson as Holmes' therapist. Irritating, too. The past- love interest is UN-interesting. Not buying her backstory, and worse, I'm not eager to learn more.<br /><br />I am leaning towards 3.5 stars, but I am not able to round up to 4 stars because of the W/H dynamic failing so completely. I will watch the next episode for Holmes, Bell and Gregson.
B004SIIBGU|2.0|I thought I would be able to use this app for managing my store. It just let's me look at my listings.
B006O3CZTQ|4.0|The first thing I thought when watching was: are the people in the news copter complete idiots? Flying into the line of fire and staying there. Nuts.<br /><br />The partners: Sam Hanna, Navy SEAL, charismatic, exudes confidence and a physical presence that is immediate. G Callen: no first name, rootless, victim of a horrific shooting Sam witnessed, just returning to work, earlier than expected apparently. Pretty clear he has a mysterious past. Sam&G work together seamlessly, lots of field time there, a solid bond, great fit. The image of Sam holding G and willing him not to die lingers.<br /><br />I was not expecting to like this NCIS knock-off. But, Sam and G work as partners pretty much from the first moment. The flashback gives some necessary history without interfering with the flow.<br /><br />Hetty is a pleasure. I already know I'm going to like this episode after only a few minutes. Linda Hunt excels.<br /><br />The back and forth between Sam and G is entertaining, natural. The looks they exchange hint at an intriguing shared history we aren't yet privy to. There is understated humor that fits in rather than interferes, no forced laughter, rather, a knowing, mutual smirk.<br /><br />Kensi Blye, young, attractive, competent and well established part of the team. Dom, inexperienced, smart and more than a little naive. Eric, the requisite tech expert to dazzle us. I have tech/gadget envy already. Nate, psychologist and eager to be a field agent, keen observer of behavioral clues. I like that physical beauty is not the norm here, most of the cast look like real people you could encounter anywhere.<br /><br />The case held my interest, the twists weren't hard to follow. There were a few moments of disbelief that agents would be so trusting. What happened to trust but verify? There is also just a touch of predictability, but not enough to dampen the enjoyment of the new series.
B00992CF6W|4.0|first I think mojang should update it or ifthey are allready working on one they should do mods like te kit or just mods
0452289963|5.0|I looked at this book last year when Oprah had her series with him, and for whatever reason it did not resonate. I had read his book The Power of Now years ago and found it esoteric and 'heavy going' (too 'heady' and abstract for me at the time.)<br /><br />But I happened to be at Bart's Books in Ojai this weekend and picked this up. My friend and I were there on a kind of inspirational/contemplative getaway and the book seemed fitting fare to imbibe on the four hour train ride home.<br /><br />The phrase when the student is ready the teacher appears is what comes to mind. His message, most particularly the section about the 'pain body' and the ego and their cooperation with each other, just hit me like a thunderclap.<br /><br />Now I had spent the weekend being 'triggered' by someone I found obtuse, oblivious, thoughtless and even deceptive (our hostess at the BnB type place we stayed at). I spent a chunk of time fuming over how I wasn't getting what I paid for etc. Then in talking to my friend I realized I had had this SAME experience at least three other occasions in the past! Stayed somewhere where the female hostess/proprietor was unwell, unavailable, and not offering the level of service their reviews and marketing claimed they had.<br /><br />And when I read on the train about pain bodies, how we are all born with them, they vary in strength and activity, but when they are recognized (observed with neutrality), when events and the ego conspire to 'feed them' with stories of 'they did it again! this always happens to me! I recognized what had happened to me and in an instant the indignation melted into bemusement and I did indeed observe that the blocked energy of the pain body transmuted into a beautiful kind of awareness.<br /><br />In describing my epiphany to someone today I likened the pain body to the Wicked Witch of the West in Wizard of Oz who dissolves when pure water (awareness/ presence) is thrown on her.<br /><br />Our ego is clever and fancy and often the more 'intellectual' our tendencies, the more 'enlightened' and special we deem ourselves, the more 'defended' and blind we can be.<br /><br />The triggering event that provokes our outrage contains a beautiful gift if we can just allow neutral awareness to occur, even momentarily. All the stories rush in, the list of slights, the reasons our rage /indignation/frustration/annoyance/disgust is so very justified. But if we realize through the gift of a message like Tolle's , that indignation and defendedness is not real power...it's illusory, empty, and can lead to tragedy if left unchecked by awareness.<br /><br />We observe in the present world we live in, the array of fear permutations doing their riotous blooming as paranoia, lack, defensiveness, self righteousness, retaliation, and the endless cycle of misery we know as reality and 'the news' in mainstream media. But those things grow in us too, in the dank closed up world the ego has created in us, trapping us (seemingly).<br /><br />It was the 'pain body' concept that has rocked my world and feels as if the heavens themselves opened and gave me a rope of light to climb out of my pain with. Gave me hope that I don't have to stay 'stuck' in a holding pattern of experiencing variations on a theme of the same old pattern of me 'not getting what I need' story.<br /><br />I think the term 'Pain Body' does not quite do justice to this phenomenon. When we are 'titillated' with schadenfreude, the delight of our 'enemies' or the 'elites' stumbling from their lofty perch, when we thrill to a roadside accident or our pupils dilate and hearts race with excitement in witnessing gratuitous violence, or even the smug horror I feel watching my reality show guilty pleasures....that also is feeding the 'pain body'. It indeed likes to 'feed' and its fare is anything arising out of human suffering. The ego is its handmaiden.<br /><br />The concept can resonate with many mythological archetypes including those in Christianity (I'm not technically a Christian but I was raised so), but for me I have never heard / read it described in terms that are so accessible, and in a manner that is gentle and not as harsh and cold as even some Buddhist concepts of samsara can be.<br /><br />(Tolle describes the Christ figure himself in his suffering as the embodied symbolic 'pain body' which seeks to be transmuted into pure awareness through 'allowing' and non resistance to 'what is'. (Forgiveness in Christian terms). The allowing and nonresistance can then give way to the real power of Presence (Paradise in Christian terms). Fighting and resistance continue the pain, allowing transforms it. This is the paradox of the crucifixion that always puzzled me as a child (why is it good that people suffer? why must we always look at this gruesome imagery or talk and pray about it? why was Judas bad if what Christ did was necessary and preordained? etc.)<br /><br />Amazing that the same message delivered at an earlier time in my life could not take root, but now, when I was open, it has indeed been received.y (I'm not technically a Christian but I was raised so), but for me I have never heard / read it described in terms that are so accessible, and in a manner that is gentle and not as harsh and cold as even some Buddhist concepts of samsara can be.<br /><br />(Tolle describes the Christ figure himself in his suffering as the embodied symbolic 'pain body' which seeks to be transmuted into pure awareness through 'allowing' and non resistance to 'what is'.

B008RJFRTK|4.0|With GPS added shows position well and can track as you travel.  Won't give you directions, but is very useful in figuring out where you are so you can decide how to proceed.  Search for local features is weak and lots of places aren't shown.  Well worth the price but if you want the features of a full GPS, you will need something else.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|I honestly think if I was stranded on a desert island, I would bring this album and Breath of Life. I don't think I could live without it. It's so intricate and complex in its haunting melodies and darker undertones. It's truly beautiful. Best album I've heard in such a long time. Florence is one of the most talented musicians I've ever heard. All the songs on this album are truly amazing!
B007BT0RKG|4.0|Shows maps and location with GPS feature, but lacks search feature. I replaced it with paid pro version quickly.<br />Still a handy app if you need maps while traveling.
B0058YPL66|5.0|If you think this movie is for kids- think again. I found it fascinating and it's not over yet. Bring on series two!!!!!

B008XG1X18|5.0|its so addictive.  I live on this app. I have never had issues with it and its just as great at the Pc version!! this is a must get application!
B000OIZUW6|4.0|In these days the sophistication and high-tech pace of spy novels leaves the reader gasping for breath. Follett takes you back to WW II, where we were learning the business.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Well done variation on this tried and true genre. Variety of power ups and bonuses. Should be priced a little lower, though.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The series met and exceeded my greatest expectations.  I was impressed with the fact it was brand new, in a sealed case.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|OMG1 I LOVE THIS BOOK! i love the constant ups and downs, twist and turns of the plot kept me guessing and i was every awed by the ending. im not giving anything away but all im saying is it is a edge of your seat humorus mythology based book. if i could i would have given 10 stars to Rick Riordan's The Mark of Athena
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's easy enough in the beginning that you can understand it and tougher as you move on. Keeps your interest and is great for people who like games that make you think and problem solve.

B003G4W49C|4.0|I really did like this book. it just wasn't what i expected. i am glad that it ended happy. i wont tell any more you will just have to read for yourself.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love the kindle app it makes thinks so easy an very convenient whenever I want I'll just redownload my books if I get a new device or something of that assorted very convenient and efficient
B0065GC0BA|4.0|Jojo Moyes really succeeds in drawing the reader in, despite the difficulty of the subject, and I felt a lot of warmth and connection with the characters. I found it so hard to put this book down at night and ended up with a lot of late nights as a result! It's a very easy read and is well paced. The book opened my eyes to the challenges that people with physical limitations face in getting around and even just getting through their day. I think (hope) I'll be a lot more empathetic as a result.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Characters and plot were very excellent!  If Rowling wants to write more adult books, this is off to a great start for her.  I love Rowling and I always will!
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|Other than the outstanding graphic designs, it really is a great novel. You get to know every single character in a very psychological way.

B005CMSDLE|3.0|Action as promised. Not a sweet story. Daddy lied to his girl; which may have kept her alive. She killed without regret; I wish I hadn't seen it. I want my baby to be like Eowen, Arowyn, and maybe the woman in the Rowhan village. Fiercely protective and deeply loving.
B002BZOVLG|5.0|I have at least 6 DVD's of Cosi & this is<br />the best and only one I will watch from now on. Great teamwork and sophisticated expression of Mozart Pathos which is what makes him the Genius he is. The singers are all most attractive and really know how to sing & act.And the blu-ray is terrific. Wundebar! Damiron.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I honestly loved and hated this book. I mean, the last cliff hanger was bad enough. Fans of Rick Riordan had to wait a year for the next book. We cried, cursed, curled into a small ball, until FINALLY, it came out on October 2. I read the entire book in four hours.<br />Seriously? How much longer are we going to have to wait for the next one? They didn't even say. I honestly hope it's not over a year and half, because I think all of the middle schoolers, high schoolers, and fifth graders are going to revolt. It was a fantastic book, but a horrible ending.<br />Then again, the best books want you to want more.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was a wonderful book!  It is a series I could read over and over!!! I wish there were more books in the series!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Very good read.  Frustrating at times.  I had to go back and re-read it after so that I better understood why Gideon was acting the way he was.  Made more sense the 2nd time around.  Love the series and anticipating the final book.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|I really couldn't get past a particular scene where the female protagonist makes her way out of a disastrous predicament and finds her way, covered in blood, to her shipmates and they don't really seem to react to her appearance, and she doesn't scream to the hills about what just happened to her(??????). It would have been a crucial plot revelation but it just came and went. I'm a sucker for ancient alien  theories, so I would have seen this regardless of reviews, but I must say I was a bit disappointed by the film.
B007FQDPL8|5.0|Bought this for my wife for Valentine's day. She loved it and we spent the next week watching the show and the extras. I especially like the in-show newscasts that come with it. Good stuff.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read, very funny and romantic! Glad to see Percy and Annabeth together again!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I absolutely loved it. The first book was like fifty shades and I wanted to see how the book would go. The author did an amazing job switching this book up. I can't wait for the next one to come out to see what she has in store for the end.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|If you like KISS, you'll like this record. If you don't, you probably won't. It's a definite return to form, and frankly shames many younger groups. All in all, I found this record to be a definite return to form and a pleasant surprise. Well worth the purchase.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The best in the trilogy pulling the three books all together - I enjoyed reading this trilogy and recommend the author
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun to play now and again, nice to see it doesn't cost an arm and a leg too. I would like to see more free games come out that I could download that would be fun to play.
B007N8RULO|5.0|A great fun way to keep those old braincells from dying. It takes a game that we have all played for years and makes it more challanging and exciting.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Easy to read and decent content if you like ground-pounder tactics with Navy Seal emphasis.  I enjoyed the boots on the ground details of sniper action.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The story was good, but a sad commentary on our society.  Desperate measures, adultry, job loss, ailing parents...too much reality!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Stupid bird is the reason I invested in the Kindle Fire HD. I was ruining my eyes playing on my iPhone so I needed a bigger screen. It is an addictive game, but in a good way. Lol
B003XNTTYY|4.0|Built well on the first book.  The plot becomes more complex and you learn more about the world and characters in it.  I like the way the author allows the reader to follow several characters' journey at the same time.
B008A1TIOK|5.0|This sounds like complete blasphemy. Vivaldi's Four Seasons suite is a monument of classical music. It is a pillar of human art, so to have a young pup come along and pull it apart is enough for any fan, however casual, to start fuming in anger. What will stay the mob's pitchforks is the knowledge that said \\"pup\\" is Max Richter, nothing if not a sensitive, soulful artist, whose track record consists almost exclusively of touching people's souls with little more than a violin. This is not Philip Glass deconstructing David Bowie.<br /><br />Over 13 tracks (the 12 months and a short overture), Max Richter samples Vivaldi, sometimes faintly, sometimes closely, either distilling or expanding familiar pieces into something new, yet familiar, that adds a new layer to a masterpiece without detracting from the original. And what Max Richter brings to the table proves a game-changer, at least to this listener: he gives this music an aching heart. Vivaldi's originals are unique, brilliant, technical masterpieces, but sometimes, even in their best interpretations, they leave you cold, too admiring of their structural brilliance to be moved in a primal way. Richter collapses the distance and makes the 4 Seasons intimate, heartfelt.<br /><br />If you have even the remotest interest in classical, orchestral or even minimalist music, you owe it to yourself to hear this. At the very least it will be an interesting experiment, but if you open up to it, it will haunt you long after the last note fades to silence.

B007TBZ63Y|4.0|If you've read the first two books of this series, you've got to read this one, its got a lot of action, and its fast paced. I personally thought there was a little to much romance in the book, Rick's done really well with it in the past, but this book definitely has the most, but that's just my personal opinion.
0316228532|1.0|I would give this book ZERO stars (or negative stars) if that was an option. I am returning it for a refund at Costco. It's just depressing, disgusting, and crude.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|fun and addictive little game that requires a bit of strategy as you go along. end of game is anticlimatic though.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I'm so happy they made a Kindle Fire version of Call of Atlantis. An overall satisfying, sometimes challenging game. Great for experienced and novice gamers alike! Greatest thing about this game: NO IN-APP PURCHASES! FINALLY!
B007THA4FI|4.0|I am enjoying The Casual Vacancy, but not as much as the Harry Potter books.  Guess I was hoping for the page turning can't-put-it-down experience of the other books and this is an entirely different animal.  It is good, just has different pacing and so many struggles for each of the characters.  To be honest it is a bit depressing, but picks up very nicely in the end.
089898890X|5.0|If you are a drummer, a serious drummer of any skill level who wants to strengthen their chops, you need to buy this book. Period. I attended a FSU Summer Jazz camp and the excellent Drum Set professor and Director of Jazz ,Leon Anderson, recommended this book along with a few others as a \\"MUST\\". So, once again, BUY THIS BOOK. IT IS A MUST! lol // Stephen
B008RYN44U|1.0|Well, Settle Down was catchy enough for me to download, but I couldn't wait for the fast \\"spiderweb-esque\\" songs.  How dissappointing that this is the highlight of the snooze-inducing album.  I didn't expect a repeat of any other album, but come on...Where's The Energy???  It sounds like all the members went through menopause during the making of this.  And Gwen is usually so full of life.  I, like so many others waited years for this and I guess my expectations were Wayyyyy too high!  Still waiting for another Tragic Kingdom.  YAWN :(
0345803493|5.0|I brought this book even though I had an ekectronic copy. It was so good that I had to buy the physical copy. The seller got it to my house in a few days which was a plus. I would but from them again!
B0053VKP8S|3.0|I connected the FiiO D3 between my  new HDTV and a 2.1 set of powered speakers.  When I leave the TV's built-in speakers on, there is slight delay from the powered speakers, causing an annoying \\"echo effect.\\". If I use only the powered speakers voices aren't sybchronized with the picture.  The delay is very slight but noticable

B007THA4FI|1.0|I purchased the book on its release day and have not been able to get into it.  I go back to it when I am trying to sleep and it helps me to nod off.  Usually, after a short period of time, I can get into a book, but it is not happening.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|When I finished reading this book I could only say wow, then it hit me I'm going to have to wait almost a year before I get to find how the story plays out, but I digress.  I had a hard time putting the book down, the story moved with the speed of light and I couldn't catch my breath.... Ok, ok I got a bit carried away, but it was a great story that generated the desire to find out what was on the next page.<br />Thanks for the ride
0062014102|5.0|This is  a book written for an open mind that if approached as such will make you think about<br />your place in the world. It is not meant for glib minds ready with philosophical arrows of rejection. It is a masterpiece of cogitation through reflection. It was written for the general public and as such you will find many popular examples that might not add up. So, to approach it as a scientific treatise is to miss the point that the author is trying to make.<br /><br />The author is just trying to get you to think about your place in your mind and the tittle of the book says it all-\\"The Holographic Universe.\\" If you read it as a New Age novel, you will be wasting your time. If you approach it with vapid, western philosophical questions, you will cease to think about its message. It is never easy anywhere trying to explain or interpret what is mind and what is matter and how they might interact. Or, for that matter, what is consciousness.<br /><br />So what if this model of reality is still based on the Cartesian view of reality? So what if it is a model still looking for the \\"I\\" in its implementation? So What? As more research is done and updated, the idea of a holographic view of reality might one of the tools that will assist us in chipping away at the mystery of consciousness.<br /><br />The limitation of the prejudice of not considering another angle or view of reality is what is the real limitation in perception. Unfortunately,scientific thought is the paradox that provides man's best tool for attempting to understand himself while at the same time constipating him and preventing him from continuing to observe himself from different angles of perception. For explorations beyond \\"the lure of the edge of completeness\\" that keeps rearing its head in science and in our search for answers, you constantly have to break out of that rigid box which only allows you to see the four interior walls but nothing else beyond that.<br /><br />Other ideas will come along, but this is one of the best books about man's search for explanations of reality that you will read if and only if you really, really approach it with an open mind.<br /><br />Amazing how a little book that is already dated can still contain such powerful ideas.this is one of the best books about man's search for explanations of reality that you will read if and only if you really, really approach it with an open mind.<br /><br />Amazing how a little book that is already dated can still contain such powerful ideas.

B0085Z8F4A|2.0|I can't believe I bought this movie. I wish that I had rented it, then it may not have been so bad. The whole plot was a joke. The acting sucked. The aliens sucked. The characters reasoning abilities sucked. I was pulled off the couch by all the suction. Nobody noticed when the woman came in all bloody and half naked? No, \\"what the hell happened to you?\\" Any high school student could have written this movie and it would have had better dialog.<br /><br />Sucked. Don't waste money buying this, rent it. You will not want to see it a second time.

B001EC3JME|5.0|I purchased this flashlight holster about 6 months ago and use it almost every day to carry a Streamlight Strion LED flashlight on my belt. I was a bit hesitant to purchase at first as some reviews stated the build quality was poor and that the elastic stretched out. That has NOT been my experience at all. As stated earlier I use this holster almost every day and the flashlight is in and out of it quite a few times each day and, after 6 months of use, it still looks and works like new. It has never fallen off my belt even when I catch it in the seat belt of the car or catch it in equipment, doorways, etcetera while squeezing through small spaces. I've never had the flashlight fall out of the holster though I do periodically have to nudge the flashlight back down into the holster during the day (depends on how active I've been and how many things the holster has bumped into during the day). All in all I would not hesitate to highly recommend this flashlight holster to anyone carrying the Streamlight Strion LED flashlight (mileage may vary with other flashlights though).
B008HK3S04|5.0|The Timbuk2 Envelope Sleeve is a stylish looking bag. The label on the product says that it will fit the Kindle Fire and the Kindle Keyboard. I put a Kindle Fire in it and it fits fine. It will fit devices up to 8.07 in tall x 5.5 in wide x .5 in deep. I have not traveled with it, but the label says that it is TSA Approved to leave the device in the sleeve. The colors are very nice. I usually use a cover that remains on the device, but if you prefer using the device without a cover, this is perfect for protecting the Kindle when not in use. I really like this case.

B003O86FMW|3.0|If you read the first Hunger Games then you obviously have to finish the series, there's no doubt about that. I will say, however, that the story starts to get a little lame in the second book. Collins' characters remain one-dimensional, her lack of descriptions (of settings etc.) remains annoying. And because of a weakening plot Catching Fire loses heat, only to continue to burn out in Mockingjay, until by the end of it all it's a mere smoldering ember you could just flick away.<br />Another peeve I have with the book is that Collins' vision of the future seems to have been conjured in the late 80s. Listen, Suzanne,  if kids today don't even know what a tape is, I doubt they'll be watching tapes in the future.<br />But congratulations on the bestseller anyway.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|The product was exactly what I ordered. I haven't had a chance to use all the batteries but I'm pretty sure they are all working. They were a great price, and shipped quickly. Thanks!

B005QUQP76|5.0|Well I did one day shipping, so that's always nice :P Took less than 24 hours to get here. Amazing.<br /><br />Mouse feels great, grippy on the sides. Smooth finish on the top and bottom. The brushed aluminum (i'm assuming) is gorgeous. Have only been using it for a couple hours.<br /><br />Good click distance, not too long, not too short. scroll wheel feels very clicky in a good way. I feel each scroll.<br /><br />Blue lights match the ambiance of my setup, so that's a personal added bonus.<br /><br />Sniper button is within reach for the grip I use. A hybrid between claw and palm.<br /><br />Back and forward buttons have a good feel to them. The back one, initially, felt very soft and not sturdy. Upon a couple more clicks it feels fine. I was just used to my old Mionix Naos 3200.<br /><br />This could be the mouse for you. And the price just dropped 5 bucks before I bought it. Thank you! :)
B005S9ELM6|4.0|Argo is based on the actual dramatic and secret CIA rescue that took place in the midst of the 1979 hostage crisis in Iran.  If you recall, Jimmy Carter was president and probably lost the 1980 election to Reagan because the hostages weren't yet released.  It wasn't until 1997 that this side drama was declassified.  When the US embassy was attacked, six staff members escaped and took refuge in the home of the Canadian Ambassador.  A CIA agent and a friend in the movie business cooked up a scheme to rescue them before they were discovered and possibly executed.  This film is a nail-biter of the first order.  Ben Affleck produced, directed, played the agent and pulled all roles off masterfully.  The only weakness in the film is that in his telling of the story, every possible block to the rescue that could come up does come up and at the last possible moment.  This produces a lot of tension that begins to feel contrived.  Nevertheless, it is a very good film.
B002SSUQFG|3.0|This is a nice looking -military style- watch with Malaysian movement. The price is very reasonable, however, know what you're getting into before you purchase it. The automatic technology is sub-par. If you don't use this watch for roughly 24 hrs. the mechanism will stop. If you don't plan to use this watch daily, I would recommend purchasing one with better technology or battery operated. If you happen to own a winder, your off the hook.
B006O6F932|5.0|The Monster High - High School Playset / Dollhouse, is the first major house set for the Monster High Series. It's two storeys high and includes the mad science classroom, creepateria, casketball court and lockers some of the main scenes and areas for the Monster High Doll Series. It also comes with stickers so you can decorate your house with more flair, and best of all folds up neatly into a little carrying type case so you can bring to your friends house and share the fun.<br /><br />As far as durability, keep in mind this is actually a \\"PlaySet\\" and not a full blown Dolls House. With that in mind it holds up pretty well to a 5yr old girl, and although this isn't made as well as some of the older more recognizable dollhouses, it's fun and bring tons of enjoyment. If you love Monster High Dolls then this is a must add accessory to your collection, either as a nice display for the dolls or as a fun playhouse.
B0092ZEIN4|3.0|This is the response I received from Nyko concerning the availability issue for the Playpad and Playpad Pro:<br /><br />Thanks for contacting Nyko Technologies. The PlayPad and PlayPad Pro have shipped to GameStop retailers last week. To get your PlayPad or PlayPad Pro right away, you should call your GameStop and see if they have them in stock. The PlayPad Pro is currently a GameStop exclusive, hence the February release date for that product on Amazon.<br /><br />As for why Amazon is showing it in stock on our website, we assume that's because they are allowing pre-orders hence our system thinks it is available. We are working with the vendor that provides this service on our site to rectify the issue.<br /><br />We apologize for any confusion this may has caused you, please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.<br /><br />Best,<br /><br />##### #####<br />Marketing Associate<br />Nyko Technologies<br /><br />*This is legit. You can write to them yourselves. I'm sure you'll get the same response.*<br /><br />Update (10/25/12):<br /><br />I went ahead and purchased a Playpad Pro form GS because of it's easy compatibility with Nvidia Tegra games. Although I have a couple of gripes against it, I feel that it was a good choice. However, if you plan on getting one for yourself, you should be aware of it's current limitations.<br /><br />The first impression that I got once I held the Playpad Pro in may hands was how light and sturdy it felt. My second impression was how cheap it looked, LOL. Looks can be deceiving... I hope. On the back of the Playpad, there is a four way \\"slide\\" switch that allows it to tailor to different control methods. These four options include gamepad mode for mapping games without the use of the Playground app, iCade mode for things that start with the letter \\"i\\", mouse mode for games with simple control schemes, and App mode for mapping games with the use of the Playground app. There is no battery cover on the back as it has an internal battery which can be charged via USB (5v). Other than this, the Playpad Pro looks like a standard gamepad.<br /><br />Pairing the device was reasonably easy but I would recommend reading the instruction pamphlet thoroughly before doing so. During game play, there wasn't any noticeable lag and no loss of Bluetooth connection occurred. As advertised, the Playpad worked easily with Nvidia Tegra devices and games.<br /><br />The Playground app is still in beta testing so the options are limited. I won't go into detail about the app since you can read about it on the web and the Play store. However, I feel that it's important for the consumer to know that although the Playpad has four different modes that allow it to tailor to different control methods, there is no \\"touch mapping\\" support as of yet. Popular \\"touch based\\" game titles not released specifically for Nvidia Tegra devices such as Modern Combat or COD Zombies can't be played using the Playpad or Playpad Pro. Hopefully, Nyko will provide \\"touch\\" support soon and this won't be a problem. It's also worth noting that the selection of pre-loaded game control maps is very limited. So far, you can only select from GTA 3, Samurai 2, Sonic CD, Meganoid, and Trial Extreme.<br /><br />Overall, I'm satisfied with the purchase. As of now, I can play my Nvidia titles and a few others without problems. Once Nyko release the full version of Playground, this gamepad will make a fine addition to anyone's phone or tablet.<br /><br />Update:<br />I've noticed that I cannot map the D-pad or R-stick when on gamepad mode.

B008O9V4C2|4.0|Condos is more groove oriented than Morph, which is a good thing. These songs glide along in a funkier zone than some of Fagens recent studio efforts. The usual topics are covered with an increasing awareness of aging, giving songs like \\"Slinky Thing\\",and \\"The New Breed\\" a peculiar pathos and irony that only being 65 can. In \\"Slinky Thing\\", the writer observes how \\"we went to a party, everybody stood around think in' , hey what's she doing with a burned out hippie clown?.\\" Self deprecating humor like this is sprinkled throughout the album.<br /><br />\\"I'm Not the Same Without You\\" revisits the theme of separation explored on SDs \\"The Things I Miss the Most\\", although this time the protagonist isn't feeling sorry for himself so much as marveling over the newly improved person who is emerging out of the ashes. Unless of course, he's just trying to convince himself. A steady groover with a straightforward conversational tone, it's growing on me.<br /><br />One of Fagen's great strengths is to write songs as character study. \\"Memorabilia\\"  tells the story of an older guy who's obsessed with objects from the Cold War era, a nuclear doom collector if you will. Strangely catchy. The other character study and an indisputably \\"Dan worthy\\" tune introduces us to \\"Miss Marlene,\\" a fanatic bowler. It's the little details that make Fagens writing so memorable:\\"your move to the lane child, played on my heart strings, with your long skinny legs and your hoop earrings...\\" The album closer, \\"Planet d'Rhonda\\" is also a character study about yet another wild girl in Fagen's ever growing pantheon of irresistible trouble girls. A fun if perhaps not the most harmonically exciting tune on the album.<br /><br />In his mature years it's apparent Fagen has eschewed his penchant for penning obtuse lyrics for a straight ahead story telling approach and as such he is a master. Perhaps the standout example and my personal favorite so far is \\"The New Breed.\\" An age old story about an older guy having to deal with his young girlfriend going off with a younger dude, it stings and smolders with irony, sarcasm and self pity. \\"I get it- you look at me and think, he's ready for Jurassic park. He's sweet- but it's time to find a keener spark\\". Ouch.<br /><br />Rounding out the album are \\"Weather in My Head\\" a straight head but clever minor blues whose title spells out the gist of it, Good Stuff, a noirish gangland story executed in a typically streetwise Dan fashion, and a cover of Isaac Hayes \\"Out of the Ghetto\\", given a new meaning with a subtle Eastern European neo-Klezmer twist (check out those Balkan inflected horn parts - which ghetto are we talking about?) Thus far, these tracks have made the least impression on me, but I'm hanging in there, as past experience tells me Fagen's material often opens up after repeated listens.<br /><br />The production values are of course, flawless. The arrangements are funky and  tight- every part sits perfectly in the pocket, leaving lots of comfortable space around every instrument. Michael Leonhart did a fine job producing and holding down the drums, not to mention playing trumpet and arranging the horn parts along with Donald.<br /><br />Summing up, if you are a Dan or Fagen fan, you simply have to get this album. No, it's not his strongest work and no, it can't compare to the Nightfly for consistency and harmonic surprises, but next to most of the dreck that's out there, Sunken Condos shines with more than a handful of moments of pure brilliance.ing to deal with his young girlfriend going off with a younger dude, it stings and smolders with irony, sarcasm and self pity. \\"I get it- you look at me and think, he's ready for Jurassic park.

It lays down the groove without calling attention to itself, which to me is a good thing. And of course Jon Herrington lays down picture perfect guitar solos. What else would you expect? Oh, special mention should be made of William Galison's tasty harmonica solos, a logical progression from the melodica solos of the past.<br /><br />Summing up, if you are a Dan or Fagen fan, you simply have to get this album.

I lent my dog-eared copy to a friend and never got it back...now i'm reordering so I can read it again.<br />In addition to reaffirming my believe in the way our minds and this world interact, this book led me to forgive someone who hurt me...it really puts our lives in perspective.  The part about the afterlife and the life review..and realizing the pain you inflicted on others...and past lives..led me to forgive this person after years.

B002SSUQFG|4.0|This timepiece looks infinitely better in person. Amazon must have foun the worst picture available. The face has a perfect pilot/field watch look and I LOVE the elegant second hand. Watching an auto/mechanical watch is mesmerizing and the see through case back is great to how folks that have never seen one although the movement is very utilitarian looking. I could complain about the size but there is a similar model that is slightly bigger so just get that one of you don't like the classic size of this. So far I really dig this wath for $65. Oh yeah...just ditch the band and have some fun with colorful NATO style bands. I also put it on a leather NATO which classes it up.
B0015AARJI|1.0|These controllers are fake garbage!  only 3 months old and both are useless already.  Spent another $50 on skins for the controllers and now i have $150 worth of nothing!  They are NOT genuine SONY products! Joysticks are way tighter than originals and makes gameplay suffer. Buttons stick.  Figured they would take a few months to break them in and thats why the were not returned.  Ended up taking a few months to just plain break!  Dont waste money on this garbage!  spend another $10 and go to gamestop to get the genuine ones.  Just another case of people ripping off others in a struggling economy and it is just wrong!  The product stickers on the back of the controllers arent what they should be.  They take forever to sync up when you turn the ps3 on and if you have one charging the playstation wont ever turn off.  Going to contact SONY so they can look into this.  STAY AWAY FROM THESE!!!!!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|awesome movie. made my husband and kids want the entire collection, hulk, iron man, thor etc. lol. thankfully, my husbands birthday was only a couple weeks away. it was the perfect girft set.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|this app does exactly what it says it does. it has loads of options from playing any selected music track to opening another app. loads of snooze options from pressing an on-screen button, shaking your phone, to solving basic (or not so basic) math problems. my only issue with it is that it doesn't always start up automatically with my phone after a restart. but so long as you keep that in mind its not an issue either.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This is the perfect case, better than my magnetic cover on my iPad.  The tilt and watch stand feature is perfect for watching videos and even surfing the net.  The case offer good protection when closed, but you will need to open the case to plug into you charger.  Maybe the next Kindle's will put the charging port on the side inside of the bottom in the future.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|As I knew it would be, this sequel to Bared to You did not disappoint.  The relationship between Gideon and Ava continues to develop and definitely steers away from the similarities most find with 50 shades.  This series, while it does have the similar overall vibe, is its own story in itself, given the chance you will see it is very unique.
B0090X4GLW|3.0|Loved the movie and had to buy the soundtrack. While I do like the soundtrack, but I really expected more.<br /><br />The whole soundtracks only runs 30 minutes. I wish they had expanded the length of the tracks a bit more, especially the mash-ups which all run the 1-2 minute range. And where is Titanium? That would have been a great addition!<br /><br />I did like that the soundtrack is all A Capella arrangement's and they did not try to fluff the CD with the original songs/artists.<br /><br />All in all, a good purchase - but I probably won't listen to it much once I can buy the DVD.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Definitely an engaging read.  The story centers on a government hitman who travels the world protecting the innocent from the true dangers that exist.  A questionable order causes him to examine his role in his own homeland.  Very believable characters.
0385342063|2.0|This novel fits squarely into the category of \\"chick lit\\", and it certainly is not the best of that genre. The author looked at a handbook of \\"How to Write Chick Lit\\" and spit out this novel. It's so predictable, and sort of annoying. It features a \\"goofy\\" heroine, who is so incompetent she can hardly be trusted to manage her own affairs, yet alone make a wise relationship decision. Then of course, there is the man she is currently in a relationship with and the other guy who is so wrong for her, who she intially finds completely annoying, but can't help falling in love with. There is nothing new or fresh about this story, Kinsella should try again. I am so tired of authors thinking that they don't need to think when they are targeting a female audience. I crave more than a mindless read that does nothing to pique my interest.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|Quality of the stream was less than average. Movie in general was very predictable suited for the intellect of a 7 to 10 year old.
B007THA4FI|4.0|The storyline was OK and it was enjoyable, not earth shattering, but good solid enjoyment. This is definitely not a Harry Potter type story, and I would recommend it.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|I enjoy playing this game, it is definitely challenging in a good way. It makes you try to think ahead.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Without a doubt, a most interesting timewaster. I couldn't put it down! Need more like these! The developers did an amazing job. Many thanks for keeping my mind nimble
B002PEP4SC|3.0|The Nikki Heat series created by ABC to coincide with the Castle Series is an average read.  While the series itself is very well written and a super watch, the books are average at best.  No surprises, long-long investigation story and again, no surprises.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This is a fantastic fantasy book. I would recommend it to anyone who loved The King Killer Chronicles or Game of Thrones.
B009ANAQ4S|5.0|Van is in great form here.  Absolutely loved this music.  Van always has something to say and always says it well.  Music is strong.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett has a way of developing deep characters and weaving history into an amazing story.  I love the way this book follows the next generation of the same families from Fall of Giants.  It makes you feel like you really know the characters.  I can't wait for the next one!
0547564651|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, as well as Tough's prior effort, [[ASIN:B003TO6G3E Whatever It Takes: Geoffrey Canada's Quest to Change Harlem and America]].  He is a capable writer and I especially appreciate his ability to avoid bogging down in tedious statistics.  Every now and then (as with the chapter about chess) you feel like he's meandering a little too much but then the problem resolves before it gets aggravating.<br /><br />I will say that the although this discussion of character education is very interesting, at the same time the content seemed to me to be dressed-up common sense.  It shouldn't be any surprise that being a hard worker, tenacious, patient, resilient, etc etc, will lead to success.  There's so much noise out there these days surrounding the topic of education, it seems like people have forgotten some really basic stuff, so I suppose this book is useful in refocusing people on the basics.
B008YP272M|4.0|Quite a moving account from a man who knows his time is limited.  Uncompromising to the last. The end of the book is like physically losing a friend!
B007TK77QE|3.0|The characters were VERY well developed but it just took too long getting to the<br />guts\\" of the story....  I had to be VERY patient and was rewarded for  the \\"plodding\\" through the pages!!! as most of the action happened right at the end..I Think the Author should stick to more of the Harry Potter!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Better than book one. I didn't expect the twist in this story but it was so good. I can't wait for the next book.
B00846REIS|1.0|This book was way too similar to Fifty Shades of Grey. I got through it, but barely. It kinda felt like I bought the same book twice with different names.
B008B0QH5S|5.0|For an album entitled Elysium, this offering from PSB does not disappoint.  Resuscitated from a self-perceived obsolescence, Pet Shop Boys presents monologues from the end of a love affair as a metaphor for the end of the public's love affair with the music of Pet Shop Boys? It's a dramatic idea, and I promise, the most fearless territory an artist can venture into. Questioning one's relevance and 'boy' status after being in the limelight for over 30 years is the polar opposite of going in front of a stadium and belting out \\"hope I die before I get old\\" in your mid 60s.<br /><br />Now for those who complain that Elysium isn't dancey enough, I like to remind you that's why recordings were invented. You have 30 years of PSB catalog to browse through.<br /><br />I would describe Elysium as a performance slow, steady, and sturdy by the musical maturity of self-assuredness. It also fights an internal battle against sarcasm and bitterness of age. How does one once soar at the top of the movers and the shakers, now \\"Invisible?\\" One of the greatest fear- once reserved for those in \\"the community\\" - is now a widespread fear of aging. \\"Should I hang it up and call it quits?\\" this body of work seems to be asking. This sort of honesty you'd expect from ungroomed folk singers, but not disco queens like the Pet Shop Boys. And it is this sort of self-interrogation that puts the boys many cuts above your average divas that go faster than they come.<br /><br />\\"Winner\\" sounds like some anthem one would expect to hear on Pride Weekend. Say what you will, but let us remember, even though he didn't come out in the 80s, Neil Tennant was pretty much in the open before musicians jumped on the bandwagon. He shows that he can be out about his age too: \\"Your Early Stuff\\" is pure humor, and shows the great delight of PSB where they can still laugh at themselves and their autumnal years (\\"What's in it for you? Need the Money?\\") Lush orchestration accompanies the ruminative \\"Breathing Space\\" as Tennant sings \\"far far away, I'm going, I gotta get out.\\"<br /><br />\\"Ego Music\\" basically surrenders completely to sarcasm, repeating \\"it's all about me me me.\\" It's the age old battle, do we laugh on the outside, or do we lash out with an acerbic remark about the present self-absorbed generation (conveniently forgetting that we ourselves were just as indulgent in our day).<br /><br />But an album called Elysium wouldn't live up to its name if there weren't the prospect of a second chance in the afterlife. \\"Hold on! Hold on! There's got to be a future!\\" opens the redemption act in this album. \\"Hold On\\" sounds like a glee club vocal ensemble, but what it really does it is to set the stage for classic Pet Shop Boys ahead.<br /><br />\\"Give it a Go\\" is optimistic, full of sunshine, and soulful medium tempo. \\"Memory of the Future\\" is unapologetically dramatic with \\"It's taken me all my life....to find you.\\" Swirls of electronica serve up musical hooks from a Gorgio Moroder film from the 80s, possible only by songwriters who have lived in that era.<br /><br />\\"Requiem in denim and leopardskin\\" is the crowning glory, the lily that asks for the gild, the violet that seeks the perfume. Urbane, polished, luxurious like the back of posh limousine going along city boulevards. All the great Pet Shop Boys ingredients are here: beautifully orchestrated strings, accompanying chorus, understated tempo, and carefully structured chords just the way you would want the movie of your life to close when the credits start to roll.<br /><br />\\"This is our last chance for goodbye, let the music begin,\\" Tennant sings, but the great treat of Elysium is if you happen to have your album playlist on repeat.  Because after the closing track stops to linger, Track 1 \\"Leaving\\" starts up again.  And in a metaphorical afterlife moment, you realize the song that first opened up Elysium now sounds totally different to your ears. That's what a great work of art does: it transports you on a journey andleaves you a different person with a different perception by the time you're done.<br /><br />The Pet Shop Boys will forever stay the Pet Shop Boys. They just make records that grow old, stowed away in some attic.leaves you a different person with a different perception by the time you're done.<br /><br />The Pet Shop Boys will forever stay the Pet Shop Boys.

B004ZRV3AU|1.0|The cutter is difficult to put together.  The instructions are not clear.<br />The glass cutter itself does not work.  It is not sharp enough and the blade dulls very fast. I even tried to score a bottle without the bottle holder and it did not work.<br />Don't waste your money.
B0087HT36U|5.0|This is a great game it requires you to think and allows you greater control than the birds thing.  Please continue with this game.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I love the \\"Crossfire\\" novels!  Lots of twists and turns in this book to keep me up until early hours of the morning unable to stop reading.  The only complaint I have about the book is that those two lovebirds need to quit fighting- it seems like they are fighting on every other page.  I would highly recommend the series and I really love Sylvia Day's writing as it is very easy to follow.
B000W967UQ|5.0|This was my introduction to the DiscWorld, and I enjoyed it very much.  Terry Pratchett knows just how to make the reader laugh, and the characters are likeable as well.  It was the perfect combination of good plot, well-rounded characters, and humor!  I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a fun, easy read.

B009CPJHY4|5.0|This film should have general appeal given the story and the cast BUT to be English gives it enormous appeal.  Sort of like watching \\"Brassed Off\\".  We loved it.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Reading this book was so delightful.  The words provided such wonderful mental pictures and made the reader feel as if you weree there with Belle and Lavinia.  I found myself wanting to visit the homeplace and savor the food.  As I finished the book last night I felt sad that the book had ended because I thought of it as friend.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|A fun time waster.  Yes it is free and yes you can buy coins but in the higher levels its easier to get free coins.  Its very addictive even though there isn't a real point.  If you play the game at carnivals you will love it.  You'll regent coins faster if you leave the game on.  I just plug in my kindle and leave it on and I get coins super fast.  Give it a try!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|It's nice having this movie hooked with my amazon instant video. I didn't have to wait for the movie to come in the mail and I can watch it anywhere I go. No DVD to get ruined or lost just need my account and I can watch it on the go or at home. Not to mention it's a pretty awesome movie.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Like always Sylvia captures the eroticism between these two characters! I waited so long for this book and I felt like it didn't quit meet my expectations. Over all it was well written though
B000GBFQT8|5.0|The Chronicles of Narnia children's series is an excellent read not only for children and young adults, but for anyone who is fascinated with adventure, magic, mystery, friendship, and action.  The first book in the series, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, is a wonderful tale of four siblings who live during WWII.  The four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy find themselves living with their Uncle whom they have never met.  While playing an innocent game of hide and seek, Lucy, the youngest of the four stumbles into a magical wardrobe.  The wardrobe enters into a place called Narnia where it is never Christmas and always winter, animals talk, and an evil witch rules over the land.  Lucy, her older sister and her two older brothers will enter Narnia and be known to the animals and magical people as the \\"sons of Adam and the daughters of Eve. The four learn that they have entered a world where evil has thrived and good has been forgotten.  Until, they hear of a savior, a king, a lion named Aslan.  The four must save the kingdom, fight evil and restore good.<br /><br />This first book is only the beginning of many adventures the four children will have in the land of Narnia.  My promise is that if you read the first book, you will be hooked!  C.S. Lewis again, has done a fantastic job in capturing magic, spiritual undertones and morals into a classic children's book series.  You will NOT be disappointed! Enjoy:)

B00338QENI|5.0|This book taught me so much and really opened my eyes to the way medical research takes and uses cells.  Thanks to the author for taking on such an exhaustive project.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I really like this - maybe not as much as SNM but more tracks stick in my head.  I especially like Where Are You Now- very touching I can't seem to get it out of my head (not an earworm- just memorable)and their excellent cover of The Boxer.  OK- it is all about love & loss, so maybe they've been on the road too long, but that is not a negative in music.
0316228532|4.0|Very clever premise, very complex interwoven plot. Enjoyable seeing teen characters as major players in an adult novel The most interesting character- `Fats'- lovely. The story saved by being balanced. It didn't condemn the middle classes while it poked derisive fun?  Didn't condemn anyone specifically- all of us- antiheroes.  I thought it less about class distinctions and more about human condition. Soul has to express itself someway - rare heroes like Barry Fairbrother make the most of what life has to offer while the majority  of us squabble & squander it tragically. The internet shown as a damaging force- Fat's facebook bullying- but also as a positive force for the silent sufferers - Andy & Suhkvinder  who found a voice  there & got their messages across.<br />There's a strong medical flavor to it I felt. Those ethical questions about whether we treat those who won't help themselves-  we do make circumstantial allowances for poverty, abuse, depression, mental illness - but where do we draw the line. Is the isolated teen being harassed on facebook anymore needy than the girl with a heroin addicted mum?  It's the same- everyone's trauma just as important? Excuses are made for the socially disadvantaged here but no effort made to excuse that morbidly obese shopkeeper? He could have been insulin resistant, or comfort eating to help cope with a most awful marriage etc.  But otherwise all dysfunctionality- mental & physical- (one leads to the other- inseparable?)  was exonerated by either a character's situation, their past, their personalities or even that they just `didn't get it' . The Harry Potter caricatures are exaggerations of very real people- we all have some of that in us?  Showed I thought an understanding that we all have some inner `pain'- regardless of class or circumstance- just that the middle/upper classes are shielded - and  maybe  often unable to appreciate basic important truths the way less fortunate are forced to. Fats went searching for that- was what he needed -& he got it, poor child. He had the teenager's certainty that he knew the truth, that life is so simple and he failed to see that the polite lies adults tell are recognition that it's all more complex- that we can never know other people's circumstances, so we choose to keep `inauthentic' so we won't hurt them. Assumptions fool all of us always regardless of social situation.  The shielding effect of affluence helps the individual (if not society) - is maybe an extremely mentally healthy & adaptive thing- that ability to block out ugly inconvenient truths- all important for a building of the ego enabling  growth, enjoyment, discovery, achievement  and apathy? But shielding occurs also for those severely disadvantaged like Terry -where there is an important  need to dissociate self from terrible, inconvenient- nasty  truths.<br />Was it saying- that there is often suffering involved in insight-that the great tragedy of human condition  is that those with most need understand our world best - but have the least opportunity  or capacity  to act, force change? Their suffering, subjugation  cripples them ? It takes unusual strength- Krystal (almost) & Barry had it. But its not limited to underclass as shown by Suhkvindar. Great achievers are more likely to come from priviledge- but this story isn't about that. It's about all those who waste their advantages- have all the brutal confidence & power- but who squander it- being cowardly, without insight & blinded by comfort.<br />Free will? Man prides himself on this- we make all other processes adjust to support what we decide to do. Story heavily underlines how bad decisions made, always have serious consequences & what goes around -comes around? - a constant theme of novels last century.  But does story ask, does it exist? Brave decisions or bad decisions- here the privileged seem in no better a physical or psychological state to exercise it properly- they are too, too anaesthetised by all their selfishcomfort to make an effort or to understand what is needed- they squander it. We are shown it takes tragedy & suffering to see injustice most clearly - here insight is only forced by brutal circumstance? But the sufferers struggle most to exercise free will- since their suffering emasculates them. All heroes in this story come from deprived backgrounds & class doesn't define this - so I don't think it blames the middle class- a detail that makes the story acceptable for me.<br />The medical point is made about grossly obese shop keepers who cost the health system  but they simply don't get it- & why should they. And Sukhvindar's  parents -a very imperfect medico family -a nice touch- as flawed as anyone here.  Parminder could have helped Howard if she had wished & we see how in  caring for the physical health of her patients - she terribly mentally , physically damaged her daughter-  Unreasonably she applies the same rigid punitive  conduct she must apply to herself - to her daughter who also is made to  suffer the emotional  neglect that goes with all consuming responsibilities. Cleverly we see Parminder will get off- it's council rules.<br />So many characters- I struggled and concentrated on the main ones. The ending is optimistic- the 2 most misguided characters have an epiphany  and they change- though realization is only forced by tragedy- hope for us all.<br />So much work has gone into this? - I liked it that the author democratically doesn't exempt herself from these flaws.

0062017926|3.0|\\"The Judas Strain\\" is the forth book in James Rollins Sigma series (preceded by Sandstorm, Map of Bones, and Black Order).  After reading the previous book \\"Black Order\\" I commented on Rollins consistency as a writer and about his ability to produce solid action / adventure novels.  In The Judas Strain Rollins takes a small step backward.  The first problem with the book is the story itself.  A powerful terror group (the Guild) discovers a biological weapon capable of destroying all of mankind and the Sigma team must fight against the odds and stop them from acquiring it and using it as a weapon.  Along the way, we find long hidden secrets, betrayal, mysterious artifacts, etc.  The problem is that instead of being the latest and greatest James Rollins thriller, this book could have been any one of fifteen other novels that I've read of the past year.  There's very little here that new, fresh, or unique.<br />If you're a fan of the genre or of Rollins, then Judas Strain is not a bad read.  As a matter of fact, there are a couple of fun twists at the very end that do make you smile as you read them.  Unfortunately it's too little, too late to save the book from being anything other than average.

0525952926|3.0|I'm a Ken Follett fan of many years, but not so much of this book. It's an entertaining read, and he held my interest. But, I conclude he tries to cover too much, and ends up not doing any of it very well. His World War II coverage is almost entirely about the European theater, and very little about the war against the Japanese. I know he has the license granted to those who write historical fiction, but truly doubt that the British deserve quite so much credit for the Marshall Plan and the Berlin Airlift. And many of the people are only two-dimensional: How can one imagine Volodya and Ilya talking politics together in a Prague bar after Ilya broke into Volodya's home, beat him up, and took Volodya's wife away with no clothes on. Come on! This book skims at such a shallow layer that it really isn't very worth while.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|Although it seems that everybody has their favorite \\"Phantom,\\" however, I think this is one of the best productions of \\"Phantom\\" that I've seen to date. The quality is outstanding, and the acting is exquisite. It is wonderfully adapted for viewing at home, so much so that one almost feels like you are sitting at the Royal Albert Hall watching it live. I would highly recommend this to any \\"Phantom\\" fan.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|OMG! Oh..my..GOD!  Seriously?! This is how the author is going to leave us?  Okay, I am still floored by the ending of this book -- even though we should have seen it coming -- and I am having a hard time trying to figure out how to write a review for this.  I know if you are a fan of this series, you have already been stalking other reviews, so I want go into too much detail.  Besides, if I were to go into too many details, it would spoil much of the book.<br /><br />Gideon. I am now head over heels in love with you.  I was slow going and tried really hard not to let you into my heart, but I failed. I was a bigger fan of Gideon in this book and started to throw imaginary daggers at Eva.  I fell so hard for Gideon that in his words -- \\" I won't survive you.\\"<br /><br />On with the regular part of the review.  This book in the series focused on Gideon and Eva trying to build their relationship into something solid.  They are going to couple's counseling and trying to make it work despite the obstacles thrown at them every other page.  There were some small things that happened and then there were huge things that happened.  The one big thing was at the end and literally in the last chapter.  I can't believe it and my jaw is on the floor with my heart.  I had a what-the-heck moment and had to reread that chapter several times.  I just knew I was reading it wrong.<br /><br />All I can say is that if you are a fan of this series, read it.  Flat out simple.<br />If you haven't started this series yet, then you forfeit your claim in the future of having Gideon as your book boyfriend and I claim him now with no take-backs.

B001DZLAWI|5.0|I've liked this album since it came out. Sounds so much better on vinyl as most metallica fans know the cd was way over produced. Definitly worth checking out.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|So good. Not just the action, like almost all super hero movies... But the script and actors are actually great too! It blends seamlessly with the back stories from previous movies, which were also really well done (except I thought Thor was cut off from Earth at the end of his movie.) worth buying!
B001EC2ISA|5.0|The DVD arrived in brand new packaging and I received it timely and when I was told that I would.  Would buy again.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|New album was well worth the wait. I can listen to this all day. Ghosts We Knew is my favorite so far.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Relaxing and fun...nice way to de-stress your day down to a peaceful end. Soothing soundtrack is a nice plus. Great way to end the day.
0062060562|3.0|Before I Go to Sleep challenges readers to think about the relationship between memory and life, and the difficult process of life review, and journal writing.  S. J. Watson's character, Christine Lucas, has a form of amnesia that allows her to retain new information for only twenty-four hours.  When she sleeps she loses her memory, and must begin each new day with a blank mind.  Christine is desperate to find out who she is.  She wants to review her life.  She wants to understand her past.  But since she has no memory she must rely on her husband Ben, and her therapist Dr. Nash for information about her past. Dr Nash advises Christine to keep a journal so she can collect information about her life.<br /><br />  Watson uses first person to tell Christine's account, and Christine's questions become the plot of the story.  Each day she rereads her journal.  It becomes a substitute for her memory. A disturbing sentence in the beginning of her journal, \\"Don't trust Ben,\\" makes Christine and the reader aware of hidden evil.  The story slowly unfolds as both Christine and the reader learn more about the details of her past.<br /><br />  Any novel is important if it investigates universal ideas; Before I Go to Sleep does that. It explores the relationship between life and memory.  It narrates a fictional character's effort to find truth through life review and journal writing.  Early in the book Dr. Nash tells Christine she is not alone.  He says everyone, consciously or unconsciously, maintains a running narrative on the story of their life.  Everyone pieces together memories and thoughts to create that story.  But memory is faulty, so we must constantly revise and question our own facts.  Before I Go to Sleep defies the reader to think about these issues.  We may not be amnesiacs, like Christine, but at a certain age or after a traumatic experience most of us reflect on our past.  This is not an easy process, because it makes us question our previous narratives of our own life.  We are not that unlike Christine.n life.  We are not that unlike Christine.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Bared to you and reflected to you are amazing books. I found myself still thinking of characters after I was done reading. I'm counting down the days until the third book!!!!!! Sylvia day is an incredible author!!! I have enjoyed so Many of her books.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|As sequels go, this was a very good follow up. I am ready to read what happens next in the life of Gideon & Eva.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|great game,  very addicting - thanks for letting me try it out. look forward to trying more games like this
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Didn't think I would actually get hooked on this game. After playing it for awhile I can't put it down. Habit forming if your not careful.
0871404133|1.0|The topic should be very interesting and the author is the original source for the science of social behavior in insects. But...this book is long, rambling, self-indulgent, and ultimately untrustworthy. To make his broad generalizations, Wilson ignores obvious counter examples from the natural world. Towards the end, the book's long ramble on art theory and religion is unpersuasive social commentary.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|This is a great book, just like all of the other Harry Hole novels. Nesbø has not let me down yet.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book, and I could not put it down.<br />I thought the story was good, but it could have been written better.<br />Overall, I enjoyed it, but I am not sure if I want to read all the sequels.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|At first it was confusing and it ended in a big cliffhanger. The rest of the book was amazing. My favorite part was ...
B008J34466|5.0|I am loving this album!<br /> It is not as serious as Funhouse, but just as good in it's own way. It sounds like Pink is enjoying life and having fun.<br /> Some of the songs are different than \\"typical Pink\\", they are more pop infused, but still great. Her powerhouse voice really shines on every track.<br /> \\"How Come You're Not Here\\" and \\"Slut Like You\\" are awesome rocker tracks. \\"Try\\" and \\"The Great Escape\\" are fantastic ballads. \\"Try\\" being one of her most powerful and haunting tracks to date, in my opinion... And try not to grin like an idiot or outright laugh at \\"Walk Of Shame\\", I know some of us can relate to this particular situation. One of my favorites on the album.<br /> This album has a great pace, love listening to it in the car or while running in the park.<br /> As others have pointed out, she does swear a lot, but any serious fans already know this. If it bothers you or you are buying it as a gift for someone who you don't want to expose this to, buy the censored version.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I loved this book because it have Greek mythology with real life and is in the present. I also loved The Son of Neptune.
B004ETVAH0|5.0|Wow. This was great I'll be buying more, especially Imelda May. I love this stuff.[[ASIN:B004ETVAH0 Rock 'N' Roll Party (Honoring Les Paul)]]
B003O86FMW|5.0|great book once it got started did not leave you guessing what would happen next thru the book lol  wonderful
B006XF5BTG|5.0|The book is a surprinsingly clear guide in training protocols and nutrition. After reading many books on the subject, I totally agree with the author's suggestions on excercise selection, number of sets and repetition ranges. I didnt like the splits since I've always prefered whole-body workouts (I think it is better for fat-loss). However, considering author's suggestions make so much sense I accept giving it a three month trial period.<br /><br />Overall I feel releived and confident after reading this book, Now I'm pretty sure I'll be training in the most effective way.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|With Fagen's melodic narrative, colorful horns, and deep pocket grooves - what's not to like?  Nightfly lovers will feel right at home here - with a shot of funk for good measure!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I like that it tells me how long it will take to charge up to full. Also the colors are customizable. Works great on my nexus.
0345803485|5.0|I have read many, many romance novels. Now, when I say many, I mean that's all I have on my bookshelf; with a few classics thrown in. I am pretty aware how the plot goes in a romance novel. With this book... That goes right out the window in the best, most infuriating way possible!!<br /><br />Spoiler Alert!!<br /><br />There is defiantly a reason why this book is for mature audiences only! Although it's not for the reasons that your thinking. Those scenes are very detailed (hellooo Mr. Gray!) and wonderful to read, but that's not all the book is about. When you read this book, you have to think outside the box and read between the lines. Look into what is happening with the characters emotions, not body. I read a lot of reviews about this book and all the ones that talk about abuse are way, way off. People see Christian as this Dom that only wants to hurt Ana, but that is not the case. If you pay attention he's actually not the Dom, she is. She is the one that is making demands of him, not the other way around. Every time she speaks up that she's uncomfortable with something, he stops; she doesn't. Ana is the one calling the shot, not Christian.<br /><br />You have to be able to read between the lines and see what is actually going on in their relationship. This is why I think only adults can fully appreciate this book. The writing is a little hard to get used to; but in no way, shape, or form does that determine the success of this book. I understand now the attraction 50 Shades of Grey. This is a great book, for those that will look beyond the surface.<br /><br />P.S. For my fellow hopeless romantics who read this, hold on to your seats... it's a rough ride!!!
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Arrived promptly and kept me glued to my DVD player non-stop until I was finished with all episodes! The series is addicting.
0316228532|3.0|I am an avid reader and my home is small, so I've learned to categorize my books as 'one-time reads' and 'must own for life'.  One time reads are borrowed or loaded on the Kindle.  Must own books are hard copies to be kept forever.<br /><br />Since the author was Rowling I pegged 'Casual Vacancy' as a must own. I was disappointed and brought the book to work, left it in the reading room for someone else to take.  No need to read it again.<br /><br />Rowling has founded an organization - Lumos - to help underpriviledged children.  This purpose of this book seems to be to raise awareness.  I admire her for remembering her homeless days writing on napkins in a coffee shop.  Her fortune and fame have changed her into a person who can help, and she does.<br /><br />I gave 3 stars because Rowling is such an outstanding writer, not for the plot.  Casual Vacancy has multiple intertwined story lines, a typical small English village tale with Rowling's excellent character development and her ability to create another world for the reader to become a part of.  The problem here was, I didn't want to become part of this world and there was no character to identify with, the realism was too gritty.<br /><br />Maybe Rowling did this on purpose, to keep the reader as an outsider looking in.  Is she saying, lucky you, you have a choice and can escape this mess when you close the book, so please help those who live it and can't escape? Or maybe, please don't be the prig, fatty, adultress, child beater, pathetic drug addict or evil teen in your community, thanks.  What she explores is how the 'haves' desperately fear the 'have nots.<br /><br />Nearly every child in this book experiences hopelessness and despair.  They have to become tough in order to survive. I wanted some form of happy ending, or at least a kernel of hope by the end, but it never came.<br /><br />The most annoying of the villagers do get their comeuppence.. Shirley, Howard and Fats in particular.  And in most cases acharacters' biggest weakness was the thing that got them in the end, which was mildly satisfactory.<br /><br />Here's hoping Rowling will write another adult book and find the happy medium between HP and Vacancy.
B004UID2LC|2.0|This used to be a very good app...until recent updates. The videos wont even play now. I hope the developers fix this issue.
