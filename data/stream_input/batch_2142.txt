B007EE4XKI|4.0|This kind of follows on from the novel Immortal Coil.  It explains a great deal of additional background on Data's creator, Dr. Soong.  No spoilers, but the reports of his demise were premature and he's been quite busy...
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I first saw Dr. Alexander on an interview with Oprah. I found his book very enlightening and written from both a very knowledgeable Doctor's viewpoint and a regular guy's take on his experience. I think it happened to help people, like myself, that didn't know what to believe about &#34;near death&#34; experiences.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A well-written, fun and intriguing read. The reader will be amazed at how smart and corrupt these characters can be.  Underhanded suspense at every turn.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|The moving Skyfall was an excellent choice for a movie this evening.  Certainly, glad we selected it.  Definitely worth watching.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|This is one of those games you can't put down. Very smooth game play.<br />Works on both my cheap tablet and LG metro phone
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My grandkids truly liked playing this game. It was chosen by my  ten year old granddaughter, but the younger ones enjoyed it, too.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham  stories draw me in alsmost immediately.  This one was a real page turner.  Had trouble putting it down until I finished it.
B002KDSBGA|5.0|I have seen this film more than 30 times and I still make new discoveries each time I watch it.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I really enjoy Vince Flynn. His characters and stories are always very captivating. This book has some high points but I usually can't put his books down. Some parts were a bit slow. I still would recommend it.
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|Joss Whedon managed to make the movie with the exact feel of the comics I grew up on. Just an amazing and entertaining movie, with fresh dialogue.
B00683JK9K|5.0|I am impressed on how well this works even on my limited tablet. Makes me want to upgrade to a tablet with some real guts.
1400067820|5.0|The main premise of the book is that organic systems, including economic systems, need some stressors in order to improve and grow. Economic-wise, it also provides a strong case against all central managing of the economy in order to prevent every small slowdown, and by that, preventing the system from cleaning itself. Eventually, by postponing every small slowdown we end up coping with a huge economic crisis. Taleb covers many different aspects, and not only economics, in which he shows that small systems are comparatively better at coping with outside shocks.<br /><br />&#34;Antifragile&#34; is a thought-provoking book and, as opposed to other reviewers, I found it to be for the most part fairly readable.
B004LROUNG|5.0|This story was another facinating story.  I look forward to future books by this author as his choice of topics always seem to capture and hold my interest.
159420411X|4.0|Nate Silver has become quite famous by using statistical tools to make predictions, from baseball to his success in forecasting the last presidential elections. In the midst of so much ‘fog of election’s war’, he was one of the few sane voices that relied on fair analysis of pooling data to predict results in every state. That we have these days so much science but also so much ‘noise’ is the genesis of his book.<br /><br />Just the first few pages of the book, comparing our era of over-information with the crisis after the advent of publishing (Gutenberg’s Bible) is worth its price. But this is also a long read, covering not just politics and baseball, but also meteorology, geology, economics, epidemiology—even poker and chess—sometimes in such excruciating detail that even knowledgeable readers will start toying with the page’s edge and considering skipping the next fifteen pages (and their corresponding plots).<br /><br />Still, most of the book manages to maintain reader’s interest—especially when stays away from trying to be a textbook about each subject—and at times is quite original. Comparing what’s said about poker players and Wall Street leads to a deeper understanding of how much our economy resembles a money game. Oddly, the author doesn’t spend much time in game theory, and perhaps loses the opportunity to develop a general view of how we get fooled by noisy data (Fooled by Randomness by Nassim Taleb has covered this better.)<br /><br />All and all, Silver’s book takes us in a broad journey to find meaning through science (raising signal/noise ratios?). Perhaps we should all read a book like this every 100 hours of watching the news’ corrupted idea of how to make sense out of reality.<br /><br />If you still believe anyone who tells you that unemployment ‘increased’ from 8% to 8.1%, you must read this book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I thinks its great . My sister told me about it said it was really good and she was right I<br />would recommond it
B003F1WM2K|5.0|I was not familiar with Patti Smith's story and her path to music through art.  Intriguing and heart-inspiring to read about her undying loyalty and love.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|I was a little disappointed in this book. Hopefully the third book will have a more solid direction . :)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abby is a great series.  I adore England and that time period, when elegance and proper behavior was the norm,and<br />there was a sense of morality and ethics, unfortunately missisng in today's society.. What a shame!! But I am old fashioned and love it.  Life is a series of happiness and great sadness.  Downton Abbey is a history of life in a certain time and it was wonderful seeing it.  I look forward to next season.<br />  Thank you.<br />  Marjorie Carlson
B005LAII80|4.0|if you are a fan of the movie - The Raid: Redemption, you should like this.  it is a similar story line. If you are a fan of the Judge Dredd comics?  Hmm, you might like this, for the action, but, there is very little of the Mega-City One vibe or much to any of the odd ball culture that is presented in the comic.  Frankly, you could have put the actors in just semi-future looking assult gear and played out the movie without any Judge Dredd connection at all.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This is definately an interesting show.  It combines the weird science stuff and the humor/zaniness perfectly.  I highly recommend watching it!
B009NPK1IO|4.0|I got hooked on GG early on, but wearied of the continued corruption of all my favorite characters.  The end put it all to rest and made it the enjoyable romp it was always meant to be.  A fun and funny last scene has Rufus next to someone making a cameo and it couldn't be more perfect!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It Is so fun and a huge addiction and is so fun for kid a and adults also it is free and something to waste time.
B004SBX112|5.0|Very fun game.  Even my 2 year old grandson LOVES it!  Lots of holidays included, with lost of surprises in the actions!
B0073XORCY|5.0|I was very interested in hearing music intended as a sequel to a famous prog epic from the '70's. other artists have successfully reprised early works: Joe Walsh includes Funk 50 on his current release; Keith Emerson reworks early ELP epics on his current release. Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson brings much to the table with this update to the fictional author of the original Thick As A Brick. I really enjoy this album. The songs are identified as indivdual pieces, but the songs do blend easily into a single extended suite as the first. This is not an earth shaker as the first TAAB was, but a well thought out and executed musical epic for this decade.
B005HI4LLY|4.0|A horror comedy is a difficult thing to make, and this one was done well. The story turned the over used tale of a group of teenager friends heading out into the 'sticks' to party on its head.
B005COO1X6|4.0|What can I say? Steven King wrote this story and it just his style. I did like it and would recommend it to anyone that likes Steven King.
B002VH7P4O|5.0|Fantastic , great packaging concept, excellent videos, pristine sound. Short of getting the whole collection on vinyl this cant be beat.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|I purchased this simply because I own all of the Alien films and I must say it wasn't quite what I expected. Originally it was intended to be a prequel to Alien, but Ridley Scott decided to make it a stand alone film. It didn't stand very well. It was interesting but not enough to rate it on par with Alien and Aliens. Good try but probably should've stayed with the original plan. It would have been more interesting as a prequel.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|loved this game my nephews love it. fun for the whole family. great visuals and sounds. easy to play for the adults.
B003UESJFG|5.0|Great movie at a great price. 2 formats for any player you may have. Great movie for kids or adults.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I can't wait to read the next one. Gideon seems so hot. This book made my heart hurt right along with the characters.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Very exciting game. Kept you wondering what was next. Recommed to anyone over the age of at least sixteen. I don't think children to young should play.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved the series. Can't anticipate what will happen. Many unexpected twists and turns and your heart and emotions are wrenched with them!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun for everyone...lots of different games to try your skills. A must have app for your kindle fire.  I love these games,  they are addictive.
B00B7G23KQ|2.0|I think the industry has taken this too far or &#34;heaven forbid&#34;, I'm too old for the same thing over and over.  Please come up with something new or change story lines ever so often for writers.  The script writers may new to rotate every couple of months to keep their brain cells alive.
B007QNRMUU|5.0|Love is a four letter word showcases Mraz's exceptional talent. The hidden track \\"Coming Over\\" was one of my favorites when I saw him on his most recent tour. It's always great to find albums where there are several great songs. Others on this album include \\"93 Million Miles\\", \\"I Won't Give Up\\", and \\"The Woman I Love.\\"
B0063IH60K|1.0|if you want inappropriate ads, this game is for you!<br /><br />i was immediately turned off by the ads. i did not even try the game. sorry.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This story gives a lot of background into the life of a navy seal.  And goes into some detail on the night the killed bin laden.  Gets into what the author was feeling leading up to , during, and after the raid on bin Alden's compound
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Pretty good game, wish it had been longer. Good graphics and good story line. Did not disappoint which is great since I paid for the game. Played on my kindle and it didn't take long for it to load after I purchased it.
B009KY5OGC|5.0|Just brilliant. I first read this book 30 years ago( I was 18 years old) and I loved it. Today it has the same impact.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a really really good game and I love to play it everyday<br />I would recommend this game for you
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is an awesome game for people to not only learn how to care for a horse but also get to know to know one. My only complaint is that, it has a lot of problems at times . But still a great game
B00B19DMUE|3.0|Definitely a take on the exorcist. But there was an X-Files episode that involved a Jewish exorcism -- in a hospital -- with a possessed child. Still it is entertaining and suspenseful. I think you will like it.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Very intriguing complex story. Adults only for sure with some psychology to go with it. Can't wait to read on.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Our daughter showed us this game on her phone &amp; got the whole family hooked. I loved it so much I downloaded it on my kindle..great toddler game too! keeps them entertained for at least as long as a checkout line!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was very descriptive and opened up the reader to new images I would say that this book would be a five.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game is neat. Very fun and challenging. If you like detective type games you'll like this... Very entertaining! Like the graphics.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its really fun and easy to use. and you even get to see what its like to take care of a horse I would recommend this app!!!
B000TDFUQC|5.0|I had it in english but my mother wanted to watched also in spanish.  The translation is gread and the picture wonderful.  Yes, I will recommended with my eyes closed.
1579128955|5.0|This book is great, wonderful pictures and examples of what the elements are used for. My son of ten loves it - great for budding scientists.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|How this got to be so popular is a mystery to me.  From the first page, it was a lousy read and I'm sorry I wasted my money.  The fact that it appeals to so many women leaves me mystified - who likes pain with sex?  I think it is sick, I didn't even finish it.  I like a good love story as much as the next person, but this was not about love, it was about perversion bringing satisfaction.  Ugh!
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|thatz all U gotta know !!! it was a fun movie,,,i liked it alot,,,marky mark is cool !!!!! the bear is classic
B009SJ3H8Q|1.0|we watched this series through our xbox and it was just awful. don't know if it's xbox or amazon, but we won't watch on our xbox again. we have a samsung tv and says we could download prime vido app and it doesn't show on our tv.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I kept needing to remind myself that this book was not fiction but a true story. It was a adventure worth reading. It was a fast read because I couldn't put it down.
B009GIPDQS|5.0|I have all ways been a fan of John Grisham. All his books are very good.This book is another great works
B001E75QGG|5.0|In the tradition of Indiana Jones this was as good as it gets with all the action you would expec
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I like this app. It's a lot of fun to play with. You can make your own meditation or yoga music with various sounds.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|One of BBC's best! Thoroughly enjoyed it and can't wait for season 4.  The interior of the house and scenery was superb
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Having missed out on Downton Abbey when it first aired, we were very excited to see it on Amazon Prime. It is an excellent show and there is no sacrifice in quality going to season 2. It had a lot of hype. It did not disappoint.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Amazing show we are hooked!!!  Can't wait to see what happens in the current episodes!  My wife doesn't even like zombie shows and she loves it!!!
B0094M0P4G|2.0|Except for her opening song, Miss Christina is not very good at what she does.  There is not screen appeal or acting ability.<br />Cher is the star, but she took a back seat.  Shame really.  She has a lot more experience as a diva.
B00846REIS|5.0|It reminds me of fifty shades of grey however it has a twist in it. I'm loving it. I can't wait to read more.
B009VMN3RA|5.0|What in God`s name is wrong with your &#34;Mom&#34; . Oh my good God she a sick woman ! Sachi your Mom and Dad sure do think a lot of them self `s . I got to say I feel so bad for for you . You need to keep you kids away from her . Just for get her she not in any was good for you ! Let her keep up with the ET`s .........  Be Happy with Your Life and kids . Good Luck .
B005LAII80|4.0|I don't know what people are looking for when they go to a movie like this. I had friends say \\"It isn't any good...all it has is action...etc\\". What's wrong with that?!  This is by no means an \\"Oscar winner\\", but it is entertaining! I know some people I know complained that Dredd never took off his helmet. However that's how it was in the comic books so I wasn't put off by that. Anyway, if you are looking for an action movie this should do, and then some.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Whats going with Rick... losing his wife...  have to worry all the time.. his son... new baby...<br />So he hallucinates is dead wife... but I think the attack at the Prison will bring back...
B00821PCJS|5.0|An enjoyable series, which Noah Wyle carries very well.  We particularly appreciated the emphasis in each of the episodes on the dedication of Wyle's character to his family.  In fact, a major theme of the series is the growing understanding of how important human relationships are to survival.  This is much more than a simple science fiction disaster story.<br /><br />Wyle also carries the series with his innate good nature.  His character shows that the discipline of a good warrior and the wisdom of an history scholar aren't incompatible.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|Good book, can't wait to read the next book! Great high adventure, love the setting. Gave it 4 stars for length, could use a little more character development.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Good  The young kids loved it.  But I am a fan of West Side Story etc.  dated my self<br />But they did a good job
B000SEGMAU|5.0|Awesome<br />Amazing<br />Life changing<br />Beautiful.<br />I have referred this very book to every single person I value in my life.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great. i love it and i am not easily empresed. so i give this app 5 stars. i think that is deserved is given. .,..........;)  GO TEMPLE RUN 2!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00881VLCE|4.0|I've only had it a few days but it's so cute and more fun than I originally anticipated. I'd definitely recommend.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love this book.....<br />The story very exciting.  I will read this one over and over.  Truly amazing story from start to finish.
B00A757EFW|1.0|This app is RUBBISH the controls are terrable to navigate and you can't even see pac-man when you swipe. Don't buy it also because it quits after level one and 3/4. VERY disappointed.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Like this actor  did a great job  But if they make another I will watch it<br />Love this kind of movie
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Highly recommended. Enjoyed it completely. I don't want to ruin it for anybody but you'll be saying really? I can't believe it. When will he learn?
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|The story line is good, but it isn't very long. Graphics are good. A lot of the hidden objects were very hard to find. I had to use the hint button many times to find the objects that were so well hidden. There is not much of a zoom just about useless. I still enjoyed the game. This G5 company has put out some great games, but lately it has been putting out a lot of average to below average games.
B005HSL626|5.0|Graphics are great on Galaxy S3, great way to pass time or keep my neice occupied. Don't bother with the &#34;Rewards,&#34; they are just advertisements.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I was hoping to be convinced there is an after life, a heaven, but this book didn't do it for me.  I think there is something in science to explain what happened...they just don't know it yet.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Loved this book! It's about a 5-6 hour read and once you start you won't stop till you're done. It's a little like an extended episode of mcGiver with lots of innovative problem solving and seemingly good hard science PLUS Andy Weir can write! Highly recommend!
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|bad like the rainforest cafe in menlo park mall in Nj don't go or get it just helping u out
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Great Concert!  They still got it.  all the great oldies and some new thrown in.  the band is so diverse.  their music is a wonderful mix of voices, instruments  and talents.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I play it all the time. Love the graphics, the way the cards move, you name it. I have it on my kindle.
B009LK6JS2|4.0|Would like to see a heading feature. I notice when you have to circle, you can't look back to check your heading against the lay up heading for the carrier landing. Making is necessary to go around again. Good detail.
B006H3MJ7G|5.0|If you enjoy Prince Royce's music, then you will love this.  Thoroughly enjoyed this.  I listen to it over and over again.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved reading this book, the only problem is that you don´t have part two and three in Kindle editions!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I was hooked by page 6, and did not want to put it down. The struggle of the family was incredible. The author's writing style was such that I felt he was telling me the story. It's a must read!
B009U9S6FI|4.0|Mr. Frankl found a new reason for bearing suffering and injustice with courage, and has earned serious attention from philosophers for that reason,  His book is thought-provoking, and worth the time to read it.
B00000J0O2|5.0|Should last for the rest of the life of the printer.  what more can i say about it.  that's it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I purchased this while on vacation with grandchildren- They loved it.What can you say about a game that you can't wait to play. The challenge is all consuming -You know its not about winning or losing just playing.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|Really enjoyed this.  If you love Garth Brooks you will love this.  Thoroughly entertaining from a great performer.  Would recommend this.
B000059ZLH|5.0|Had this concert before and was lent out . So good it was never returned !!! Had to get it again !!! One of the greatest concept albums & live shows EVER !!!
1878424319|5.0|An easy and understandable read that makes a lot of common sense. Most of the teachings, I already knew but it put it in another perspective that really clicked for me. There were many parallels to AA's 12 Steps. Mostly, I appreciated being able to share it with my 18yr old son who has done little spiritual exploration or self introspection and he was able to understand and relate to the readings and benefit from them. I found the Third Agreement, &#34;Don't Make Assumptions&#34;, extremely powerful and helped our whole family improve our relationships with, and understanding of each other.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love this app! its so much fun, and life like! takes a while to load but it pays off!(: download it forsure!
B0038P59A0|5.0|This is a nice, robust version of the Arthur Conan Doyle character as he was written in the books.  Robert Downey, Jr. Is superb in this roe, and Jude Law a ought proper Dr. Watson.  The friendship between the two characters is clear.  In the old Basil Rathbone series, Watson was reduced to an associate of Holmes, but here, they rly on each other as true friends would.  Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler was marvelous, and Robert Downey, Jr.'s interactions with her were great.  I looked forward to seeing them together.  All in all, this is a worthy and enjoyable way to pass the hours.
B0033VUH6A|4.0|Very good casting. Loved Jeremy Renner. I thought it was a little slow at points, but overall I enjoyed it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book. Typical Nicholas Sparks novel that didn't disappoint. Fast read. Really similar to The Lucky One in story/plot. Still not a good a The Notebook. But what will ever top that? Still, I recommend this book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Want to try something new or just to explore. This is a wonderful sight for anyone including alot of men. From interior decorating to cooking to jewelry. You can not beat this site.
B008X9Z37A|5.0|Love this cover. No need to zip or unzip, just open. Fits perfectly. Perfect for the price. A great value.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Finally, they went back to the original Bond plot and not the overly violent crap of the first 2 Daniel Craig Bond movies.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I absolutely love this game!  Once I get started, I can't put it down!  Very challenging and captivating!  Everyone should try Flow Free!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is real not some little fake crap it is like a real horse I cant stop playing it I wish I had a horse but with this game it feels like it
B0098JJYZQ|5.0|an absolutely brilliant read, great love scenes. I would highly recommend reading it, I will definatley be reading this one again
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I think that this was Mr. Grisham's best book in many years.  It had a number of intricate twists and surprises. As usual with a Grisham book it was hard to put down and it did not disappoint.  The main character was intriguing as he was a very intelligent and enterprising.
B00BF8OYJO|2.0|This was quite disappointing, very short and i was finished within 5 minutes wasn't expecting it to be so short....
B007HACDLK|5.0|Riveting.  Good fast read.  Vince Flynn and his Mitch Rapp are American heroes.  We need a Mitch Rapp today.  What would he think of the Benghazi fiasco ???
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|addicted to it!  also love the season version.  my son who is 7 also loves it. we have it on 3 different devices!!!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I didn't really like this book. Mostly because you can't find anything in it! When you click on the go to thing you can't type<br />in words.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|If you're tired of being lulled to sleep with modern fiction and looking for a stimulating Intellectual challenge... this is the book for you.  It will challenge your beliefs about humanity, the universe and everthing within - and without it.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Lee Child and Jack Reacher totally have my attention.  This book is fast paced, easy to read and of course like usual very intriguing.  It was a good historical picture of Jack Reacher.  A great first Lee Child reader.
111846446X|5.0|Eben Upton is the co-creator of the Raspberry Pi computer.  Here with Gareth Halfacree he has written a comprehensive guide to setting up and using it.  The book is beautifully organized and covers everything one needs to know about this little marvel of a computer, along with chapters about programming in Python, etc.<br /><br />I strongly recommend getting this book if you are interested in the Raspberry Pi--it is an ideal user manual and more.
B004SBX112|5.0|Thanks for having this Ad-Free version of Angry Birds Seasons available when I wanted to buy it. Would definitely not hesitate to order games again from Amazon.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and didn't think I would.  I had just seen the movie, Zero Dark Thirty and wanted to know a bit more.  This book gave me that, but also, showed me the path one has to take to become a Navy Seal.  I found that part more interesting, than the parts about The Mission.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved this book. It was very different from other books I've read. I would suggest this to be read by all women =)
0307749495|4.0|Very good audio book. One of his best. We have many of this author's books and have enjoyed all.Very detailed.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Always looking for apps to pass the time and this is one of the best ones.  With different challenge levels, you make it as easy or difficult as you like.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Everything about Downton Abbey is wonderful - story, scenery, the development of characters --- this is what I enjoy watching.
B008476HBM|5.0|This was my third time to read this classic 19th century romance novel; as always, it was a delightful read. The witty banter, passion, and humor are expertly woven together to produce a story that is not only interesting, but riddled with new, interesting words and facts (this was where I learned what an entail was, long before Downton Abbey). I would recommend this to anyone!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|the temple run 2 is better than the original temple run. the new version has a few glitches every so often. it wont let me play when I don't have wi-fi which sucks
B00BESLT6G|3.0|I thought the movie was good. It took up for the first one left off and had the Same errie looking characters.
B000FC1HQY|5.0|I really enjoyed reading about the incredible experiences she<br />Had growing up and in such an amazing place as Africa.  I think<br />Her parents were quite brave to bring children to such a place<br />But really paid dearly for that choice.
B007KFZ7RE|5.0|I recently purchased &#34;Time's All Gone&#34; by Nick Waterhouse as a gift for my husband.  He seems to enjoy it very much.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|My purchases are always quick to arrive without error or without harm,. The billing is always correct. One of my favorite Ap's of all times! My favorite on line shopping site.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|An excellent, interestingly written coming of age novel. The epistolary style allows the reader to insert him or herself more easily into the story, since it often seems that Charlie, the main character, is writing to us. I read this book several years ago, and upon rereading it I found the frequent references to drugs and alcohol a little unsettling, particularly since the target audience is high school students. However, the overall message of being accepted for what you really are is worth looking over some of the less poignant moments.
B006K2WXOI|5.0|I really like Christmas stories . Most kids my age do not believe In Santa. I am I seventh grade . This was a really good story
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|I got this for $4.99 on Amazon lightening deals as a spare Christmas gift.  I couldn't help myself and just had to open it. Needless to say it has not left my car since then (about three months).  I LOVE this album! Amazing and fast shipping!
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I have been enjoying this series as a result of watching Downton Abbey.  Certainly not as dramatic, but enjoyable none the less.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Always love a John Grisham book and this was no exception!<br />Great characters and could not wait to find out the ending...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i absolutely love this game. my son loves it to. I would recommend this game to everyone.I wish it was easier to get more gems though.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Could not put the book down.  I was in love with most of the characters, as if I knew them personally.  Read the book before seeing the movie.
B003F3PMYI|5.0|I just saw Shawn speak in Dallas and he is engaging, FUNNY, inspiring and delivers the message effortlessly! I recomend this book for any age and any group that needs to understand how Happiness should come first to attract everything else
B0085MNZ66|5.0|Fun, challenging puzzles, but the last puzzle on each level (especially the higher levels) required you to leave your finger on the board for up to several minutes as you moved to figure out the solution. If you accidentally removed your finger, you had to start over. The solutions were complex enough that you couldn't simply figure them out in advance and then quickly move through the solution. My finger got very sore and it was frustrating if you had almost solved the level and then your finger came off.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|Very entertaining novel, different from others by the same author, in that ending is good  Story is narrated by a woman (unusual in a novel written by a man). Narrative is entertaining and language is handsome.<br />It is sort of a spy love story.<br />I enjoyed this novel much.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|A very important documentary. Please take the time to watch this when you can dedicate all your attention to the information that is in this movie..it will blow your mind and change your life!!
B0026O475M|5.0|very good family movie,tom hanks does an awesome job playing roleloved it when tom hanks was trying to start the fire on the island and i liked when he was talking to wilson the ball
B009VB97EY|1.0|I saw countless ads for this movie, and it looked entertaining.  Matthew  McConaughey's  sly little grin and quip about all the \\"law-breakers\\" in the audience looked promising.  Joe Manganiello was very handsome and witty in interviews, so I ordered the dvd.  I thought it would be light-hearted and fun to watch.  It wasn't.  It turned out that that brief clip of McConaughey was the only good part  he had in the movie.  And Joe Manganiello?  If you look closely, you might spot him in the background occasionally.  I do not find Channing Tatum at all attractive, and it was his beefy bod that was in most of the scenes.  The plot, such as it was, seemed more a chronicle of a character's descent into addiction than anything else.  By the end of the movie, I really didn't care what happened to any of these people!
B009GEAPYW|5.0|The Dark Knight Returns delivers in a way that no other comic-book animated film has. It is a must see.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I use this to consolidate my personal and work calendars and the calendars of my wife and kids. Does a great job. Better than stock Google calendar. It's the first app I install on new devices.
B005ZMUTZ4|5.0|I recommend you read my review of \\"Toy Story\\", which reviews the trilogy as a whole.  In this movie, Andy, the owner of the toys, is going to college and the toys have an idenity crisis.  In truth, Andy and the toys grow-up.  The first evil toy is introduced.  And, if you have watched the first two movies in the series in the order they were made, you will understand the greatness of this trilogy.
B00BESM14U|5.0|A beautiful story.  The young actors do a great job telling the story of the trials that many young people endure during high school.  Made me laugh and cry and cheer.
B001NLKXK2|3.0|the perspective of this book is really neat. i like how the reader &#34;experiences&#34; the journey with alice. however, overall i felt the book was missing something and i couldn't even say what. while it was interesting to learn about early onset alzheimers, i don't think i would reccomend this read to anyone else.
B009CF7GRY|3.0|It was worth watching but there could have been more dancing.  The original was much better.<br />Not one of those movies that I would watch again.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|Some of the pop ups are annoying but not as bad as some other games I have gotten for free.
B008458O3S|5.0|This game actually started of too slow and easy for me. After completing all of the regular levels, I still didn't think it was that challenging (only medium difficultly). But the bonus levels were much more fun for me, because they finally presented a good challenge.
B0030IIYYS|5.0|I recommend you read my review of \\"Toy Story\\", which reviews the entire trilogy.  As far as \\"Toy Story 2\\" is concerned, this movie is better than \\"Toy Story\\", but not as good as \\"Toy Story 3\\".  This is a very great movie.  As the \\"child\\" in the movies grows up, the toys Grow too.  Watching this happan is why this is the greatest trilogy in Hollywood history.  For the a Adult in every Child and the Child in every Adult.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|This is a fun game, but one gets tired of it soon, yet it is fun to play.  Fun to turn the cube.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|i love this angry birds! much better than the seasons version, in my opinion. my 5 year old loves to play as well.
B004U8VX2M|1.0|Unresolved technical issues with this series.Sound and the color is absent from some. Hopefully Amazon will eventually correct this, because the series itself is worth watching. but for now...don't waste your money.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a good game it is osom I love I do not have to be morio the floor in my zombie road to draw as the first
B0079KGAOY|3.0|I just don't get it.  Warner Bros. spends the time & money to release these movies on Blu-ray discs, but doesn't make it clear which version is included and is still charging a premium?  Really?  I know Americans consumers are considered gullible, but I'm insulted!  Is there no expectation we'll do any research at all about what we buy?<br /><br />\\"Oooh, shiny box with blue label - MUST BUY NOW!\\"<br /><br />The questions I have are the following:<br /><br />1) Are the director's cuts of each movie included?  And with the storage capacity of the Blu-ray disc, shouldn't the theatrical version of each also be able to be included?  I mean this isn't the Lord of the Rings, with all of it's special effects.<br /><br />2) Has the audio been remastered for HD?  That was a major complaint with many of the DVD releases.  Some had Dolby, some had DTS, some had both and some had nothing but stereo 2.0 but there was a broad, somewhat inconsistent range across all of the releases of the 4 movies.  In the picture provided, first off, it's a Canadian release, which I really don't know if it makes any difference.  But at the bottom, it mentions DTS-HD MA 5.1, which is loseless but only if you have the necessary equipment, otherwise it scales-down to lossy.  And it's variable bit rate - so, yes, no maybe so?<br /><br />So, in conclusion, too many questions unanswered to buy now, even with the sale this week.  If through more research, I'm able to determine anything prescient, I will update this review accordingly.
B0009MAO46|5.0|Although this review is about the first Toy Story movie, I will mention the other two Toy Story movies as well.  Indeed, The three movies should be seen one after the other in the order they were made.  Viewed this way they make the best trilogy of movies ever made in Hollywood-with the possible exception of The Lord of the Rings set.  I rate all three toy story  movies as five star, the highest rating possible.  However, each movie in the trilogy builds upon the preceeding movie(or movies).  The characters in these movies &#34;grow&#34; in each installment-which makes it an emotional and delightfultrilogy to watch.  I recommend all three of the films for all children and grown-ups to watch-and love.
B008476HBM|5.0|This was an unexpected read for me. I honestly would recommend this book to others looking for a nice read.
B002W7J3SO|5.0|Another Alfred Hitchcock movie that is full of suspense and is well played by some of the old great actors and actresses. Story line is past history but is engaging.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|KIDS love this we might just wear them out!!  Delivered on time very happy STAR WARS FAMILY. May the force be with you
B009EEFTMC|4.0|A very enjoyable game. A great game to play to pass the time in your day. I love it great game
B005K17RU0|5.0|Much better coverage than the local station's app, and gives you all of the info you need. I love it!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is fun, easy, and entertaining. The only problem is finding out how to train my horse. Help please?
B008NW67E0|4.0|Bought the CD for the wife who loves Mumford & Sons.  every track is consistently enjoyable and makes a great addition to the library.
B001F4UHGC|5.0|Steve McQueen in one of his best movies. Usual style and very interesting plot. I have enjoyed watching it again.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|Well done show missed it when it went off air, great to be able to watch the series reruns again
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Amazing just amazing one of the best books ever written. I HOPE you enjoy it as much as I do.
B00AZL3PBK|2.0|What I liked about this game: the levels reminded me of the old Mario Brothers games. So there was a little bit of nostalgic fun.<br />What I didnt like: this game made my Kindle Fire freeze up again and again. Even while I was playing the game would freeze. There seemed to be a big problem with the response time in this game and that caused alot of issues throughout the game.<br />Overall, I couldn't recommend this game.  The issues are just too frustrating.
1423140605|5.0|I got this for my 8 yr old granddaughter Christams ,she is a huge fan of Roudans . Her dad also got her the same book for Christmas so now grandma is reading the Mark of Athena - well written and bring you into the world fanasty and become a charater of the story line - so much better for kids and adults than a TV . Build word and thinking power : )
B004GYY714|4.0|It's ok for me.  Does not have all the local stations, but not all of them stream online so it's not the apps fault.
B0090SI42Y|5.0|This movie takes all the best parts of Kill Bill and cuts out the useless dialogue.  Awesome action if you like the kung-fu/Wu-tang style.
B00BESLHEA|3.0|This movie was fun, but not good. The story felt like it was written by someone with roughly a 7 or 8 year old's vocabulary. The names, plot devices, and even acting in every scene but the fighting scenes seemed like a high quality remake of something an 8 year old wrote and told his friends would be the greatest movie ever.<br /><br />This brings me to the fight scenes though. They are the single redeemable feature of this film because they are well choreographed and in a very Tarantino style. Its everything I used to love from the bad kung-fu movies I watched as a kid, there are improbable weapons, unlikely magic/spirit based fighting powers, fighting stances of one can only assume great power that seem like they would only injure the fighter, and more. There is even the rampant, badly written, and only mildly terrifying sexual perversion of the character played by Russel Crow.<br /><br />In summary, rent this if you need something to put on in the background of a party or while you work (at home, mind you. Incredibly NSFW.) Or consider renting it if you haven't seen a man have his arms ripped off in a while, but this movie is not worth owning, if only because that might encourage someone to make another movie like this in the future, and I cannot condone that for writing this poor.

0547995660|5.0|Excellent work and I got this book for my granddaughter for Christmas as it was on her list. I haven't read it but Lois Lowery has been on many H/S reading list as a former bookstore owner. I would stock her books and would suggest to local schools to place her titles in their schools library . A must read for any child from 8 yrs to 15 yrs .
B00846F1YW|4.0|I wish I had more time for this game.  The graphics are nice and the objects are not too hard to find.  I love the storyline.
0307341550|2.0|I read Gone Girl first, which is an amazing book. I loved it, so I decided to get the other 2 of this author's books. I was disappointed in this one as it is slow and did not keep my attention. I was waiting for the twists and turns that Gone Girl had...they never came. I actually quit reading this because it was so boring. Gone Girl was so good, it kept me up at night and made me late for work in the morning. This book didn't keep my attention at all - even while waiting for an oil change at the car dealership.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|I went into this expecting a movie about a heroic deed but was surprised with a movie deep in character study. It was a welcomed change.

B005HSL626|5.0|Great way to learn how to use your new Kindle and touch screen if it is something new to you.  Plus, it is fun :)
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Love this series. Storyline is so entertaining!! Walking dead rocks on so many different levels!!!! I am truly a fan.
B004XDYJRU|3.0|The app is fine, I just do not like that it does not have all my local stations.  Not the apps fault, they all don't stream online. Other than that it is a great app to find stations and listen.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Everyone that is a fan of plays, shows, musicals and anything wholesome should definantly have a copy of this movie in permanent rotation.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I had to have this movie in my library after seeing it.  It is such a well done movie.. not the junkie kinds that are being made.  There was quality, an education and great acting!!!  I recommend it - help your selfish eyes open up.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great show, interesting characters, interesting story line. It has me waiting for the next showas soon as the one I'm watching is over. Waiting for season 3 to be released.<br />Really enjoy Prime video streaming
B00APJLFEG|5.0|We LOVED this movie!  I never BUY movies but I'm tempted to do so with this film.  It was so cute!  And funny.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Ho Hey is the first song that would draw anyone to this album, but there is so much more. Strong country undertones, acoustic styling, fiddle and  piano overlayed with folk styling provides a folk rock album The Byrds would be proud of.
1451695195|5.0|The medical scientists have always been skeptical of near death experiences and the afterlife until a neurosurgeon experienced it himself. This book takes you on a journey into the afterlife by a doctor who is now a believer. I highly recommend. Received on time and packaged nicely.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Great for kping track of what you need as well as communicating and shaing<br />We use this application all the time
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I read this book because it was a required read.  It was good more sad.  I believe all in all it was well received by the book club.
B009K45Y62|5.0|Love it, the box is great, as well as the bat cowl base, its a very good buy, I don´t regret it at all.
B0039YZPZ4|5.0|The move was waaaaay better than I expected it to be judging by friend's comments.  It was 'classic' Sherlock Holmes.  Robert Downey Jr. gave a superb performance as Holmes and Jude Law wasn't bad either as Watson.  I downloaded this on my Kindle HD and am watching it on that screen....it was great!<br /><br />The only downside was that the background sound sometimes interfered with the dialog....but I have the same problem in movie theatres.
B00499NHLC|4.0|Compared to the other version of Doyle's franachise playing on network television, this one is fresher, with the characters quirky to the extreme, and funny in that wry way the British have honed ever since the Normans came across the channel...
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Bravo! Josh has done it again. It is a CD that you will sit through and enjoy every single. Josh is a uniquely talented prodigy. Highly recommend to all Josh Groban fans. Received on time and packaged nicely.
B008BM9L72|5.0|i have serious addiction to these books, hasnt happened to me in a long time!!:D cant wait for the movie...............it will be interesting:P
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Not much for video games but really like this one!  Challenging but not so hard I don't want to bother. And rather addicting too. Highly recommend.
B00A2H9LK6|3.0|The movie is good, it has its ups and downs, but its enjoyable. What I didn't like at all is that this is the second product I bought from amazon that I received damage, I'm starting to loose trust on them, the case cover was smashed up,  like when they were packing it got out, and when trying to put back in, they did it very sloppy, and I find it very disappointing to have received to products in a row in this conditions.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|I Did not watch the origional series. but fell in love with the with this movie. Would reccomend to anyone.
B000U0O9FM|5.0|If you can buy a first edition because this book is a must have and you educated when society swings from side to side.
1439170916|4.0|I purchased this because I belong to a bookclub at work, and this was the selection for the month. It is very interesting, but does use alot of medical terms and is a little lengthy as well. It was received on time and packaged nicely.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|More self-explanatory and easier to figure out than a lot of the hidden object games out there. I like that it doesn't have an endlessly boring storyline interrupting your play. Recommend.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|My grandson who is 3 enjoyed this film very much.  I often look for a family friendly film when he comes to visit.  Thanks so much!
B007SRZULW|4.0|If you were a proper English mother at the time of Jane Austen, what sort of novel would you want your impressionable young daughter to read? You certainly wouldn't want her reading romance novels, for that might result in her eloping with the gamekeeper! No, you would want her to read a sensible novel, about how it is important to marry money, and that upper class men, even if they seem haughty, are really the best husbands. You would want her to read novels that reinforce, rather than undermine, the class-ridden social fabric. You would want her to read novels that show that even less-than-beautiful girls can use their wits to snare husbands far wealthier than themselves. In other words, you would want her to read Pride and Prejudice, the ideal anti-romantic novel.<br /><br />The novel offers a stark contrast between sisters. The younger sister falls in love with a poor army officer, and, by following her heart, brings herself and the family to the brink of disgrace. The heroine, by contrast, by keeping her head, marries the haughty but wealthy man, saves the family, and climbs up a notch or two in social caste. The men in the novel are good in precise proportion to their wealth: the best men are Darcy and his rich friends; in the middle is the father, a nice but ineffectual character; at the base is the poor and caddish army officer. Things appear differently early in the novel, when the army man appears dashing and noble, and Darcy seems rude and prejudiced. But by the end, the rightness of the class system is revealed, and the heroine discovers that marrying wealth is the best way after all.<br /><br />This is the perfect instructional tale for cynics of Austen's time, and for ours. Enjoy this masterpiece of anti-romantic fiction.
B0076DELIG|3.0|NOT AS GOOD AS MOST OF CONNELLYS BOOKS BUT IT WAS ENTERTAINING AND A BETTER READ THAN MOST.<br /><br />IT IS WORTH THE MONEY SPENT.
B001CDZZI6|5.0|Don't forget that the E-book version has a seperate email for the book code. A great book to see how you measure up.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I got the distinct impression that this novel was made up as it was written.  It felt like Grisham discovered plot twists as needed and wasn't sure of the outcome himself until it needed to conclude.
1451695195|5.0|Coming from a neurosurgeon, you have to believe this experience of life beyond.  Although he writes very scientifically, he has had a spiritual experience and shares the importance of living in the true self.  Good read!
1594487154|2.0|I was under the impression that this would be an informative read. This book takes 260 pages to get a very simple point across and uses very qualitative research at that to prove his points. I had high expectations after hearing pink on NPR. Disappointed.
B007HACDLK|5.0|My husband is a big fan of VINCE FLYNN. He reads everything Mr. Flynn has written and this book, he told me, is exceptionally good. Exciting all the way through. He highly recommends this book and anything written by Vince Flynn.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like playing this game only its always a hassle trying to even bring it up on the kindle screen. I always either get a black screen or it will take forever to load. I uploaded it 2xs and if I have to do it one more time I'm done.
B002OSXDAU|5.0|Each story speaks to me and in the journy that I have lived and wanted to live.  I feel like there are heros in this book that speak to me dirrectly.

B0044C5SCU|3.0|Fringe is interesting enough. It has a couple good strong acting performances. But after a couple it is repetitive and doesn't do much for my attention span.
B00002DE2L|5.0|An electrifying performance of Vivaldi's familiar favorites, beautifully recorded.  A must-have for me as soon as I first heard it on PBS.
B004E5D2M0|5.0|I chose this rating because it met all my expectations. I had been wanting to buy the collection, but it was a little too pricey for me. Also, there had been quite a few complaints about not being able to play a couple of the discs. I must have waited just the right amount of time, because the price went down and the quality of my discs was terrific. I love the Royal Collection. thank you.
0689859414|1.0|i have no idea about this product as it was a gift for my grandson and I haven't read it.
B000OZ0NXA|1.0|Con:<br /><br />- Too many plotholes to count<br /><br />- Weak story. Anyone with half a brain could figure out the plotline after about 50 pages.<br /><br />- Terrible dialogue. You cringe when you read it.<br /><br />Pro:<br /><br />- Decent action
B005UDD1R6|4.0|Both our young daughter's received Kindle Fire's for Christmas.  I was on board with the purchases since they are so enamored of tablet computers.  I had researched parental controls and was happy to find the Kindle Free Time app which gives us parents as much control over content & time management as we want.  What I didn't realize was that the Kindle Free Time app doesn't have a way to let them listen to their music.  I tried a couple of other apps, attempting to do a round about kind of thing, but nothing worked that would keep them in Kindle Free Time with all the parental controls.  Until I found this.  I installed it Saturday afternoon, and haven't had any complaints since.<br /><br />The short amount of time we've had this is the only reason it isn't 5 stars.....
B00337KM2S|3.0|The product was sent and recieved in a timely manner.  The problem is that dvds are hard to play when they are scratched which this product had enough scratches to ruin the experience of watching the movie.
0596805888|5.0|Only came across this book through an XKCD link. Excellent find. I may actually start using my kitchen now, just to give me an excuse to calibrate my oven with a bowl of sugar.

0385535147|5.0|I love all books by John Grisham and would never find a problem with his books. He is my all time favorite author.
B004QSQML8|4.0|I am a fan of Sci-Fi & Fantasy, so I gave it 4 stars. Only complaint is, I wish the director's version was converted like the theater version. Theater version is unbelievable! Blu Ray for sure! After watching the extra stuff, I really wish Ridley Scott could have made it the way he wanted to & as long as he needed it to be, like Lord of the Rings (4+hrs).
0316056898|3.0|This book(and Tina Fey) was hilarious.<br />Amazon?  Sort out your Kindle books already.  The [probably funny] footnotes to this book are all jammed together at the end...after the acknowledgements.  One after the other. With no reference points.  So if you're reading a part of the book and hit an * somewhere, you have to skip all the way to the very end of the book and look through ALL of the * to find the one that refers to the sentence/paragraph/chapter you were just reading.  Then you have to skip back to the right chapter.  Then forward to the page you were on.  By then, who really cares?  Just another of the many problems I've encountered in the bad Kindle editions good books.<br />Tina, you still rock baby.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|I was looking for a show that was similiar to Bones on Fox, and I found a show that is great on its on its own. Love Holmes and Watson!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I absolutely love Downton Abbey and cannot wait for season 3 & 4 to be available on Amazon Prime!! I recommend it to everyone!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Great read!  I couldn't put the book down.  Looking forward to seeing the movie soon.  Another great book from Nicholas Sparks.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I actually enjoyed this book more than I thought I would. I found a few of the plot twists to be predictable, but the story itself still remained entertaining. I'm very interested to see where the rest of the series leads.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This movie is excellent! Nothing bad to say about it. I get chills every time I watch the scene where the Avengers &#34;assemble&#34;!!!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|A must read for any runner, would be runner, or anyone who needs a reminder of the greatness each of, as humans born to run, possess.  Wholly inspirational, and the most compelling story I've read in ages.  Live to run, love to run.
0345457692|5.0|This is one of the most satisfying science fiction novels I've read in years. It is not easy to get the scifi noir genre right and there are not many good examples out there, but this is up there with the best.<br /><br />The novel begins with a pitch-perfect noir scene, set against a brilliantly inventive scifi universe. It unfolds furiously, with exciting action sequences, great dialogue and intriguing characters.<br /><br />There's some Blade Runner in this novel, as there are Raymond Chandler-esque observations. But there is also the voice of the author, which comes through confidently and clear. A remarkable first effort.<br /><br />My only disappointment is that I somehow managed to miss reading this novel until ten years after it was published. It's a cracker.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|It was great having it to prepare me for Season 3.  My only regret is that it isn't captioned.  It is difficult understanding sometimes and captioning would be a real boon.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved it.  I couldn't put the book down.  I thought it was well written and very suspenseful. She did a great job with character development.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is one of the best seasons, each episode is packed full of new and exciting drama! Just when you think you've seen it all...it just keeps getting better!
B007REV4YI|5.0|Bond is `dead', M is being pushed out of her job, so this is a story of Bond's and M's survival, both professionally and physically. Unlike Nietzsche's idea that 'Whatever does not kill you, makes you stronger', Bond is weaker from what didn't kill him.This is a damaged, unshaven Bond who is struggling to keep up his indestructible and arrogant image. It's suggested to Bond, \\"Why not stay dead?\\"<br /><br />The rest of the movie concerns Bond's 'hobby'; \\"Resurrection,\\" as he puts it. What follows is a masterpiece of psychological rebirth, mixed with suspenseful action. I don't usually rank the things I love, but I know that when it's summer and my blood is up and I'm ready for action, I'll watch 'Casino Royale'. However, when it's a damp, drizzly November in my soul, I'll put in my disc of 'Skyfall' to be resurrected.
B00846REIS|5.0|Only just started but so far I like it.  The book was recommended as a similar to 50 shades of Gray
B00846REIS|5.0|Fantastic read.  Very hot and intense if you enjoy that type of novel.  Several of my co-workers are reading it also.  So if you liked fifty shades you will love this book also.
B009LGO88E|5.0|I enjoyed this attachment immensely. I was SOOOOO upset that it was available in Japan at the time. Even though the instructions were in Japanese, I still (kind of) knew what I was doing. I never take my 3dsxl without it.
B006ATJXQW|3.0|This book was ok but I was slightly disappointed.  The previous books were so engaging but this one just didn't do anything for me.
0061992860|5.0|The size of the book is surprisingly small, but there are a wide variety of topics being covered. The author talks about survival in nearly all but the most inhospital environments, and will greatly boost anyone's chances of being found and rescued. I especially loved the discussion about decision-making, many books will gloss over this aspect of survival, which I personally feel is most important. Highly recommended to keep in your &#34;bug out&#34; bag or in your vehicle! I would take this along when I'm travelling though, just so that it would be there when I really need it.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I'm not done reading it so I hope ending is good.  I would describe as an adult version of Twilight.  No teenage drama!
0143106651|5.0|We are starting a book collection for our daughter, I bought this version because I liked the cover, it is kind of rustic. We were surprised to discover that it smells like sandalwood.
B002ZG98UK|5.0|I really loved this movie when not in 3D and now that it is, it's even better. I'm just missing one out of the whole set. Watch out for those antique 3D movies out there, they come with glasses in a box and it doesn't work on your TV and the seller doesn't tell you.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|This game is so fun, if you download it I am positive you'll love it. Every day there is a new reward you receive. You have to save trapped penguins, but watch out for falling icicles, ink splats, falling ground, and obstacles. Have fun playing this game.
B002ZBRSMK|3.0|I am a science fiction buff of long standing and will go through many length to see the edge of what I feel is to be our ultimate destiny. I say this so you will know how sad and disappointed I was with THE MAN WHO FELL FROM THE SKY. It had such promise that I kept believing that \\"any moment\\" it was bound to improve. It was a roller coaster ride, stringing the viewer along with high segments that teased and promised more, only be dropped to great depths. Although the acting was worthy of some of the effort, I truly regret that I wasted so much of my Earthtime on this film!
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Not as fun as I anticipated. The pinch and zoom does not increase the view much at all. Objects are so well hidden that I need to use the hint button way too much. Ok if you are desperate for a game while waiting for a great game.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|The absolute worst Bond movie created! The dialog and acting was as if everyone was reading a cue card.<br /><br />Bond disappears after he's shot and only God knows where he went or why. He's a frikkin British secret agent for crying out loud!! He's not gonna lay around in a shack with a ho for months while his last big job was shot all too hell!<br /><br />The corny action scenes like when he's climbing up the front end loader on the train made me wanna puke! There were these really 'handy' tracks bolted to the loader's arm so he could just walk right across to the train. He throws his gun away after running out of ammo! He hangs off an elevator then somehow gets around to the door with a couple of steps. Every fight he gets in (except the one with the girl with the shot glass on her head) he gets his ass kicked! He can't hit the broad side of a barn from 20 paces (even before he was shot) and come on, Q was a total pile of nerd crap! The computer use was something straight outta a hokey War Games clone! Q would stand there whammin on the keyboard spouting off some drivel about secret hacker code crap all the while not having a clue what the heck he was doing. Where did they come up with this screenplay, off some B rated Bond wannabe scruff??
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This is a simple entertaining book with wonderful conversations among characters in amusing dialogues. Read it for a imaginary trip to Ireland's small village culture.

159562015X|5.0|This is an awesome book to help clear up any questions you might have about your self or doughts about your capabilities.  I am going to continue working this process with confidence that I can learn more about myself. I recommend this to more managers to help them understand their employees and develop their productivity and self confidence.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|An English period drama like this could get stale after a couple seasons.  Such is not the case with Downton Abbey.  Storylines twist and turn, and characters develop over the seasons, making for very compelling viewing.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|i like the app but can't figure out how to log off/sign out. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.<br />The pics look great on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9!
B007URVZJ6|2.0|Takes too much for granted....  This book is aimed at amatuer writers and kindle beginners.  Therefore;  Should the author not use language appropriate to that goal!  Too many paragraphs - Ever thought of using Tabulations in PLAIN ENGLISH instead of computer jingoism...
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Great conclusion to \\"feast for crows\\".  Last book was a lot of build up and this one delivered.  The wait for the next will be torture

B0036JU6CY|5.0|This is one well put together movie.It was not a cheesy movie.The fight scenes were great,and how the ninja just came out of the dark was so fluid and shocking.It is a really good movie.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is pretty fun. My five yr old loves it too! She can learn &amp; have fun at same time.
B008D4AKYQ|3.0|I was excited to hear this one. I loved their last four CDs  especially the last 2 with this vocalist. But, sadly, I must say that I was not thrilled like I thought I would be. The songs are flat at times. It sounds like left over songs that never made Genesis' Wind and Wuthering album.
B005DJGMQE|4.0|I enjoyed this flick, and made you think just how corrupt our government was and is today. I worth watching film.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|This was one of the best music-based movie I've seen, and heard, in years! Love the score. Would recommended wholeheartedly.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|My 5 year old and I like to play this. It is pretty easy for the most part. I do however wish it were easier to get some of the items like hearts. you need them to buy things and if you don't have friends with the game it is impossible.
B001RJTFP4|5.0|I really like the original Blade.When I first saw it in the theater,I felt the visual effects where new and I still like watching it.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Incredible new band! I love this album.  I really hope they go far!<br /><br />The song &#34;Carry On&#34; is really uplifting!
B007IX383I|5.0|Anathema, have produced another great CD following their superb We're Here... CD. I'm really impressed with the singing on this one. The Storm before the Calm is a prog masterpiece in my opinion. The melodic line at the end is spine tingling like some of the great Yes moments.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|I can't believe I didn't buy it sooner.  Right now it's on sale for 2.99 and once I listed to &#34;Little black submarines&#34; all the way through – that song along is worth 2.99.  Great album with some real gems on it.
B0030F5W5K|4.0|This is one movie we enjoy watching over and over.  Really fun movie to watch over and over and over.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this story and can't wait for the next book. This would be a great movie!!! I love Travis!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one game that I love it is really fun and never get s boring and is exciting. There are always new updates.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Its a little forced off of temple run but it is a good game and a better game because it has similar things as temple run does and has more missions and objectives to game.....i luv it!
B000RF7XYO|5.0|Shekar's Elizabeth compresses many years of Queen Elizabeth's reign into an apparently short time, and changes some events for dramatic effect. The result is a stunning spectacle of Elizabethan life and politics that simplifies and sometimes deviates from history, but is never dull. For example, Mary of Guise, Regent of Scotland and mother of Elizabeth's nemesis, Mary Queen of Scots, was not seduced and killed by Walsingham. She died of dropsy. Of course, showing the grotesquely swollen body of someone with dropsy would have had a very different cinematic  effect than the sight of slender and lovely Fanny Ardant. And William Cecil was not retired by the young Elizabeth so she could run her own affairs. He was only 38 at Elizabeth's coronation (unlike the octogenarian actor who portrays him in the film) and continued to be her most trusted adviser on the privy council for 40 years until he died, and was succeeded by his son, Robert Cecil.<br /><br />But perhaps the greatest deviation of the film from history is its portrayal of Elizabeth's favorite, Robert Dudley, as a shallow boy toy. The real Robert Dudley was tall and athletic and an expert jouster. His main attraction for Elizabeth, however, was his mind. Like Elizabeth, he had a classical education, and was fluent in French and Italian. But he also studied science and mathematics, was a brilliant conversationalist, and (most important) could make her laugh. In the HBO miniseries, Elizabeth I, Jeremy Irons portrays Robert Dudley and his relations with Elizabeth (played by Helen Mirren) much more accurately. Good as the miniseries is, though, one can't help thinking that sometimes Shekar's film (in the spirit of Thucidides) shows us what people should have said and done (rather than what they actually said and did), because it would have made better drama.
B0083EY9EI|4.0|Emile' Sande is a very fresh new voice in the new wave of British soul singers.  She has a nice style.  Doesn't sound like everything else on the radio.  It's a good listen.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This  documentary  is  scary  but  critical  to  those  who  value  their  health .<br />This  is  one  of  the  top  3  videos  for  educating  one  on  how  our  food  has  changed .<br />King  Corn  and  David vs Monsanto  are  the  other  2 .
B006LSZECO|5.0|I am a lover of a clever story that is told well. Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl was certainly that. The story kept me turning the pages. She has created a story line that proceeds with numerous, unexpected twists and turns. As Gone Girl unfolded, I just sat back to enjoy the two protagonists and their tragic but believable world that she so intelligently created for them. Towards the end, I began to wonder how it would end. I wasn't successful with my guesses but in no way unhappy with her ending. It just confirmed my opinion of her intelligence as a writer and her respect for her story. I'm already reading and enjoying one of her earlier books.
B00742BVW8|5.0|The best of the modern epic martial arts films based on legend, \\"Hero\\" is an intriguingly structured film that explores themes of nationalism, revenge, love, and the brotherhood of man. It unfolds like a mystery--which of the several versions is the true one? Along the way, it depicts elements of the warrior ethic, letting the audience decide what constitutes honor, bravery and the greater good. And it gives us an ending to ponder at length through the questions it raises: When is war justified? What makes a hero? What sacrifices are necessary? Is it possible to achieve peace?<br /><br />It's also very beautiful--beautifully filmed, acted and choreographed. Whether you watch for the fight scenes or the war and peace themes, \\"Hero\\" is a rewarding experience.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I bought this becuase it was recommended for a solid read and being deployed, offered a great way to fill time. even though the book had me engaged at times, i found that most reviews of the redundancy is a solid review. the Female is a 12 year old virgin in a 22 year old body and acts like she is.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|A beautiful idea of what happens to loved ones lost even out of great horror and tragedy.  This story helps us to accept our loss yet accept the blessing that those we love make within us.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|But not horrible. Things cost too much but there is stuff to do. It's free so can't complain too much.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|You'll be at the edge of your seat.  Ooooh!  Action packed. Very nice movie if you like lots of action!
0756666937|5.0|Family gift to our daughter and family for Christmas.  One of the granddaughters really loves it.  She really enjoys building with legos. I guess an engineer in the future for us.  All of us enjoyed the history section of legos.
B00B7ERH04|1.0|Technically, this camera takes pictures. But that's it. To use any of the other features you have to sign up for adds and stuff to earn &#34;points&#34; to buy them. I was disappointed and deleted from my kindle.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I enjoyed the little stories that went with this read, i just look for a more story than a past tense and review of what has happen. recommend if you want a good intro into zombie apocolypse type books
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love that this is an app for all my devices so my info is accessible no matter where I am
B00004TS0E|5.0|I have loved the simple story behind the movie. It is good clean fun. And it is a good movie to show around Christmas.
B003Y5H574|4.0|I bought this movie for my daughter for Christmas, and she said it is a very good and funny movie that she liked watching. Any movie with Steve Carell is great- can't go wrong there!
B005LLSNNE|5.0|looking back i am glad i bought this season 4 from amazon i own the first 3 seasons on disk and wish i would have bought them here on amazon
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Purchased this cooler for an Intel 3770K (currently at stock) on a Gigabyte z77x-UD3H mobo in a Coolermaster CM690 II case, 1 fan rear exhaust, 2 fans top exhaust. Temps on all Prime95 tests for extended periods is about 60c, idle temps are 28-30c. Fan noise at full RPM is very quiet. Installation is fairly straightforward if you are an experienced installer. If you are a novice builder or are replacing your stock or after market cooler, be forewarned that this particular assembly requires either the removal of your motherboard or access to the backside of it through your case to at least the underside around the processor. Once installed the unit will twist side to side slightly if you nudge it. This is normal and from my experience does not in any way affect heat transference, provided you have applied your quality thermal grease properly. I don't have first hand experience with Intel's stock cooler on the 3770k, but from what I've read, the Hyper 212 is miles above it. For the price of this unit you cannot go wrong.
B00BESKTMG|1.0|Not in a good way. Less a tribute than an insult. This was too bad to be good, but took itself seriously enough that their failings didn't have a tongue in cheek effect. Awkwardly awful.
B007REV4T8|4.0|I loved Casino Royale and thought Daniel Craig was perfect as a very physical James Bond/007, resurrecting new life into the Bond series. I've seen CR many times. I bought Quantum of Solace on Amazon and liked that, but not as well as Casino Royale. I just saw Skyfall this wknd; watched the entire thing riveted of course (good action sequences), but I wouldn't care if I ever saw it again. Normally, if a movie is truly GREAT and timeless, I watch it over and over (examples: Lord of the Rings, Star Trek with Chris Pine, Harry Potter series, Batman Begins/Dark Knight Rises, etc.). Skyfall was interesting, but very personal as 007 is protecting M more than saving the world. The villain reminded me of the Joker from Batman. Daniel Craig looked old, tired and washed up. Not the super sexy, unstoppable super agent that makes Bond movies so addictive. I get that he was supposed to look old and we were supposed to doubt if he was field-ready, but...I didn't really like that. And didn't like Eve either; she wasn't a compelling female sidekick that runs with Bond throughout the film. The good thing is I didn't know who the bad guy was until halfway-through, so liked the twists & turns & misdirection. I do miss the tech gadgets and hope in the next 007 that Bond is back to being ultimately physically fit, rough & tumble awesome, not an alcoholic, pill-popper with blood shot eyes who can't hit a target. UGH!
B006LMMN8I|5.0|I first heard Gregory on a free download on iTunes.  I don't know why I purchased the CD except that I was browsing Amazon and I had written down Gregory Porter's name.  The same day I was listening to and ordering<br />Carrie Rodriguez's CD.  This CD is loaded with musicians that are smooth.  The lyrics are not slam into a person's conscience.  Porter seems to be concerned for others.
B002ZG97LK|3.0|This was a remake from the original. While I enjoyed the movie, the 1984 version with Kevin Bacon was what I remember from childhood. I did not like the way they used some of the old songs and updated them. My children did not like the old movie so it's a wash I guess. I did enjoy the way they expanded the story from the original to show more background about why the town was so against music and dancing. Ren getting nuts in the factory dancing was kind of dumb- I know he was blowing off steam, but it just didn't make sense.
B008BM9L72|5.0|The first book was a little raunchy for my taste. But it turns into a beautiful love story and the 2nd and 3rd book had me hooked! Read it every chance I got!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King keeps you wanting to turn the page on this thriller! He was able to take a predictable part of history, put a new twist on it, and keep you guessing until the end.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This with out a doubt is one of the best Batman movies that have be put on the screen. If you like super Heros you will like this movie.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My grandkids really enjoyed this movie and so did I. It's simply a fun movie and good for the entire family.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|So every few years a record rolls around that blows me away.  This was one of those albums.<br /><br />I had no previous opinion of the Black Keys as this was my first foray into their music.  I was very pleased with this release.  It is like they took everything I loved about 1970's classic rock, inserted grooves where appropriate, inserted rad rock where appropriate, inserted some soul where appropriate, and then said here you go Chuckie, you're welcome.<br /><br />This is a great record.  No to ways about it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It was very compelling. The story always keeps you on the edge of your seat. There are always things happening you don't see coming until it hits you in the face. Can't wait for next season!<br /><br />can't wait
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I watched the movie before purchasing the book and thank goodness for that otherwise i would have given up on the book a long time ago!
B008BDZOZY|1.0|I had forgotten how annoying Byrne's voice could get.  I love all genres of music and agree with many of the comments that much of today's music and is very bland and \\"corporate\\".  But an artist doesn't have to be truly awful to stand out; Byrnes and St Vincent did just that.
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|This could have been a good movie if it were not for the way over the top, of pouring out of filthy language
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love hidden object games with a plot!!  This one is very intruguing!!  I gave it five stars!! have fun playing
B004LROUNG|5.0|John Grisham writes books to educate as well as entertain American readers. I have read his books for years and find them exciting, passionate and wonderful. As an attorney, I find that John Grisham is distinguished from other 'legal thriller'  writers who mis-educate by pandering to readers and distorting what must be understood about the legal system. He performs one other vital service -- Grisham reveals corporate policy decisions that ultimately entangle citizens in the domestic and international  tragedies that cause all of us permanent harm. Knowledge is power. Thank you John Grisham for your dedication.You are truly an American Patriot. What your books often reveal is just that important -- whether we know 'it' or not.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I hadn't seen this show until I streamed it. I was hooked with the first episode. It's an intense drama at points mixed with lighthearted scenes as well. Good chemistry among the cast makes this a new favorite of mine. Seasons 1 and 2 were great. Looking forward to season 3!
B001PO53IO|5.0|My children love it and always want to watch it over and over again.  In my opinion, it is a great buy.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|We love this show so far!  The first season has been very interesting and has a great humor element along with the science fiction.  The characters and story plots are not too far out there to be unbelievable.
B003OCWF6I|4.0|This movie ofered penty of action, of which I always am enterested, but the language I feel took away from th movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have become a new fan of PBS thanks to Downton Abbey. I love everything about it. Actors, locations, accents! But this season was by far the best. You wouldn't think there could be much intrigue or plot twists in merry old England. Oh but there are!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I watched both seasons in less than 2 weeks! Awesome, addictive... Can't wait for season 3.<br />Carrie, Saul and Brody....sensational!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Love the game and how the cube rotates. wish the icons were a bit bigger and response was faster. Overall it's a fantastic puzzle game
111846446X|5.0|How could I go wrong with a book written in partnership with the Pi co-founder? I found this attention to ' Well Organized Detail' to be extremely helpful. In fact I could easily say &#34;my saving grace&#34;. What an amazing computer. You are limited only by your imagination in how to use it and getting it 'Right' in the beginning is critical. This book has helped me accomplish just that!
B00B5HQL50|1.0|Daniel Craig is just too ugly and unsophisticated to be James Bond.  He has ruined the image.<br />The movie, although a bit better than the other Daniel Craig James Bond movies, is still not much better.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Very simple and well done 3D twist on Majhong!<br />Can't seem to turn off the background music.<br />Gotta try it!
B006RXQ6FM|5.0|This movie was great!  Meryl Streep is always fabulous, and Phiip Seymour Hoffman never fails to nail the part.  Highly recommend this movie.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|This is a must see movie for the family. Clint Eastwood was brilliant and the story line was in focus throughout the movie.<br />I like how the movie showed the true struggles of older people and their adjustment to getting older and developing health problems. I also like how it showed a true bond between a Father and Daughter is even though they did not always feel or relate to that bond. It still was always there.
B0055PMURG|5.0|Great movie, with a good plot.  Also, being based on truth made it very exciting.  I also shared it with my students.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|very informative reading.  this work was very well written.  i never realized the struggles lincoln faced as president.  he was a remarkable human being.

B005LAIISA|5.0|This movie arrived promptly, good packaging.  As for the movie itself, the story of the mammoth female child, Sid's relatives, and Diego finding a girl...flavored with wit, family values & morals-to-be-learned made for a great movie!  My inner child loved this movie! (along with all the others in the ICE AGE movie series).
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Johnny Lee Miller is amazing in this show, well-written, interesting, and suspenseful!  I hope this one is around for a long time!

B003O86FMW|4.0|I love trilogies, but I prefer it when each book can stand alone. No one does that anymore. This is half a book. A very good half, but for this book to be complete you must read the next, which I guess could be a part of why it was done this way. Glad I read it though. Going to read the next.
B00B10ENBA|4.0|It took two viewings to get the full story, but I thought it was a great movie, Very well done.

B001676320|5.0|If you like Chicago, and Earth Wind & Fire this is a must see performance.<br />I played it for friends Saturday, and they had me order 2 more so they could<br />Enjoy the show at home.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I would recommend this book to those who like suspense and murder novels. I admit hit wraps you up into its ever weaving plot so much you can't put down the book. For me, I don't personally like suspense or murder novels but I guess this one was &#34;light enough&#34;.
B008BM9L72|2.0|In case you have never heard of sexual experimentation, this book will be informative but really badly written. I read the first book, hoping to find out why the big hoo haa .... nothing. Read the second book and it was more of the first. Then decided there just HAS to be SOMETHING and read the third book. It had a smidgen of a stronger storyline but by the end of the three, I really felt cheated. Such drivel!

B009YU62H2|5.0|Big Sound garden fan - and while I was on the fence with the single, Been away...the CD hit a home run. And now I like the single/1st track<br /><br />Buy this CD
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The balance of adventure, action, romance and heartbreak is very good. The book obviously ended with a view to a second book.
B007ZI06FE|4.0|This was a fun book and well written.  World building worked.  The only problem I had with it is that I have to wait a few months for the sequel.  I've found a new author to follow.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game is a lot of fun to play. Very easy, no instruction really needed, its like a 3-d cube version of those tile matching games.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Can't say is a huge musical fan, but this was actually really good. Good story, great music, and the movie flowed together really well
B007EC27QM|5.0|I use this handy tool on my kindle and my smartphone. It performs all all basic accounting and mathamatical functions. I give it five stars. (5*!)
B009P12GQ6|5.0|This is maybe ELPs best ....ah the headphone memories...lifting the stylus to listen to Trilogy over and over...the pops and crackles still play in my head when listening to the digital version.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Ellen DeGeneres is extremely funny, honest, and human. I enjoy reading her books. her comic nature translates well to written word. Highly recommend this book.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I had a personal experience with Dr Alexander for over a year while he was in Boston at Brigham & Women's Hospital. he was great then and always available. I was shocked when I heard about his experience and then writing this book. If you've lost a loved one, it gives you something interesting to think about. A good read!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|This is my new favorite play. Listen to it all of the time.  makes me want to dance.  makes me happy.
B004H1V5RU|3.0|Bought it as a Christmas gift.  Best have lots of patience, it will drive you bonkers if you try to rush through it.
B00AGKH6D8|1.0|I really don't know what i was expecting from this but i felt as if one song led into another and another and never changed.If i don't reach for the volume knob at least once then i know i'm not into it and that happened here there wasn't one track that made me stop and actually stop to listen to it.I am a Joey B fanatic and can honestly say i really didn't hear him here at all.I know it's a band and all but still i could not get into this disc at all they don't explode at all as i said just one song into another.In all this was very boring and if you were in some jazz club hanging out then this would be perfect but to actually get moving and really jam with it not so much.It all depends on what you were looking for and since i had no idea what this would be i just found it wasn't for me but i am sure there is an audience out there for this i am not one of them though,Hope this helps you.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|The fact that Amazon gave me a free streaming rental from Amazon prime when I bought the dvd just made this a perfect deal. This may be Ben Stiller's best movie, and it's really made me wonder if there's more to my life than being really, really, ridiculously good looking.
B005HSL626|4.0|Fun game, wish the zen option was available. This game can keep you busy and entertained for hours. Keeps your hand ete coordination in check.
B003P8D6JQ|5.0|When I first watched this movie I didn't understand all the hype.  Then a friend told me to read the books.  Now, I get the movies and love them almost as much as I love the books.
0307730697|5.0|First, don't dismiss this book if you're not into military stories or don't consider yourself super patriotic, or anything like that. Adam Brown's story and his life does contain aspects of military life and patriotism, HOWEVER that is not the focus of this story. This story--and I hesitate to even use the word \\"story\\" because that almost trivializes this man's life--is about how God transforms a life and then allows that life to impact many other people around him.<br /><br />Fearless is highly motivational--motivation to get through your tough problems, like writing a thesis that is just hard or getting through a tough time at work or whatever monotony you deal with on a daily basis. Reading how Adam Brown worked through hardship, injuries, and tough times with a straight-up, deeply rooted belief that he could do this and this and this, no matter what \\"this\\" is because he had the strength of the Lord was just awesome. His ability to persevere is just amazing.<br /><br />The gospel message and encouragement to keep on keeping on was so present in this book--but not in an annoying way. Some Christian memoirs can be annoying and fluffy in that way, but not Fearless. This story was real--swear words, sweat, and all. The coolest part was at the end where the author revealed he wasn't a Christian but was more intrigued by faith and spiritual things after writing Brown's story, getting to know his family, and immersing himself in Adam's life just for a little bit. These are the kind of faith stories that need to be told. The well written, real faith stories that can have a gospel impact on people's lives--even if they are coming from hard situations. [Go back and read the book description. Drugs, people! Extremes! Risk! This is real life.]<br /><br />This book is a great reminder that life is short and life is precious and you should tell your family and friends that you love them, often. Because you never know what's going to happen. So husband, and family, and friends, I love you.<br /><br />Last, but not least, the inspiration of Adam Brown as a heroic member of the military who gave his life for this country was incredible. As I first pointed out, this isn't just a book about the military or being patriotic--but those aspects of Adam Brown's story are hard to miss. I personally do not know many people who are in the military. I know a handful who were or who are married to military professionals, but I don't have day to day interaction with anyone in the military. I think that's something needed in this country [a good dose of perspective], but that's another subject for another day. This book is a good reminder of those who have given their lives [or even just their days or time with their families] for our freedom. Bottom line: this is a book worth reading. I wish I had a non-e-book copy to loan out... but in the meantime, be sure to check it out! I highly recommend it!<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review. However, I was not required to write a positive review. The thoughts expressed above are entirely my own. Thanks to WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for the chance to read this great book!I love you.<br /><br />Last, but not least, the inspiration of Adam Brown as a heroic member of the military who gave his life for this country was incredible.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved all three book and read them all in less than 1 week...couldn't get enough of the...drama, the unconditional love the grew betrween Christian and his wife and the great sense of love and family portrayed by all the family members.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|This was a great movie to rent on Amazon instant video.  I really liked it and it was well worth $1.99.  I couldn't give it 5 stars because the villains were a little hokey -- everything else was great -- acting, characters, special effects, plot, etc.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|it takes a while to load but I seen videos online and it looked fun so I wanted to get it. I have it for my kindle
B00005JKQZ|5.0|This movie, is in my opinion one of Russell Crowe's greatest roles. he captures the character brilliantly and does it without making it over the top,
B001JOIEZ4|5.0|I love the music from these movies and now I listen more closely to music during all movies.  None have been as good as this series.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|A quick fun stress release game. Great eye hand puzzle  with the board flips are fun.  Would recommend this game to anyone who likes marjn
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The best love and romance story I have read..loved it so much I read it in a day and a half. Now what do i read to come up to those kind of standards.
B000WCDBKM|2.0|Something was missing from this movie.  It reminded me of the old Christopher Lee movies that I watched on TV when I was 10 - 14 years old.  They were supposed to be scary, but I found them stupid and &#34;fuddy-duddy&#34; boring films.  I didn't care for any character so I didn't really care how this movie ended.  SPOILER:  I think that the main character chose to be the She Devil's patsy because he just hated himself, his life as he lived it, and people in general.  I don't think I needed to spend $1.99 on this.  It was well-acted but just so useless as a film for me.  Maybe I'm wrong, and this is the sign of a good movie -- that you want to take a shower after you watch the worthless characters in this movie.  You have my opinion -- SO BE FOREWARNED.  HA HAHAHAHAHAHA (evil laughter)
B007SGM084|5.0|I chose this trilogy after it hit the mainstream. I was not expecting to fall in love with the characters as I did. Book 1 and book 2 were my favorites.  Book 3 starts out well bug I feel ends a little rushed. In will definitely re-read to fall in love with them again. And another thing I love is it gave spice back to my marriage.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|the plane upside down was good the rest of the movie is about an alcholic---Yuck. what a wase of Denzel's talent
B002SVBDYQ|5.0|I love the music from these movies and now I listen more closely to music during all movies.  None have been as good as this series.
1616550414|5.0|I originally ordered this book because I love The Legend of Zelda Games, When I received it I was surprised that it was very high quality! I would recommend to others who are fanatics of the Zelda franchise.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The author spoke of sexual encounters you would never have imagined but put them in words so gently to you ears; which made the book a sheer delight. Just as, the news in South Florida reported it will boost you sex life.
B003QTUQGU|5.0|I gave this movie 5 stars, and I really enjoyed watching it.  I liked the Mad Hatter character the most, and I thought I would hate him.  I have a fear/hatred of clowns and most of the characters from Alice in Wonderland.  I watched this film via Amazon Instant Video clean and sober, and yet I still liked it!!!!!  It was a very enjoyable movie.
B005FISBV2|5.0|Dexter is probably my favorite show on TV. Season 6 is really good. There is some religious/biblical references that I found pretty interesting (although bizarre).
B0099114WO|5.0|this movie is a great story of a couple who married and after several years needed to re heat there relationship and they do in this. great job on this movie you will be glad you watched this one
B0062IQNG4|5.0|When I first watched this movie I didn't understand all the hype.  Then a friend told me to read the books.  Now, I get the movies and love them almost as much as I love the books.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Great mouse for the price, easy to use interface and very smooth for FPS games. I wish i had this mouse a long time ago.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is a lovely movie about a group of older English people in India. It has a great tone, gentle sweet and beautiful performances and scenery. It's like taking a journey that you feel happy and confident about from the first moments. The film does have moments of cliche but it doesn't matter or effect the overall enjoyment. I recommended it.  No violence, guns or horror just sweet relationships and a sense of well being and that life is in the end kind and good.
B002MGGM9I|4.0|It was a strange, but understandable movie.  I did try an internet search after watching it to get the &#34;finer points&#34; of the film because I was intrigued -- even though I felt satisfied by the movie's ending.  A good movie with an excellent soundtrack.  I mistakenly watched it with closed captions on -- and that really seemed to work for me.
B004XQO90E|5.0|First happened to see this movie on a ferry in rough seas.  It is still as enjoyable.  A well written and shot feature.<br />The 'Source' idea  stays close enough, not crossing into the fantastic.<br />Technology, the future, and the life of a person living in the crux of the two.<br />Enjoy.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|we re watch lost season 1 thru 6 recently and the show is amazing it has some great stories and great actors if you decide to watch this you will be glad you did because it will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end. ohh and at the end of every dvd it says bad robot lol great job bad robot
B009YX02T8|5.0|I love the music from these movies and now I listen more closely to music during all movies.  None have been as good as this series.
B005OCHOZS|4.0|There are quite a lot of books about running and books about vegetarianism. But not too many books on both. Jurek's book perhaps provides some sort of empirical evidence (through a single case study) that a vegan or vegetarian diet supplies the energy needed for such a physically demanding task of running an ultramarathon. Ordinary folks who are thus far satisfied with running 10K or more should find less excuse of not becoming a vegetarian or even vegan, which is good for the planet earth in the long run.
8866130907|4.0|small and well put together. Nice page beside calender for notes. nice color Red... so easy to find in my bag
B0011MZOEI|5.0|My GOD, I love John McClane.  I'm a 45 year old female who enjoys action movies.  I thought DIE HARD was one of the best movies that I had seen in my early 20's because I had such an enjoyable experience watching it and rewinding some of the villain's scenes.  (I watched it on VHS tape.)  I thought the 2nd film wasn't good (I'd give it 2 stars); I thought the 3rd film was horrible, so I was worried about this film because of McClane's young sidekick.  It was a wonderful film!  So much fun to watch.  A wonderful villain.  I'd stick with 5 stars for DIE HARD, and I'd give this film 4-1/2 stars because some of the action was just over the top and left me feeling stupid.  I think Michael Bay might be responsible for ruining action film sequences with his over-the-top, ridiculous films.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I keep thinking &#34;How can this get better?&#34; But it always does!!  Can't wait for each episode - but I don't want it to end.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|This show is amazing. I am so glad I can get it on Amazon as I do not have cable to watch it the day it comes out. I just have to be careful of spoilers from others who can watch it on the day.
B008MEM24S|4.0|This is  great game for the tween age kids. It takes some thought. It requires that the player understand water in its different states (steam and ice), how it gets there and how it behaves differently in these states. The character is fun and  te game is challenging as the kids get a little older.
B003CH9PTU|4.0|I found the show compelling and unique. I would recommend this show to people that enjoy Dexter or lovers of an antihero role. I have yet to see the rest of season (due to school), but plan on finishing it when I have time.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season is amazing and the fact that I can get it instantly from Amazon is even better. Love this.
B002EDH0FE|3.0|It was a good, solid movie, but I was surprised at how little I liked the characters.  I never read many comics growing up, so I didn't expect how realistic and troubled the characters were.  There was good acting and a decent mystery in this film, I'm rating it as Okay because of my ignorance going in to the film.
B00B2EWNWG|5.0|I saw this and I cant understand what all the negative comment are about this was actually a great movie filled with diverse characters, kungfu styles, great fights scenes and sets, a damn good debute movie for RZA, I hope he makes more. never let the haters say anything to keep great things from happening.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|This was an amazing show and I can't wait for season 4. Amazon allowed you to pay for the entire season up front and watch it before the rest of the world saw it on tv. It was great since there are so many spoilers out that if I had to wait, I would be sad for hearing about the cliff hanger
B000001F95|4.0|\\"Cal\\" (1984), Pat O'Connor's film adaptation of Bernard MacLaverty's 1983 novel, introduced many American viewers to the tragic intricacies of the Northern Ireland conflict.  MacLaverty crafted the screen adaptation of his economically written novel of love, death and destiny amidst the Troubles, and O'Connor's brisk, spare direction captures the stark and minimalist feel of MacLaverty's novel.  The story is a simple one: Cal (played by John Lynch), a withdrawn young Catholic who lives with his father in a predominantly Protestant neighborhood, finds himself falling in love with Marcella (played by Helen Mirren), the Catholic widow of a Protestant police officer murdered by the IRA.  The isolation that both Cal and Marcella feel -- emblematic, perhaps, of the vulnerable position of the Catholic minority in majority-Protestant Northern Ireland -- draws them toward one another; but secrets from Cal's past threaten their fragile relationship.  To say more would require the proverbial spoiler alert.<br /><br />Back in the late 1970's, in the grimmest days of disco's notoriety, I was grateful to Mark Knopfler, leader of the British band Dire Straits, for keeping the fires of rock-and-roll alive.  I didn't know at the time that one day I would also appreciate Knopfler's work as a gifted composer of film soundtracks; his soundtrack for \\"Cal\\" complements well both the story and O'Connor's visual style.  Traditional instruments like tin whistle, mandolin, and uilleann pipes work well with Knopfler's distinctive style as a guitarist.  A couple of melancholy leitmotifs predominate throughout, with emphasis on the quiet guitar melody that is featured on the track \\"The Road.\\"  But there are some changes of pace; \\"Father and Son\\" has an almost anthemic quality to it, and \\"Fear and Hatred\\" features heavier guitar that would have fit right in on one of Dire Straits' rougher-sounding songs -- the title track to \\"Brothers in Arms,\\" maybe.<br /><br />One of the issues that always arises with regard to film soundtracks is whether the music on a soundtrack would work on its own, independent of the film.  After all, the music of a soundtrack is written specifically to complement the visual action and drama of a motion picture; for example, when one hears the track \\"In a Secret Place\\" from this soundtrack, one knows at once that the music is mean to set a grim mood during a tense part of the movie, even if one has never seen \\"Cal.\\"  (The grim mood of much of the soundtrack matches the black-bordered cover of the CD, with its photograph of John Lynch as Cal being roughed up by two RUC officers.)  I saw the film first, so I can't say what I would think of the soundtrack if I had heard the soundtrack first.  But as things stand, I like the soundtrack very much.<br /><br />Back in the 1980's, \\"Cal\\" was regarded, along with Peter Ormrod's \\"Eat the Peach\\" (1986), as being possibly part of the beginning of a resurgence of Irish cinema.  Today, however, it is not even the best-known movie about Northern Ireland.  That honor would probably go to Jim Sheridan's \\"In the Name of the Father\\" (1993), with Paul Greengrass's \\"Bloody Sunday\\" (2002) getting an honorable mention for its cinéma-vérité treatment of the Bloody Sunday killings of nationalist demonstrators by British paratroopers in Derry/Londonderry in 1972.  Yet Cal remains an adroit little film treatment of the tension and tragedy of the Northern Ireland conflict, and is still worth your time.  So, for that matter, is Mark Knopfler's soundtrack.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Gotta love this games irish theme, especially the music! Being able to choose graphic level helps with slower connections but are great as caartoons come! Looking forward to more from this company if u got timevtime to play grab a cold one and come home to Mother Ireland!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is a nice game my daughter & I love it. It is cool to play wit partners love it
014241543X|3.0|i heard about this book on pinterest that it was a good read so i decided to give it a try.<br /><br />I am almost done with it an its OK not spectacular has a lot of stuff that you could do without reading soooooooo. I am definately going to finish it and the secod part just to finish the story other than that ..........................<br /><br />2/27/13<br /><br />not reading the second book after all.
B003M70O5O|3.0|I love Sons of Anarchy, however the 3rd and 4th discs tended to skip or freeze, which made it difficult to watch. Since I didn't watch them until a couple of months after I purchased them I didn't think I could send them back.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfed is the best game EVER! I hope that everyone has a chance to get the game. This game is positively awesome. What is weird is that it's kinds like temple run.
B005HSL626|4.0|I like this one because it is a bit challenging for me at least.  I have found out that 2 fingers work best.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|The previews were misleading, yet the movie was an awesome story of struggle and failure. Even the most intelligent, experienced and competent people can struggle.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Moves too slowly.  xxxxxxxx  xxxxxx  xxxxxxxxxx  xxxxxxxxxx  xxxxxxxx  xxxxxxx  xxxxxxxx  xxxxxxxxx  xxxxxxxx  xxxxx  xxxxxxxxx  xxxxxx  xxxxxx  xxxxxxx  xxxxxxxx  xxxxxxx  x
B000I9S668|3.0|Sound quality good , film was herky jerky in parts so  I had to give it a less then perfect rating
B0086700CM|4.0|Awesome game the graphics are , though it is definitely not as good as the 2nd one, but otherwise it is great.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|Somehow you've got to make the zombies scary again or else change the name of the series to the &#34;Boring Dead&#34;.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I did what!! I had my life all figured out!! I don't remember any of this.  What do I do now?
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved it all<br />Ready for the movie yes I tell everyone they got to read fifty shades of grey
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Upgrade from the cheap one, because you're about to get the best f#^%&iexcl;&pound; sleep of your life. Upgrade. You're already wasting time reading this when you could be relaxing or getting some sleep, you insomniac. It's got sounds, yeah.. sounds. The most calming sounds ever. Except the vacuum sound. That one wasn't very relaxing. But that's okay, just don't push that button. Purchase. Download. Enjoy.
B009CGAMK6|5.0|The music is wonderful.  It is worth every cent I paid for it.  The London Production is great.  &#34;Les Miserables&#34; and the London Production of &#34;The Phantom of the Opera, 25th aniversary&#34;  are great to watch.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun. I love it! And you will too! It is so much like Temple Run but in a more fun  way!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This was a free app of the day.  I don't think I would have tried it other wise.  I live this game.
B006L9B6TI|4.0|Yes, it is miraculous and I am still trying it out. I am a believer and it seems to be working most of the time; however it raises more questions than it does provide answers. For example, what is the &#34;Universe&#34;? How does the Universe deal with everybody's hopes and desires? etc. etc.<br />Anyway, saying &#34;Thank You&#34; is pleasurable, recommendable and - above all - totally harmless.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really like thus game a lot so far. You could go through competitions and go through levels and basically take care of a horse.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|These stories, like the unearthly mysteries, are worth investigating. Watch FRINGE. The fate of our universe depends on it, and Walter might share his licorice with you
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Not a big fan of Angry Birds, but the Kindle version is easy to use and kind of fun.  Needs more instructions for first time users
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Final scene of Season 3 stunned me. Hoping this turns out to be a teaser and Matthew reappears in Season 4! Must we wait a whole year to find out??
B0029QRA1U|5.0|This was a Christmas gift to my son and he has given it great reviews.  After recording several old LPs he said the results were great.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fast paced duck and dodge type game. Fantastic game to kill some time. It's an absolute Must have on your tablet or phone
B006E4QCXU|2.0|Not sure what I was expecting but I was underwhelmed. Tried it a few times and then forgot about it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game I play at school and a home all my classmates have it on their phones an or Ipads so just about everyone I know plays this and if they don't I download it for them.thanks for making Subway Surfer!!!!!!
030758836X|2.0|I would actually give this book 2 1/2 stars if I could.  While it was an easy, fast-paced read, I also felt there was ultimately not much point to it.  The first half of the book was engrossing, but then it became progressively harder and harder to believe the plot twists.  The characters were fairly one dimensional too.<br />If you're looking for a fast paced mystery (perhaps a beach read) without a lot of substance, this is your book.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|a truly great story. I enjoyed this book from beginning to end. could not put it down. a plus for me
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I read this for the first time as a mom, trying to see if it was a good book for my 8 year old. I enjoyed this simple read and think it will be very suitable for my daughter.  The language was not complicated and the adventures were short and not overly violent. I can't wait to discuss this book with her.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Best book in the entire series.  Both Rankin and Rebus get better as they age.  This one should have come with a map of Scotland.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this games very much and can not stop playing it.I wish it was a part two to the game
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book grabs you from the very beginning.  It's an easy read that you don't want to put down! Excellent
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really connected with Charlie's character and could not put the book down.  I did watch the movie first and I couldn't get enough, so I decided to read the book (also a friend's high recommendation) and I don't regret it one bit. I want to know more about the characters' journeys.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|BEST BOOK EVER!! I can't wait to read the next one. You're a great author! This is my all time favorite book!<3
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Historical detail with an intriguing plot.  Watched season 1 and season 2 back to back in two weekends.<br />Can't wait for season 3.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game helped me to learn to be a better righter mostly because I just picked the easy ones and the hard ones .
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book sucks you in and you won't want to put it down!  Christian Grey will move you beyond words.
B001NN4162|5.0|Great movie. My son asked for it and he got it and loves it again and again until Mike is imbedded in my brain.
B005KELQEU|5.0|When I first opened the parcel, obviously it's better than what I expected. I don't want to attach it with my kindle when I'm reading, so this is a wonderful case to protect my kindle.
0765325950|1.0|I am waiting for ebook release. Very disappointed at release delay. It's the 21st century and I don't want a hardback. Maybe I'll keep my money and borrow it from the library.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This app gave me everything I needed to properly organize all of my ideas. I have my Kindle Fire with me wherever I go, but when I got a sudden, crucial idea for a story, I had nowhere I could write it down. The other thing is that I only had a single notebook for my ideas, and the plot details, character descriptions, and storyboards were scattered together so haphazardly that I had trouble deciding which belonged to which story.<br /><br />With this app, that's not really a difficulty anymore. This app is much better than just grabbing a sticky note or random piece of paper and jotting it down. Instead, it allows you to create multiple notebooks and place all of your ideas in each separate one. While I once before had everything jumbled together in a single notebook, I now have it organized easily across several digital ones, making writing so much easier.<br /><br />Something else I appreciate about it is the customization and passwords. It gives you enough to have a unique feel, but it could indeed have some more options to choose from. The password feature prevents others from getting into the notebooks and reading all of your information, which was one of my biggest pet peeves.<br /><br />If you are a writer, a songwriter, or even those who need a simple shopping list made really fast, then this app is a very handy tool to have.

B007V9N5R8|4.0|I'm a digital artist and rendering supervisor for broadcast post production, and I bought this in order to keep my monitors at home and work consistent with one another.  This device does absolutely improve eyeball calibration of an sRGB computer monitor, and the ability to use the same calibration profile between multiple devices is extremely useful.  It means i no longer have to switch a comp between the &#34;warm&#34; monitor and the &#34;cool&#34; one and somehow split the difference in my head -- they match perfectly.<br /><br />My only beef is that the calibration process is a bit slow, but it's a small price to pay for knowing that the color temperature and gamma of my monitors are matched up.<br /><br />I should also note that this is not a perfectly precise calibration tool for broadcast.  It doesn't seem to have any settings for rec709 gamma and the interface doesn't seem set up for anything that doesn't support USB and the ability to install the required software.  (So, for example, not on your TV -- and more importantly -- not over a decklink.)
B003Y5H59C|5.0|Secretary explores an unmentioned dynamic in relationships. Gyllenhaal and Spader play realistic characters in a domination / submissive love story. Hollywood needs to push more boundaries instead of boy meets girl etc.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Dustin Hoffman's \\"Quartet,\\" from Ronald Harwood's screenplay, takes the middle ground between \\"Amour\\" and \\"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.\\" Like \\"Amour,\\" it depicts the infirmities of old age honestly. But like \\"Marigold Hotel,\\" it takes an upbeat view of its elderly characters, portraying their lives as triumphant rather than tragic.<br /><br />There isn't much to the story, which takes place in Beecham House, an elegant but financially troubled home for retired musicians. The residents are planning their annual gala on Oct. 10, Verdi's birthday, the revenues from which comprise a good portion of Beecham House's operating funds. Cedric (Michael Gambon), the imperious director of the annual gala, has commanded Reggie (Tom Courtenay), Wilf (Billy Connolly) and Cissy (Pauline Collins) to persuade Jean (Maggie Smith), a famous diva newly arrived at Beecham House, to sing at the gala. Jean, Reggie, Wilf and Cissy made a legendary recording of \\"Rigoletto\\" many years before, and their singing the quartet from \\"Rigoletto\\" at the gala would guarantee a big enough attendance to keep the home open indefinitely. However, Jean is painfully conscious that her voice is no longer what it was, and angrily rejects her friends' entreaties.<br /><br />There are further complications, the biggest is which is Jean and Reggie's painful romantic and marital history. Also, Wilf and Cissy are not well: Wilf has had a series of strokes, and Alzheimer's disease is tightening its grip on Cissy.<br /><br />Despite the sorrows, however, the overall mood of \\"Quartet\\" is genial and celebratory. Michael Powell once said that the only important things in life are love and art, and both are worth dying for. Hoffman and Harwood show us characters for whom art--specifically, the art of music--has been their entire way of life. Between that art and the love they bear for each other, they can go, if not gently, at least with equanimity into that good night.<br /><br />The final scenes of \\"Quartet\\" will leave you smiling through tears, but the final credits--which shows pictures of the various cast members in their prime--will have you bawling and applauding simultaneously. \\"Quartet\\" may not be an important film, but it is a sublimely satisfying one.eave you smiling through tears, but the final credits--which shows pictures of the various cast members in their prime--will have you bawling and applauding simultaneously. \\"Quartet\\" may not be an important film, but it is a sublimely satisfying one.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is the first board game I've really enjoyed in a while.  I've been playing it a lot with my early 20s peer group--but I'd guess the &#34;fun for all ages&#34; cliche applies here.  It's a strategic, position-based game with a randomness element where players gain resources based on dice-rolls and where the player has chosen to build.  It's easy to learn, and not difficult to win against experienced players after a few rounds.  I would guess old-enough children (10+?) could play with their parents and things would be competitive (unlike Scrabble, for example).  A big plus is that the board can be shuffled, so each game requires a fresh analysis (if not a completely new strategy).
B003XF1OJK|1.0|This book was incredibly simplistic and felt like it had been written over a long weekend.  Nothing really original, no developed characters, and even the military stuff felt flat, uninspired, and unoriginal.<br /><br />Compare the military stuff in here to &#34;Iron Sunrise&#34; by Charles Stross and you'll see what I mean.  There are way better ways to get your space marine fix.

B007N31YH0|5.0|...for one of the best movies ever.<br /><br />Paul Newman and Robert Redford are at the top of their game(s) in this classic.<br /><br />EDITED ON 08/10/13:<br />I know some didn't find my original review helpful, but c'mon people.<br />There are already over 300 reviews for this one movie. Are you reading every single one?!<br />And except for some who had issues with the DVD's Full Screen (I did not), almost 250 people already gave the movie 5 Stars. What else should I say?<br />The movie is a 40-year old classic with twists and turns (I refuse to spoil it for anyone), and it stars Paul Newman and Robert Redford. (Don't know who they are? Think: Matthew McConaughey and Channing Tatum.)<br /><br />Just buy it...and don't blink! You don't want to miss anything. :-)

B008LSVLZG|5.0|Simply, an incredible concert captured so professionally for all to witness the evolution of Steven Wilson.  From the opening song, in which the drummer (Marco Minneman) comes out alone and sets the table for the rest of the boys, to the ending in which Marco and Nick Beggs close it out, we are treated to a variety of moods from hauntingly beautiful to melodic to sinister.  Prog/rock/jazz/fusion is the feel and it is performed at a very high level by this band. The music Steven has written is exceptional. Well worth the investment for anyone of any taste.  Steven will be touring this year in both Europe and the States with this band sans Marco but with the infamous Chad Wackerman in his place.  DO NOT MISS THIS!

B002E2M5IC|3.0|After the prologue, the first half an hour of the main film is definetely great and very promising, supported by good editing and good pacing.<br />Unfortunately after this impressive beginning it weakens into something rather mediocre.<br /><br />Michael Stuhlbarg does indeed offer a great performance as the lead-character Larry Gopnik but the other characters, except for one or two, are mainly caricatures bringing with it an artificial feel and predictability instead of a human feel and more realism.<br /><br />There is throughout admirable subtle humor and there are really some hilarious situations - but also several unfortunate exaggerations.<br /><br />Though the overall portrayal of jewish community and atmosphere is respectful and well done, the portrayal of rabbis in this movie is quite devaluating, even a disgrace, not at all realistic. And to what avail?<br />(Yes, it does help to erase one possibility of redemption.)<br /><br />The supposed climax of the movie did not work for me as a believable or fitting climax.<br /><br />The makers of this movie show they have the capacities for creating quality but in this movie they were not able to sustain it.<br />Still, this movie is certainly worth seeing.

B005HWUBZ0|5.0|Several weeks ago while channel surfing I came across a most extraordinary musical talent performing on the PBS series \\"Live From The Artists Den\\".  The artist was Mayer Hawthorne and the tune that caught my ear was \\"The Walk\\".  I thought that Mayer's vocals were extraordinary and the background musicians exceptionally gifted. I had never heard of him.  I stuck around for the balance of the show and shortly thereafter decided to order his latest disc \\"How Do You Do\\".  It turns out to be an amazing album.<br /><br />What most impresses me about \\"How Do You Do\\" is that Mayer Hawthorne a/k/a Anthony Mayer Cohen wrote every one of the dozen tunes on the disc.  I was at a bit of a loss to categorize the specific genre of music I was listening to.  I guess it can be best described as \\"retro soul\\".  Although he currently resides in Los Angeles Hawthorne grew up in Michigan and has a great love for the \\"Northern Soul\\" sound that was so popular in the 1960's and 1970's.  Mayer counts among his influences people like Isaac Hayes, Smokey Robinson, Barry White, Curtis Mayfield and the legendary Motown songwriting team of Holland-Dozier-Holland.  I could listen to this guy all day.  Not surprisingly, \\"The Walk\\" is still my favorite track but there are quite a few other numbers on this disc that caught my attention.  I have always been a fan of catchy pop tunes and there is no shortage of them on \\"How Do You Do\\".  I particularly enjoyed \\"Dreaming\\", \\"Finally Falling\\" and \\"Hooked\\" while \\"Stick Around\\" reminds mean of something that might have been written and sung by the great Smokey Robinson.  Check it out!  Unfortunately, you just don't hear stuff like this on the radio anymore. And for more of a funky sound check out Mayer's duet with Snoop Dogg called \\"Can't Stop\\".<br /><br />Now it is my understanding that Mayer Hawthorne performs with a rotating cast of musicians so I really have no idea if the people playing on the record are the same ones who I saw performing on \\"The Artists\\".  No matter.  I am pleased to report that I found the musicians playing on \\"How Do You Do\\" to be every bit as talented.  Incredibly tight sound!  I was also surprised to discover that guitarist Dennis Coffey, who at one time was a member of Motown's legendary Funk Brothers studio band, appears on a couple of the tracks.  I count myself with another Amazon reviewer who \\"became an instant fan\\" after hearing Mayer's music.  Rest assured, based on what I have heard on \\"How Do You Do\\" I eagerly await Mayer Hawthorne's next release.  Very highly recommended!s\\".  No matter.

B00B5HQLMI|2.0|Skyfall is a dud, just an overall letdown.  Some of the performances are good but the script's weak and the plot's dumb.  Javier Bardem makes the most of his demented villain character but the writing is awfully thin (with the exception of \\"the last two rats alive\\" monologue.)  In his characters obsession with wanting to kill \\"M\\" (Judi Dench) he simply goes to ridiculous lengths - with pre-arranged elaborate escape routes for any impossible contingency .  Surely there must be more interesting ways to introduce Ralph Fiennes into the franchise.  Albert Finney is an after thought, which was really depressing to watch as the shotgun-toting grounds keeper.  Really!?!  Couldn't they have found something else for him to do here? Daniel Craig is still wonderful as Bond (although after this film, I'm wondering if he might be suffering from ED!?!  What happened to the beautiful Bond women?) Sam Mendes' technical work is fine here but he's given us a Bond movie that missed the musk on so many levels.

B00BN3EE1O|2.0|Safe Haven is a pretty sweet film that drags on for far too long. It isn't too hard to figure out the first mystery within the first fifteen minutes, the surprise ending is telegraphed at about one hour.<br /><br />This is a romantic film. Julianne Hough is absolutely gorgeous as Katie. Josh Duhamel is her handsome romantic interest Alex. Most of the film takes place in a tiny beautiful seaside town in North Carolina. Cobie Smulders (How I Met Your Mother) breaks out of her Canadian role from the television series and is a sweet pretty friend to Katie. The soundtrack is beautiful in a folky Amos Lee, Shawn Mullins fashion. The closing credit song is a pretty song by Colbie Caillat - the very tone of the entire film.<br /><br />The problem with the film is that pretty gets old after the first hour. The plot moves along so slowly, at times it felt like nothing happened for ten minutes. The flashbacks are poorly done, interspersed as nightmares. But then that vernacular changes later in the film with a huge flashback pouring in during the middle of the day. Aside from being horribly boring, there was a massive continuity problem at the end of the film. The following is not really a spoiler, but some sensitive readers might want to skip the last part of this paragraph. Katie is forced to leave; she tells Alex she has to leave and cannot stay. He believes one thing; she never tells him anything else, other than she's leaving. Later on Alex knows the whole reason why she had to leave, but she never told him that part of the story. Given that this film was sooooo slow and so deliberate about everything it did, this gap is massive. I would guess that when the DVD is released, a 10 minute scene will be included in the deleted scenes where Katie explains all to Alex. Sadly, they cut this portion out and the actual dramatic resolution makes absolutely no sense. There's no way Alex could know what he says, because Katie never told him.<br /><br />In theory this is a romantic comedy geared mostly to female viewers. Oddly, I happen to like a lot of romantic movies. This movie just didn't work. My wife sitting next to me never talks during movies, she was so bored she started making comments. We both walked away thinking we wasted two hours. I can understand how some might cry at the end. There is a bittersweet twist that does a little bit of tear jerker. Unfortunately the whole film resolves in the last ten minutes and I was just happy it was over.<br /><br />The film is rated PG-13. It deals with a violent subject that some younger viewers might find objectionable. There are a number of fights and almost strangulation in the film. There is a bedroom scene where it is clear that the couple is having sex, but it is about broadcast television grade. There is very little strong language. There are a number of scenes with alcohol use.<br /><br />This is a pretty film. If it was a magazine, I'd say buy it for the pictures and nothing else. The articles are bad. Josh, Julianne, and Cobie are beautiful to look at. The scenery is beautiful. The story, not so pretty.medy geared mostly to female viewers. Oddly, I happen to like a lot of romantic movies.

1451696191|5.0|This may be one of my all time favorite reads! It is filled with characters that are so easy to relate to that you will feel like Charlies friend's are your friends, his thoughts are Your thoughts. He expresses many of the thoughts that are going through a teenagers head and finds the best ways to answer them. This book will open your mind to so many new possibilities. The writing is a little fragmented as it is written as a series of letters from Charlie to an anonymous friend, but stick with it! This book is worth all the praise it gets and more. It is so short that it is nearly impossible to not finish it in one sitting! The plot drags you in to where you can't stop until you know what happens, and after it is over, you will be wishing Charlie, Sam, and Patrick's stories had all been continued.

B001NEK2GE|5.0|I'll begin by stating that I am completely new to the market of gaming peripherals to PC. I just recently built my first gaming PC, and the last time I played was on a basic IBM keyboard and mouse back in 2000. That being said, I didn't realize that this handy gameboard would quickly become a staple of gaming.<br />First and foremost, out of the package, it is very noticeable that this gameboard is designed with comfort and ergonomics in mind. It fits the contour of your hand very well. (And I have large, slender hands.) And it is coated with a nice rubber-esque material that feels good on your skin and provides grip. I have gamed for hours using this gameboard, and I am in no fear of developing carpal tunnel syndrome. It has a multitude of buttons, and they were all easily within reach of my fingers. Not to mention, the bottom has grippers that prevent the gameboard from sliding every which way when in use.<br />Secondly, the number of buttons offered is really just great. I have yet to play a game that demands more keys than this board offers. It also has an easily programmable set of four macro buttons, that make long tedious tasks on MMOs a lot more bearable.<br />Lastly, it has some great aesthetics. It's got an LED backlight, which you can modify the color for, as well as a built in computer screen. This screen is actually a lot more functional than I thought it would be. You can read world news, see computer CPU and RAM usage at a glance, see a virtual clock and use a stopwatch. However, the real strength of this display are the times when games are programmed into it. For instance, on Battlefield Bad Company 2, I can filter through several screens, showing my KDR, Points, XP to next unlock, server information all at a glance.<br /><br />All in all, this is an extremely beneficial product to my PC gaming setup and I would highly reccomend it to anyone who games on PC, whether they play MMO or FPS, it's been useful for pretty much everything.

B005EWDA3I|3.0|In My View: I enjoyed the last part of the trilogy somewhat less than the first two. It is just as well written as the first two books, the characters are intriguing, well developed, the scenery and contemporary Japan are of considerable interest, the suspense mounts, some weird stuff of dreams is introduced (which would have been acceptable to me if it were,perhaps, presented differently, or if it were solved in some no less than brilliant way before the end) the love story is appealing. But. My premonition about the Little People had been right...and it was something that I personally experienced even as a bit distasteful... At the end I realized that it was the \\"journey\\" that had fascinated me, while the \\"arrival\\" itself was not of great importance. Nevertheless, the \\"journey\\" was worth it! (I am sorry in case I have missed something in the larger plan of things...)<br />No recommendations needed: I am sure, that anybody who had read the first two books will want to read also the third one.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Laughing from page one with Don's thought processes - I could actually picture all the characters as they were very well described.  You will laugh and almost cry.  I think this would make a great light-hearted movie too.  Highly recommend this read.
B00A6D5GBE|4.0|I must agree that the developer has put some good work in creating the graphics and sound. It is clever design of game which is more or less a side-scroll-er but has other twists which makes the sleepy character reach his bed.<br /><br />The levels are not very hard to complete especially if you try for the second time you can get all your three stars and all the moons on the way. Love the ability to rewind time and fast forward to reach the bed. I also like the fact that the game is not rushed in anyway (especially knowing that the main character is sleepy) all you need to do in order to achieve a perfect level completion is to solve simple puzzles along the way and collect moons stars and go to bed.<br /><br />Cute game. Gets four stars!
B001AQT0RC|5.0|This is a great sci fi exploration of the human desire to believe (or not) in a higher power.  Special effects that make it all the more amazing.  Performances worthy of oscar nominations.  Don't miss Gary Busey's son in a short, but disturbing cameo as a religious nutcase.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I've read many books on NDEs throughout my life. Not to discount anyone else's, but Dr. Eben alexander's book is different. It sticks with you like no other.
B005EWDA9M|4.0|In My View: The first two books are very well written (like we've become used to with H. M.), enjoyable, and the \\"journey\\" is great! The characters are most interesting and well developed, the surrealistic atmosphere, location, and contemporary Japanese (or those of 1Q84) are very well presented and of significant interest. There is also enough suspense to keep one going on happily...and an appealing love story.... I utterly enjoyed the reading.(The references to classical music and such were pleasant, but I didn't understand their \\"relatedness to the novel\\" and the need for so many of them.) While all along I  had some not so pleasant premonition about the \\"Little People\\", to me part of the suspense was in the expectation , that this issue would be resolved brilliantly at the end of book III...<br />I recommend it, it is a good read, and one more achievement for H.M.

B009EEFTMC|2.0|I usually never give low star rating to any game unless it is very bad or has less appeal. This game was not appealing to me at all. May be because it was more or less a mahjong clone but in 3D cube style. I am  not a big fan of mahjong and may be that is why I did not like it. The colors of the tiles are not very attractive to me and the game gets repetitive very soon and there is nothing original about it. The music is not soothing either. Just take any mahjong style game which has been done over and over again and now put them in a 3D cube Viola! you get cubistry<br /><br />However, if you love the classic Mahjong style matching games this may be as colorful as it can be and you may very well like it just like some other reviewers and happy customers.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This series is gripping gut wrenching drama, peppered with zombie intestines and brains.  Not for children, that's for sure.  The writing is superb, with raw examination of all aspects of human survival under the most challenging circumstances.  A great series for AMC to challenge Showtime.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Language was much to raw; though the story  line was great. I was disappointed in DeMille's language choices. I seemed to remember he wrote a great story without all the cursing in the past; but perhaps I'm remembering incorrectly.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is a truly moving book.  Well researched and written.  A fantastic read for anyone, especially those with an interest in WWII.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|My favourite book by far. It was interesting to see how Charlie thought and acted and the dramw classic problems of teenagers growing up with a little Charlie flair. I would suggest this to a lot of young adults to read.
B009LT1YZ6|4.0|This is a clever clone of the popular [[ASIN:B00AK0X5VQ Osmos HD]] but with a twist wherein you are the fish and instead of touch controls you move the fish by tilt controls. The controls are not very fluid and can be frustrating at times but the game does have some nice graphics and sound effects and got my attention. I played it for a while and I seem to like it.<br /><br />If you liked playing Osmos HD and some black and white aspects of the [[ASIN:B009MCRHH6 World of Goo]] you will like this game. I got this as free app of the day and coming tomorrow the 99c is surely a good game to play.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a very fun game for horse lovers. It is very addictive and I play it all the time.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|excellent movie.one of Denzel's best.i will be watching it again.i liked the ending I was surprised.but I always knew that good people do the honest bthing.
1400067820|5.0|I have to declare at the outset that this is the first book to excite me in a long time and it still excites me now that I have completed reading it.<br /><br />Taleb begins with a relatively simple proposition, that there are some things that actually gain from discorder. In itself that would hardly seem like a remarkable statement but consider that most of us are active participants in a game where conformity rules and the crabs pull back those who attemp to escape from the bucket.<br /><br />I read mainly academic books, written in academic prose, following the steps, joinging up the dots, so this book was a severe jolt to my system. It takes you by the seat of the pants and throws you around like a waltzer in a fairground. No disrespect to the author but sometimes I felt like I was reading to a narrator who wrote like Groucho Marx speaks. You are experiency an intellectual maelstrom where the central ideas are enveloped in examples and histories from across the world which swirl around constantly to bring the point into clear focus.<br /><br />Fortunately you need no expertise in non-linear dynamics and complexity theories to understand Taleb's points as he uses tools on a variety of levels to bring the points home.<br /><br />The book is certainly provocative and will make uncomfortable reading for those in established positions in politics, corporations, economics and business schools, should they choose to read it. It is original in that it turns on it's head much of what is accepted behaviour in the modern world and pushes the reader through a gestalt switch into seeing the world in a new light.<br /><br />Infuriating? The breakneck speed with which the reader engages the book reminds me of the scene in 2001 where the astronaught is propelled through the star gate. As he moves forward everything is changing around him and he is awestruck by the carnival of lights until he finds himself in a somewhat recognisable room but still changes come. Essentially what I am saying is that there is so much a reader can take at any time and the book is a Pandora's Box, a treasure trove of ideas that it is very hard to absorb all of them as you read.<br /><br />Perhaps Mr. Taleb will authorise a Reader's Digest version.<br /><br />I encourage everyone to read this book and have their perception of life changed.  As for myself, as soon as I have met my committments with the items on my Vine list, I shall read it again.<br /><br />A remarkable book that deserves a wider audience.I am saying is that there is so much a reader can take at any time and the book is a Pandora's Box, a treasure trove of ideas that it is very hard to absorb all of them as you read.<br /><br />Perhaps Mr. Taleb will authorise a Reader's Digest version.<br /><br />I encourage everyone to read this book and have their perception of life changed.

B00BETX5PS|2.0|What more can I say...just like most of everything at this day & time...people are being catered to...by having their EARS TICKLED...and as such are reaping the CONSEQUENCES! This movie in NO way compares to the ORIGINAL James Bond aka Sean Connery, Roger Moore & Pierce Brosnan. It is a complete FARCE & in no way REPRESENTS the TRUE & REAL &#34;M&#34;, &#34;Money Penny&#34; and most importantly the TRUE James Bond characters. This is basically a hollywood FABRICATION to cater to political correct of this day & time...not a TRUE representation of AUTHENTIC James Bond movies. James Bond & the Male &#34;M&#34; will ALWAYS represent the TRUE...no matter how much today they WANT to change YOUR VIEW. James Bond in the original movies TRUELY represents the MAN of this day & time...and as such &#34;Money Penny&#34; and the rest of the woMAN are their FOR the MAN &#34;symbolized by the character James Bond&#34;. I will say what an ORIGINAL rap song said...&#34;Don't Believe The Hype&#34;!

B002UM5BXW|1.0|Lewd.full of foul language, gross behavior, takes interest out of going to any restaurant. Bourdain is self absorbed and crude.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|OH - b/c the plot is fantastic, even if the writing is painful.  A very few characters are actually well-drawn and they keep me suffering through the majority who aren't.  The plot is fascinating as everyone vies for power and discovers themselves in the process - this keeps me skimming through some of the more torturous bits.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great horse game. I'm glad I found it and its very addictive. I absolutely love this game!

B000SEGUDE|5.0|A thoughtful and talented contribution to modern literature. The novel is well-constructed, each line and chapter crafted carefully to build a story larger than any one plot arc. Mitchell's voice changes so completely to reflect each world he creates, and therein lies the success of each character and each microcosm we experience.  It was really a great read, and one I find myself referencing in conversation weeks after having finished it. (I also had to buy it in paperback - this one wasn't good for kindle, imho).
B008DL1DQI|5.0|This beautifully crafted British farce is not only great fun for audiences, it's also filled with lessons for screenwriters and directors interested in comedy.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|Loved it. Unique and interesting idea for the plot for the film! Parts of the plot required looking past the actual science involved, but other than that a good movie!

B007SGLZP8|2.0|I have read all Grisham's books but this one was not one of his best. It was a story that dragged at times, seemed confusing in events and was hard to stay interested at times. It did not flow well as his other books did in storyline. I would rate it mediocre.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|As always great pace, Rebus continues to be a brillant, wise cracking, rule braking and bending, pain in the butt cop; his superiors are incopetant climbers.  Complex story/crimes, needing the intuition of an old timer like Rebus to figure out and solve.  Shiv is younger, smart, grew up learning the craft from Rebus, always a bit of sexual tension between them, but it will never happen..great read!

6305278016|4.0|one of the few early cop classics out of this decade that still holds up over time. Music is not too kitchy and the dialogue contains a few memorable lines. Als stars a younger Andy Garcia. First 10 minutes or so starts out pretty mundane but it then settles into an investigative drama. Its mildy superficial but not overly so for this time period.
0316077046|4.0|Hhhhmmm.... I am going to be honest right from the start of this review. I read Beautiful Creatures right before I watched the film. I really enjoyed the book but the film was such a let down to me. To the point that I have a friend that was going to start the series after watching the film and now she doesn’t want to even read the book. I was even finding it hard to start Beautiful Darkness because of disappointed I was with the film. But I knew I shouldn’t be judging the series by the film so I bit the bullet and started.<br /><br />“We don't get to chose what is true. We only get to choose what we do about it.”<br /><br />Sadly I struggled to get into it... The first half of the book was just so-so and would have given it three stars if it had stayed that way. However, the second half was so exciting and fun and I would have easily given it five stars if the entire book had been that good. Since there was a mixture of the two I think a solid four is the most fitting.<br /><br />The reason I enjoyed Beautiful Creatures was because of the relationship between Ethan and Lena. Yes the side characters are fun and the story telling is simply beautiful... like really beautiful. You can almost hear the sounds of the town and you feel as though you could walk down the street and know your way around Gatlin. But it is Ethan and Lena that make this story.<br /><br />“I had never been this mad at her before. It was one thing to be attacked by someone you hated, but this was something else. This was the kind of hurt that could only be inflicted by someone you loved, who you thought loved you. It was sort of like being stabbed from the inside out.”<br /><br />So the struggling? Ethan and Lena are just not the same... Lena is pulling away from Ethan. Ethan tries to keep her close but off she goes. So the entire book is really about Ethan trying to find Lena and to save her from... well herself really. I just couldn’t get into the story because of what was happening to them. I know that couples will always at some point have a hard time of things and there are always rough patches, but this entire book was a rough patch for them.<br /><br />“In Light there is Dark, and in Dark there is Light.”<br /><br />Then... somewhere after around 65% things started to get really interesting and fun. The story that was unfolding kept my attention and I honestly couldn’t put the book down from this point to the very end. I was so happy to have that same excited feeling as I had from book one again. So much happens at the end of this book. It is just one revelation after another.<br /><br />“She was my destination. I was always on the way to Lena, even when I wasn't. Even when she wasn't on her way to me.”<br /><br />So would I suggest this series? My answer at this point would be a big fat yes. As I said I adore Ethan and Lena and I am invested in their future and I want to see what happens next.<br /><br />However... I think I need a little break from the series. I plan to read a few different books next and then I will come back to them. The writing truly is wonderful and as I said before you really do feel like you are there so with that said there is a lot of drama and I just feel like a need a tiny breather before I step back into Gatlin. I know there are still going to be rough patches but I am looking forward to seeing where the story takes Ethan and Lena next... Just not right away.<br /><br />“Because life goes on, L. The birds do their thing, and the bees do theirs. Seeds get scattered, and everything grows back.”<br /><br />Christine<br />Rainy Day Readsg to them.

B0047WJ12K|4.0|Christopher Nolan, iconic filmmaker, does nothing short of thrill his audience in this sci-fi action film that brings together both real world and dream world. With the help of special effects, plot development, acting performances, and a well written screenplay, Inception tackles reality with an interesting take on imaginary.<br />Dom Cobb, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is not your typical thief. By projecting himself into the minds of others, he can steal ideas and information from within their subconscious. Working in the world of corporate espionage, Cobb is the essential piece to the puzzle. However, every person has their weaknesses. When Cobb experiences these faults, he is left with one option to finally get his redemption. This time Cobb won't be stealing an idea, he'll be planting one. If he succeeds, he can go back to the family he's struggled to maintain. Cobb and his team: a \\"right-hand man\\" (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), an \\"architect\\" (Ellen Page), and an \\"imitator\\" (Tom Hardy) who can morph into another person's identity, possess the tools and qualities to successfully complete this task. Moreover, they have managed to perfectly plan everything. However, trouble arises when an enemy seems to know what they are up to and how to stop them. This thoughtfully poised plot will blow your mind.<br /> Almost as amazing as the plot and development in this movie are the specials effects. Whether it is the street folding scene in Paris, or the architecture created on cue: you are in for a visual indulgence. These visuals take you everywhere from zero gravity fights to visual paradoxes in hotels. Special Effects Director, Paul Franklin, does nothing less than turn dreams into reality with these visual aids.<br /> Nolan's ingenious script also helps to shape the movie. With this vivid screenplay, you are able to understand the brain and dreams on a whole new level. This script incorporates tricky concepts such as the subconscious and explains it in ways that will make you think. \\"Inception\\" is a lot to take in and develop; however, if you watch it with attentiveness, it is not a difficult movie to understand. The thoughtfully creative delivery makes it both enjoyable and mind stimulating.<br /> With many astounding performances, the acting in this movie makes for an even better quality film. \\"Joseph Gordon-Levitt\\" and \\"Tom Hardy\\" find themselves playing roles that could take their careers to the next level. In his past movies, Gordon-Levitt goes from playing a lost boy to a charming lover: This versatility allows for an interesting yet well played role. Hardy portrays a \\"soft side\\" to add more of a light side to the movie.<br />This breezy two and a half hour movie will leave your imagination to implode. This \\"must see\\" movie will keep you pondering and questioning. Though, this film slightly lacks the \\"wow\\" factor that everyone craves; it is a refreshingly interesting action film that will cause you to think and analyze for so long that you will have to see it again. Everything from the plot and development to the acting and special effects makes this film Grade-A. Christopher Nolan will leave you intrigued, thought provoked, and satisfied. You will never see another film like this. By the end, you will find yourself lost in both dream and real world.
B000LXHK2C|3.0|Just an easy watch kind of movie. A light plot and a younger Crowe always easy to take. His character is a bit annoying in the beginning but lightens up as plot progresses.

1600597963|5.0|Jamie Cloud Eakin<br /><br />Lark Jewelry & Beading<br /><br />One of my favorite pastimes during my childhood was embroidery work.  A trip to the local Ben Franklin store filled me with sweet anticipation.  The array of colored floss would pull me in like a magnet.  Hoops and needles were neatly arranged on the shelves, along with stamped pillow cases, dollies, bibs, hand towels and other sundry items.  Once the selections were made, I knew my weekend days would be filled with the joy of making French knots, satin, running,  stem, feather, tent stitches, etc.<br /><br />The book \\"Dimensional Bead Embroidery\\" takes one on a new adventure in embroidery land.  But this time, the allure is the beads.  I had attempted bead embroidery before without too much<br />success, but this book is a wonderful aid. Its primary focus is bead embroidery techniques for all levels of experience.  The photographic images and drawings are well defined and very instructive in illustrating the various concepts.<br /><br />In each chapter, the reader is taken by the hand and led down the yellow brick road.  From basic techniques to specific stitches and then on to components, no brick is left unturned.  If your design calls for a cabochon focal point, the instructions point the way.  Some projects can be completed in an evening, others take more time.<br /><br />What is the hurry though?  In the long run, the land of \\"Dimensional Bead Embroidery\\" is a wonderful awakening experience.

Each level has seperate  tasks to finish before going on to the next.  Objects are well hidden, several times I had to redo a task because time ran out.  It's a great game to keep your mind active
B005LAJ16I|4.0|It is good but a little slow moving at times. I do like the doubt planted about multiple characters.I would get another season to continue!

B008FYZIVY|5.0|The DVDs for Seasons 1 and 2 were received timely and exactly as promoted.  The casting and attention to period detail are reminiscent of the long version (with Colin Firth) of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.  Very well done.
B00846F1YW|3.0|This. game. is a real hidden object game what bugs me is some of the objects are<br />blocked by the drop down bar so it is frustrating when you have to use the clue.<br />But I have to say the graphics are very good.
B00AHTYGRW|1.0|I can not stand political movies made in Hollywood, USA.  This is a personal opinion.  They have no point to be considered entertainment.  Cinema is for entertainment only, and should not be used for political points of view.  I am so sorry, but I do not give a penny for this movie.  The Blu Ray transfer might be of first quality but the movie, to me, does not worth the time it takes to watch.  Sorry.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|A fun modern take on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's super-detective.  Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu are excellent as Holmes and Watson.  Aidan Quinn (NYPD Captain) is also quite good.  The episodes are well written and the dialogue is especially well done.  Holmes and Watson are both interesting, likable yet flawed characters.  Their interaction is a very fun part of the show.  Highly recommended.

B004GHNIRK|5.0|I was recomended this book by a friend and I am really enjoying it. It is filled with thought provoking passages so don't be in a hurry. Victor Hugo does like to expound on his ideas, don't fret if you get a bit lost, he will return to the storyline.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I could not put this book down. The minute I finished it I bought the sequel Point of Retreat, which was maybe even a little better. Read both.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I love bingo games and this one is no exception, the only problem is not enough coins, you run out and they don't give you enough the next day to play ..I want to continue to play without all the ads I find this very frustrating.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|When I started this series, I got hooked right away but as I go along, somehow I felt bored of the &#34;sexual content&#34;. The story line does not hold my attention anymore which is why I still haven't finished the last book after over 6 months.<br /><br />Anti-climactic towards the end -- the novelty had worn off.
B008476HBM|5.0|I can read it over and over again and never get bored of it! Highly recommended to start off if you're new to Jane Austen's books!
0143038419|5.0|What a refreshing perspective on one woman's journey to find herself, her faith, her love. It was even better the second time I read it.
B002VWNID6|5.0|This is a movie that I have liked for many years.  Finally bought me a copy and have really enjoyed it
0316228532|5.0|I loved this novel and greedily gobbled it down in just two days. You can just visualize the small English village and the characters therein. Now i can't wait for her next book.
B000UZ4G8M|1.0|when this arrived and gave it to  my daughter she made a comment mom these are CDs. to my surprised they were and i thut i bought dvd set for her. i was very disappointed since i thut they were dvd considering that was what i was looking for. i don't even recall seeing the &#34;CDs&#34; beside the title as you can see. i felt i was deceived.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I find this to be a very enjoyable game.  The graphics aren't as pretty as those of Fairy Cubes, but I don;t enjoy Fairy Cube as well due to the time pressures.  This is a nice relaxing game to play when you want something to do without feeling like it is a race.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|This is a movie that I have liked at the theatre so finally got me a copy and have really enjoyed it
B00170I7GG|5.0|We have watched this movie many times and decided to watch it again on Groundhog Day with our 12 year old daughter.  After watching it once, she went back and replayed a number of the scenes again and again and then rewatched the entire movie.  Some of the scenes are the kind that stick in your memory forever while others seem like they were inserted between viewings but are nonetheless hilarious.  The entire sequence when Bill Murray becomes convinced that he is immortal, will reawaken in the same bed at the bed and breakfast regardless of what he does and proceeds to do everything from getting arrested to committing suicide to telling Andie MacDowell exactly what is going to happen in the diner are absolutely priceless.  It is one of the funniest movies ever made and manages to have a message, as well.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Amazing series. I love the actors, their story lines, the costumes - everything.  The show moves me more each time I watch.
0307951529|1.0|This book was something that I hoped would provide inspiration and useful instruction [as a gift for my teenage nephew].<br /><br />However, I found it wanting in the extreme.<br /><br />Stories lack substantiating details.<br /><br />Compared to another book (&#34;Start Small, Stay Small&#34;) - this book pales in comparison to the value, level of detail, and hands-on direct applicability.<br /><br />Too Much Fluff, Not Enough Stuff.
B001AQT0RC|5.0|This is a movie that I have liked  for many years.  Finally bought  me a copy and really enjoyed it
B00APUQRPC|3.0|very slow.  I think film editors forget that most of us watch television which moves at a rapid clip.  When a movie drags for a tv watcher it last forever.  Good actors; good subject.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I believe this book was written with an approach to touch the readers through their emotions. I felt all of my emotions triggered through scene after scene. It was a perfect book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is the best game ever!  It's addicting. I play it everyday! You can challenge your friends and try to be your high score. I give this game a two thumbs up!
B000PC6A3E|5.0|I have enjoyed all the batman movies and the original show when I was a kid.  So have bought me a copy of all of them
B009JZTOG8|4.0|This show engages the watcher with intrigue and creativity. I won't watch on tv due to cliffhanger finishes to episodes so streaming video is great.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|a must read.  kept my interest right to the last page.<br />Would definitely recommend.<br />A great ending to the trilogy
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Bought for my GoPro Hero2 and it works great. I like that it has an extra long cord so I can run it all the way to the back of my car with the camera mounted to the windshield.
B001AQT11M|5.0|My grown daughter is collecting the whole Disney princess series so she  had to have them all and  this one too
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Way more challenging than I expected, but very fun. Would recommend this game for anyone who likes a fun challenge.
B0016OMFO8|1.0|I like vol. 1, & I'm trying to give vol. 3 many chances. However the more I listen to it, the more it hits me that I just don't care for it.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|good story line. hos challenging enough without being toow difficult. would recommend it to others. who like hidden object adventure games.
030759565X|5.0|My daughter picked this out  herself and sent me the link, so I know it was just what she wanted
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I found it to be very intriguing and as most of Grisham's books I found it to be thought provoking. Although I mentall kept thinking that I knew how it would all end I was very surprised. Would recommend it to all those who love a mystery that is out of the mold.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|Works well on my KindleHD.  Eminently playable to that final test of exacting scream!! Unnnh!  There's more than just the landing to explore.
B00B0ND67K|5.0|Since the early days of Loggins and Messina to the steller solo career of Kenny' years in music.He leaves us spellbound<br />with a great big smile and songs like stories that move us.Like his longtime friends Jim Messina and Michael McDonald,Kenny Loggins and his signature voice makes every song a hit.His son Crosby follows in his fathers footsteps,making music a magical journey.Buy any of Kenny's albums.You won't be disappointed.I have them all.With all the crap on the market,that the music industry calls hot.This is a example of real artists,who make great music.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|My grown daughter is collecting the whole Disney princess series so she  had to have them all and  this one too
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I found this a struggle to read.  Didn't really interest me too much..boring.  I kind of just repeats the same things and doesn't really give me any proof of heaven.
0062082353|5.0|Great book. It was easy to read and very insiteful in what actually happens over there and the life if a man that was safer over there then here at home.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I was looking for a good read to occupy my mind on the treadmill. This book was the distraction I was looking for! I actually spent more time than I intended b/c I couldn't put it down. I looked forward to working out just so I could revisit the characters & see what twists & turns lay ahead.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love that it has levels of difficulty and good challenge.<br />Makes me feel like I am stretching my brain a bit and<br />having fun doing it.  Satisfying challenge.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I love most of theses  hidden object games and the challenge of them. I also like having the hints buttons to.I only wish they were longer in duration.
B000244FDW|5.0|The best adaptation of Pride and Prejudice ever made. All the characters are perfect.  Mr and Mrs. Bennett are superb.
B009CF7GRY|5.0|Watched Julianna when she was on &#34;Dancing with the Stars&#34; and marveled at how flexible she could move.  So knew she would be good in Footloose and not a bad actress either.  And she can also sing.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I hate how this season ended. But every moment up until then was pure entertainment bliss. This is the best show I've watched in a long time.
8866130907|5.0|Small enough to carry in purse everywhere. I love the dates listed in a column on the left with the right side blank for notes. Red color makes it easy to find in my purse and the elastic band keep the book closed.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the whole series!!! Cant wait for 4th season!!!! I love all of the characters. My favorite is Violet..Show is fantastic!!!!
B003U4UPTE|5.0|After this season things get weird but the 1st and 2nd seasons are just captivating.  Knowing who these people were before the crash and then how they adjust after the crash - fascinating look at human nature.
B005DJGMQE|4.0|A must see for history buffs. Engaging and well acted. It appears on the surface to be a very believable account of the events surrounding the trial.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|This is not the cookie cutter story. It keeps you going, wanting more.<br />I will be looking for more from these authors.
B008ODZEQ0|4.0|The music in this documentary is beautiful. It is a interesting look at how one becomes the best at their profession.
B002ZG999U|5.0|Received this movie and watched it the same night with family and truly enjoyed it. I will ordered more movies from your site.
B006GLM5EQ|1.0|I watched only the first episode and that was enough. The main story lines were vampires are cool and I can't wait to have sex with one.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|We watched this with four kids under 10 and we all loved it! Intense, with great messages for life! About forgiveness and pride.
B002JWD6AS|4.0|Good read - slow in some parts but easy read kept me interested - I will continue reading the series
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I read James Lovell's book, Lost Moon, years ago, and Martian reminded me a lot of that story.  I know nothing about science or math, but the details seemed believable and I could barely put the book down until it was finished.  The main character and the relationships between the secondary characters were very engaging.  A great read.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|Claire Danes does a good job portraying someone who is severely Bi-Polar. I feel sorry for her at the end of season 1.
B001JK7Y9K|5.0|The dancing alone will make you want to see this movie again and again. It does not disappoint! A classic!
B009O2XY12|2.0|Started out as a good free game, but when i ran out of bubbles and bonus points the only way to continue was to purchase more with your own real money. Would not recommend this game.
B004EWFUQY|3.0|While I am sure this may work for some, it certainly wont work for everyone.<br /><br />I am not incredibly overweight, I have 10, maybe 15 pounds to lose. So I was hoping this would aid in helping me with these last pounds that have bothered me for years.  Let me just say, I followed a 3 day attack phase religously, and had no benefits whatsoever.<br /><br />I ate only super lean protein,<br /><br />I used no fat and no sugars,<br /><br />I didn't touch any carbs except making toast for my daughter,<br /><br />I drank the recommended water intake or more.<br /><br />I got outside and walked each day for 30-40 minutes.<br /><br />I didn't lose an ounce.  I gained a half pound.  And in fact, I actually gained 1/2 inch on my stomach (prob due to meat overload), and about 1/2 on each thigh as well.<br /><br /> I was disappointed after 2 days of nothing but stuck with it another day just to check.<br /><br />And I found myself continually annoyed by the \\"use aspartame and splenda and drink diet soda\\" routine.  While no one is expected to follow that to succeed on the diet, I cant believe a Dr. would recommend this.  I have never drank soda personally, but come on!, that diet crap is terrible for you.  And large quantities of art. sweeteners actually stall your metabolism.<br /><br />So some people may find this helpful, but really, try eating a couple days of only lean protein and lots of water and just see how your body does with it before you buy this book and muddle through the whole thing.<br /><br />I don't think its appropriate for some, just a warning
B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|Great music. I love the TV show & this is the music & songs with the actor singing. Looking forward to season 2!
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|I cannot remember ever seeing a film with such a powerful and complex ending.<br /><br />Ultimately it is a triumph of Human Spirit.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book had me hooked right from the start! I couldn't put it down! This book has you sitting at the edge of you seat!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I had heard so many people talk about this book and I wanted to read it for myself and I'm glad I did. It is so good and really exciting.
B0094K1PW4|5.0|Not to bad, a Sandlot type of move just not baseball aliens.  Wasn't what I expected it, very well written.
B002SSBD6W|5.0|The case for veganism built here is irrefutable. If every adult reads this book, our world will be completely changed. I'm sad to think that probably won't be the case.
B00005JNS0|4.0|My 3 yr old grandson loves this, but he won't watch the whole thing...too long. No problems, though. He can always put it on again to entertain himself.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Fast read, thrilling. Classic king. Exciting build up, horror occurring in a very every-day setting. Great character development in such a short amount of time.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I don't like that it's so easy to move cards...it's ok that you can click on them and they move where they are suppose to but often times I'm just passing a row and the cards move and then it has cost me a move that I didn't want.
0547848412|3.0|I found a dog-eared copy of this in paperback by the side of the road one day on a walk home. I decided to entertain the story after reading much acclaim and praise of the author. The tale of survival earns high marks for reader engagement. Pi's trials in the Pacific often rendezvous with primal sanity at degree 360 after an arduous battle with the wilderness has traversed a full circle. As a first person narration; \\"The Psychology of Pi\\" might be an equally fitting title, although \\"The Life...\\" is overtly physical.<br /><br />The fabulist manages to marvel at nature during an 8 month struggle with self, circumstance, exposure and the elements... not to mention an aptly named companion and would-be predator; cast away Tiger: Richard Parker. As anthropomorphic as allegorical \\"Pi\\" navigates the dynamic of the food chain/IQ.<br /><br />I would categorize this novel in the genre of Realistic Fiction for its use of economic scarcity and contention rather than fantasy. I found the most unlikely detail to be that a lifeboat user manual would include a guide on how to clean a sea turtle.<br /><br />In a word, the theme of this literary journey is clear: endurance.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Allways good, exciting, non stop action. I think the good lord above that life has nor got that bad. Good stuff
0062200909|5.0|My family loves the book. The artwork from the movie is beautiful and the detail is wonderful.  A great companion to the movie.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this game it's a challange somewhat..I have to clear each layout in order...obsessive lol  Would like more layout options.
B000FCK65W|3.0|As a reader outside of the U.S.,  I am not so familiar with the society and life during that era. This book provides the vivid background information. I find the details of her life and family satisfy my curiosity much more than the plot. I read some paragraphs to my 8-year-old daughter and she loves it!
B002MFX0RQ|4.0|You know this show is remarkable.  It is slow, eccentric, and sometimes downright goofy, but due to the strong acting of Jimmy Stewart and others it somehow holds your interest.  One thing is sure.  It is memorable.  I think I only saw part of it once before probably 25 years ago on a station that showed a lot of old movies, but I never forgot it and always wanted to see it again, this time in its entirety.  I finally decided to find it on Amazon and purchase it.  It was only then that I found out it was based on a successful and long running Broadway play and that James Stewart often starred in those presentations.  I would like to give it 5 stars on uniqueness alone, but I don't think it is something I would watch again and again like &#34;It's a Wonderul Life.&#34;  Still don't let that dissuade you from watching it.  It's worth seeing even if you watch it only once or twice in a lifetime.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awsome this is so cool I like it a lot this is super amazing plus it is so hard some times
B009O2XY12|3.0|Not much different than other games where you match items....I like it when I hit I don't know what and lightening happens and a bunch disappear.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I don't review many books, but this non-fiction book is better than any fiction book you could find.  The author did an amazing job of putting details together and telling the emotional story of a German pilot and an American pilot's unbelievable encounter.  I have already recommended it to all our friends and highly recommend it to anyone who has an interest in aviation, military history or just a good story.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great love story..Makes you believe in love at first sight. Love can come when u least expect it so be open and trust your heart.
B009XTF8KQ|4.0|I like this movie. It was not like the Exoriorist and this one goes a different one is a whole different way of telling a possession and exorcism. Loved the ending.
B004JM8X5E|5.0|I liked this movie since the first time, and I wanted to watch it again. I think the actors did a good job!
B0094K1K42|4.0|I liked it but after watching the previews, it is a little darker than they lead you to expect.  I did find it humors at times and I also found myself cringing at times.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|it's a wonderful story,based on true situation in afganistan and well plotted love story. situation in which women endure in Agranistan and aomost every middleeast countries must be inproved.
B007GE2H3G|4.0|Cute Movie.  Sort of a cross between Sherlock Holmes and Get Smart rolled up in animation.  Suited for young adults.
B009CCBCU4|2.0|Maybe I'm just outside the target audience. This seemed more like a book for the adolescent crowd (where it might find a more appreciative readership) than this old guy. I believe there was some interesting history here, but I couldn't get involved with the characters...too many young ones without the base of mature ones to carry the story line past the teenage &#34;angst.&#34; Like I said...maybe I'm just too old to appreciate it!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My daughter recommended I give this a try, I like puzzles. At the start it seems mindlessly easy and a bit boring. Then I tried some higher levels and discovered it can be quite difficult. If I'm going to stick with a game I want to be challenged. This is fun quiet and entertaining.
B006YC74E8|3.0|Easy to use, but I couldn't find the folder to where photos were saved at, but otherwise easy to use.
B000KE1PDC|5.0|This is an excellant version of Dicken's story. Great actors and actresses. I've seen other versions which I have enjoyed also, but this is the best!
B004J4WKTW|2.0|I don't care for fantasy and there were too many characters.Blah, Blah, Blah.  So glad to finally finish it.  Book club is Thursday and I will be interested to hear what the others will have to say about it.  I think I wqill be quiet.............
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I am a fan of Nicholas Sparks. I think he writes with gentleness and more like a woman writer than a man. There is no crudeness in his writing.
B003M8NGM6|5.0|A lot of people get confused when watching the matrix reloaded. And yes you might have to see it again to pick up things you may have missed. But that is a clear sign of a great movie. A film that makes you think! A film that makes you want more. A Film that challenges the viewer.<br />The Effects are out of this world. Looking at them now in Feb 2013 I am taken back at how well they live up to the effects we see in movies today. Just perfect.
B0034G4OYA|4.0|The ending to the movie was the worst part. It felt like they just wanted to wrap it up fast and didnt really think of an actual ending. The movie it self was cute and had a good story. It was just the last 20 minutes that didnt make much sense.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I delayed reading Life of Pi because I dislike fantasy and particularly dislike books where animal suffering and death are used for heartstring-pulling and to add cheap emotional depth.  I was VERY pleasantly surprised by the amusing, smart writing, the clear-eyed approach to religion, and especially the zoological realism of the animal portrayal.  I also admired the realistic description of both physical and psychic pain during the long tribulations.  In the end, I thought it was indeed a fantastical adventure, and was not at all inspired.  The sense I got was of an uncaring nature and universe--including insurance agents!--triumphed over by one admirable individual.  So, I enjoyed it but it did not really stay with me.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Great movie!! Everyone should see this movie!! Great story line. Excellent actors. Great feel good movie and based on true story.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Reacher is one of my favorite characters of any book.  The only disapointment when you finish a Reacher novel, is that you finished it.  I can't wait for the next one!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Loads of fun. Great way to pass the time and make you think. I'm completely addicted. A must have for everyone.
1451629192|5.0|I read this book In about a day it was really good. Couldn't stop reading. I received it fast which was nice.
B00AOMR2S2|5.0|Loved the movie, and the soundtrack is awesome.  I can't stop listening to it!  I hope they make another movie!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Hooked the moment I read the intro.<br />Can't wait to read more. Difficult to put down. I am reading it as soon as I submit this.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|used it on other phones and it works well.<br />No problem whatsoever.  Very handy if you go on Facebook allot.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|For a phone game it was cool. The puzzles were fun and the story line, interesting. Not bad for a few bucks :)
B00571F26Y|5.0|The book makes a lot of sense! It is a great way to lose unwanted pounds! Your belly will get smaller, too!
B00B5ACNRM|4.0|Saw this movie weeks ago through a Torrent but just brought  the DVD at Walmart they have the 2 disc version with the slip cover there, now why wait till march u know but any way good movie,animation on this not my fav but is ok but loved the story,if it looked more like the red hood or superman batman apocalypse it would have been great, the trailer they have for super man unbound sucks but the extra batman shows r nice to watch ,we all have seen them before if ur a true batman dc fan ,but still cool to have them there
B005HEFB6M|5.0|A great show for people who love everything Star Trek, my husband and I watch it together. Give it a try! :)
B0001US62I|5.0|The acting in this is excellent. The plot twists and turns and made me a nice kind of dizzy. Scared the hell out of me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing and I have some ideas. plz add a section in the game that you can be able to customize charactor and hover board.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|A great start for Jack. A whole town with the wool pulled over their eyes. There`s trouble on the horizon with literally tons of money involved and even Jack`s family involved.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|I loved everything about this book! The historical back ground, a murder mystery, hardship, friendship and love all wrapped up in one. It makes me appreciate being from America and being free. Being controlled by the government it's hard to know what character I would end up like.
B002AS463W|5.0|Very sensual and surprising. The chemistry between Kim Basinger and Mickey Rourke seems so real and outstanding.Don't pass this one up!
B004JHYRP4|5.0|I never read this book as a youth, but thought I would get it on kindle.  Amazing his ideas and how he presented them way back when.  Way ahead of his time and building stories on the leading edge of science.  Well worth the read.
B008MWBY6W|5.0|This is a very nice small case for my Canon DSLR. It will hold other models, but the Canon is the only camera I have tested it with. There is plenty of room for the camera and one lens. The pockets are all very small, but are plenty of room for power adapters, memory cards, etc. The hard bottom of the case is also nice for setting the case down without having to worry about being extremely gentle. The shoulder strap is also comfortable and fits well. I would recommend this bag for anyone that needs a small, light case to protect their DSLR and carry a few accessories.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|The movie was very original and creative. A whole lot of fun for the entire family! There was quite an extensive list of well-known actors, too.
B00274EYKY|5.0|This is the best movie I have ever seen. Mickey Rourke's work in this one is outstanding. I have watched it 5 times and have cried in the same scenes every time. One of the best movies of all time.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I typically don't read &#34;detective books&#34;, and don't buy into the whole military training is the best thing that can happen to a person.  However this guy, Lee Child, writes a very intense, very nicely paced book.  The book starts fast, by like page 3 or so, then basically doesn't let up.<br /><br />I also like how he follows the one main character, perhaps it's lacking finesse or perhaps overly simple, but I don't get that feeling at all.  It's riveting.  He switches to other characters for a few pages then it's back to Jack Reacher.<br /><br />His choice of wording is what I think other people are trying to emulate in this genre but now that I've read this guy.  Well he has talent.<br />Worth buying, and I'm going to read them all.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|A beautifully done and uplifting film that will compel you to listen to the music that is woven wonderfully throughout. Rodriguez makes you appreciate, and should compel you to seek out, the true talents in any artistic field. A legend from the streets of Detroit, from a completely different block than Motown, is now, thankfully, thrust into our larger consciousness.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this game verry much. This game is very addiing. I really like it but wissh you had more thsn one charter
B007KDFWRG|4.0|Been a Susan Tedeschi fan from way back when she played locally here in the northeast. I first saw Derek Trucks years ago playing with the Allman Bros Band at Saratoga. Together, they are just awesome. A lot of this is covers of old favorites with a bluesy flavor and very well done. Darling Be Home Soon was one of my favorite John Sebastian songs and their cover of that song is just fantastic.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|But still up there.  I actually read this one second, and after reading Die Trying, well, it's good, but not quite as good.  Still excellent and definitely worth the read.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This is such a touching and beautiful piece of literature....very long, so don't plan on reading it in one afternoon but an epic<br /><br />Story nonetheless...very twisted plot with tons of interesting characters you're sure to fall in love with...highly recommended..I'm sure it will bring you to tears as it did me..very very good book
B000VMBXNA|5.0|Wonderful book, easy to read,<br />The perfect book to take along, very entertaining.<br />Brilliant author, worth every word<br />It will make the perfect gift
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Bought it on release day and I'm still playing it. I bought their first cd also and still play that. The grammy was well deserved.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|She loves it and the price of &#34;FREE&#34; is always good.  Easy to download and installed without any problems. She is very happy with it and I enjoy playing it too!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|got this app because I have a passion for horses and I love it so much. You start off with a horse that they name Beauty and then you.may rename the horse and care for your horse I recomend this to anyone!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This should be read and discussed at all middle schools - it touches upon so many important themes - tolerance/intolerance, acceptance, bullying, fitting in, developing character. A very touching, moving story with some intense parts. It was recommended to me by one of my students, and I couldn't put it down.
B002RXZF6C|5.0|This is the movie that gave Frankenstein's monster the flat head he has on Halloween costumes.  As you watch it, you see how parts of it have been mimicked for generations of movies.  Still, the movie maintains its suspense and occasional humor when you watch it now.

0345803485|5.0|Wow....I really enjoy this book. In despite of the  dark side and hidden personality of Christian Gray. I must admit I am in love with him. I don't know if everybody will agree with me but I think  I would relly like to find a Christian gray  for myself. : )<br />My husband is jealous of him....lol.

B003YL4LYI|1.0|The point of this review is to give you, potential reader, an honest and fair review of a series you've probably heard a lot about, but not enough to decide if its worth the money to buy, and the time to read. I have suffered through all 5 books at this point, and will attempt to describe briefly some high points (there are a few), and the low points (there are many). Then, you can hopefully use this information to help you decide for yourself.<br /><br />High points (such as they are) - Martin obviously loves the world he writes in. He has created an intricate, detailed version of Medieval Europe and the Middle East, and is very dedicated to enriching that environment and making it as immersive as possible for the reader. A few of his characters are well developed (not all, or most, unfortunately - read on). Martin tries valiantly to imitate some authors he obviously admires (JRR Tolkien - beyond using the double-R in his name, some scenes, character details, names, places, etc are obvious hat-tips to Tolkien - I find that trait admirable, even when the author in question (Martin) is so far beneath his idols in terms of writing ability). And once in a long while, Martin will succeed in writing a scene which is almost worthy of publication - while certainly not inspiring or thrilling, it may at least be mildly amusing.<br /><br />But that is where the high points end. If I had to do it over again, I would not spend the money or take the time to read these books. Now, usually, when I make that decision, it's because the books are merely poor literature - the writing is bad, the authors abilities are poor, or the plot is mundane. While all 3 are the case with Martin and this series, these books are not merely poor literature - they are offensively poor literature. There are 3 major reasons for this.<br /><br />1 - Formulaic plot (when it exists): All 5 books so far, but especially this one and book 4, suffer from the utter and complete lack of plot, and worse, what little plot does exist is utterly formulaic and predictable. Those who believe the series boasts &#34;cliffhangers&#34; and &#34;unexpected turns&#34; simply haven't spotted the formula - and that's curious, because the formula is simple and rather obvious. First, Martin will introduce characters which fit (more-or-less) into classical &#34;good and evil&#34; stereotypes, and a few which are ambiguous but likeable. He will develop these characters with the intention of making the reader hate the &#34;evil&#34; characters, and grow attached to the &#34;good&#34; characters. The few ambiguous characters are used to ask shallow, mundane questions about existence: &#34;Can ugly people be likeable?&#34; &#34;Does good always win?&#34; &#34;Is honor and virtue important in life, or will it just get you messed over by the bad guys?&#34; I suppose George finds these questions absolutely mesmerizing, but unfortunately most of the rest of us discovered the answers by the time we reached puberty.<br /><br />2 - A shallow fascination with &#34;going against the grain.&#34; Now that Martin has good and evil characters, and bored us with these stupid, sophomoric, and transparent questions, he will attempt to shock us all by killing the &#34;good&#34; characters in meaningless and trite ways. Those characters with the highest morals, greatest honor, etc, Martin kills in the most mundane ways - sometimes by a mere accident, but more likely at the hands of one of the &#34;evil&#34; characters. Martin, apparently, is attempting to reassure us that &#34;power corrupts&#34; and &#34;only the good die young.&#34; Again, Martin apparently thinks these stories are &#34;real&#34; and &#34;gritty&#34; and &#34;bold&#34; for &#34;daring&#34; to kill off the major characters that way, when actually, they're just boring, formulaic, and predictable. (By the way, one side effect of this &#34;shocking against the grain&#34; writing is the we readers never get attached to the &#34;good&#34; characters after he kills the first one or two. As a result, we find ourselves totally uninvested in the story itself). The evil characters, on the other hand, usually live prosperously, but may occasionally have a sudden (and most unlikely) change of heart, becoming &#34;good&#34; themselves due to some off-the-wall Deus ex Machina. In that case, they'll soon die of an accident or at the hands of one of the &#34;evil&#34; characters.<br /><br />3 - Gratuitous, graphic sex and violence. Lest you roll your eyes, stereo-type me as a prude, and assume that I am simply bashing all these books for this reason alone (making up the other points or embellishing them), let me assure you that I have no problem whatsoever with sex and violence (graphic or otherwise) when it serves the story. Both should be used to advance the plot, develop the characters, illustrate the culture in which the story or set, and so on. The problem is that in these books, the sex and violence do none of these. Instead, both are used as a cheap trick to sell more books; sex and violence seem to exist as an afterthought and are thrown in whenever the author believes he needs to keep the reader's attention (which is actually somewhat perceptive, since he fails so miserably to keep our attention in other ways). That means that the books have now been degraded to cheap porn - and if it's cheap porn one wants, why read through thousands of pages to get it?<br /><br />All of this combines to insure that, while I will not only refrain from spending any more money on anything else that Mr Martin writes, I actually took the time to give you, the reader of my review, a bit of information which may help you to keep from making the same mistake I made. There is far better fantasy literature out there - thousands upon thousands of pages of it. Spend your money, and your time, on it - and pass these horrible impostors on the genre by.rs after he kills the first one or two.

B00A14V0MM|5.0|A super good cast, great music & funny cool story. This has everything a romantic comedy should have.  It's this decade's &#34;Dirty Dancing&#34;.
B004HD61KE|5.0|I really like James Rollins. He has a great story line and keeps tying it all together and points so you don't get lots. great action
B002WNC5BU|5.0|Not surprised that The Edge is more of a computerized guitar player while Page and White are the real deal. Page was mesmerizing and many times White and Edge watched him with wide eyes. The highlight of the three of them playing together was when they played slide guitar. Edge seemed to be somewhat lost but Page and White were especially hot together. Just a fun time while watching these guitarists perform and tell stories.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game because you get to see all your favorite ponys whenever you want.You can't take your eyes  off it when you sart too  play!
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|This film has graphic language about sex and lots of female nudity but nothing is explicit.  The directer did a fantastic job in telling this true life story. I knew it was critically acclaimed however I was prepared for something campy like so many films out there like &#34;The Hangover&#34;. What I wasn't prepared for was the sweet gentle well acted film I cried through. Lovely film.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|My daughter loves this app. She has become the Angry Birds champion at our house.  It is deserving of all five stars!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|At first it I was worried, thought it was a cheap knock off. Then the packaging came in. It was really nice and well presented. When I finally got to use it, I was stocked. It was so lightweight and well designed. The buttons where position in the right areas. Moving the mouse around felt so effortless. If you felt the mouse was too light, its include with weights that you can put in the mouse to your liking. For me it was a nice change to this. Coming from other gaming mouses I have used in the pass. Its not as solid as I would like, but I'm content. This mouse has 9 programmable buttons, more then enough for me to play my fps and mmo. I would recommend this to anyone in the market for cheaper alternative gaming mouse to razor. You won't be disappointed.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|works great! Now if my phone is not nearby when i fall asleep i can use my kindle! Try it
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham delivers another fantastically written novel. I could not put it down. It is most definitely worth the purchase.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Very good look into the reality our soldiers face over seas or here at home. A must read!<br />Check it out.
B00A6N7QIA|3.0|Good story, nothing earth-shattering.  Shocking performance from Lively.  Great characters.  The title refers to a Mexican Cartel, and then ultimately to the main characters.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Really makes you think about results vs rules and what could've happened in general. Definitely takes you back and forth between end result and all the things that were wrong.
B0017PD2J8|5.0|I learned things about the Holocaust I never knew......Despite the situation Frankl remains hopeful.  It is a very inspiring book.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|It's a very fun game, all but the adds, every time I get done with a turn, an add pops on and eventually it gets annoying. It's fun except for the adds.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I didn't understand the DA obsession until a snowy weekend found me & my husband housebound. We went thru the first season that weekend in entirety. Amazon is the only place we found where we could get the second season on demand relatively cheaply. (free with our prime membership). Totally hooked.
B007PP2J9I|4.0|I felt like Mark dropped the ball on the complexity of the plot, not usually a big deal but when you consider &#34;zero day&#34; this was a bit of a let down
B0051QIGP4|4.0|I don't like every song on the album, but the ones I do like end up being played many times a day. I think this record showed good evolution and growth from her earlier work.
B002S218P4|5.0|You don't hear anything like this around anymore. She has an amazing voice. Accompaniment is on par with the singer. I would sincerely recommend it to anyone.
1451695195|5.0|Very interesting reading,you need to stay focused to understand it. It took a little longer to read, to keep information  straight.
1439127700|4.0|Liked it a lot.  Very informative.<br />Long and a little hard to read.<br />I like to be short & sweet word requirement dumb
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|If you like her earlier work, give this album a whirl. It's a short album, but it follows Born to Die beautifully
B007SGLZP8|1.0|Usually I like John Grisham - but I kind of feel like he is just dialing it in on this one.  He has a disclaimer in the beginning of the book that says that he didn't base this story on reality...NO KIDDING!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Just the right amount of romance without being sleazy and a story that you could only read in a book because you know it could never happen in real life.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|It was ok, not the best yet, just ok.<br />I would have liked more James Bond trick stuff. It was kind of a let down at the end. rIp, M
0525953590|4.0|it's tough reading for a non physicist, but loaded with information particularly about how they determine that it exists and the LHC
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Took me longer to get into than the previous &#34;new&#34; Bond films. For some reason I felt more detached. Not to give anything away, but I didn't feel like I was involved enough to show emotion by the closing credits.<br /><br />There are some cool character reveals, but not as much hand-to-hand as I expected and the opening &#34;chase&#34; scene was very lacking on the green screen efforts.<br /><br />Overall very good, but I liked the previous two better.
0143039431|5.0|Hands down one of my favorite novels of all time. I instantly fell in love with the Joad family and my heart went out to their struggles. I love how Steinbeck uses religious elements to create such a heartfelt story. In my Western Literature class, almost everyone hated the ending. Not to give anything away to those who haven't read it, but I loved the ending and don't think it could have ended any better. I thought it the ending gave a weaker character purpose that she desperately needed to fulfill.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|As much fun as version one, but with more hazards and pitfalls to liven things up.  The mine car is the perfect enhancement!
B003U4ZU7Q|5.0|Before I began watching Lost I was told the ending was horrible, however, after now watching the entire show myself I do not think the ending could have been any better. I believe that if you do not enjoy the final episode then it is because you did not watch the show closely enough and simply just do not understand it.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|Ok now when is part 2 coming out. I want the rest of the story. Definitely satisfied with they buy and the shipping.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the story, love the characters, love it all!  Costuming is just awesome and the scenery is beautiful!  Can't wait for 4!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless is full of Hope, the characters were well developed and each page gives give the reader asking for more. Read this if you are interested in complex family issues.
B000056HE9|4.0|After seeing the Preacher's Wife, this one seems a bit quaint.  Fun to watch, though.  Loretta Young is such a class act, even now!
B00B7G3Y4U|1.0|Don't waste your time watching this they aren't even making this series make sense anymore. They had success early on, but now they are just doing anything and everything to try and keep it alive. This franchise is getting stale and the only way I see them saving it is if they wrap it all up in the next movie and really delivery on the fear and suspense factor.
B0060D15AK|3.0|This is an Ok comedy, but not one of Sandra Bullock's best, in my opinion. Not much depth, even for a comedy.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|The last book was a big let down!  But they have made up for the last one and I can not wait for the next book!!  I was really nervous about this book, because of the last book being so disappointing!  Thank you for coming back stronger the ever!!  Love me some Agent Pendergast!!!
B000HEWEJO|5.0|Absolutely fabulous!!!  I watch it at least 3 times during the Christmas season and whenever I need a &#34;pick me up&#34;!
B0083Z614S|5.0|I read this book years ago and thought it would be a great addition to the classics I have.  I missed Mary, the sour girl who lost her parents in India and was forced to move to England.  Once I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down and everything I remember was there again.<br /><br />This is an excellent book to read and really gives you a sense of life and living.  If you think you can't, then you probably won't be able to.  But if you believe in the magic of life, the happiness to life around you is just behind the door to The Secret Garden.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|I loved the movie Taken. It's a great movie for people who love action, but I would not recommend it to kids under 12 because, while it's not scary, it's intense, and what makes it scary is that things like this kidnapping happen in real life, and to children, it could be pretty scary.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|its better than and i3 but better than an i7 who would have thought. just what you need for gaming
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Everything was expecting it to be. Needed it for my collection for it wouldn't be complete without it. Loving Season 8 so far.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I will never look at my dog again without thinking about this book! What a fantastic story, and so well written that I had to start reading at a slower pace because I just didn't want it to finish. Beautiful, touching, very clever.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Didn't see the  coming liked I better than book number one fifty shades is grey can't wait to find out what happens
0793518326|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend's birthday. He is a Beatles fanatic and a pianist. He has had this on his &#34;wish list&#34; for years. When I gave this to him, his face lit up. He's picked &#34;Martha My Dear&#34; as the first song to learn properly. It's the easiest gift for any proper musician who loves the best band that ever was.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|This is a very good game/puzzle. It is very responsive to finger touch, I would give it 5 stars if it would work with the s-pen.
B00138GZAC|5.0|Wish this lady would sing more!!  The passion, the lyrics, the attending music is classic. What's not to like?? Sade rocks!
B005IQZB14|4.0|she displayed a lot of courage and took advantage of the people and their knowledge on the trail.  no panic.<br />Book kept you interested.
B0063GORYU|1.0|This made my pad freeze.  Didn't like it at all.  Too many ads too.  That's what made it freeze.  Wouldn't recommend it to you.
B009G78EE2|5.0|An amazing debut album.  Macklemore is an amazing lyricist and speakers with such honesty about life, personal struggles and the music industry. Ryan Lewis' production is also spot on, ranging from catchy to more serious background beats appropriate for the tone of the song. This album is a true asset to the hip hop genre and hope this will be an inspiration for aspiring artists. I'll be listening to and sharing this album for many years. While thrift shop is indeed great, you would be missing out to only purchase the single.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|ok if your are a pony lover and have nothing to do for a long time and for kids that love my little pony.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This was an all-too-real and frightening tale of cyber-espionage.  Tom Clancy is still in excellent form.  Highly recommended for all!
B007SY3CEW|5.0|This app is so much fun!  I've always wanted to play piano and this really makes me feel like I can.
B00B7FXZQS|1.0|Hang it up. These sequels get more dull with each installment.  I was hoping for a surprise hit. So much for hope!
0143119680|2.0|The first 100 pages were so promising. But then the strong, intelligent heroine becomes a tired, fragile little china doll.  The book really drove me nuts.  I literally had to spot read through the last 300 pages (very long book, btw).  Our herione sleeps, eats, drinks tea, all the while, being carried around by a gorgeous, hair-flipping vampire.  I've never seen two characters go from so likeable to totally unbearable.  The only reason I gave this book 2 stars is for the two (action) scenes in which the herione comes face to face with real evil.  It could have been a great story.
B003VS0CX8|3.0|A classic that promised a pretty amazing experience. The DVD was as expected - the same great musical performance I remembered with the typical softening that MPEG2 compression does to movies. Some folk here also noted a number of other issues, that I'll leave to them - I'm just going after the obvious issues.<br /><br />I had high hopes for the Bluray version and was disappointed. This movie was allegedly shot on 70mm film, the largest and most expensive format available back then, and with plenty of resolution. I sincerely doubt that the folk doing the filming would have allowed as many scenes as there are in this movie to appear out of focus and devoid of detail as they are on the bluray transfer. It could also be a function of excessive compression being applied... who knows. The bottom line is that this version of the movie does not offer the resolution to make bluray the big step up that I expected.<br /><br />Perhaps the originals weren't in that great a shape anymore but in many scenes the detail I was hoping for simply wasn't there. That said, the bluray movie still looked a lot more like an film-based movie (with pulsing grain and all the other typical artifacts of movies shot on film) than the DVD.<br /><br />But as 70mm to bluray transfers go, this one wasn't great for me.
B007SGM084|5.0|Because I truly love the books. Kept my interest. I would reccomend it to anyone. Three of my favorite books.
B000OVLBFS|5.0|Great series of mystery stories. Bought them all.  The only down side is Tom Selleck will not be producing any more.
B0039TD826|5.0|For new listeners, never mind the famous singles; *this* is the first album you need to hear if you want to understand why this band was and still is such a big deal.
B003SNKBXW|2.0|I read this book a number of years ago and loved it! It still has a wonderful ability to draw me into the world of these characters - fictional and \\"fictional\\". However, the Kindle edition is full of typographic errors (ironic given that the novel is all about books and lovers of books and stories!). Misspelled words (bad OCR?) and lack of punctuation abound! The two stars are because of the Kindle edition of a five star book.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|this game is very funny, and I can't stop to play it,and the most important thing is that's free !
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is one of the best board games ever created. Such a simple premise: get points by expanding, earn points by gathering resources and using resources to build or buy. It's got a great blend of luck via dice rolls, and skill in choosing where to settle and determining good trades, or even choosing how you want to win (long roads? big army? victory cards?). It's a fantasically social game, great for groups who love to talk.<br /><br />And while the base game is for 3-4 players, an expansion is available that lets you play with 5-6 players. These games get really crazy, with a huge board and loads of trading opportunities.
078401213X|4.0|'Pi' is an audacious debut by Aronofsky that explores some intriguing questions about the link between math and mysticism and shows how far a low budget can go with boldness, intelligence and imagination.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|Way too 21st century.  The movie took itself way too seriously.  Those of 50 years ago were always a lot of tongue in cheek.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is an excellent app. This Bible app even reads to you. You can highlight and more. Best app ever!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|When I started this series, I was unable to put it down. Which was fine with my hubby, he seemed to enjoy the side-affects :)
B006HL9G10|5.0|I've yet to explore all the features of this amazing piece of software for my Kindle Fire, but so far it is nothing but a big plus. The quality of the sounds of the bells is amazing, really amazing. I have two other timers that I've had for years, none as portable, and their bell reproduction doesn't even come close to the beauty of this. In addition it is really pleasant to look at the community of people around the world who are meditating when you are. There is a sense of connection and relatedness that otherwise would be impossible. If you meditate. Buy this timer - you cannot go wrong.
B008WOULPK|4.0|Fun read, she is very open and interesting and it makes for a fun read!!!! I love her name dropping and all her worldly experiences
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I love this show and love the book even more. I definitely recommend buying this book I'm about to buy the second book.<br />This is a very addicting book/t.v show. I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!
B002UM5BXW|4.0|A biographical story of Anthony Bourdain's culinary experiences.  Funny, apalling and entirely captivating. I enjoyed every bit of it and wanted more.  HOWEVER! I got the Kindle edition and the reading experience was marred by the transcriptional errors.  For example I couldn't figure out what dish the repeated references to  &#34;pore mignon&#34; meant.  When they finally started intermittently refering to it as &#34;pork mignon&#34;, I finally realized that it was a typographical/transcritional error.  This type of error occured throughout the Kindle book and made guessing at the sentence sometimes necessary
B000YDE46Y|5.0|I agree with other reviewers that they are a bit large. I normally wear a size 11, ordered a size 10.5 and theybarevstill just a smidge large. Possibly could have gotten away with a 10, but didn't want to deal with the return hassle. Don't forget that with boots like this, you're supposed to wear thick socks, so that makes it a good fit for me in in the 10.5s. Overall, though, great look, good quality, and comfortable. I've only worn them twice, but I expect them to continue molding to my feet (benefit of leather).
B000007492|4.0|great cd but the cd case was cracked; the 2 halves of the case do not stay together.  service was great.

B00AZL3PBK|5.0|the gamd is very funny and addicted. its like Mario Bros game but in android style. congtats to the developers of leps game.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Dry, linear, old-school, unexciting plot. Bardem (who is rarely less than stellar) was my only motivation to even watch this movie.<br /><br />I'd be pretty pissed had I paid $30 for movie tickets and been presented with this uninspiring, I don't know, saga, which drives no other point than insisting on the penchant for doing things the old way. A thoroughly failed attempt at presenting substance in a franchise that is mostly about shallow, pretty things. Speaking of which; there are no notable special effects, no gorgeous girls, no gadgets - basically none of the things that would generally help my mind ignore egregious plot holes. There's a whole lot of M though.<br /><br />As a sidenote, Mr Mendes, if you're going to hang a shotgun on a wall, please don't do so three minutes before the shotgun fires. Some of us in the audience do keep track.<br /><br />Seriously though, I realize this may be an attempt to reboot the franchise. If it is, it had failed. Sorry.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton is the first series I have downloaded onto my smart tv with Amazon Prime and it worked beautifully. I look forward to enjoying many more programs using Prime. Downton takes you back to experience a time and lifestyle that is foreign to most Americans today. The scenery and costumes are breathtaking. And through the masterful acting the characters become so real you trul feel that you know them personally. Wonderful!
B0054LJGWS|5.0|Love it, every last reference, joke-even Elvis<br />... A must read.  I mean it.  Go ahead, I'll wait...hurry up, I have things to do..

B000IYU9HW|5.0|In 1970, this heartbreaking story of true love was perfect.  We all wanted Ali MacGraw's look and her feisty, sarcastic attitude.  It made her real to us.  There was nothing fake, nothing frilly in the intense emotion in the movie.  My mother, sister, and I literally crawled out of the theater because we were crying so hard.  And here I am, at 65.  I asked my husband on Valentine's Day, &#34;What was your favorite romantic movie?&#34;  He answered, &#34;Love Story&#34; so we watched it.  And it all came back, 1970 and this intense story of love.
1596590440|5.0|Interesting, well paced, very helpful. I am planing a career  change and this book like several other help with the transition.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I find this series unique as it draws both pathos and anger in equal measure.  Always a surprise!  See it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game has every thing u need to be satisfied with. If my sister and friends a hadn't of said something about it, I would not have been playing this game. So for people all a round get this cool game it does what it says and never stops working or cut  up in the middle of a game.
B00BB8SKPW|2.0|This movie is not what I expected, I expected a harrowing story about A pilot who acted valiantly to save his passengers after a mechanical malfunction. What I got was 15minutes of air plan and an hour and 15minutes of drugs, sex, and particularly horrible people. Overall I suppose the performances were solid; I am a fan of Denzel Washington, but I was just caught off Guard with how dark a film it was.
0061719544|5.0|I am thoroughly enjoying this book. I appreciate Craig's authenticity, being real. He is funny, charming, intelligent and endearing. Great read and entertainment.
B0087GJ8KM|4.0|Daniel Pink offers a sincere, workmanlike exposition - but a Malcolm Gladwell he is not.<br /><br />5 more works required - and supplied!
B008GVD6D8|3.0|The story was nice but not as good for me as the Grey books and a bit to much. It is too predictable and the herione really?
B007A6XLDU|1.0|I had only downloaded it for one reason just so I could read my documents and pdf files from school. It did not do anything for me but you are able to write documents and PowerPoint. So if you want to create any thing this is for you but you will not be able to download any work.
B00886XQO0|2.0|I got these head phones and I could not control the volume the Bluetooth also did not work right it was a waste my Xp 400 were better
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Though I'm not a huge fan of Daniel Craig as bond, the story was engaging and the film moved along at a classic Bond pace.
B007LNJ3YS|4.0|Good I recieved it faster than I though.<br />Thanks to send it to me faster and it was safe<br />Thanks
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|There aren't enough words I can possibly think of to even attempt to write a review of this amazing book. All I can simply say is this is probably the best book I ever read<br /><br />The emotion Collen Hoover writes with makes you feel like you know these amazing characters personally.
B00881VLCE|3.0|The puzzle aspect works great.  I just wish it had more FREE designs to choose from.  The choices are pretty &#34;girly&#34;.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Not just about prison camp life, but also the culture of the North in general and what 60 years of totalitarian domination has done to the collective psyche. Simply amazing that this kind of thing has sustained itself (with the unthinking aid of other governments) for all these decades! It can't go on forever; think Soviet Union.
B009LT1YZ6|2.0|I really wanted to enjoy this App. It looks good and the premise sounds fun. But no matter what I tried, playing on my RAZR Maxx, I could not control the fish. My boyfriend couldn't get it to work for him either. I could get the fish to move, but it would not stop where it needed to stop or it would just sit at the edge of the screen. I'm a bit envious of the people who are able to play this. I'll keep trying for a few days, maybe I can get the hang of it. I also appreciate that there are no extra permissions needed for this App.<br /><br />Two stars for now, for the attractive design and lack of permissions. If I can get it to work, I'll update and increase my rating.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|This is a great family classic and addition to the previous two films. It was also a bit cheaper than what I found in the regular stores.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is pretty good. Young children who like horses may enjoy it. Recommended for children from ages five to seven.
B000W9399S|5.0|love this book, i love all the disc world novels, but this is the first and it is always fun to go back a read it and meet Rincewind and Two Flower and the luggage for the first time.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|If you love Akitas and want to learn how to teach your Akita to fetch, watch this movie.  LOL  It's great.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Great movie featuring some of the DOWNTON ABBEY actors in very different roles!  The film is best suited to an older audience.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|As a retiired Navy person I found it very interesting, With  few places to poke holes. The nation may now appreciate what some do for their country
B0040Z9H5K|4.0|Lots of action and the Black Widow gymnastics were great. Tony Stark character a bit over-the-top, but well acted. Story line surprisingly engaging.
B00AN0KBJC|3.0|This was a pleasant overview of some of the design work that went into the Game of Thrones sets. I wanted more depth than what it offered.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game!!! I'm enjoying all the little activities. It definitely kills time. The graphics are great also! Would most definitely recommend this game.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|someone gave this game one star because he didnt know how to play... if you dont know how to play bloons then you are the dummest person i know. and i know some pretty stupid people.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|If you are a guy and you generally can't stand chick flicks, give into this one. You will be somewhat satisfied, but she will be gratified. Good (romantic) story line. Great acting (given the material) ... even somewhat believable ... but the romance crushes the wackiness of porcelain vampires and hot-blooded werewolves.
B00BESM14U|3.0|I enjoyed this quirky coming of age story and the compassion and support the main characters actually demonstrated with one another. It was a positive and reassuring teenage story.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game was very enjoyable and fun. I had fun playing it and i will be buying more things off the maker. It was cheap and quick to buy.
B0063M22QO|2.0|too easy, became boring in 5 monutes, no challenge.<br />I play a lot of mahjong games and this is not one I would reocmmend for a challenge.
B0045XKJBI|5.0|If you are a guy and you generally can't stand chick flicks, give into this one. You will be somewhat satisfied, but she will be gratified. Good (romantic) story line.

B001FVV2X2|5.0|I have been watching on my kindle at night and I love it.  I highly recommend it. :)  Love that all these great shows are available on Amazon.
0449911357|5.0|Want a story that moves you to tears and forces you to smile? Buy Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe. Part coming of age story, part love story, and part 'getting back up again' story, it is an all around wonderful novel.
B004U52VPS|5.0|We bought this as a cake topper. We put it together and used hot glue to keep the pieces together. It looked fantastic! Everyone loved it! Because the plastic is so sturdy, the hot glue peeled right off afterwards and now the kids play the game. Double excitement!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|really cool game especially for horse lover's. Awesome graphics. It is a really detailed game. Definately one of my most favorite games I have.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I have only played it once since it is new but I do really like it.  Very entertaining. Worth getting
B000S9HVZU|5.0|This book is extremely hard to explain well and reading it can be a very personal experience. Just read it for yourself. You won't be disappointed, I promise.
B005HSL626|5.0|So much fun for my kids, and also me! I love this app. Even my 3 year old plays it. It's fun and has great graphics.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|The acting in this movie was completely fantastic!  I love this movie so much!  I love the emotion portrayed by the actors and made me feel like I was living life with them!
B004X4QW42|5.0|Well made movie. Great action scenes. Excellent sequel. Throw some zombie apocalypse into the tightly choreographed action scenes and they would create a new genre!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved this book it only took me about two days to read it. I recommend this book to everyone.
B00ABO573A|3.0|Little drawn out..didn't keep my attention . Poor acting as well..a few were good to look at ,still didn't stop fast forwarding ...
B003JTHXOK|3.0|As I began to read this book, I thought, wow a small town in North Carolina.... again, but as I got into it, it proved to be different  than I thought. I liked the look into the mind of the abusive husband. It was interesting to read his perspective, as crazy as it was.... it definitely makes you appreciate your own relationship and the feeling of being safe with the one you love.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Lot's of fun but with enough challange to be out of the little kids game section. four more good words.
B0066WJLU6|1.0|Doesn't work with Kindle Fire.  A disclaimer stating as such would have been nice and saved me the time it took to download and install.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Is this type of movies that you seat and don't want to stop watching the tv because you don't want to miss anything about the movie
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|This was my first structured introduction to DevOps.  The book is written in narrative form, which means that you can treat this like &#34;just another business book&#34; and skip to the bullet points.  This is good I think it that it requires the reader to be a bit more invested in understanding the process, and the fact that there is no &#34;one size fits all&#34; solution to the problems of any organization.  However one does might need additional resources, both in terms of the additional books mentioned in the story by other authors, as well as potentially the forthcoming &#34;DevOps Cookbook&#34;, to understand the issues more deeply and start putting change into practice.  That said, this a good place to start!
B00005JN0T|2.0|WELL I MADE THE MISTAKE OF VIEWING THE MOVIE AS SOON AS I PURCHASED IT BECAUSE IT IS NOT WORKING GOOD.  HAS PAUSES.  NEXT TIME I WILL CHECK MY DVD'S IN CASE I NEED TO RETURN.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun ! It is one of the most addicting games I have ever played and I love it but I think that the coin prices for boards and people is to high and I do not like it but that is basically the only thing I do not like about it otherwise I love the game a lot and would like them to make more.
B000OJFV4C|4.0|Good, but there's too much nudity.  It cheapens the quality of the program.  Also, it's not historically accurate.  But overall it's entertaining!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Very funny and the signing was great. Couple of really funny scenes, but I wouldn't recommend this for the kiddies.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i love it its cool a cool game plz get it my name is freak well thats what everyone calls me
B00881VLCE|1.0|Do not download this game because it is a virus! My virus protection caught two viruses out of it! Don't download.
B001FB55MG|4.0|My niece really loved this movie! I got it for her birthday, and she's already watched it repeatedly. It came undamaged. I'm happy.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|If you have kids or just love fairy tales and fantasy you should be watching this show. Nothing too difficult or inappropriate for the kiddies, the writing is great with lots of twists on your beloved fairy tale creatures, and the acting is wonderful with some outstanding performances!! start watching now!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|After the midseason finale of season 2, the show has been climaxing ever since. Now we hit season 3, where the governor comes in, and everyone who has read the comics knows that when the vroup meets the governor, it gets good. This season has to be the most jam packed and intense season yet, it blows all others into the sky. The only bad part, iz that since its going so fast, they're going to run out of comic material, so they're gonna have to be creative, like their past episode, #10. I recommend this series to everyone, as its not just blood and goar, but its how people react to the situation, and that's better than any blood and goar you'll see.
B005COO1X6|5.0|I found this to be a culmination of several of King's best works. I am waiting for this on film.
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|Best depiction of what the old Marine boot camp was really like. The combat scenes weren't that great, but the training scenes were perfect.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|love the show, amazon makes it easy to stream these shows and I can download them to watch on my fire just as easily
B007SGM084|5.0|A very good read. It's best to get all three together so you can start on the next book because you want to see what's going to happen next.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I had trouble putting this book down, and believe  this to be, without a doubt Kings best work.  Although it is fiction based on fact, I found it more informative than \\"Killing Kennedy\\". Again waiting for the film.
B005DOKM9M|5.0|My kindle fits snug in the sleeve and protects my kindle.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to protect there kindle
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Good read but as it is a book that was wrote prior to some of the latest firearms it is a little behind the times.  Became intrested in the character after the movie came out
B009O2XY12|4.0|I found this game to be fun & relaxing.  I enjoyed playing it.  My grandsons also enjoy playing it too.
B00AQL8VU4|3.0|very handy for amazon shopping on my Nexus 7 and Acer A700.  So much better than a web browser. And the price is right!<br /><br />(Update: Revised from 5 stars to 3.  Didn't realize it initially, but this app frequently frequently (every few seconds) displays a dialog that says \\"Unfortunately Appstore has stopped\\".  When you click okay, the app continues to run without missing a beat.  I haven't tried a purchase through the app yet, so don't know if the error would be a problem during check.)
B000FC1336|4.0|I was attracted to the title as I served on USS Nimitz for four years. Of course the book centers around a fictitious Nimitz Class carrier rather than the namesake. The book is well written and includes a number of twists as the US tries to determine how a nuclear aircraft carrier could simply disappear in a cloud of vapor.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love the reading plans and various versions of the bible. Account transfer to various devices. Note taking and highlighting helps for later review.
1475143389|5.0|I started attempting to lose weight on my own last year and I ended up losing quite a bit...but then I reached a plateau. I started switching up my routine to include weight lifting, but nothing helped...I was staying the same weight. So I ordered this book because I saw the good reviews and I'm very happy with it. I thought it would be over generalized and mostly talking about irrelevant things but it was actually very informative. I learned so many things about weight loss and muscle gains and I feel stupid for wasting so much time at the gym doing things the wrong way. Save yourself some trouble and pick up this book to learn to get fit the right way.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I was not disappointed in this film. It lived up to the fun and silliness of the first two MIB films.. After 15 years Will Smith is still being surprised, befuddled and exasperated by his partner, Tommy Lee Jones. This time Will has to go back in time to save his partner's life. Boris the alien gets creepier as the movie goes along. Kudos to the CGI people for incorporating the eewww factor. Josh Brolin gives a stellar performance as K the Younger. His mimicking of Tommy's voice, accent and mannerisms is downright spooky. Michael Stuhlbarg is a sweet and funny alien in this movie. If you like the other movies this one is highly recommended.
B000QCQ8XA|5.0|Does it matter...Tropper is always a hoot! All his books are easy to read, full of laughs, and hard to put down.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Well done as always, but I wish the author's afterward had been a foreword.  I kept waiting for characters.  When I read the explanation on structure, I  approach.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|The best of the best series of all time.  Number One!
B002KGKH5A|5.0|This DVD is so much more than I expected, and I recommend it highly.  I especially enjoyed seeing Meg White sing solo (In the Cold Cold night), and the White Moon ending.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Amazing graphics and realistic movement.  Also realistic cost lol.  I am one of the real horse poor and this gives you s true idea of the expense involved.
B00B3EVNEE|5.0|Robin Trower is back and after almost 50 years playing his brand of the blues he has a little fun with a few standards. Trower has returned to his roots, the album is composed entirely of covers, and these are the songs that just about every serious blues enthusiast has played at some point in time. An impressive list, \\"Little Red Rooster,\\" \\"Born Under A Bad Sign,\\" \\"Hound Dog,\\" \\"The Thrill Is Gone,\\" to name a few.<br /><br />This old dog has many new tricks up his sleeve and by paying homage to the original artists in a cover album he shows he can compliment any tune he covers. That is the hardest part, making the cover sound as good or better than the original.<br /><br />From his astounding \\"Bridge of Sighs\\" [[ASIN:B000URDE2Y Bridge of Sighs (Exp)]] to this latest release, Trower has always been the consummate perfectionist and performer. His last 10 years have really been super productive, the man is a machine. Robin comes out of the blocks on \\"Hound Dog\\" bending the strings every which way but loose.  Trower's cover of B.B. King's \\"The Thrill Is Gone\\" is haunting and so special. He puts his signature on every cut with a huge fat sound that blows me away.<br /><br />The introduction of organ and blues harp is not something you see a lot of on a Trower release but the fit is just right on these standards.<br /><br />I read...<br /><br />\\"What he has done, since the mid-sixties, is play a style of Blues guitar that is original, recognizable and absolutely trippy - this guy could have written the book on psych guitar if he had stopped playing long enough to do so.\\"<br /><br />\\"His original songs fit in well alongside the classics and there isn't any obvious gap in quality - he has been at it long enough to be able to apply his sound to these songs and the result is pure Trower.\\"<br /><br />As Robin confirms, ''I started off thinking I would do a complete album of covers. I wanted to get as far away from the originals as possible. I came up with half a dozen arrangements, which I felt were different enough. Then the project escalated. I ended up writing some new songs as well. I have tried to make the new songs be influenced by what I have done with the classics, so the album blends together.''<br /><br />Robin's Team...<br /><br />Livingstone Brown... Bass, Engineer, Producer<br />Paul Jones...Harmonica<br />Luke Smith...Keyboards<br />Chris Taggart...Drums<br />Robin Trower...Cover Art, Guitars, Liner Notes, Primary Artist, Vocals<br />Richard Watts...Bass, Vocals<br /><br />Fabulous solos, Trower's iconic mastery of the Fender Strat, knowing when to hold notes, and when to leverage special effects is always right on. The cut \\"See My Life\\" is what effects are all about and is one of my favorite cuts on the CD. BTW, Robin sings six of these songs, Richard Watts sings the other five.<br /><br />There's nothing too demanding here, it's good, solid blues to be enjoyed by anyone, anytime, anywhere. Another Trower benchmark release. Fantastic.ents, which I felt were different enough. Then the project escalated. I ended up writing some new songs as well. I have tried to make the new songs be influenced by what I have done with the classics, so the album blends together.''<br /><br />Robin's Team...<br /><br />Livingstone Brown...

B008EKOO46|3.0|i am struggling...only half way thru...a bit bogged down with too many tribal names...i enjoyed guns germs and steel more.
B001YXS7JI|5.0|Good music especially Calling Elvis and On Every Street. I've uploaded this album to my iPhone and listen to it frequently.
B00821OX98|5.0|good scrip fast action drama always keeping you engaged actors doin the real things would recomend to others would want to see it contune
B007REV4YI|2.0|I consider myself a James Bond fan, but ths was not 007 worthy. It was more action than plot. The villain was over the top, and his back-story did to make sense. The whole movie was slow, and there was not enough talking. There were no one-liners and hardly any gadgets. I never really liked this M, but the plot with her as a target was weak. I am glad I only rented tis movie, not purchased it.
B009Z5975A|4.0|My wifes favorite movies, or some of them anyway, all in one package.  We lost our vhs copies long ago.  This was great addition to our library.
B00AYB0SX4|4.0|A compulsive thriller. I enjoyed the movie. Jennifer Lawrence, Elizabeth Shue and Max Thieriot have acted very well in the movie.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book was an easy read and very enjoyable.  It is hard to put it down.  It leaves you wanting to find out more.  I am Catholic and this book truly helps me believe that there is life after death.  Alexander's description helps relieve any fear of death.  He makes me want to be a better person here on earth knowing what the afterlife is like.
0446554995|5.0|I love all their books and have read them all.  I can't wait until the next one is written.  Great
B00973902K|3.0|really good value on music and great addition to my fire.  Enjoy listening to music and reading books at same time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great! I just started and I already love it, it does jam a little but over all a wonderful game to play! Also the horse movements are very realistic!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so fun!! I used to play it on the xbox and then bought it on my kindle. i also like how you can play with friends in join game mode. i play it with my friends all the time!!
B00AE2I4WK|1.0|I didnt get to finish watching it....what I did see of it was great. I even rented it twice in hopes of seeing it. The first time there were down loading issues..the second time I got called into work.....
B0018QQQKS|3.0|The contents are good and well written, but the expectations created by the title were much bigger. I was expecting a focused history of this fantastic human invention - the store of value - but instead got a mishmash of some monetary history diluted by accounts of scams, bubbles, stock market performance, retirement schemes etc. Interesting stuff, but all accessible from better sources, and all presented in detriment of the subject which should have been exploited more deeply: money.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Still an all time must have, both as a Devotional aid and literature full of ancient wisdom, history (born out by modern archeology).
B00A6D5GBE|3.0|It's well made and my kids really seem to like it. You certainly can't miss when it goes on sale.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Honestly the writing is shallow and almost elementary but I guess there's a reason why the story was written... everyone is a voyeur at heart and wanting to peek in on a forbidden life is natural.  But the writing, ugh, so plain.  Too bad for a character that's supposed to be obsessed with English classics.
B009EEFTMC|1.0|Bought this app for my phone.  Went to put on my tablet and wanted ?e to purchase again.  You have to purchase too many times _or me.  Greedy!
B004AUNSX2|4.0|You'd think a movie staring Ryan Gosling AND Kirsten Dunst would have the potential to be a really slow, little dialogue snooze fest, but the story of this movie is able to carry it well. Since it's a bit of a murder mystery based on a true story makes it really intriguing. I'd say give it a go and if it moves too slow for you then just turn it off since it's on Prime Instant which should be costing you none extra.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Dexter is fantastic!  This season has great depth in exploring the issues of good and evil, dark and light in the context of God and religion.  Colin Hanks is excellent and the ending to the season is unbelievable!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|We read this novel in our book club. All members were passionate about certain subjects. Some about foster parenting and others about the birth of baby Hazel. All members felt that Victoria was unlike most foster children and that she was saved by her love of flowers. We felt if all foster children had a passion as Victoria did they too would be successful. Of course, we cannot give a person a passion. The dictiionary of flowers is wonderful. We did not give this book a 5 as that is saved for the best we ever read.
B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely love it so much it its like totes fun 4 real it is really I mean seriously fun
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My husband and I just LOVE this show. As Left 4 Dead fans we have noticed some scenes from the game that are reflected in the show. Hopefully, no zombie apocalypse never happens. I would recommend this show to any adult as it is not quite suitable for kids until their mid-teen years, in my opinion. It has definitely evolved since the first season. Be prepared for your favorite characters to disappear. You just never know when one will become infected.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Amazing!! I'm hooked and can't stop reading... I'll be sad when the trilogy is over... I never would have thought these Books would be so addicting
B00B2V66VS|3.0|worse then the first but it is ok I guess. but it is still a good game that's all I have to say
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is awsome<br />The first<br />Amanda Knox county sheriff's I luv it  so much<br />Luv it luv it luv it luv it luv it
B000FC1AGG|5.0|A great bit of escape ism .<br />It's an easy read and sitting in the sun, by the pool a must.<br />I loved the Shopohlic series but this is better.
0765325950|5.0|Loved this book despite not loving everything and every character in it.  I got tired of Perrin several books back and wished that he had a much shorter role in this one.  Instead I would have greatly appreciated a much expanded role for Moiraine and much less for Avienda.  Min is always great and would love to have seen more from her.  Lanfear's final moment with Perrin was a bit whacky in my opinion and could have been developed more cleverly.  I suspect that one could go all through the characters and nitpick about their actions, their motivations and roles in general but I think that would mostly be a reflection of how we each would like to have seen things develop from a personal perspective.<br /><br />The overall most important things to me when I read a book are that I enjoy it so much that I don't want to put it down and that I don't want it to end.  This was the case with this book and it was easy to brush aside most of the minor flaws.<br /><br />*** Spoiler Alert ***<br /><br />I also found it interesting that the prologue was written by a new team of writers and their style flowed pretty well with the rest of the story.  It makes me wonder if there will be a sequel series to the WOT especially since Rand is still very young, his power is intact (though modified) and he has serious plans for the future.  If so, I'd look forward to reading it and hope that Moiraine and Min play key roles in the story.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Excellent work.  Absolutely could NOT put it down.  I love Clancy's work and this was one of the best.  a definite must read for those who like this genre.
B009X01C64|2.0|When I first got the case, I figured it would be a 5 star review. It's very stylish and looks great. All my coworkers kept saying \\"what a snazzy case\\", well, not in those exact words. You can even spin it around, which I almost never did, but whatever. It was a little tricky for me to get it into the case initially, and I had to really follow the instructions, but once it was in, I was satisfied. It also seemed so well protected inside that gigantic bulky case. I figured I could.. throw it against a wall! and it would stay nice and safe. But alas, the love affair didn't last.<br /><br />You see, eventually I wanted a case with a keyboard; so I could have it all. And at that moment is when I had to take the darn thing out of the Marware case. Do you know how impossible it is to remove? I figured there must be some secret to doing it. So I tried googling it, and the conclusion is this: there is no trick, you have to pry it out as hard as you can, and hope you don't break your kindle. My little feminine fingers weren't strong enough, so I recruited my husband, and when he talked about getting a butter knife, I took the thing back and struggled with it again for 20 minutes. I eventually got it out, fingers raw and burning. That's when I swore I'd never imprison my precious kindle inside this thing again.<br /><br />The case is also bulky beyond belief, it's just as thick as my case with the keyboard. I know it gives it some protection, but does a case with a keyboard... Also, not being able to easily remove your kindle from the case is problematic. What if airport security wanted you to remove it from the case and you couldn't? Overall, I'm happier with my new case and can't recommend the Marware for the above reasons unless you're ok with having something bulky and never plan on removing it.
B00304RMFE|4.0|Within the short takes, for someone who loves anime and this universe it gives a couple of cool insights into the storylines!......different styles of artist and types of takes are cool, just needed a little more polish......
B00AMLFJT4|5.0|I didnt know Bruno could bring it like he does.  He has serious Swagger :)  Jammed to him on an entire road trip with my sister.
0425263916|5.0|I'm extremely excited for the third book! This defiantly beats &#34;Fifty Shades!&#34; I might actually get the Kindle version next time!
B008IJTFYW|4.0|The only thing that could make this better is if it would have offered some guided meditation options to go with the sounds.  For being free, this offered a lot of choices.  Good app.
B0076DELIG|2.0|This book just dragged through the first three chapters. I just couldn't get into it. I normally like Connelly's work but this was not up to par.
B009CYCF5I|4.0|I dont think it was worth the extra for the bonus tracks but her music was good.  I liked her album before better.
B00846REIS|5.0|If u liked Shades, u will like this series also!  It's different , but it all comes down to wealth and sex.<br />Takes u to a place that u can only dream of.  I am reading the second book now, Reflected In You,<br />cant wait to see what happens.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a really fun game and my daughters love the different world tours.<br /><br />The new version of the world tours is awesome.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Not just because it's free...but this is a great game, my daughter loves playing it!! I would recommend it over buying it.
0802130208|1.0|Due to the respect I have for many great and funny writers who have lauded this book's brilliance over the years I have planned to read it for some time. I recently read something that referred to the book and decided, \\"it is time to do this\\".<br /><br />As a reader I try to give a book 1-2 hours, maybe 100 pages before giving up. I read this whole thing waiting to laugh, find something funny, anything. THis was a great disapointment in my literary life. I have been trying to rethink this book and try to imagine what could be funny. Perhaps I'm such a dunce myself I could not get into the high-mindedness of it?<br /><br />Oh well . . . like some disapointed movie fan I'll say, thats a few evenings of my life I'll never get back.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This is a follow up to Bared to You....great story.  Like Shades in a way, but lots of different<br />things happen.  Can't wait to see what will happen next.  All the love that is shared takes u<br />into another place in time, one can only dream about.  Love this series
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Needs some bug fixes and a better interface. Can't complainbecausd it is free.you may find it more useful if you getpiints
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Enjoyed it immensely.  Easy reading and sexy !!  I'm 58 years old and LOVED it.  Would recommend to others.  Thanks.
B001AITH50|5.0|This movie evoked to darkness and depression of the novel, but also made me wish that Pitt and Cruise had collaborated with Ann Rice to make the next two installments in the Vampire Chronicles. While I enjoyed both actor's performances, Tom Cruise played Lestat to perfection, with my favorite scene at the very end of the movie.<br /><br />While the movie must stand on its own vis a vis the movie, at least it was just faithful enough to please me, as an old Ann Rice fan. We're still missing movies for &#34;The Vampire Lestat&#34; and &#34;Queen of the Damned&#34;! And the actual, existing movie of QOTD doesn't count, as it was just barely based on the book, and was horrible!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What u have heard about these books, are all true.<br />Certainly explains alot of different things and how and<br />what they are used for.  Lets just say u can learn from these books....<br />very sensual
B009UMTMKS|4.0|Steve Blank is a genius and his work is a must read.  However, the Kindle version has no page numbers, which makes it difficult when using in a classroom setting.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great reading -- sexy and love the love story to it.  Can't wait to read the 3rd one.  Easy to read and hope she writes more.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This is your basic Spider Solitaire game & as fun & addictive as the playing card version. Cards are nice & big & animation is smooth & reliable. Good app.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Fabulous.  Many scars have been woken up in my heart reading this.  This book has helped me to smell so much more around that fire hydrant.  This book will have u laughing and crying  all at the same time. Thank u Mr. Green.
B0041QSZJM|2.0|A friend suggested their Hang On Little Tomato CD and I love it, have listened to it many times. I was so excited to find out they had a Christmas CD. But I was disappointed in this one. I like their eclectic mixes of different/foreign language songs but this CD had too many of these. They should be used as the spice, not the main ingredient.
B003204MQS|5.0|This was one of my favorite movies in the paranormal activities series. It was the best one out of all four.
B001NHN7TU|4.0|This movie has an interesting plot without the nonsense of an unnecessary backstory.  The characters are fun to watch because they are extreme examples of every one of us. Although many people will deny it, I think that all of us can identify with one of the stereotype characters in this movie.  Although the characters are over the top, I truly like everyone in the film and found myself talking to the screen, telling the characters to run or be quiet or whatever would save them. All in all, a fun movie and quite entertaining.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Very good app. It gives me all the info I need. It is easy to navigate, You can get it to send you alerts for bad weather.
B004W1GCQO|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this series. It is very well written with an excellent cast and gives an insight into life in London prior to WW2.
B00B7G3Y4U|5.0|This was one of my favorite movies in the paranormal activities series. It was a lot better than number three.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|She is a great author and I enjoy all of her books.  Being able to read them on my Kindle makes it even better.
B009GEFXLC|4.0|Very good interaction between the characters is the main attraction.  My wife & I usually watch the older British detective series but this is a rare exception in this &#34;new age&#34;. Violence is at a minimum & the plots are usually very good.<br />I have seen every episode up to Season 5 where I am now.
B00A6D5GBE|3.0|This game posed little challenge, a simple scrolling game that you have to flick bars up and down in good timing for the sleep walker to run into stars and moons while he's asleep (walking). Good graphics on Samsung Note 10.1, low file size and lower than expected permissions keeps this app from achieving zero stars. I took it off my device just because I don't see myself playing in the near future.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This one was different. It was very heavy on the math and science, and basically the whole entire book is the main character (who I found to be a very likable, funny guy) running into pitfalls and then figuring them out with his ingenuity. However, there's not much depth at all to any of the other characters. There are some attempts to give them depth, but they all seem like the same goody-two-shoes person. But it was still a really fun read, many times I laughed out loud, yes, I even cried! Well worth the price!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|She is a great author and I enjoy all of her books.  Being able to read them on my Kindle makes it even better.
B005GRTNVE|5.0|It's so great to see the four men singing so beautifully together and getting proper appreciation from a large crowd.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I've recommended it to all of engineering, operations and other senior managers across all disciplines, and I'm already hearing conversations about preventing rework. I'm going to have to give it a second read now to think about what should be our next step.
B006TKP2B2|5.0|Wow, this book was amazingly good. I really got pulled into the world the book is set in, and the characters are varied and complex. I want to read more by this author!
B003O86FMW|5.0|She is a great author and I enjoy all of her books.  Being able to read them on my Kindle makes it even better.
B002VUFKG6|2.0|This is a big disappointment after &#34;Eat, Pray, Love.&#34; It's mostly a whine-fest and a pity party. I wouldn't recommend it.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Very good book.. I would recomend it to anyone that enjoys a good mystery. Book has a detective that is easy to like as he unravels and solves a 20 year old crime.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|What this girl went through is unimaginable but she survived and lived to tell her story. Thank you for telling your story....
B007SGM084|5.0|I sooooo love my books. I have suggested these books to everyone and of course I always recommend the bundle because you can't just read one. These books leave you wanting more and more than anything wanting a Christine Grey!!!!!!!
B003204MQS|1.0|I know its just a rental movie but I should have known it was going to be bad.  How much was the budget on this film?
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Really like this calculator. Very easy to use with large keys. I have recommended it to friends and relatives and they also like. Getting it free was an extra bonus!
B00867GJYK|5.0|This Pixar film is a great one, really captures the essence of the ocean in the graphics and the story is good.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The news feed always get stuck. Something must be done about it. An iPad is starting to look very tempting
B0090X4GLW|5.0|Got this for my Gramma who loves the movie. Some of the songs aren't exactly from the movie more so sounding edited in a studio but she loves it and it really does sound great! :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Playing this game makes me feel like I am on a farm. Competing with other horses in this game feels like real competition.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My husband & I really enjoyed the UK version. It was great to get the clear streaming when we wanted to watch this very enjoyable show.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I loved this book the way they both had so many problems and their loved helped them through everything. I couldnt put this book down and i cant wait to read the next one that go with this!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love Minecraft it's really fun and sometimes challenging but cool and awesome upgrades for this awesome game but its hard to defeat some hostile mobs at night
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Its an addicting season! Cant get enough. Amazon makes it easier to watch because it streams right to our computer so we can play catch up and not have to wait until season 3 comes out on dvd!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Couldn't put the book down.  Mixture of fantasy and reality to the point that it draws you into its plot.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|If you are a creative person with &#34;white paper&#34; syndrome, read and get inspired. This book is fun, funny, positive and an easy read.  Would make a great gift.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|the game is really fun and could get challenging on higher levels I reccomend the game very much but it could get boring
B000FC1HBY|5.0|These books are a Godsend! George R R Martin has done an amazing job, and I thank Amazon for selling it to me!<br /><br />Get these books now, and then watch the series on HBO!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Been a Baldacci fan for some time.  One of his best.  Hard to put down.<br />Looking forward to many more reads.
B0001VV1GK|5.0|I saw my little grandson playing with the parking garage, and he was having a real good time - just like his dad did when he was little.
1451695195|3.0|I don't doubt his experience. However, the book seemed a little generic to me. I watched his interview online and it still seemed a bit generic. I would love to read further details as he proceeds to explain them, but I thought this book would share a few more details.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Don't understand the buying of power boosts.  Outrageous  amounts. Must be missing something.  Fun without them though .  New at this.
B001F12J0C|5.0|vvvvvv  f fff f fffff fffff fff  ffffff f fff e4eee eeeee eee e e eeee ee eee eeee e
B004SBS8LA|5.0|These angry birds give you hours of fun. Very good game to play with all ages. Skill and entertainment is required.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I &#34;unfortunately&#34; got the flu two weeks ago. I say that in quotes because I rarely have a minute to slow down and follow any series but getting sick forced me to. I found Season 1 of Downton Abbey and LOVED it! Loved it so much that over the course of the week I was really sick I watched both season 1 and 2. I just finished watching season 3 and heard there will be a season 4 so I'm looking forward to that! The only thing that's a bummer is that I am a Prime member but I had to pay to watch all of season 3. I'm not sure why that is because I could have watched the episodes on the day they ran for free! lol The end of season 3 has a total cliff hanger...I'm hoping there will be some miracle to fix what happened and can't wait for season 4!! :) Highly recommend!
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|What a touching story, beautifully written. This is the first John Green and I hope to read more. An easy read, you'll shed a tear
B000UZPIAW|4.0|Easy read and intriguing tale of the rock star life.  Pretty graphic & too descriptive for the younger reading eyes...however, who else would care to read it besides children of the 80's anyway?!?!?!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Nice approach and good science in this well written survival saga. The main character is enough of a character to make you root for him.
B0067LY4WG|3.0|...but this one is awfully low key - I don't recommend listening if you're already depressed, but the lyrics are terrific!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I loved the last twenty minutes of this movie!  Great routines!  The rest of the movie was amusing, but not something I'd watch over and over like friends have raved about.  Without the end, the movie would've only been three stars.
0061864153|5.0|Definitely worth including into your Bon Jovi collection if for no other reason, the photos!!! Loved thumbing through & getting the lowdown on my fave band!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Otherwise it looks and sounds great. I might go back and turn on the subtitles so I can understand what the heck the Godfather is saying.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|First the method of delivery:  It took me over an hour just to get the 'streaming video' going.  I have never had these issues with Amazon streaming before so they must have changed something.  First they tell me that Chrome for Linux is a wash and to try Firefox... After loading Firefox they tell me the driver is not up to speed and to update it.  After updating it, I am then told that I cannot have more than 1 video streaming at a time... After rebooting my computer to close all connections, I am then told that the updated Flash for Firefox still will not work... so I boot up Win Xp in virtual box only to have the '1 stream at a time' message again...  After one more reboot and loading Vbox, I got it to stream and then almost wished that I hadn't.<br /><br />The cool thing about Bond movies is that they are supposed to be fun.  This movie was bleak as possible, and I fast forwarded a bit to get to the end, and then almost wished I hadn't.  Can a movie get any more depressing?  If I want depressing, I will go watch a chick flick like 'The Story of Tess'.
B00APJLEGA|5.0|My Son has watched it over and over and over again.  I even enjoy watching it with him.  Must Watch
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|I absolutly loved this movie. My children and I have seen it about a million times. Very funny for every age in our family from my husband and I to our 9 yr old and then to our 3 yr old.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Seriously, this is one of the best Bond movies in a very long time.<br /><br />It is not  a predictable Bond movie.<br /><br />I realize there are those who will not like this movie, becuase it is not one of the canned stories.<br />The whole movie meshes the action with the plot very well.<br /><br />Finally, the movies have caught up with Craig's rough edges. And honestly the Bond franchise needed it.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Just got started reading David Baldacci about 2  months ago - and I am trying to find everything he has so I can get it on my Kindle.  Fantastic author!  Can't say enough good.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I downloaded this on my sons tablet and had to uninstall almost instantly. It never worked. He would love to play it if it would just work.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is an addicting game -- very well made and fun.  Have to keep playing to try and beat my time!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is so addicting it needs to come with a warning label.  Nice time waster for my 45 minute bus ride every day.
B007VYDFMS|5.0|I was never really a \\"fan\\" of Bob Marley's music but this film educated me and brought about a new respect for the man and the band. Well done indeed.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show. It has just the right amount of drama and some mystery too. It is also an interesting peek into what it would have been like to live during that time period - especially for women.
B004TI5N38|3.0|A rather blatant attempt to cash in on the popularity of Lee Child's Jack Reacher series.  (The Reacher-like character is named John Puller?  Really?!?)  I have to admit a bias against Baldacci's writing.  I've always found him to be a bit superficial and his dialogue to be awkward and unrealistic.  That said, I do read him occasionally.  If none of your favorite authors have anything new available, this is a quick, decent read.  Just don't set your expectations too high.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Good book.  It is the kind where you don't really suspect the ending.  A very refreshing approach to a story.
B009GX6SSK|5.0|Love this show... and the characters... wish Nate could be back more... but don't want him to replace anyone.. Love the way the gang works together...
B0083GQKQG|4.0|The writing intertwined details from past and present beautifully. This movie is a dramatic approach to the hidden pieces of being a family and how they can unravel.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I fell in love with Downton Abbey and will be going through withdrawal until the next season begins.  It is one of the most compelling series I have ever watched.  I love the cast of characters, the set, the costumes, and the smart writing.  Even with the ending of Season 3, or perhaps because of the final episode, I can hardly wait for Season 4!
B0012HF5NC|1.0|I really don't know why this stupid movie is often referenced as great.  It is so bad and unbelievable- even if you did believe in aliens- that it should only be remembered as embarrassingly bad.  I suppose that it pushes the right stupid buttons that gets the fools going. I'll be better off with never hearing of this movie for the rest of my life.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I feel like I know each character as if they were real... Like I am part of their &#34;family&#34;... Enjoy ever single episode...
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Excellent, easy to switch from one version to another. Excellent way to take notes especially with the use of the bookmarks.
B003TSEEDY|1.0|Perhaps I am in the wrong demographic to enjoy this book.  Maybe you have to be in high school.  I don't even know what to say?  I really don't understand why people RAVE about how life changing this book is.  The only way it changed my life, is by making me angry!!  I was so mad that I wasted time reading it.  I kept thinking, &#34;It MUST get better...&#34;  or that something grand was going to be revealed and I could then say , &#34;AHA!  Now I understand&#34;  It is poorly written, and is supposed to be from the point of view of a 15-16 year old boy, who is very well read!  Yet, he can't write!  I have seen other reviews that said it appeared the they author took every single stereo typical teen drama, and mashed them into one book.  Rape, homosexuality, suicide, teen pregnancy, drinking, drugs...all covered!<br /><br />Please, don't waste your time.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Seriously, who is the head of HR for this expedition?  This is the best lot of scientists from around the world that they can muster?  Let's see, the rock guy is clearly a hothead with a fierce attitude and temper.  Then there is the dorkey naive guy who wants to play with the gooey stuff and with the creatures. Wouldn't they have figured out ahead of time to be wary?  Isn't skepticism a primary rule of a good scientist?  The captain of the ship come on to and sleeps with the bosses daughter.  These morons set themselves up for defeat.  So many classic movie cliches are played - ie they get split up, communications break down- that the overarching themes which could have been dug deep are lost cause the audience is frustrated at the foolish antics of the characters.  Woulda, Coulda, Shoulda.  Too bad a blown opportunity at an intriguing concept.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Love all the characters... So glad that Castle & Kate are together now... Love watching it every time... Can't wait for the next episode...
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I tend to meander through books but this one wouldn't let me go. Very well written, descriptive, original, and terrifyingly plausible. If you're looking for an edge of your seat page turner, look no further ! This was my first Blake Crouch book but it will definitely not be my last!
B009YQJ322|4.0|Loved this movie.  Lots of Action.  I would recomend this movie for older audience, too much violence for younger ones.
B00ANW33CM|5.0|This is a new way od playing Mahjong and I love it so much. it is so additive and sometimes i lose track of time just playing it.
B00111L0MY|5.0|It's a good heartful movie at first I did not understand the movie but the more I watch the movie the more I understand the movie and love it.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|My 8 year old grandson and 6 year old grandaughter play this game. I havent worked with it yet. If they like it I guess it is OK
B008MEM24S|5.0|challenging for kids without being too hard. my 5 yr old loves to play to just set Perry free and I play to get all the gnomes.
B004MPESSY|3.0|If you want a pure revenge flick, this is it. It's basic premise was: small-town thugs brutally assault young woman, they try to kill the woman, but woman survives and exacts even more brutal revenge on all of her attackers.<br /><br />Two better stories are Lady Lawbreaker by G.J. Fuller, and Hard Candy, starring Ellen Page. In Lady Lawbreaker the female protagonist is a mysterious beauty, with dark humor, lethal skills, and a touch of insanity. And her motive is survival, not revenge, as she gives two murderers a night they never bargained for. In Hard Cardy, Ellen Page terrifically plays a twisted 14-year old who uses her wit to turn the tables on a man she believed abused and killed her friend. In both of those stories, the characters are awesomely done.<br /><br />In 'I Spit on Your Grave' the main character has no outstanding personality traits. Perhaps the biggest plus to this film is witnessing her attackers get 'punished,' by her.<br /><br />I gave this film 3 stars because it IS an okay basic film. It's just nothing special to deserve more stars.
B002VKE0XA|5.0|This is the first time I watch any of the paranormal activity and I like it some I think the add to it other I not think so.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot........but with a great story line, and fantastic ending.  As I read this on my Kindle on the treadmill at the gym it would make me sweat more, but the best thing is no one could tell because I was sweating already.  I'm glad it ended as it did with some sense of decency.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|The remainder of the movie is about the first 20 minutes of the flick.  Intense!!  Comic relief from John Goodman.  Great role for Denzel  A hard look at alcohol and drug use and the toll it takes.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|I purchased this game for my 4 yr old grandson who loves to play games on my Kindle Fire. He has not had a chance to play it yet, but I've 'kid-tested' the first three 'dreams'. The graphics are very cute and well done. A  little boy who sleepwalks across the screen collects stars and the moon along the way. He is helped in his quest by moveable platforms and ramps. It is easy to play- very straightforward and I think 'kids' of all ages would love it...
B0026RLM6Q|5.0|I enjoy the TV show so much that I love the sound tranck to the show I own both dawson's creek soundtranck.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This is exactly what I needed. A case to keep my kindle safe while being able to sit it up and watch shows and movies.
B00B10ENBA|5.0|Excellent movie about a true event in history  Really enjoyed it.  Ben Affleck was great.  Really could watch it again.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Just what my daughter was looking for under her Christmas tree. She spent the holidays with Harry and the gang!
B000A59PMO|5.0|Love this teen crime dream show like Roswell that give you 3 season when the show is good and like to see more with Veronice see her finish high and college when season 3 end she just finish college and was gone to work at the FBI when they end that were season 4 was gone to pick up but no they had to end with just 3 season.
B009ZUZ9FW|3.0|Cheap printing. some pages good, many just readable. For a foreign printing, they could use a little more ink to make quality even.
