0316056863|4.0|I don't watch tv. I haven't since 2003.<br /><br />I can hear the gasps. Sorry to disappoint you.<br /><br />I tell you this not to traumatize you, but to explain why I have absolutely no idea who Tina Fey is. I've never heard of her or (what is it called?) 30 Rock.<br /><br />So why in the world am I reading a book about a person of whom I know nothing?<br /><br />Good question.<br /><br />It's for one reason:  I was told this was a fabulous memoir.<br /><br />And it is. Terribly hilarious. Just what you might expect from someone who wrote Saturday Night Live sketches for a million years (even I know what SNL is!)<br /><br />(Warning! Warning! Warning! Lots of content that your mother will frown upon.)<br /><br />So there you have it...A rec for this book about a (apparently) popular tv actress from someone who doesn't even know anything about tv.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Great book. Finished in record time because I couldn't put it down. This is the first Stephen King book I've read...may read more now.

B000LXHK22|5.0|Loved the movie, will watch it again ,beautifully cast and shot and a great feel -good factor! Made me feel a whole lot better.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street shows us exactly why  it is best to leave a musical on stage. To get even until a 2 hours movie, or at its running time of 1 hour and 56 minutes you lose up a lot of the story, and songs or have to shorten up the songs. Which shows they do both, so at best try to see it as a musical and then what the movie. But the cast is interesting, you have the majority of the cast that may not be known for singing, so you think you would hear them dubbed. And you have 3 of the actors that are best known for their roles in Harry Potter. And you have the movie lead by Johnny Depp that is known for his acting, but not for singing. But he does make a good Sweeney Todd , but here is still one good question that we just don't know the answer to it, is just how does he get the name Sweeney Todd? And he also is known for appearing in Tim Burton movies, which this film is directed by Tim Burton.  But whatever you do don't watch it with the kids, this is a R rated film, and one of the rare R rated films that is not rated for language. The movies opens with Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) now known as Sweeney Todd who is returning to London after being in jail on false charges for the past 15 years. He and his shipmate Anthony Hope (Jamie Campbell Bower) where they sing about that there is No Place Like London. He also tells him of a tale about a barber and his wife, without reveling the names of the barber or his wife, and the fact it is his story. He was falsely charged by a judge named Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman) and sent to prison who was taken by his wife Lucy (Laura Michelle Kelly). He then asks Anthony to leave him, and they both go their ways. He then goes to a meat pie shop owned by Mrs Mrs. Nellie Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter). But she thinks he is just another person coming into her business to give her business. She offers him up a meat pie that she claims is the worst in London. He then notices a room that is upstairs after she offers to bring him into her home to help wash down the taste.  He asks her if times are so hard, why doesn't she rent out the room, but she says that nobody will go near it because they think it is haunted. And she tells him the story of the barber and the wife, which she doesn't know but has to wonder if this is really him back, and she revels that Judge Turpin and Beadle Bamford (Timothy Spall) lure her to his house, to a party with masks, where with him also in a mask, and he rapes her, which causes her to scream, which also calls him to scream, which then confirms that he is Benjamin Baker and is back, she then tells him that she poisoned herself with arsenic, and that she tried to stop her but she won't listen to her. And that Judge Turpin also took in his daughter Johanna (Jayne Wisener). Which causes to make Sweeney Todd realize after hoping for 15 years that he was dreaming on returning to his wife and child. She also returns his old razors, but that is all just the beginning as Sweeney Todd vows to take his revenge.

0545265355|5.0|As expected from a YA series, the writing isn't superb and the characterizations are lacking for all but Katniss and Haymitch, but the action moves at a clip, the setting is enticing, and you feel for the characters as they go through an absolutely grueling story.

0743454537|5.0|This book was a required read for school and I ended up loving it.  It was very well thought out and informative regarding the medical terms.  The time that Jodi Picoult spent doing research showed.  It was a very emotional book that kept me up at night.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I'm slightly embarrassed to say that it took me this long to get around to reading Pride & Prejudice. I don't like romance novels and I'm generally wary of anything that is too popular. And yet here I am, giving P&P one of the few 5-star ratings I've ever bestowed. Jane Austen is, without a doubt, among the wittiest, cleverest, most talented authors I've ever read. I laughed out loud repeatedly, thoroughly enjoyed many of the characters (the protagonists were refreshingly frank and the stupid ones were delightfully annoying), and don't you tell anyone but I had tears in my eyes when Darcy and Elizabeth finally sorted things out. I'll be thinking about this book for a long time, and I imagine that I'll be delving into Austen's other books in short order.

B005O7PXNS|5.0|This is really fun brain candy. The personality interactions are a hoot. My younger daughter is very much like castle's with all the angst that goes with that. It is so worth it to me to be able to watch a show for 1.89 and skip the commercials.
B000SEFCD8|5.0|This has so much good information for dog training.  She makes you see things from both sides of the leash.  This is very helpful and was recommended by my instructor in my Puppy Training Class.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great game. or should I say games. I think thar this would be great for people who like arcade games
B0015POEV0|5.0|This is hands down the best show in years.  I can't tell you how much you will enjoy the mis-adventures of this family and their brilliant slide into becoming sinister.  Some of the best acting I've seen in a long time - - I know why they've won all of those awards.  I'm hooked on it like the product they're selling.  Amazing.
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|I feel like I'm the only one about to give a rating below 4 stars but I must be honest:<br /><br />This was a \\"bipolar read\\" for me. The story was gripping but exasperating at the same time. I appreciate the sip of raw/original teen characters but I kept wishing for the point of the story to come already. Why? Because the characters got WAY too \\"I'm unlucky but unforgettably gifted\\" AND irritating with their \\"impressive\\" remarks, speeches, etc...to me there was almost nothing realistic/relating about those teens. I didn't even care to understand them; they played their parts annoyingly.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the book in any way so lastly, I will admit that I was a little intimidated at times but what really made me want to run from this book was the moral of the story that seemed to grow like a never-ending mosquito bite. Itchy as hell too.<br /><br />Verdict: give it a try.
B006UKFFE0|4.0|As part of my day-to-day work, I see lots of ideas, business plans, non-startup investment proposals, entrepreneurs, and fund managers. Especially helpful for the Internet entrepreneur, Running Lean helps you think through your idea, test it in real life, and provide you with the ability to nix it before all your friends & family start putting money in. I wish every entrepreneur reads this before they show up to investors meetings or Angel groups. The book is easy to read, yet thought-provoking, and provides tools & processes that you'll go back to for each new venture. Very well done. I send it to all my friends looking to startup a company.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|the free version of this is just as good but I recommend getting this app its great I think everyone should get this its amazing
B006UKFFE0|5.0|I've seen a lot of material about Lean Startups, but Running Lean has the best practival advise I had.<br /><br />At the same time it's a step-by-step guide and also a flexible way of thinking your venture from scratch.<br /><br />If I had to recommend just one book about the theme, it would be it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app! I used it on my android phone last year and it was amazing. I love that there are reading plans and you can make your own notes. It's an all around great app.

0807014273|5.0|I had the privilege of studying with Viktor Frankl and his book literally changed my life. His tested views on meaning being the driving force in the human experience was discovered during his years as a psychiatrist  before the war. Observation under the most heinous conditions in the concentration camp reinforced and perfected the system that has allowed millions to enhance their lives with self determination. This book has stood the test of time ,and continues to be a beacon of hope.<br /><br />S.J.Tagliareni author oif Hitler's Priest

B005QJZ5FA|2.0|Born to Die carried a load of pre-release buzz, driven by del Rey's provocative video for her early single \\"Video Games.\\"  Now that the album's here . . . eh.  Plodding tempos dominate, with drums, strings, and everything else awash in girl-group reverb.  And del Rey?  Self-described as a \\"gangster Nancy Sinatra,\\" she is, in essence, full of herself.  She can pout.  She can also swear, in the most innocuous way, giving an otherwise catchy melody (\\"Radio\\") a pointless shove.  The rest of the time she's simply expressionless, a modern-day Marianne Faithfull, walking through her vocals and giving every last song a zombie quality that underscores the appropriateness of the album's title.  \\"Gangster Nancy Sinatra?\\"  More like \\"female Ben Stein\\" - without the humor.

0553277472|1.0|I remembered liking this book when I was 20. I bought it recently at a library sale and was excited to re-read it after more than 2 decades of (cough, cough) wisdom. Usually when I have read books that made an impression on me in my earlier years (I'm thinking \\"The Good Earth\\", \\"Atlas Shrugged\\"), I still enjoy it, although maybe in a different way. A classic is a classic no matter where you are in life or how it speaks to you. This book, however, just left me thinking \\"What WAS I thinking?\\" I can not fathom how it spoke to me or why I liked it. The underlying plot was just a thinly disguised means of rambling about the author's self-important ideas. It didn't take me long to get bored with both the plot and the philosophy. My personal philosophy of quality led me to abandon this book before the end.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|this is the second update and still the same issues with the galaxy nexus.  Game freezes on the first level after the second zombie enters the screen. worked fine on droid incredible.. rate 5 stars when fixed.
B004JXXKWY|4.0|If you are into the intrigue of Wall Street and the sub-prime issue this is a fascinating read. The story is told thru' a number of participants who saw what others couldn't or refused to see. Others simply were making too much money to care about the consequences of sub-prime or if they did then they dismissed them on the flimsiest of excuses ie: I'm making too much money right now, so who cares? Enjoy.
B0052U59F4|2.0|I've read of the book on Kindle, happy I didn't spend $29 on these. I can see the similaties other reviewers are mentioning between Twilight and Fifty Shades. Let me tell you this BOOK IS HOT, very explicit sext scenes as it involve BDMS. and that's it. The characters are not well develop, the chemistry between Ana and Christian is...not genuine. It feel as if the author is telling me what it is and not showing me, therefore it feels unatural and unbelievable. I was not convinced.<br />I never understood why Christian feels that way for Ana. He says she smart, brave, she surprised him by her reactions or actions, but why? for what? Ana had very little personality, Christian was more interesting because he has baggages, a dark side and more complex character.<br />The over use of \\"Oh, my\\", \\"Oh...my\\", \\"MMmm...\\" and Ana referring to herself as her \\"Inner Godness\\" was very annoying.<br />Among other things, the writing was mediocre with a weak plot. I can go on but I'm sure you can read about it on other reviews.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|in my times of stress I seek solace and peace this app was all I needed and a must have.I recommend audio listening.great in the kitchen and excellent before bed.
0743233832|5.0|Hi,<br /><br />Buy this book.  Then when you wear it out, buy another.  When you wear that one out, buy yet another copy.  Keep this up as long as you can, then start over.<br /><br />Tony

B006UKFFE0|5.0|I read an early draft of Ash's book some months back and was immediately impressed. It's a great hands-on guide to actually practising the lean startup approach, and for that reason it's extremely valuable for entrepreneurs who want to get started and get learning. I've shared the draft copy with a few entrepreneurs with whom I've worked and the response has been universally positive. Highly recommended.
0743487486|5.0|love it, mostly because its based on actual research. im reading it a second time right now, thinking that i dont really need to read any other books, just read that one really well.

0738212415|5.0|I bought this book on a whim after my fiancee drew an amazing comic book for me for Valentine's Day. I decided to buy her a couple of art based anatomy books to assist her new found interest in art; in the middle of selecting the anatomy books I stumbled onto this art book. I haven't tried to draw anything since junior high (I'm 33 now) so I thought why not on trying to hone whatever \\"art\\" skills I have. I bought the book, a sketch pad and a pencil set and I haven't looked back. Every night after work I sit down to this book and start the next lesson. I'm 7 lessons in and having a blast. I've even bought some other art books to work on outside of the 30 lessons contained in this book. Once I finish these lessons I will probably start them again as the concepts (at least so far) are simple but extremely important as base knowledge for any work of art you are attempting. I'm not kidding myself that I am the next (insert your favorite famous artist here), but I have found myself to be much more talented than I originally thought. Never before would I have imagined I could ever create a work of art that I could actually frame and proudly display in my house, but now I am very confident of that fact. If you are looking for a great introduction to the world of drawing (no matter your age), then I highly recommend this book.

B004A8ZWWY|1.0|I watched this with my wife over streaming video and had no issues with that luckily. However if you want to get a terrible I love New York movie that just bores you to death then this is the movie for you. Not one part of this movie was good and I personally felt responsible for the worst 2 hrs I have spent with my wife watching this awful movie. I hope you dont get this movie and for those people who put 5 stars on here, they must have been on meth or something.

006197806X|5.0|Words cannot begin to describe the feelings I had when I finished Pandemonium. I am a late bloomer to the Delirium series, but I can't believe I waited quite so long to get started on it.<br /><br />Pandemonium picks up right where Delirium ends. Lena is on her own and is running for her life. I really loved Lena in this book.  She is a completely different girl than the one we met in Delirium; she has become such a strong, independent young lady. More than once she did things that surprised me. I love watching her character grow more independent.<br /><br />While Lena is still the main character in the book, we are also introduced to a whole set of new characters. Most of the characters I found to be very interesting, and each for very different reasons. We don't really get to see many of the characters from Delirium, and I have to say that I really missed a few of them.<br /><br />One thing that disappointed me is that something is missing from the book. I'm not going to say what, but I will say that when you've read the book, you will totally understand what I'm talking about. I do, however, realize that without this one missing piece, we wouldn't have had this really awesome book.<br /><br />Pandemonium will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat up until the very last page. The ending nearly killed me, and now I'm dying to get my hands on Requiem! Lauren Oliver does a wonderful job of grabbing your attention and never letting go. I love that while the storyline is still the same as Delirium, the book is just has a completely different aspect to it. SO GOOD!<br /><br />Overall, this book was great. If you loved Delirium, just wait until you get your hands on Pandemonium!
B003E6K1VK|4.0|Easy to get set up and running. I hooked it up to the USB port on my Mac, went into the Sound pref pane and selected the USB device for my sound output and away I went. No muss, no fuss. Menus for the settings are a little strange, but once you get used to how they work, they're no big deal, and aren't usually tweaked much during daily use. Sound quality is good for the unit's size and cost. I just wish FiiO would stop trying to make their products and packaging look like Apple products. They're not fooling anyone, and it makes them look a little sad.
B005DF2QMC|5.0|Could not get it to work at first.  Then I uninstalled the program from my computer and re-installed it.  Now it is working fine.  I must have skipped a step the first time.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|Running Lean is a must read for anyone looking for a systematic way to develop and launch a product that the market craves. The idea of launching a \\"Minimum Viable Product,\\" which is explored in the book, caught like wildfire at our company and has influenced many of the decisions we've made for our produce and service updates.<br /><br />Definitely a must read for anyone who wants to launch or retool a successful product or service.
0525478817|5.0|NO SPOILERS<br /><br />It is hard to believe this novel is fiction. I was stunned at the realism of this novel and pulled in by how genuine the characters are and how much depth Green offered in what is a fairly simple story. If you are looking for high action and theatrics, this book has none. If you are looking for a real and \\"human\\" story, do not pass this one by. It is for both a younger and older (as I am) audience.<br /><br />First, do not assume this novel will be a downer since it is based on kids battling cancer. Yes, this is the backbone of the storyline; however, there's more to it than that. There are moments that will certainly provoke tears, but it is also laced with humor. Perhaps this is one thing the novel teaches us: humor is essential to our health and well-being. It is also a beautiful story of empathy and compassion. It reminds me of Atticus in To Kill a Mockingbird when he says, \\"You never truly understand a person until you walk around in their skin.\\" The characters in this novel had their assumptions challenged and learned of the interconnectedness of human nature.<br /><br />The novel is also an intelligent one. There are many allusions to other literary works (besides the one in the title) that enhance reader enjoyment and understanding of the characters. Even if you don't know what he's referencing, you can understand why Green included particular literary tidbits in the story.<br /><br />What is most refreshing is the sincerity and realism of the characters. Many YA novelists don't really know how young people think, behave, and talk and will slather on the, \\"Like, OMG, no way\\" or emo attitude as a means of capturing \\"true\\" adolescent behavior, which incorrectly over-generalizes teens as flakey and moody. Green's young characters are realistic. They have their occasional OMG and eyeball rolling moments, but, as a high school teacher, I can say that they are truly an accurate portrayal of their age group: sarcastic, sweet, sometimes selfish, intelligent, full of bravado and vulnerability among other traits. As a parent, I could also identify with the parents in the novel who simply needed to hover around their children watching terrible TV shows just for the mere pleasure of soaking up every available moment with them.<br /><br />Green covers so much ground in the book: love, loss, mortality, family, friendship, survival, dignity, and memory. It is a wothwhile read.

B003UCPEJ2|5.0|At this point the Sony Korea RCA Living Stereo CD box set collection comes in and out of availability, so I had to wait a bit before it came back into stock and I could get a copy.<br /><br />In the mean time, I spent months reading the reviews and checking out the individual SACD releases, many of which are going out of print again, waiting for it to come back into stock, so I could grab one for my dad.<br /><br />Now it came back in stock for a week at a slightly increased price over the original price and it's already sold out the 14 copies they got in. (If it is available currently stop reading the reviews and order it now)<br /><br />It was worth the wait, even though some of the other reviews made my choice more difficult than it needed to be.<br /><br />This is a set of CDs, NOT SACDs, but the CDs contain the stereo remasters that were on the 3 channel SACDs, (which is a combination of the original simultaneous mono and stereo recordings).<br /><br />The sound quality is fantastic from the days of analog recordings that capture the warmth of the medium and have a spacious sound field from recording in historic music halls.<br /><br />This is my first dip into the classical CD market, it was more for my father who was interested in getting his Living Stereo lps transferred so he could listen to them on his MP3 player, but as a fan of historic recordings this set caught my eye and I'm glad I waited for it.<br /><br />This will sell out and being an import only collection from Korean Sony, it is already diffcult to track down.<br /><br />A perfect companion to the Mercury Living Presence box for an instant reference library on CD of some of the finest analog classical recordings of the late 20th century, with minimal overlap of material.<br /><br />There has been a flood of classical import CD boxes of late to move the copyrights from the original American labels to the new owners and this has been a boon for people just starting to build a classical CD collection. This also helps the new labels get ready for the future with download only versions of the original lp based albums once these discount boxes sell out.<br /><br />This Sony box is the best of all of them with 60 CDs and an almost half inch thick book with the complete liner notes from the Soundmirror remasterings including all the original liner notes and liberettos for the operas.<br /><br />If you are even thinking about it and it's still available, go for it before the undocumented MP3 downloads are the only versions of these historic recordings left in print.
B002RL7W9W|3.0|My son was happy to receive it. How unhappy we were going to be, we were just about to find out. It had miising parts!!! THe box looked like someone was trying to open it. There was no time to exchange the package so my son received it for Christmas... I was very dissapointed. It took us two weeks after to gather othe parts from old Lego blocks to fit into this one. We searched for simmilar and thanks GOd we found some. My 6 year old son was finally happy. But.. seeing him so sad during Christmas... My heart was broken on the inside :/<br /><br />What happened to this package? This time I ordered two serious Lego blocks straight from LEgo.com.... I did not want to take a risk having incomplete box again.
0385738773|4.0|WARNING: This review may contain spoilers. Proceed at your own risk.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this book. The action, mystery, and suspense were all there, but I just didn't like it as much as the first two books. It was still a very good book though.<br /><br />Although this was a good wrap-up to a great series, the ending leaves me with a very unsettled feeling: they basically went through two and-a-half books of pure living hell to just end up hitting the RESET button and starting [civilization] all over again! It almost seemed like they did all that for nothing.<br /><br />I still love the series, and it will remain one of my favorites.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|The theory of Eric Ries 'Lean start up', Steve Blank's 'Customer Development', Alexander Osterwalder's 'Business Model Canvas' and Dave McClure's 'Start up metrics' applied in one actionable, bite sized book form.<br /><br />The above-mentioned books are a great foundation for learning start up theory and the principles of lean startup but Ash's book takes things to the next level by drawing on his own experiences and walking the reader through the iterative process of finding product/market fit and testing ones assumptions in tandem with actually building a product.<br /><br />When people ask me what book I recommend for running a start up I point them straight to Ash's Running Lean.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
0385738757|5.0|After finishing the first book, I did not wait more than an hour to start this one and easily finished it within 3 days! I had to find out what happens next! This series is shaping up to be a big favorite of mine. The story continues on with bigger trials and more mystery, suspense, and intrigue... the elements that really set these books apart. Once again, Dashner divulges just the right amount of information to keep you hooked and wanting more. A few new characters are introduced and of course the twists and turns really make you second guess just about everything. I love it!<br /><br />When a story can invoke so much emotion, that tells me the story has certainly grabbed my attention and really pulls me in. I love that! There were numerous times I would get frustrated or angry or disheartened at something (or someone), I would almost yell at the book (okay, sometimes I actually did yell). But all of this was in a good way; it makes me like-- no, love the book even more.<br /><br />In the Hunger Games versus Maze Runner series battle, the latter is pulling ahead. Just saying....

0385737947|5.0|I couldn't believe how much I liked-- no, loved this book. I knew I would probably like it, and I was really looking forward to reading it. But it really took me by surprise. Despite how \\"in-the-dark\\" I was about what was going on and the purpose of everything, it was easy to stay interested in the story. I enjoyed the ignorance; it added to the mystery and suspense of everything. Dashner does a great job at balancing the information he drops and the amount you get along the way. It keeps you glued long enough to get the next morsel of the story as it unfolds. All in moderation, right?<br /><br />One of the things I liked the most is how unpredictable this story is (at least to me it is). Sometimes it's difficult to see where the story is going or what might happen next. There's a nice amount of twists and turns. I noticed how the chapters were kept fairly short which seemed to make the story move along at a nice pace.<br /><br />I really love this book and the series so far. I have one more opinion on this, but I will wait to make a definite decision on it after I finish all three books. But, there is a very real chance that I could like this series more than The Hunger Games series. Just saying....

0307888908|4.0|I must say I appreciate that Reid Hoffman shares his experience. But I must caution what you decide to act on. Here is a different perspective: There are no safety nets for entrepreneurs. Say if you fell off a cliff and cling to the side of a tree, the coast guard will come rescue you, but if you fail as an entrepreneur, in my experience, nobody will rescue you.<br /><br />In Koffman's book he mentioned Stephen Covey's 7 Habits, I read the 7 habits, it filled my mind with confidence. I happen to side with Hoffman, I want to burn Covey's book. I stayed away from Covey's writings ever since.<br /><br />Even if you do everything Hoffman does, you will not be another Hoffman. This is his unique experience, all his. I must say he is credible, but read it as his experience.<br /><br />I wish you all good luck.

B004SQS9FA|4.0|At first listen I didn't like this album much, but as with several other Radiohead pieces it takes time for some to come around. Now it is one of my favorites. The first four songs are ok, but the last four really make the album for me. Give Up The Ghost and Separator are especially beautiful.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|The books were amazing but I have to say the show was way better! HBO is excellent at choosing new shows. Cannot wait for next season! For those who say it isnt worth five stars, you obviously prefer to stimulate your mind with shows like the Jersey Shore (I am from NJ and even I think the show it aweful).
B000WQW988|5.0|Great quality. What can you expect for the original? This is a golden relic. This has the scenes between songs MTV didnt want us to show until 2007.<br /><br />Its a must for us Nirvana fans.

If you don't believe me, reach out to me on twitter @alexanderlumley and I will explain why this book is so awesome.<br /><br />Read this book. Now.
B005SZAEYO|1.0|This is one of the worst pilots I have ever seen.  It was disturbing on so many levels and it made no sense at all.  The creepy boy that befriended the daughter was painful to watch.  Bad acting all the way around.
B006UG90RM|5.0|I've been meaning to write a review of this after I got it at it's 2/7/12 release. I saw some other reviews bashing the CD, and babbling on and on about this, that and the hogwash other.  First, like many others, I've been a die-hard VH fan since day one...<br />like many others, I also think the Roth-era is not only the classic-era VH, but certainly the music was better, more raw, and not as wet-sounding(over-produced) as the Hagar stuff. Eddie was more brilliant early-on as most artists tend to be...yet did still put out some really good stuff with Hagar with a lot fo credit to Sammy, who's a brilliant artist in his own right.<br /><br />On a personal note, pardon while I divert for a moment - - - - - - - - - - - - - -<br />{{My issue after Roth, was that Eddie's guitar sound (and overall production) became more wet with effects, losing a bit of the bite of the classic `Brown-sound' he was known for, and  his solos appeared to me to be of one resting on his laurels a bit. Although with the advancements in digital technology, you can hear from 1984, the production was already moving in that direction.<br />Don't get my wrong - I love Eddie, and I sing his praises as much as the next-it's a no-brainer he's an innovator, and I've always said that in this wide-world of guitar-players, one of the things that sets Eddie apart from every other is not only his classic tone, and style, but that he's a brilliant song-writer and no one can touch that total package...not even  a wizard like Vai, who I  consider a better guitarist technically and theory-wise...Stevie is hands-down in an atmosphere all his own, but even he admitted once seeing Eddie live and thinking how incredible a player he is...and knowing as genuine and nice a guy Steve is, it's not just a passing compliment-he really meant it!<br />So, apples to oranges-different styles and modes of playing!<br />Eddie's earlier playing was just so raw and spread-out, and the Hagar-era stuff, though the writing was greatand Eddie's playing had it's moments, it seemed more refined and pulled back...the same old two-finger tapping-the same way everytime, and the way he would bend a note up high into the octave...just seemed he lost a bit of his soloing creativity...I mean, I know those nuances are Eddie's thing, but it just felt like he wasn't being creative with it any more and it felt-to me anyway, that the finger-tapping became more of a crutch-an easy way out from having to do as much with one hand...I'm sure there are some guitarists out there that feel where I'm coming from- but the thing that has always set him apart was his ability to write.  He's a brilliant song-writer/arranger...even on VHIII- I didn't think the songs were that  bad, but Gary Cherone? I've still yet to figure that one out, but who's gonna blame Gary-who wouldn't take that gig...and Gary's a good dude-get's a bad rap for VHIII... there were 4 guys still involved.<br />[Note:  His band Extreme released a classic in `Three Sides to Every Story'...By the way-Where's Nuno?]}}<br /><br />OK, so the Dave & Sammy stuff...It's a different era, different singer, different mentality and I'm not getting into the wasted time of comparing apples with oranges!<br />With that-all of the 1-3 star reviews are probably some armchair critics who commit the ultimate review crime: judging the cover before you actually read the book!<br />In this case, I personally only need 1-2 listens to know this CD is plain & simple, A Masterpiece!  Tattoo was a little different at first and most didn't know what to make of it... Until what? Until they gave it a few listens and I can't tell you how many times I've heard people say or read reviews that it actually grew on them.  If ADKOT doesn't hit you between the numbers in the first 2-3 listens, it will...unless you've already made up your mind so like a lot of stuff, you really have to give it several listens before you can throw out a kneejerk opinion about it.<br />But if you are a trueVan Halen fan or even have a decent ear for good music, then you will not deny that this is simply the best Van Halen album since 1984 (I've heard some say ever, but I'm not  gonna go that far)-but it's certainly up there where they left off when Diamond Dave got dillusions of Grandeur & went Crazy from the Heat' [By the way:  As crazy as it seemed at the time, DLR's 1st 2 solo albums speak for themselves sporting the best Rock guitarist and Bassist even to this day in Steve Vai & Billy Sheehan...talk about masterpieces...both are!]<br />Also, so much is being made about rehashing older songs...yes, I heard `She's the Woman' back in the day and thought it was OK, but so many have not heard it and VH has  breathed new life into it while bringing it more to the masses-Yes, Tattoo is an older song called `Down in Flames', but only in it's arrangement...the song wasn't really that good...until Dave laid down a brilliant new vocal melody and in my humble opinion, doing more than breathing new life into an older cut as it really is a completely different song.  I think so many try to spit out these comparisons to say: I was there back when, and I know something you don't... WHO CARES people...who really cares?! I love Sammy too-brilliant singer/ songwriter as he proved before joining VH, but even he has made the points that most of this CD is rehashing of older material, but again I ask-WHO CARES???!!! I think with Sammy though-it's more sour grapes than anything else.<br /><br />If most of these armchair critics knew then what they know now (before this was released), I'm sure they'd be saying that VH should update & record these songs and re-release them-but of course would never admit that. I also bet a lot of these 1-3 star reviewers have since worn this CD out!<br />There just simply isn't a filler here peoples!<br />Tattoo is addictive, and outside of the Diver Down-esque Blood and Fire, the obvious comparison to Ice Cream Man-`Stay Frosty' (acoustic to thumper), this album flat-out rocks from start-to-finish! Give them credit for getting it done already - it's been 28 years since they released a full album(CD)with Dave and released 13-strong cuts...I don't care if they wrote them when they were in High School, I say better late than never!<br />It should be about the strength of the songs and not(in a baby- whining voice)...'they had 7 of these songs from way back in the late 70's...whaaaa, whaaa' -Whoop-tee-doo!  Trust me-there's way more good to say about it that bad, and I guess there's always gonna be haters out there!<br />Spin magazine said it best: \\"the frantic, haute-for-teacher \\"As Is\\" and the mid-tempo shoulda-been-the-single \\"You and Your Blues\\" can hang with any heavy-breathing romp they made in their heyday.\\"[13] The A.V. Club's Steven Hyden stated, \\"After so many years of fumbling dysfunction that reduced the once-proud Van Halen name to<br />a laughingstock, A Different Kind Of Truth matters because it's a reminder of why this band mattered,\\" whilst noting that, \\"Roth deserves some of the credit for that. For whatever reason, when Roth is in the band, Eddie Van Halen plays guitar like the world<br />wants him to play guitar.\\"<br /><br />Also - still on the fence with Wolfie. Is it really him playing bass on the actual CD?  I'm sure Eddie's got him as seasoned as possible-but maybe the question is did Eddie write the bass-lines for these songs and even record them or did he give his son free reign...It's odd I guess that (although we all know what the other 3 guys do), it would seem that he'd still want to have his son's name credited as a bone fide bandmember: EVH: Guitars, DLR-Vocals, AVH-Drums, Wolfgang-Bass guitar...but I didn't see that - just a thought-I could be over-thinking that.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love this app! it doesn't require wifi to work and its free!! you can pick your own background ... why not download?
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I had my reservations at first because it's written from a guys perspective and I'm used to reading from a female's perspective, but it truly didn't matter.  The main character wakes up in a box being raised into a community surrounded by walls.  He has absolutely no memory except his name 'Thomas'. A new boy (they are all boys) is delivered every month, supplies every week, and every night the walls close to protect them from the 'grievers'.  outside the wall is a maze and everyday runners are sent out to try and figure it out.  But everything changes when the next day a girl arrives...  The book is a very fast paced Dystopian/Post apocolyptic and very difficult to put down because it keeps you guessing.  Although very different, and possibly a little more violent, I'd compare it to Hunger Games or Enclave.  HIGHLY RECOMEND!!

B006UKFFE0|5.0|This book is a must if you're starting your own Internet business or taking part in an early-stage company.<br /><br />I had plenty of business experience but had never started a company before. You hear so much conflicting advice and so many vague bits of direction, that it can be really tough to know where and how to start. This book is great for focusing on the stuff which really matters and putting things into a framework which you can gradually progress through.<br /><br />The author pulls together thinking from a few sources on lean development practices, but the themes are always grounded in really practical, specific examples on how to tackle different phases. We found the lean canvas particularly useful in crystallizing our thoughts and also surfacing areas in which we thought we had all agreed but where we need to have more discussion.<br /><br />Highly recommended
0143119680|5.0|I am NOT a professional reviewer like some who posted reviews here. I AM a reader who really enjoys a good tale, preferably one with historic or \\"fantasy\\" elements. I bought this book as an impulse buy at a local music shop because the title and premise sounded interesting. I think too because I was born on All Souls Night it was especially appealing.<br /><br />The first 20-30 pages were a bit tough, I'll admit. It took me a little time to get used to the author's writing style. Once I did, though, her style reminded me of Conan Doyle at times - very intelligent, drily witty, and sophisticated. But Harkness really does have her own, unique \\"voice\\" that I quickly became used to and enjoyed. Fair warning - you will need to engage your brain a bit with this book...as I mentioned, the writing is sophisticated and you will need to keep your brain on it in order to follow the story. Thank goodness that it's not mindless entertainment like many romantic suspense or romantic mysteries are these days! I did find the book extremely difficult to put down and was really sad when the 500+ page story ended.<br /><br />I am a scientist (geologist) and studied archaeology and history in college. With her education and work, Harkness definitely delivers in these areas. Her characterization is superb, especially for a first novel. This is not an easy thing to achieve and I can tell the author spent a lot of time getting to understand her characters. If you're looking for a good tale tinged with fantasy and history, give this one a try!<br /><br />The book is not perfect but it's VERY VERY good...if I could I'd give it 4.5 stars but I'll err upward.
B00030590I|3.0|Of course, this is only my opinion. I was expecting great things of this film, and it does have some incredible elements, but overall it just felt a bit flat. I think that perhaps the story translates (figuratively) better to a more collectivist-minded, Asian audience. For me, the ending just left me disappointed, and not in that \\"sad, but still meaningfully thought-provoking\\" way that it was probably intended to. I can appreciate a challenging philosophical statement, but at the end of Hero, I just felt like something was missing. Perhaps that was and is indeed the point, but because of that, I am not going to give it five stars. The film as a whole, as opposed to a typically flowing story, is more like a series of beautifully choreographed cinematographic dioramas. The colors are incredible. This is the sort of picture that, as someone else said, would be worth having hi-fi AV gear to enjoy on. Also as others have mentioned, Jet Li and Zhang Ziyi (sp?) are not necessarily the stars in the way that the cover suggests. The other lady and guy (I won't pretend to know their names) carry more of the actual story. Anyway, this is what it is. Unorthodox storytelling style, but lots of style.

B006UKFFE0|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book with its no BS approach, witty and light writing and practical examples on how to get a lean bootstrapped business off the ground. It seems that the author, Ash knows what he is doing and has tons of experience in the field which should be a prerequisite for writing this kind of book, but unfortunately isnt always the case with other authors. I would recommend reading it even if youre still working for someone else and have no plans of starting your own business, it might spark something inside of you that you didnt know existed and we need new entrepenuers to rebuild the economy not a nation of welfare sucking wage drones.

B002RI9ZPY|5.0|This is a great book and really kept my interest.<br />I read the whole trilogy and was really sad that<br />Stieg Larsson died before he could write any more<br />to this set.  Lisbeth was an interesting heroine and<br />a kickass kind of lady.  Saw the movie to this one<br />and hope if they complete the series they stay with<br />the same people or else it just won't be the same.

B005V2EVBQ|2.0|It fits like a glove for the product. It is very light polycarbonate (an impact and scratch resistant PLASTIC). Which is nice and I love the rubberized feel of the outside.<br />  But something I don't see people mention is the FELT on the inside of the flap. The FELT while holding the device will build up static electricity like rubbing your feet on the carpet and will shock you(I have tile floors by the way). Repeated SHOCKS cannot be good for an electronic device, the shocks can be damaging for your Kindle Fire. And I don't like continually being SHOCKED. If they would have just used the rubberized on that side also, I think it would be great and not a shocker. So I'm going to try to find a leather one with suede inside the flap, that should keep the shocks away.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|I found this book hard to get started. Somehow, the letters were difficult to understand within the context of the story. As it unfolded, however, the story began to come together. I knew nothing about the book beforehand, and had read a review of the movie in Rolling Stone, which referred to the novel. I was absolutely blown away by the ending. Wow. Excellent read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i have read alot of YA books & this one was amazing.. at first it was a little slow compaired to the rest of the book but about chapter 6 it picks up i LOVED it & was afraid that I wasn't going to beable to read it because there was no communication & a lot of in your head reading, but i can say that it is a book to read CAN NOT wait for the second book to see what happens with katniss & peeta along with her former life at home district 12..
B005COO1X6|4.0|It was pretty good.  I quit reading Stephen King a long time ago.  This is more like his first works which I enjoyed.<br /><br />It read fast and easy with lots of suspense.  At times I felt the main character would even be able to accomplish his mission.<br /><br />I really liked his ending.
B004SIP8W0|5.0|First, I want to say that when I first saw this movie, I saw it in a movie theater with 6 people: myself, my mother, and 4 concentration camp survivors.  There was not a dry eye in the house as the credits rolled.  One of the Auschwitz survivors said to me on the way out, \\"it was this kind of love and devotion that saw me through.\\"<br /><br />Second, I find it interesting that the haters for La Via e Bella pin it against Schindler's List.  I have never met a person who loves Life is Beautiful ever say a bad thing about Schindler's List.  They are two different films, with two different purposes.  Schindler's List exposes the cold, dark reality of 1940s Europe and teaches about the Holocaust on a mass scale.  However, if we look at history, we can see that people often can't see the forest for the trees.  In Rwanda, it's hard to hear that millions died, but it's even more touching to see Hotel Rwanda and what one man did for one group of people.  The same is the case here.  Life is Beautiful is not about the 6 million Jews who died; it is a fable about ONE family's struggle to survive.  The impact is that rather than just another faceless person dying, you see Guido, a man that the viewer has developed an extreme closeness and affection for, face the end.  In that way, Life is Beautiful is actually far more analogous to The Pianist.<br /><br />Third, anyone who writes a review stating that they only watched the first half of the movie has no idea what they're talking about.  THIS IS NOT A COMEDY ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST.  That is an insult.  The first half is jovial and light because it is about the family BEFORE the dark cloud of the Holocaust took over their lives.<br /><br />Fourth, the comedy that appears in the second half is there for one purpose: survival.  Guido loves his son so much that he is willing to do anything to protect him.  Anything.  That is not comedy.  That is not insulting.  That is love.<br /><br />The last and stupidest comment I've seen on here issomeone claiming that the title is insulting because life wasn't beautiful in the Holocaust.  I don't even know how to respond to such an ignorant interpretation.  Look up at point four; what the title refers to is the beauty of a father's UNCONDITIONAL love for his son.<br /><br />If Steven Spielberg didn't like this movie (as some indicate), that is his mistake.  Schindler's List is a masterpiece, but so is Life is Beautiful.  I suggest anyone to see it, embrace it, and discuss it with your friends.<br /><br />A true classic.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|As a first-time tech entrepreneur, knowing where to start and how to implement your ideas seems like an almost insurmountable task. Ash's book helped me and my team immensely and instead of launching a big, bloated product that met my needs alone, we were able to trim the fat and as a result the vivogig app is a clean, agile product that fulfills the needs of our customers.

B00006CXSS|5.0|The first time I saw this series was shortly after Private Ryan had completed its run in the theaters. Tom Hanks was great in that one and hearing that he and the great Spielberg were involved in this series got me to check it out though my expectations were realistic; nothing could top Ryan, I thought--I was wrong. Even if you don't particularly care for war movies, please check out this series. I promise that five minutes into the first episode you'll be glad you did.<br /><br />Brothers follows a unit called Easy Company from boot camp, throughout various skirmishes in the German theater, to the Jewish labor camps, and finally victory and German surrender. The trip from point A to B is oftentimes heroic, sad, and harrowing. What I like about this series over Private Ryan is that even though there are quite a few characters, you spend enough time with them to get to know them, and care for them, and admire them. Like Sergeant Spears' character, my favorite character in the series. Or Lieutenant Winters.<br /><br />Each series begins with surviving members of Easy Company giving his account of the campaign depicted in the ensuing episode. If I were to sum up the theme of this series with its many twists and turns it's about how adversities turn men into brothers and how that adversity can often bring out the best and worst in men. Truly unbelievable series. So many memorable scenes in this film. One of the most ghoulish and convincing scenes is the one where they discover the labor camp. The episode is called Why We Fight and I promise you it will affect you, the depth of cruelty and barbarism man is capable of inflicting on another man. My favorite episode is the third one.<br /><br />But it's not all drama. There's more than enough good ol' American kick-*ss action in here. Looking at this series it's hard to believe that all of this stuff actually happened. Those were some bad dudes. And that this series was made at all is a miracle in this era of style over substance.

To those looking for self-help, you will find some nuggets of wisdom, but the real value of this book is in providing insight for those who need to influence a cultural change in teams of people.
1439190275|5.0|I have just started the Atkins new for you. My husband joined me to support me. I have struggled with my weight all my life and have been on just about every diet there is. Some have worked for a short period with total regain. I liked this book very much. It is so informative and allowed us to start \\"in the know\\" Once I understood how fats, protein and carbs work in your body it all made sense. I had tried Atkins years ago without the proper knowledge and therefore it didn't work.  I really recommend reading the book before starting.<br />The first week my husband lost 10 pounds(not fair because I did all the research and cooked all the meals)amd I lost 7. I'm just kidding I know men lose faster than women..still not fair. This is the first time in my life that  I can remember not being hungry at all times. That fact alone is enough to keep me motivated. We both want to lose 40 pounds and we are both hopeful.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|The 1920's come alive in this visually-rich drama where the set design alone is one of the stars. We are used to seeing that era as grainy black and white images that appear drab and stagnant. \\"Boardwalk Empire\\" recreates Atlantic City as an electrically lit fairy land, a sensual paradise where every pleasure is available - if you got the money. This HBO series follows the exploits of real life crime figure, Enoch \\"Nucky\\" Thompson, who manipulates a world of such mind-boggling graft, greed, corruption, casual cruelty and sex that Tony Soprano and his pals appear like lightweights by comparison.<br /><br />The series begins just as the Volstead Act (Prohibition) comes into being and Nucky, Atlantic City's Republican Party boss, is addressing the Women's Temperance League. After which, he arranges for a shipment of illegal hooch to be offloaded which will net him a bundle. It's a cliche to say that organized crime began with Prohibition but the amount of money changing hands as everyone wants a piece of the action is staggering. Everyone is on the take, even elected officials. It's difficult at times to tell the gangsters, including such criminal luminaries as Al Capone, \\"Lucky\\" Luciano, and Arnold Rothstein, from the senators, governors and town fathers who are equally venal. The only pious adversary is a Federal agent, Nelson Van Alden (played with square-jawed brutality by Michael Shannon) so odious (he flogs himself for sexual gratification) that you can't help rooting for the bad guys.<br /><br />Overall, the acting is excellent and Steve Buscemi, as Nucky, gets a chance to exploit that exaggerated wise-guy voice of his we've learned to love. He meets his match in Margaret Schroeder (an understated Kelly Macdonald) who under her waif-life fragility has a backbone of steel with a mind to match. Michael Pitt as Jimmy Darmody is equally magnetic, following the Michael Corleone example of the academic war hero who gets led into the underworld of crime and finds himself quite adept at it. In all, \\"Boardwalk Empire\\" is a pleasure for the senses that tells more about the 1920'a than a dozen history books. It is a world about to go through tumultuous social changes and the viewer is swept along for the ride.lf quite adept at it.

B005MMJ84K|4.0|I've been looking forward to the release of this book for what feels like ages, so I was extremely excited to have it delivered to my Kindle so I could get started.  I have to admit, however, that Pandemonium wasn't what I expected.  I found that I was bored at times, and frustrated with Lena for letting people use her and lie to her and walk over her.  I hated Raven through the entire book and found myself wishing Lena would punch her in the nose.  I didn't love the back and fourth either between then and now.  All the \\"then\\" chapters I could've done without.  She was rescued and brought to NYC to help the resistance.  I didn't need all those chapters to get me where a few paragraphs could've taken me.  Anyhow, I did love the \\"now\\" parts of the book.  I found that I was pulling for Julian to break away from the ties that his father held and I was hoping he would be strong enough in the end to stand up for himself.  I guessed part way through what the Resistance had planned for Lena and Julian... it was somewhat obvious, but I was still invested and I still enjoyed the story.  I'm not sure how I feel about the ending... I'm not sure why Lena didn't press Raven for more information on Alex since she seemed to know his name, you would think she had some information on what happened to him.  I just don't know.  The cliffhanger I was left on with Delirium was huge... I was on the edge of my seat and so upset when it ended.  Somehow, I saw the end of this book coming a mile away.  I'm TRULY hoping the next book doesn't get all love triangle crazy on me... I'm sure it will but I can hope it won't.  I like Julian and Lena together and hope they end up together in the end.  So, for me, I didn't enjoy this installment quite as much as the first, but I'm definitely looking forward to the next book and I'll definitely buy it for my Kindle.  I sincerely hope this trilogy doesn't end as horribly as the Nightshade books by Andrea Creamer!!  I'm kind of scared... Keeping my fingers crossed and hoping for the best in the third book!!
B007BLDFWG|5.0|Slow, unsettling film. Elizabeth Olsen is amazing, as is the rest of the cast. I've recommended the film to others; however, please keep in mind it's not a feel-good film nor a thriller.
B00338QENI|5.0|The first book that I can't put down for months! The perfect mixture of storytelling, facts, and humor. I found myself chuckling, ooh-ing and ahh-ing, and empathetizing with the characters. Definitely a good read.
B004IE0G58|5.0|Definitely worth buying! Everything came in great and was in perfect condition. I found nothing wrong with the product. The movie itself is great as well.
B006OGMEUI|5.0|After the intro things start out with a bang with Helvetios, your typical Eluveitie high-energy exhilarating fast-paced song. Luxtos and Neverland are more chorus oriented. Home slows things down a bit. Meet The Enemy, Havoc, and The Siege are the more brutal songs, while A Rose for Epona and Alesia are a bit more pop, in particular the former. Alesia stands out for great use of the beauty/beast vocals, they form a perfect duet here and at times even seem to carry on a discussion, which I think is brilliant and unfortunately underused when bands have two types of vocals. It's not easy to pick favorite songs, but Helvetios, Havoc, The Siege, Uxellodunon stand out in my mind.<br /><br />The vocals deserve special mention. Anna Murphys range is amazing as she can sing beautiful and sweet melodies as well as scream gutturally with the best of death metal vocalists. Chrigel Glanzmann is among my favorite death metal vocalists. His voice is brutal, rough, powerful, and recognizable.<br /><br />Production is excellent; the sounds a bit less polished than on Everything Remains, and that is a good thing. Eluveitie's music is better suited for a rougher and wilder sound instead of the clean and perfect sound. Slania's production and sound were perfect. There are some outstanding details as well, some song intro and outro sounds, drone sounds, particularly striking is the beautiful chorus ending of Alesia.<br /><br />I'm not crazy about the prologue- some older fellow meaningfully reminiscing about war and songs. He makes two more appearances later and at the end of the album. The intros to their previous albums have been brilliant and also make perfect intros to their concerts. I sure hope they don't plan on using this. I'm a bit more concerned about the guitar work. The issue already started in Everything Remains and continues here. The guitar work follows somewhat of a pattern- quick strum-mute-quick strum. Most of the songs are like that and it's getting a bit monotone andpredictable. Perhaps it's meant to be give some consistency, uniqueness and recognizability to Eluveitie, but I do hope that in future albums the guitar work becomes a bit more varied and richer.<br /><br />Eluveitie remains the best folk metal band around. Their folk melodies are extraordinary. The death metal aspects are brutal and rhythmical. Combining both was a brilliant move. They stay away from the silliness that unfortunately characterizes most folk metal. Eluveitie is one of a kind.<br /><br />As a side note, Eluveitie is one of the very best live acts around. I highly recommend seeing their shows.
B003BVK36Q|2.0|I used to be a big fan of John le Carre. I read \\"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy\\" when I was a boy, and recently enjoyed the Gary Oldman version on the big screen. However, recently, he seems to be floundering as an author. With no Soviet Union to be behind all of the evil things that go on in the world, he of course must find someone else to despise, and of course he settles on the United States. So for several books now, Americans are more or less the villains. Sometimes it's more comic than really dangerous (after all, Americans are bumbling fools) but nevertheless they're the villains.<br /><br />So in the current book a Chechen with a strange, more Russian than Chechen, accent shows up in Germany, crossing the border illegally, and presents himself (through intermediaries) at a British-owned bank. He has a lot of money deposited there, but he doesn't want it; instead he wants help from the banker, in his quest to become a physician. He has a human rights lawyer, and of course half the intelligence agencies in the world are pursuing him, certain on the thinnest of evidence that he's a terrorist. That essentially is the plot, except for the last 30 pages and a couple of clumsy romances that don't really belong in a book like this.<br /><br />I really was dissappointed with this book. I hope he gets back to form.

B005FDWS34|5.0|Yo dog, this show is like a crazy exiting movie that never ends.  I liked the earlier seasons better then this one so far, but I like the show so much that I'm buying season 4 because I just can't wait until its free.  I just had to see what happened after last  seasons cliffhanger ending.  The subject is contoversial, but the characters are very endearing.  My favorites are Walt, Jesse, Hank, Walter jr. and the crazy lawyer.  I would consider thia a dark comedy for adults only.
0439023521|5.0|As the introductory book of the Hunger Games' trilogy, this is an outstanding work of fiction.  It is engaging, heart-wrenching, and beautifully crafted to stir up emotions one would not expect from a \\"teen-oriented novel\\".<br />It is a very exciting read!

B002DOSBMK|3.0|A friend recommended I start the series, so I download this book and devoured it pretty quickly.  It was an interesting story, an easy read other than crazy names of characters.  I'd love to listen to an audio book just hear them say the names.<br /><br />But I could tell this book was a prequel because it was a lot of back story and started slow.  My friend said I should have started with the Icewind Dale trilogy first to help me get into the story better.  It's too late now, but if someone is considering starting the series, they may want to do that instead of starting with the Legend of Drizzt , just a thought.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This collection is of course complete, and quite impressive.

B005QMOZOO|2.0|I finished reading this because, after all, it's P.D. James. And I know how much she, as I do, admires Jane Austen. What I wasn't prepared for was that \\"Death at Pemberley\\" did justice to neither. I suppose I didn't really expect Austen's lightness of touch, her wit or her irony. I did expect, however, James's clever crafting, and her adept handling of plot and character. The book did justice neither to the original Pemberley nor to its imagined existence as the home of Darcy and Elizabeth. The characters were flat and the plot unconvincing. James should have left Austen alone. I say this not because I'm an Austen fan (I am) who can't bear to read all of those extensions of her work (I can't) but because I admire and enjoy James, her own characters and their intricate representation.  \\"Death at Pemberley\\" is thankfully becoming a dim memory.
0738212415|5.0|This book is an excellent resource for the beginning artist of any age.  The fun easy lessons build confidence as they progress.  Unlike other how-to-draw books, the student examples aren't so \\"polished\\" that they intimidate someone just learning to draw.
0439023491|5.0|I read The Hunger Games and thought it was great and was deeply moved by its message of the dehumanization at the times of war and dictatorial governments.  However, Catching Fire (THG's 2nd book) elevated my admiration of Suzanne Collins.  At the end of the book you just have to pick up the 3rd one; it's that amazing!<br />Because of Ms. Collins' awesome characterizations of Katniss, Peeta, Haymitch, Cinna, etc. I am completely drawn to the story.  This book makes the 1st one look like elementary school.  The Capitol's ruthlessness is more palpable and awful, but it is the rebellion's brewing what is most exciting.<br />I completely adore these characters and despise the Capitol.<br />:)
0345522478|2.0|I'm writing this review halfway through _Hounded: The Iron Druid Chronicles_ because I'm debating whether or not to continue reading. The gist of the book is clear already, and I get the hollow feeling anything that follows will be more of the same.<br /><br />A two-millennia-old druid from the Emerald Isle, Atticus O'Sullivan, has upset the gods by stealing a sword no armor can resist. In doing so, he foiled plans for Irish ascendency and had a Celtic bounty placed on his head by the god of love, Aenghus &Oacute;g. Aided by the goddess of death and a penchant for loading up on fae-destroying iron implements (hence his moniker, the Iron Druid), O'Sullivan hides out in his occult bookstore near a college campus and acts the part of a 20-ish slacker while he waits for the final battle.<br /><br />What author Hearne has created in O'Sullivan is a poorly disguised clone of Jim Butcher's notable wizard/detective, Harry Dresden. Add elements from Neil Gaiman's _American Gods_, and be prepared to walk down familiar paths.<br /><br />And familiar paths done better by Butcher and Gaiman. While _Hounded_ is a definite improvement over the writing of Simon Green in that author's Butcher/Gaiman-esque \\"Nightside\\" series, Hearne's technically adept writing chops can't mask glaring fan-fiction errors. Everything about his Atticus O'Sullivan is too perfect. Whereas Harry Dresden struggles with women, O'Sullivan effortlessly beds every female who crosses his path, minor deities included. Whereas Dresden has a dog that seems to anticipate his moves, O'Sullivan communicates telepathically and carries on snarky conversations with his pooch. Whereas Dresden often botches or underestimates his magic, O'Sullivan easily fools the gods with his. And while Harry Dresden is a sympathetic character with real flaws, O'Sullivan had me rooting for the bad guys to wipe the smirk off his smug face.<br /><br />These \\"too much, too soon\\" characterization and storyline flaws are typical in fan faction. I'm convinced that Hearne can write better than this, which makes _Hounded_ so disappointing. Rather than trying to be a Jim Butcher clone writing a \\"better, cooler\\" Harry Dresden, he should have found a way to create distance and develop a voice, a style, and characters that set him apart.<br /><br />The lack of originality in current fantasy is troubling, with too many authors writing derivative works. When a fantasy author cobbles together character types in a desperate search to create something new, such as Hearne does with his Viking warrior vampire lawyer, the race to the bottom finds another gear. Where are the unique voices, writing styles, tones, characterizations, settings, and so on? And why do so many of the newly published authors in science fiction and fantasy write like fan-fiction writers? Haven't they been to a writer's workshop before? And are publishers so desperate to make a buck that they'll sign up these folks just to ride some better author's coattails? If so, readers of good sf/fantasy will be wading through a lot of trash and not finding much treasure.<br /><br />That said, the outrageous number of 5-star reviews for _Hounded_ tells me that publishers have diluted the offerings so well that readers can no longer discern between originality and mimicry. Or readers have made peace with sucking down derivatives while they wait between releases of Dresden novels--or whatever their favorite series and author might be. Either way, it's a sad state of affairs, and Hearne's _Hounded_ is the poster child.convinced that Hearne can write better than this, which makes _Hounded_ so disappointing.

1594203334|2.0|I applaud the effort, and I was looking forward to reading this after hearing her on NPR and reading a couple of reviews.  It seemed like the perfect thing to read as a half Francophile/half-French mom who's certainly not averse to suggestions on how to expand her children's tastes and good behaviors. That said, this book is a fantasy and a significant misrepresentation of parenting, let alone French parenting.  As someone whose entire family still lives in Paris, I'd say one thing you end definitely up feeling among French people is that your \\"Americanisms\\" are \\"taches\\" (strikes against you) that can't usually be fixed.  This fact alone could have been Druckerman's entree into making French culture accessible, but she only chronicles it and leaves the reader feeling low.<br />It's at times humorous, if you look at it through the right lens, but Druckerman seems to take 90% of her time lamenting about how unfortunate it is that she's got such \\"terrible\\" American habits, holding up zero pride in who she actually is and where she comes from. I'm not an overzealous patriot, but take some pride!  She talks about all the \\"whiny brats\\" she encounters upon occasionally re-entering New York, which I must say, is almost as common in France, though it is met with far more spankings and coldness from their parents.<br />What she doesn't spend any time talking about is how such an upbringing (I feel I can say this as a French person) risks producing the grown version of many of these French children, Parisians in particular: people who are rude, self-centered, jealous (taught in school with an emphasis on intense academic competition and public ridicule for those who do not excel), intolerant, and quite frequently, the opposite of kind. She does not address the effects or outcome of a culture who does not allow their children to express themselves freely and frequently.  She also fails to draw the conclusion that these are the very adults who look down their noses at those whoneither know nor follow their secret rules for raising children.<br />Since the majority of us don't have the time or the luxury to decode these mores, it's a real shame that she gave such a snobby, inaccessible version of French parenting culture to the masses.  She claims at the beginning to not even really like France, and it seems she took that as license to only draw superficial conclusions.  I keep waiting for the book to get better, as I'm 2/3 through it, but I felt I needed to put in my review before other mothers purchase this book and end up feeling as I currently do:<br />If you are a mother whose time is extremely precious, I would recommend devoting it to a book that will not make you feel guilty and disappointed in yourself for turning out children who laugh a lot, smile a lot, play happily but yes, interrupt from time to time and prefer short meals and the company of their peers.  Would I love it if my children (3 and 1 yr) could sit peacefully through a meal and demand fines herbes on their endive salad? Absolutely! That's why I bought the book!  But there's so little HOW in here that I've not been able to justify the remainder.  I know it's easy to critique from afar, and I wish I could say better things in this one and only book review I've ever written, but alas, I can't.

B0064NTZQ2|3.0|So Ryan Gosling is a stunt driver who commits himself to criminal clients.  Without condition, for a designated amount of time.  Miss the window and he's out.  So he's a lot like a cable repairman who breaks the law with his inside industry knowledge - like when you used to be able to splice coax and get free cable if you palmed the installer a $20.  Anyway, Gosling helps out a friend and neighbor, an ex-con neighbor, who needs a getaway driver for what appears to be a simple heist.  Problem: Mob involvement.  From there it's drive, smolder, drive, murder, drive, retaliation, drive, [[ASIN:B001T5D6LK Twilight]] staring contest, drive, staring contest redux, drive ambiguously into the sunset.<br /><br />The story is taut, simple, and engaging at times.  Casting and acting is strong primarily because of the supporting roles turned in by Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman.  Beyond that, however, I don't see what everyone is so hyped up about.  The film starts slowly, has minimal buildup, has nearly nonexistent character development, and rides gingerly along the frail path of a nearly mute connection between Gosling's character and a cute neighbor.  For a character drama, Drive severely lacks on character, dialogue, and any semblance of credible character connection.  There were enough awkward pauses and silent stares that I looked at the credits to see if William Shatner was involved.<br /><br />To be quite honest, the one aspect of the film that has any meat is the one aspect rarely discussed.  There is a decent amount of action, blood, and violence for it to satisfy the amateur gore-hound, but since all that is discussed is the artsy film noir nonsense with slow, sweeping camera angles of the gritty LA landscape, designer clothing displays with slicked back hair and satin jackets, and extraneous toothpick wiggles from an actor who looks less than half as tough as his character is supposed to be, there is no wonder the truly gripping parts are overlooked.<br /><br />Ultimately Drive ends up constricted by the same elements that have caused so much critical fanboy dog-piling.  The same neo-noir style, with blank palettes, refined behavior, and stylistic preening is what pretentiously holds it back from being a truly gripping film.tely Drive ends up constricted by the same elements that have caused so much critical fanboy dog-piling.

B004LWZW24|5.0|Wow. Holy crap is this movie scary. Did you like Poltergeist when it first came out? This one is vaguely similar in plot, but much better, dare I say. You've undoubtedly read the basic plot from other reviews, so I'll skip to how this movie makes you feel. While watching it, when it gets to a point where the music is building and you just KNOW something is going to jump out and scare you? Well, somehow this movie manages to still frighten you to death even though you know it's coming. And there are ones you don't see coming, too.<br />The 'villian' as it were, in the end (without giving any spoiler alerts) is the type of monstrosity that makes me of all people, the atheist, think I'd better get my ass to church REAL soon. It's one twist after another, with a strong cast, and every creepy type of ghost you can think of all rolled into one movie. (you'll never be able to listen to Tiny Tim again either without getting creeped out, I guarantee) And it's not bloody or gory. It'll just mess with your head and make you very afraid of the dark.<br />The cool thing that I read on IMDB about it was that the writer sat at his desk writing this movie with a bulletin board of horror movie cliches in front of him, making sure he didn't hit any of the overused horror movie moments. Somehow, it worked. Last year, I did a Halloween scary movie marathon and watched a different movie every night in October. If I would've watched this one first, I would not have watched the other 29.<br />It will scare you. Really. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go turn on every light in the house.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|a wonderful game for people who loves different games. I think many adults or kids should try it because its really fun to play.
B005URRCNQ|4.0|I'd give this 3,5 stars if it were possible.  Nice album, although there are only 4 songs really worth it.  But those 4 (Lonely boy, gold on the ceiling, little black submarines, run right back) are really awesome.
B005MMJ84K|4.0|Although I'm not a big fan of these types of stories, this series was suggested to me on Amazon, so I tried it. I really liked the first book, though I felt it was a little lacking in the character development. Pandemonium was great though. I felt Lena's character developed wonderfully in this book. I loved how the author told the story of alternating chapters between the present and the past.  It's a great read, and I enjoyed it so much I read it in one day. Can't wait til the next one!

B004J4WKTW|5.0|I think one of the best things about this book is that it's so easy to get into this world. The magic isn't overly complex and not much detail is spent on the magic. The story is about people who wield magic, not the other way around.

B001HNE3NO|5.0|Wow!!  This book was absolutely fantastic.  I simply could not put it down . . .read it in two evenings after work.  Such a brilliant piece of work.<br /><br />One complaint. . .the kindle edition is only $1 cheaper than the hardcover and is not lendable....I think the kindle price should either be lowered or the e-book should be lendable . . . .
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|this is an awesome movie. this movie is based on a true story where three whales two adults and thier baby gets traped in the ice and fights for thier lives. when a news caster descovers that the whales are in trouble he broadcast it all over the news. when people descover how much the whales need help they help them. this was a really good movie and was heartwarming. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
0525478817|5.0|If you are a fan of John Green books, TFiOS is definitely for you. If you have never read one of his books, this book is still for you. He writes about such a serious topic with humor and truth. Please don't say \\"I'm not going to read this because it will make me cry.\\" Yes it will make you cry tears of sadness, but it will also make you cry tears of happiness. Isn't the testament of a good book that it pulls you in and makes you feel the emotions of the characters? If you are looking for a great read, then look no further than John Green's The Fault in Our Stars.

1932735410|5.0|The book will indeed help you pass the PMP test on the first try. However, I was expecting the CD to assist in taking sample exam questions - I can't even get the CD to load on my computer (PC running Windows 7) so I am extremely upset with the CD portion of the book. Nonetheless, the content of the book will emphatically help you pass the PMP exam the first time.
0897500482|5.0|There are quite a number of reasons that I would recommend this book. The first is that regardless of what you may think of him, Bruce Lee did achieve the status of \\"Legend\\". This is a rare glimpse into his though processes. You have to understand also that this is not a book that Bruce Lee \\"wtote\\" but rather a book that was compiled after his death based upon numerous notes, drawings, scribblings etc that Lee kept in his private journals and other places.<br /><br />Any true fan of Bruce's would consider it a treasure even moreso than if he had actually written it with the intent of marketing it as a book. I first purchased this book many years ago while in high school and it truly revolutionized my thinking as a martial artist and also let me know that I was on the right track in my personal critique of various martial arts and my innate desire to immediately modify whatever I was then learning as a novice in order to better suit ME and my personal goals and objectives.<br /><br />Just know that this is NOT a training manual or guide although it has lots of training info and guidance that you can easily apply to ANY martial art (as well as other things that you might be pursuing). Just know that Bruce Lee was a philosophy major in college so it contains a heavy does of his personal philosophies on things pertaining to martial arts.<br /><br />There are sections that give a good glimpse into the actual WAY of Jeet Kune Do which I look at as much more of a CONCEPT than an actual martial ART. It is a concept that anyone can apply and it is based upon what many martial artists had to learn the hard way from the Gracies Ultimate Challenge matches and the UFC. Bruce was ahead of his time inasmuch as what has now evolved into what we call MMA was the very idea of Bruce's philosophy of Jeet Kune Do. MMA is NOT a \\"system\\" or a \\"style\\" but rather a WAY of combat based upon combing \\"whatever is useful\\" to get the job done and \\"discarding that which is not useful\\". And the complete avoidance of a ritualized, over organized one-size-fits-all approach to combat.<br /><br />Also, Bruce practiced what he preached training with and both learning from and also teaching greats like Joon Rhee; Gene Lebell; Joe Lewis; Chuck Norris; Ed Parker; Wally Jay and many other's. So for all of these reasons this book is a valuable addition to the library of any martial artist. It is not so much a book that you READ as much as it is a book that you STUDY.<br /><br />Each reader will find different things within the context of this book that resonate with them. One of the things that this book did for me was cause me to invest serious research into developing a system of fighting from the ground and also develop different plans of action for various real combat scenario's.<br /><br />I'd give it more than 5 stars if I could for all of these reasons.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|The Bluray DVD of The Phantom of the Opera (25th Aniversary) was wonderful and I recommend this DVD to everyone. The singing voices of The Phantom, Christine, and Raul in this stage performance were great! The surprise guests at the end of the performance were also wonderful, with Sarah Brighton and Michael Crawford coming on stage along with Andrew Lloyd Weber. Four other past \\"Phantoms\\" sang together on stage, and Sarah Brighton sang, but Michael Crawford did not because he had to rush there from another performane at a different venue. When all the guests and cast joined in to sing together in the final song tho,you could definatly here Michael Crawford's voice singing with the group (especially the high part). Since Michael Crawford was coming from another performance, I'm sure that's why he didn't want to strain is voice or have to practice a song to perform, but there were 4 other past Phantoms who sang together as a group with each one singing part of the song solo. I totally recommend this DVD to anyone who loves The Phantom of the Opera, it is well worth the money.

B0029QRA1U|4.0|Initially I had a problem during set-up; on Windows 7 computers, the sound card defaults to \\"CD Mono\\" instead of stereo for the initial wav file. Eventually, I realized that I had to go into the control panel of my laptop to make the change manually. After that, the Ion Profile has performed extremely well, producing digital files that are as good and clean as I was expecting. I should point out that I have made no use of the the supplied software: instead I use a conversion software called Polderbits which can be purchased online, as well as software called \\"Spin it Again.\\" I have also never used the Audacity software, but it certainly has a good reputation and is likely superior to the supplied software. Overall, I highly recommend this unit, especially for the price.
B005MYEQ4U|1.0|When i heard this was nominated, I scratched my head; \\"Did I see that?\\" I had to read the synopsis to remember it was Allen's paon to Paris and his ever- deepening portrayal of conservatives-as-morons (Rachel McAdam's parents, etc) and that I remembered Allen's latest slide into 'mail-it-in' acting/directing; where two-dimensions is all that is necessary: His dimension and the rest of us who are wrong. Hemingway, F. Scott, etc. came off nowhere and leaves the viewer feeling their use was ham-handed. Oic: we really shouldn't expect others to live our life for us. Most of us figured that out by high school.  B-O-R-I-N-G + DESPERATION as  Allen slips into a seeming malaise lately of Communist POV mixes with more and more 2-dimensional schemes. Given Woody's political sensibilities, I think he may be writing for Hamas next.

006197806X|4.0|You never know what you are going to get in a second book of a trilogy-- it might be filler, lack of action or character development. Pandemonium was none of these. This book is filled with action, emotion and suspense. Lena is much more likeable in Pandemonium, a strong, confident woman who tries to survive in her new world. Readers get a bigger glimpse of life in the Wilds as well as what life is like for the most upper class of the cureds. Readers are introduced to a new character Julian, who I first I will say I wasn't too fond of, likely because of his status in the cured world but he eventually grows on you. This book could have been exclusively about Lena pitying herself over the loss of Alex but I think Lauren Oliver puts just enough in to remind readers how much Lena misses him but so much that we say \\"enough already\\" and forget about everything else that is going on in the story. The ending leaves you wanting more...as in the next book!
B006UKFFE0|5.0|It is rare to find business books that provide an implementation roadmap, but this is one of them. From the very beginning of the book, the reader is guided from understanding to implementing a lean startup. The example case study used throughout the book is approachable and practical, allowing the reader's own startup to easily be inserted into the story to visualize how it might work for them. While the lean startup movement is more of a framework to help startups navigate uncertainty, this book provides practical advice on the topics that Eric Ries and others have only written about at a high level. An essential book for anyone wanting to maximize their financial and time investment into a new venture.
B0059XTUEK|5.0|Marilyn Monroe has been portrayed many times on the screen, but never as sensitively or believably as with Michelle Williams' Oscar-nominated performance in MY WEEK WITH MARILYN, now available in a Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack from Anchor Bay Entertainment.<br /><br />Indeed, Ms. Williams becomes Marilyn to the point where one forgets that one is watching a movie about Marilyn Monroe and believes that that is the real person up on the screen.<br /><br />The film, directed by Simon Curtis, is based on a memoir by Colin Clark that details his experience as a 3rd assistant director on the troubled film, THE PRINCE AND THE SHOWGIRL, which starred Monroe and Laurence Olivier (Kenneth Branagh), who also directed that 1956 release.  Marilyn was newly wed to Arthur Miller (Dougray Scott) when she traveled to London for the first time in order to make the picture, and the playwright was having a difficult time dealing with her neuroses.  When he took a brief trip back to New York, Clark (Eddie Redmayne) was conscripted by Marilyn for a week to be her emotional support.<br /><br />The casting of the movie is letter perfect.  I can imagine no other actor than Branagh as Olivier and, as with Williams, he quickly makes you believe that you are actually watching the legendary British actor in person.  Redmayne is very likable as the young novice Clark, as are Judi Dench as Dame Sybil Thorndike and Julia Osmond as Vivien Leigh.<br /><br />MY WEEK WITH MARILYN is a charming, thoroughly entertaining film that not only give viewers a realistic look at a nostalgic era of movie-making, but also an insider's viewpoint of some of that time's most revered figures.<br /><br />© Michael B. Druxman
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'm not going to give away any spoilers, but I am going to talk about the ending in general terms. So if that bothers you, please skip my review. :)<br /><br />I'm a bit cynical. I hate that almost every book I read has a sappy, romantic happily-ever-after in which everything is wonderful and perfect and beautiful. A lot of the time that doesn't even jive with the tone of the book. But it seems like a lot of authors feel almost obligated to put the overperfect ending in their books. I was going to be really disappointed if the Hunger Games trilogy ended on a \\"everything is right and beautiful in the world, and Katniss lives happily ever after\\" note. Because that does not jive, not at all, with the rest of the books. I was kind of dreading the end of Mockingjay because I was pretty convinced the ending was going to be an overperfect letdown.<br /><br />The ending was, in my opinion, masterful. It was so well written and I was thrilled with the outcome for the main characters. It wrapped up the series perfectly and left me sad that the series was over, but satisfied with the way it ended.

After that, I pretty much gave up on them.  I still check out every new album they put out just hoping for a return to their mid 90's sound but....I can not believe they released this garbage. LOL!!!! I suppose this album seems to be the natural progression from the junk they've released over the last 6 years (Remember Who You Are/Were). Dubstep???? Really????  I read an article in which JD said he thinks its cool that kids are showing up to their shows with glow sticks. LOL!!! JD is in a midlife crisis.

B000PKX2KA|4.0|I bought this to use in my service truck with a tablet pc. I was completely disappointed with it at first because it would not work out of the box. I was about to return it if not for a week of fiddling with it and scouring the internet for soultions, I hit pay dirt and downloaded a program called SiRFdemo.exe and after installing it and running it, I switched the usb-gps receiver to NMEA mode and now it works amazingly well.  I highly recommend this product.  The SiRFdemo program will automatically synchronize the baudrate and com port for the device as well.  The software \\"GPS Info\\" that comes with the receiver would only show gibberish from the device and say \\"GPS Device not recieved\\".  I think SiRFdemo should come with the box! Then I would give it five stars!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|The Help depicts the disgraceful, bigoted way in which African-Americans were treated in the deep South in the early 1960s. The film is artistic with great dialogue and sets; but it pulls no punches about the evils of prejudice as most white people in Jackson, Mississippi degrade their \\"help\\" (maids they hire for peanuts) while showing that the \\"help\\" need to be careful just to survive--one maid's cousin's car was set on fire just because he wanted to vote! The film could have been edited very slightly (maybe 5 minutes) to make it a bit tighter; but this is minor. Honestly, the entire film captivated me; and near the end there were 1 or 2 times my eyes welled up with tears--and that's saying a lot because I almost never cry!<br /><br />Eugenia \\"Skeeter\\" Phelan (Emma Stone) returns to Jackson, Mississippi after graduating from \\"Old Miss.\\" Skeeter aspires to be a writer and quickly gets a job writing a housekeeping column at a local newspaper. However, Skeeter doesn't know much about housework--her parents had their maid too, Constantine (Cicely Tyson), who raised Skeeter while Skeeter's mother (Allison Janney) had herself a good time with \\"the girls.\\" Skeeter also wants to know why Constantine left while she was away; she doesn't believe her parents' explanation.<br /><br />Then come the white women in town who want maids to feel superior--and not to ever worry, not even when their own child is crying for comfort right in front of them. One of the very worst bigots is Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard); she treats her maid Minnie (Octavia Spencer) incredibly poorly and this could cause tension--Minnie herself has a temper. Hilly wants an \\"initiative\\" to make the \\"colored help\\" use separate bathrooms outside the house so white people don't  \\"catch their diseases.\\" There is another wonderful portrayal of a maid, Aibileen (Viola Davis), who raised 17 white children while their mothers essentially ignored them!<br /><br />Skeeter now wants to write a book about the lives of the maids; but they are terrified--this could even get them killed. Skeeter changes names for anonymity and Aibileen eventually agrees to let Skeeter interview her--then Minnie agrees. But after Medgar Evers is brutally murdered in Jackson, more maids want to tell their stories of dehumanization so Skeeter can get her anonymous book published by a New York City company.<br /><br />There's even more. We don't know until the end why Constantine left Skeeter's family; and we see consequences when Minnie serves homemade \\"chocolate pie\\" to Hilly. There's also the (allegedly) \\"white trash\\" outcast in town, Celia (Jessica Chastain), who might hire Minnie because of politics. We see who keeps their job as a maid and who doesn't. There's also Skeeter and her first boyfriend--will they become a loving couple? Moreover, look for a fine performance by Sissy Spacek.<br /><br />As for extras, I particularly liked the deleted scenes and we get a music video by Mary J. Blige.<br /><br />The Help succeeds at portraying the incredible chasm between the \\"haves\\" and the \\"have-nots\\" in the deep South at a time when simply being African-American could be quite dangerous. Fans of the actors will certainly want this; people studying the civil rights movement should also get this film.es of the maids; but they are terrified--this could even get them killed.

1416596585|4.0|In little more than a decade, Google has grown from a smart, disruptive search company to an Internet behemoth, with over $39 billion in revenue and a product portfolio now spanning advertising, mobile, cloud computing, and video.<br /><br />Since Google's inception, millions have used its search engine and services and come to rely on the company for fast, reliable information. Indeed, the company name itself is now a verb meaning \\"to search\\".<br /><br />Steven Levy's In the Plex: How Google Thinks, Works, and Shapes Our Lives chronicles the story of Google, from its origins and founding, through its incorporation and rapid growth, and to its ascendancy as one of the biggest and most influential companies on the planet.<br /><br />I found the text well-crafted and fascinating. Though a work of journalism, the narrative flowed very much like a story, with Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt cast as the main characters. The book elaborated all the major developments in the company's history, including the founding, the maturation of search and advertising as major revenue streams, \\"Don't be evil\\" and the distinctive company culture, incorporation, the acquisition of YouTube, Google's moral dilemma in China, and the company's recent challenges with privacy and social media.<br /><br />I highly recommend In the Plex for anyone interested in learning more about the history and DNA of Google.

0439023491|4.0|After finishing The Hunger Games I couldn't wait to dive into the second book of the trilogy, Catching Fire.  The Hunger Games drew you in so much with non-stop adrenaline that I was expecting the same from the second book.  Unfortunately, Catching Fire starts off kind of slow and doesn't have that immediacy type feeling that the first book has.  I was disappointed when I started reading because I was expecting the writer to get to the point a lot faster than she did.  It was also very annoying to read summaries of things already learned in the first book.  You shouldn't be reading Catching Fire without first reading The Hunger Games, why do we need a ton of recaps?  In my case, as I'm sure it was the case with many others, I started Catching Fire immediately after The Hunger Games so reading the same things over and over made me want to stop reading.  I did give this book a 4 star rating though and that's if you can hang in there until about halfway through.  In the middle of the book things really start to pick up and you get back that feeling you had while reading the first book, if not more so.  The ending was a shock (for me anyway) and I wanted to scream at somebody.  It also ended in such a cliffhanger that I couldn't stand it!  If you can hang in there until the middle of the book you won't be disappointed.  It surely makes up for the poor beginning.

B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|I bought this movie without ever seeing it...I liked spirited away and Kiki's Delivery Service so I thought I would take a chance. This is simply one of the most charming movies I have ever seen. Yes the plot is simple; well what's wrong with that. The animation is some of the best I have ever seen (very bright). Hayo Miazaki(I butchered that) said that this film was made with five year olds in mind, that doesn't mean that kids of any age cannot enjoy it!!!!I bought the Blu-Ray/DVD combo I was surprised at all the special features that came with it considering that other Gibli releases have been sparse when it comes to special features.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|This app does a great job of keeping things organized the Contacts shortcuts and folder shortcuts are huge.  Easy to set up and easy to maintain.
B0007TKNII|4.0|Well, at first, it's hard to overlook that the actors are not really stage singers. I was disappointed in the performance. It just wasn't majestic, like it feels on stage.<br /><br />Despite that, I still enjoyed this film because they managed to capture the mysterious feeling and the emotions between the trio, Christine, Phantom and Raoul. By the end of the film, I was just as into it, and feeling just as sympathetic for the Phantom, as I always did.<br /><br />Additionally, I really loved the costumes, though some may think they were over the top, and especially the Primma Donna. In contrast, I thought Christine's costumes were too bland. I think they could have capture Christine's purity with better gowns, either that or they should have brought the Primma Donna's costumes down a peg... but then again, she did provide the comic relief, which wasn't really there, before.<br /><br />I went and looked at some of the negative reviews, and I have to agree with what a lot of them are saying. Still, I did manage to enjoy watching, but yeah the singing was a big problem.<br /><br />I especially loved Christine's cloak, in the graveyard. Oh, I wish I could find one like it!<br /><br />So, anyway, it had it's issues, but still made me feel the way I did every time I saw it in New York.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I enjoyed playing its helps me chill out at night. really cool game!!<br />grab the nuts and go! that's what he said lol

B0001HAISG|5.0|This is an amazing version of Peter Pan.  All the actors were amazing (I was very impressed by Jeremy Sumpter and Rachel Hurd-Wood), it was very true to the book, and it was visually stunning. It was one of the most magical things I've ever seen.
B00008973Q|5.0|This classic Japanese Samurai film from 1985 is full of fantastic images, costumes, sets and scenery. The budget must have been tremendous to pay for all those extras, sets, etc. Really a great visual film. The story, based on King Lear, and acting are also very good. The only weak point is that I feel a half hour could have been edited out of the film without losing much. There are bits that drag a bit, especially when you are watching the film for a second or third time. Nonetheless, a classic film that serves up a unforgettable visual feast and a great story.
1594481717|2.0|The author is on the bandwagon that a MFA is the degree of the future and that we can protect our jobs from being automated or offshored by learning to Design Beauty, Tell Stories, Compose Symphony, Show Empathy, Plan, and find Meaning. One of his foundational examples is a quote from GM that they are a design company that happens to make cars. While that was a great argument in 2004, they are also a failed company that required a government bailout. Overall, it is an interesting and thought provoking book, even if I do disagree with his conclusions.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|Bought this for my Granddaughters 5th birthday and she loves it. I was excited because of all the extras, not only for the completion of the look of the room but also knowing that my son daughter-in-law would have fun in creating the perfect room for OUR little princess. They bought the Disney colored paint in princess blue (sky) and pink and did a wonderful job. I also bought the large castle to compliment the princesses. Very happy with vendor and will order again
B0052GACNM|5.0|Beter than Duets I.  For fans of this kind of music, a must have.  Lady Gaga is amazing - and i don't normally listen to her music! Even though Tony is old, you can tell he is still a better singer than most of his duets partners.
B0072OFM28|5.0|This is another fantastic season. And I feel  Liam Mcintyre is doing a great job. I also have to agree  this episode 5 was over the top. I was jumping up and down in my chair and my dogs thought I lost it. When the stands in the arena started collapsing I was freaking out. Steven DeKnight is a fantastic writer. This season is AWESOME. I will most certainly buy the dvd.
B006HH5ZQY|5.0|This is a new release of Blue Cheer's 1968 album. This is exactly what a re-issue should be.<br />1. An important album worthy of re-issue<br />2. Mixed and mastered with greater clarity than the original release<br />Blue Cheer has somehow become lost in the propaganda shuffle as the first true metal band ever. there was simply nothing this heavy in 1968, This re-issue adds greater clarity to the rhythm section of the band, which was an essential part of their heavyness,<br />the momo mix of this album emphasizes the sheer heaviness as well, while paying respect to the spirt of the original recordings. This re-issue is a must for all metal and classic rock fans.
B005DOKK7Q|5.0|This sleeve was exactly what I wanted for my Kindle Fire.  It is simple, slim and provides just enough cushion for me to toss it in my purse and not have to worry about my Kindle getting scratched or anything.  I also had no issues with the smell many people are complaining about.

B0051HNMTI|4.0|i already know how to do alot of the various ab excercises that are shown in this app that i learned when i used to have a subscription to men's health. but none the less i feel this would come in handy as a reference when i rejoin a gym the only thing i dont like this doesnt show more advance ab workouts that i seen on youtube that incorporate weights last no strange permissions for anyone to have to worry about. i have tryed this without a data connection and so far it seems to run just fine which im happy with cause like other workout apps they require a data connection to be able to stream a video.but i will test again just to see if all the videos on this workout app stream all the way through to the end of the video's
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I had seen some ads for the movie and was trying to read reviews on my Kindle and accidentally \\"borrowed\\" this book.  Whoops!  Over all, I'm happy I did.<br /><br />It's a decent enough description of a dystopian world. The gulf between haves and have nots is pretty stark and certainly not beyond belief.  The grinding poverty, the quiet dignity, and the adaptability of human spirit are well illustrated in Ms. Collins book. Katniss and her neighbors seem really tough, but very kind in their own way.<br /><br />My gripes are pretty minor. Certainly nothing to sway a potential reader from picking up The Hunger Games.  It's horribly written, or pathetically predictable. (ahem, twilight, ahem) I haven't read the other books in the series so I can't say that the rest of the series seems like it was rushed out (ahem, Harry Potter, ahem)  The worst I can come up with is  Katniss and her peers are very well spoken, even more so than many teens I've encountered.  I'm surprised that the Capitol would allow them to attend school so long. I got a bit confused by the level technology:  People mine coal and harvest food by hand, but the Capitol can send a hovercraft anywhere?  Why isn't anyone watching for the silver parachutes?  Seriously?  Wouldn't that scream \\"Here's a Tribute\\" to competitor?<br /><br />Worth the read, especially for free.
B001GKJ2FW|4.0|I had to buy this for a friend.  She just loves this movie and I was able to buy it in (Blu-ray) much to her delight. It seems you can always find what you're looking for at Amazon.
B00110K3BY|5.0|I have been listening to Zappa for more than 30 years. Since technology changed continually, I had to buy the music I liked in different formats over and over. Zappa is one of them. Not all Zappa albums are so good. There are some which contain a lot of talk or noise. This double album contains some of the best music of Frank Zappa and I recommend it highly.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|I'm sure the younger set just loves this, but it gave me a headache.  I never knew what it was doing, or what I was doing for that matter.  Please don't take my word for it, but I had to be honest!

030746363X|5.0|Got this book after hearing an interview with Tim Ferris from the Nerdist Podcasts, and after hearing about some of the success's with weight loss (the main reason I bought this book) I decided to buy it and try it out. So been following this book for about a month and a half and already lost 17 pounds, which is awesome! The slow-card diet is extremely easy to follow and even got my dad to go on with me after he was seeing my success with it. Plus I've been following the other tips, to build muscle and help with sleep and everything has been working so needless to say this book is just full of win. It worked for me when other diets have not, so I recommend this book to anyone who asks how I am losing weight!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a pretty cool game I like that you have to unlock the games it gives it levels...  it can be a little slow at sometimes but that's okay I'm just doing this for the points ha
B005HV6Y5W|4.0|What's it about?<br /><br />The story focuses on three young boys going up in 1950's under the strict ruling of their father.<br /><br />Is it any good?<br /><br />Recipe for a Terrace Malick film:<br />A. Low voice over, which you will need to turn the volume up for.<br />B. Highly visual, with emphasis on detail and nature.<br />C. Individual shots that linger much longer than what an MTV generation would be used to.<br />D. A 120 min + run time, which after it ends will have you deep in thought for day after end.<br /><br />Know what you are going to get when seeing a Terrace Malick film, and you will appreciate his films much more. Tree of Life is epic in scope and vision, but unfortunately, does waver a bit regarding the story. Probably not Malick's best, but still a beautiful and haunting film, that is absolutely worth watching just to celebrate techniques of a master craftsman.<br /><br />Best bit?<br /><br />The beginning of the Earth through the eyes of Malick is a 10 minute feast of the senses.<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />The film won the Palme d'Or for Best Film at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival.
B0067D7Y3U|5.0|I have liked Daughtry since American Idol. He has a distinct style that I love listening to. The songs have words and meaning. He always delivers songs with a strong voice and mastery of emotion. This is his best CD yet and I expect may more to come. Daughtry is here to stay!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|very good app, enjoying all the different options.  Love that it highlights available tiles and zooms in appropriately. good way.to pass time.
B0060ZJ78U|5.0|What's it about?<br /><br />Brad Pitt plays a retired baseball pro, turned general manager of the Oakland A's, who uses a new and unique method of player analysis to try and compete with the biggest spending teams.<br /><br />Is it any good?<br /><br />Are you always on sports forums making roster suggestions, or creating trades in ESPN trade machine? Chances are, like me, you've always wanted to be a sports general manager. If that's so, then you will love this movie. But even if you don't like sports, you'll love this movie. What makes this film so great is that it takes you into the inner sanctum of the sports general manager, and gives you almost a fly-on-the-wall look at the pressure of performance, making tough personnel decisions and the interactions with owners. Brad Pitt is great, as is Jonah Hill, however, the script by Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin (based on the book Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game) is the true star of the film.<br /><br />Best bit?<br /><br />The streak. No, there's no nudity involved.<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />The film was nominated for a 2012 Oscar for Best Picture.

B004DLPXAO|4.0|There are so many things about this app that are wonderful. So many books to download that are available for free, including all genres. I have downloaded books for my 7 year old, books for my teen and many books for myself with no issues.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is not being able to get the Amazon Prime deals. Without researching it, I signed up for Amazon Prime thinking I could stream movies to my TV and get the deals Amazon offered on #1 selling books now and then. Unfortunately, there are only a few devices you can stream from, those NOT being a Wii, an Xbox360, My 62\\" Mitsubushi TV nor my Sony Bluray DVD player. There are tv's & DVD's that are compatible but mine aren't. Also, in order to recieve the Prime book deals you HAVE to have a Kindle device, they won't let you load them free to your app.<br /><br />All in all it's been a great app but it looks like I'm going to end up buy that Kindle Fire afterall just for those features.
B003UGLCIA|5.0|What's it about?<br /><br />Regan is a healthy and happy 12 year old girl who lives with her actress- mother, Chris MacNeil. All seems regular untill Regan abruptly becomes prone to unexpected fits and unusual behavior. Fed up with doctors, Chris confides in Father Karras; a priest with a crisis of faith. Convinced Regan is possessed but unfit for the job, Karras calls in experienced Exorcist Father Merrin. Together they join forces to free Regan from the virulent demon that possessed her.<br /><br />Is it any good?<br /><br />It's amazing how after nearly 40 years this movie can still make you feel like a hampster in a lion's cage. How Linda Blair never won the Oscar beats me, she manages to show innocence through constraint so well, while Ellen Burstyn's performance gives you that real feeling of isolation as a desperate mother unable to protect her child. An exceptional script from William Peter Blatty coupled with great direction and top performances ensure 'The Exorcist' will always stand the test of time.<br /><br />Best bit?<br /><br />It's always sure to turn HEADS!<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />The scream of the demon being exorcised was created by recording squealing pigs being driven into slaughter.
B0029LHWFO|5.0|Review of Dreams from my Father~<br /><br />This autobiographical narrative \\"Dreams from my Father\\" by Barrack Obama, gives a compelling tale of our President's life prior to being a student at Harvard Law School.  Resilience, race, inheritance, are all words Obama uses to describe his life while being raised by a white single mother and his maternal grandparents in Hawaii, and the longing he felt for his father who lived in Kenya. In his high school years, Obama learns a lifestyle of \\"partying\\", drugs, and alcohol. He then comes to the realization that there are certain expectations of him from his family such as getting a great education, defining his own success, and being an upstanding citizen. While in college, Obama began to witness poverty fist hand, and experience racism. This eventually compelled him to focus on how he could make a \\"change\\". From that moment, he finally began to see himself as a man that his father had always dreamed of. Obama graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law School, just as he received the frightening news of his father's unexpected death. Obama never felt the close, father-son connection that he idealized from his father. Following the death of his father, he felt that it was crucial for him to travel to his father's native Kenya. This journey not only helped Obama connect with his paternal roots, but also helped him forge the father-son bond that he had always been longing for from his now deceased father. Indeed, Obama's paternal relatives welcomed him with open arms, and celebrated the return of their native son.<br /><br />The entire novel revolves around cultural identity. Ironically, even though Obama was born biracial, and raised in a white household, he identifies exclusively with his African heritage. From his childhood memories in Hawaii, to the urban life of Chicago, to the buildings of Harvard, and finally in grasslands of Kenya, Obama never lost his self-identity in a society that demanded so much of him.<br /><br />Barrack Obama's graceful and cadence style of writing also offers the reader a preview of his current leadership as the president. He writes from such an intriguingly rich perspective that each sentence is as compelling as it is profound; \\"Dreams from my father\\" diffidently establishes Obama's talent and competence both in literacy and the political sphere. In this book, Obama persuades the reader very convincingly with his own meaning of education, power, resilience, and success by captivating the reader with words that will remain with you long after you've finished the book:  \\"Away from my mother, away from my grandparents, I was engaged in a fitful interior struggle. I was trying to raise myself to be a black man in America, and beyond the given of my appearance, no one around me seemed to know exactly what that meant.\\"<br /><br />While reading this memoir, I felt an instant connection between myself and Obama. Whether someone can relate with Obama's reality as an African-American or not, his memoir is absolutely spellbinding for anyone. In this never put-down, climatic, autobiography, our president takes the reader on a personal journey where the final stop leaves you with a very inspirational outlook on finding success in America.
B0013ND30W|3.0|It seem's like they repackage it I thought I was buying a brand new blu-ray, before they repackage it they took away the only reason I buy disney movies is for the rewards code, but is expected coming from a third party

B0002IQNAG|5.0|What's it about?<br /><br />The bodies of the recently deceased are returning to life and their only resolve is to feast on the warm flesh of the living. In a desperate bid for survival, two SWAT men and a happy couple unite, barricade themselves inside a shopping mall and bunker down. After blocking the mall's entrances and clearing out the zombies, all seems safe and secure. That is until an army of intrusive bikers roll in; suddenly the undead don't seem so bad.<br /><br />Is it any good?<br /><br />With great merit writer/director George A. Romero has been branded \\"Godfather of all Zombies\\". This sequel to 1968's 'Night of the Living Dead' is saturated in gross-out gore, consumerism and plenty of laughs. An epic in the zombie genre and a must have for all horror fans!<br /><br />Best bit?<br /><br />Tom Savini's work as make-up artist is disgustingly awesome!<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />Actual amputees were used for some of the zombie characters.

1612130283|4.0|Love knows no boundaries but it might not be the case in this story. Ana who is all about love, in opposite of Grey who is all about pain is like meshing black and white together and getting a whole lot of Gray or in this case Grey. Its the classic tale of good vs evil.<br /><br />I read a bunch of reviews for this book. And the bad ones made me not want to read it, but I went ahead anyway because all the good reviews made it seem worthy. In all honesty the underlining story of Fifty Shades of Grey was surprisingly good. Granted the writing seemed a bit unpolished and there was a bunch of things that irked me (which is the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5), like the excessive use of \\"oh my...\\", that damn \\"inner goddess\\" of hers who would't shut the hell up, and the word \\"scarlet\\" appearing at least 3 times on every other page. ugh. She did a poor job in depicting the characters ages. They seemed more like in their 40s than 20s.<br /><br />BUT, despite all that I must say I couldn't put the book down because the story just draws you in. There was quite a bit of sexing going that made me want to skip paragraphs. I'm not into the whole erotica thing because the corniness of sex scene dialogue. I got embarrassed just reading it. And I just couldn't help but to imagine the author writing it. lol. But I kind of felt it was necessary for characters' relationship development. But its weird because although the characters seemed a lot older, the sex scenes were described so immaturely.<br /><br />If Christian Bale in American Psycho,  James Spader in The Secretary, and Ryan Gosling in The Notebook had a baby it would be Christian Grey. I developed a love/hate relationship with his character. Despite his BDSM fetish, he was quite likable, maybe even a tad bit lovable. I admit I even got a little giddy at times reading their e-mails. Ana, the innocent quick witted protagonist in the story falls in love with Grey despite his dark side. Her character kind of lacked personality and it didn't really emphasize why he wanted to be with her.  But theres a powerful scene near the end that just got to me, even made me tear a little. Because their whole relationship dynamic shifts throughout into something plausible, worthy of rooting for.<br /><br />Now I didn't know this was a Twilight fanfic until after reading other reviews when I was done with the book. If I had known I probably wouldn't of read it because I hate twilight and know nothing about it. BDSM subject inspired buy a teen vampire story is just wrong. And kinda weird considering the author looks like a middle aged woman. Talk about perversion. But I'm glad I read it. I guess diving in with low expectations really helped because it surprised me with how good it was. And considering that it was originally fanfic I'm sure E.L James wasn't intending this to be some golden masterpiece. I mean how many people write fanfiction and get published then have the amount of publicity this book got. All in all, It was good for what it was. I give the author credit because the story actually had substance. It wasn't just a a bad smutty story about bondage and flogging, Its about trying to see past a major flaw in a person and realizing if its worth giving up your own beliefs that make you who your are just to be with them.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This game is AWESOME.  The only thing bad about it is it SO HARD to earn coins. Other than that it is great!!!!!!!!

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I've been a fan of Stephen King for a long time. It's hard to remember the first novel that I read, but it was either Christine or The Stand (way back in the early 1980's). I was hooked. What's always enthralled me are the characters he creates, who seem like real, live, breathing people that you've met in your own life. 11/22/63 doesn't disappoint in that category. And it's clear that Steve and the folks that support him have done their research; they quite adeptly portray life as it was in the late 50's and early 60's (at least, from what I've heard - I didn't come along until the mid 60's). And I learned a fair amount about Lee Harvey Oswald, particularly about his personal life. I knew he had defected to Russia and returned to the U.S. only a few years later. I knew he was a big fan of Fidel Castro. And I knew his wife was Russian. I didn't know he had children, nor did I know that he apparently beat his wife fairly regularly.<br /><br />This definitely isn't a horror novel. In having the 'obdurate past' that resists the protagonist's attempts to change what happened, King created a rather unique 'villain'. But the plot follows a familiar structure for Steve, in particular the requirement that the protagonist must sacrifice something they care about to win the day. But, I'm willing to overlook that because he's given us an engaging tale that makes you want to read it NOW to get to the end. And what an ending! It didn't entirely surprise me but if your eyes are completely dry at the end, you're not human. Although I guess Jake's would be (you have to read the book to understand that one!).<br /><br />There are a few minor quibbles. Steve clearly doesn't like Dallas. I lived in Dallas for 5 years and would happily do so again. Was it paradise? No, like any town it has issues. But it was a great town to live in; lots to see & do, cheap to live in, and filled with friendly Texans. I also would take issue with his tirade in the Afterword about extremism. Steve, you're right that it can lead to violence, but please point out that it goes both ways. Political extremism on EITHER end of the spectrum can lead to violence and tragedy. Yes, it's a problem in our society today but please don't act as though it's only one group/side that's doing it!<br /><br />Are those quibbles enough for me to downgrade this book? No. Steve's allowed to project his political views and to even infuse them into his writing. To be frank, had he not mentioned the subject in his Afterword I wouldn't have said boo about it; the book itself is not promoting a political agenda. It is an honest portrayal of the U.S. in 1958. (SPOILER) You might be tempted to argue with his 'predictions' of what would have happened had Kennedy not died but I was happy that it wasn't at all the baby boomer fantasy that Vietnam/Nixon/etc... wouldn't have happened if Kennedy had lived.<br /><br />Bottom line: Best time travel book I've ready since \\"To Say Nothing of the Dog\\" by Connie Willis. Which if you haven't read, you absolutely should.

B003TH2LA8|1.0|I thought I would try to watch this first episode, since I loved the books, (at least as far as book #6 or so), but it was very disappointing.  Obviously, they have to condense the story to fit in the episode timeline, but it all happened a little too quickly to be believable.  There was a lot of running back and forth between people's houses and the barrier, and running about in the woods.  The dramatic music and awed expressions from all the characters, every time Richard did anything of significance, such as picking up the sword, was a bit overdone.  And how many times did they say \\"You really are the Seeker!\\", or \\"Spoken like a true Seeker!\\"??

0545425115|1.0|As a parent of three children I'm often shocked at what adults think is \\"important\\" literature for developing hearts and minds. The riveting nature of a novel is not alone what renders it of value. Sadly this book has become required reading for seventh graders in many schools. I am VERY much in favor of FREE SPEACH. I do not support censoring adult material. However, Hunger Games storyline is the most horrific presentation of a Fascist Government demonstrating its total control over its citizens by forcing randomly chosen children to murder oneanother in a yearly public \\"games\\". It is the most desolate, depressing and hopeless presentation (implying this may be our \\"world to come\\")of humanity. In one of our small town middle schools alone, the majority of children are from broken families, many on antidepressants, many who have suffered sexual abuse. Weapons are weilded against fellow students, both the principal and a teacher are arrested for child molesting. So many of our young people are already crushed, struggling with a reason to live at all, starving for some glimmer of hope. Why not require reading that can assist them in imagining and creating a better world, something to bring courage and hope in the face of adversity? Something that will uplift and feed beauty to their young souls?  I am grieved we have come to this place so obsessed with violence and destruction in every aspect of our culture that we no longer retain any remnant of sensitivty much less recognize our world spinning manically out of control. The Hunger Games is rivetting if you are fascinated and entertained by the cruellest acts imaginable.

It is powerful.
B006OGMEUI|5.0|Eluveitie<br />Helvetios<br />A non-historian's take on this concept album<br /><br />Helvetios is a Gaulish/Celtic tribe that used to inhabit the region of Gaul that is now Switzerland, and some of modern-day France. It tells the story of the Gaulish War from the perspective of this particular tribe.<br /><br />1 - Prologue<br />It is years after the Gaulish War and an old man laments those terrible years, what he and his people endured, and how they remember.<br /><br />2 - Helvetios<br />This song describes the rise of the Helvetians. How they became a distinct sect of people from other Gauls. It depicts some of their beliefs, their deities (Succellus, Ogmios, Bricta), and a bit of how their afterlife (Antumnos) plays a role in their lives.<br /><br />3 - Luxtos<br />Luxtos portrays Helvetios for what they were: rich, free, wild, and strong. This is the calm before the storm, the so-called \\"golden age\\" as it was for them when life was about just living, being happy, and enjoying oneself.<br /><br />4 - Home<br />This is an account of the time when the Romans were encroaching on Helvetios. The Gauls had to leave their home and find a new one to avoid being swept into war. On their journey they consider going back, but realize that just isn't possible and they must press on.<br /><br />5 - Santonian Shores<br />Continuing from the previous song, Santonian Shores recounts another event as Helvetios flees the Romans drive them from their land, again. The storyteller looks back and sees his village burning as they wandered into the night in search of a safe haven, leaving their past lives behind.<br /><br />6 - Scorched Earth<br />As the Helvetians travel onward, in search of a new home, they take a look back, the night sky colored red by the fires that was once their home. They are desperate and cold, but they can't turn back, they March on.<br /><br />7 - Meet the Enemy<br />It took the Helvetians twenty days to cross the River Saone, once Julius Caesar learned where they were, he attacked at night while they were burdened, crossing the river.  A quarter of the Helvetians died here. It was this attack against them that changed their viewpoint, and they knew they would have to fight. This was the first major battle of the Gaulish Wars.<br /><br />8 - Neverland<br />The second major battle of the Gaulish Wars was fought at Bibracte. The Helvetians managed to organize a sneak attack on the Roman Legions here, trying to take their baggage train. Ceasar caught wind and retaliated, inflicting severe damage to the Helvetians, driving 130,000 of them to flee, and the rest to die or surrender.<br /><br />9 - A Rose for Epona<br />Epona, the Gaulish goddess of Cavalry, was offered a rose for her protection. This song is about a young Gaulish woman, whom while fleeing the Romans with her kinsmen prays to Epona.  She asks her why she has abandoned them in their most desperate times, and offers a rose for her protection.<br /><br />10 - Havoc<br />This catalogs various attacks against Helvetios by the Romans.  How the Romans were never satisfied and always wanted more, stripping Gaul of it's resources to feed the Roman war machine at the cost of the Gaulish people's blood.<br /><br />11 - The Uprising<br />Finally, the Gaulish people have had enough. This is a call for all Gaulish Tribes to unite against the Roman Legions. To fight for freedom, so that they may once again know peace and not war.<br /><br />12 - Hope<br />This is an instrumental.<br /><br />13 - The Siege<br />The Gauls were losing the war still, so it was time to adopt a new strategy. The united tribes adopted a Scorched Earth tactic and set to deny Caesar of any resources that he may use against them.  The tribes swept the land and any town within the reach of Caesar's army was raised to the ground, denying him much needed supplies.  Avaricum was not, however, burned down, it was thought to be impenetrable. Caesar proved to break Avaricum's defenses his men pillaged, sacked, and raped the town.  Only 800 Gauls of 40,000 survived the siege turning Avaricum into a mass grave.<br /><br />14 - Alesia<br />After Avaricum, the Gaulish Tribes were scattered, leading small cavalry raids against the Romans.  This was not effective and their leader, Vercingetorix called a regroup at the hill-top fort of Alesia. Caesar once again caught on and decided that because Alesia was so well fortified a frontal assault would be a futile effort.  Instead, he built two walls around Alesia completely encompassing the fort, cutting the 80,000 Gauls inside off from supplies - intending to starve them out. Vercingetorix tried to negotiate the release of all the women and children in Alesia so only the fighters remained, but the Romans did not agree, leaving everyone inside to starve.  The deaths of wives and children decreased moral, but a few Gauls managed to escape and send word to the other tribes; in their most desperate hour, the relief force arrived, boosting morale for those trapped within to urge them to fight for another day. Under attack from both sides of the wall, the Romans in desperate measure flanked the relief forces to try to stop them.  It worked, it scrambled the Gauls and they were slaughtered. Witnessing the destruction of their only hope of escape, Vercingetorix surrendered the following day to Julius Caesar. This marked the end of the Gaulish Wars.<br /><br />15 - Tullianum<br />A Tullianum is an underground prison used by the Romans.  After his defeat at Alesia, Vercingetorix was taken prisoner and paraded fro five years around the lands as a monument to Caesar's tactics and victories over the Gauls. He was then taken to the Tullianum and strangled by rope.<br /><br />16 - Uxellodunon<br />Uxellodunon was the last attempt by the Gauls to defend a town against Roman assault. It was well defended, mountainous crags on one side, and rivers on the other. A natural spring on the mountain side suppled fresh water, along with the river on the the other side of town. The Romans, again, decided to cut off supply lines to the town, hoping to starve them, but soon realized they would need to remove their water supply as well.  Setting up siege engines and archers along the river effectively cut off the river as a water supply. The natural spring was harder, but the Romans constructed a ten-story tower filled with archers to fire at anyone using the spring.  The Gauls managed to attack the tower, trying to burn it to the ground.  Caesar then staged a false attack at the gates which made the Gauls withdraw their troops to the walls for defense, allowing the Romans to save the siege tower.  Getting nowhere, the Romans began to dig into the mountain and eventually diverted the natural spring, effectively drying it up.  The Gauls surrendered to the Romans.  Instead of being sold as slaves, Caesar ordered all the survivor's hands cut off and then set free. This was considered lenient and acted as a message to all other Gauls.<br /><br />17 - Epilogue<br />We end with a soft-spoken Gaulish man recounting the years of the war, and how it will be remembered.ed, and raped the town.

B0067Q04AM|5.0|I listened to an interview with Robert Glasper on NPR regarding Black Radio earlier this week. I found this composer to be extremely forthcoming about his intentions. On this album, he seeks to infuse rock/rap into his Jazz background. Critics have said that he no longer is in the genre of Jazz but he fervently defends his stance on jazz, that being it is an ever evolving art and that it is absurd that jazz and rap/hiphop have been kept apart. I liked his metaphor of Jazz being hiphop and rap's father yet never really knowing each other.<br />  Fully intrigued, I jumped on npr.org and listened to the entire album before it got released. I have to say, I was  impressed with the complexity, yet cohesiveness of the sound. So much of it seemed so subtle, yet appropriate.<br />  My mother, who is 55 years old, walked in and asked, \\"is this Jazz\\"?<br />  I explained, and she said \\"jazz shouldn't have those drumbeats\\".<br />  I laughed, \\"yea it's new\\".<br />  It sparked a conversation and ultimately her interest and some appreciation on her part as well.<br />  I believe it stands on it's own, and the fact that it is different well that's just a plus.

0143119680|5.0|A Discovery of Witches was by far the best book I have read in a long time. While yes, the size of the book itself is slightly intimidating, it was a pretty fast read that keeps your attention. I did not want to put this book down, because things just seemed to keep happening. You begin to really connect with each character and become engrossed in their world and stories. I will happily buy the second book and eagerly await its arrival.<br /><br />Diana is a sweet main character that is pulling manuscripts for research. She unknowingly receives one that is spelled and manages to unlock the spell without really trying. No one has been able to call the manuscript out of hiding for hundreds of years. This makes her quite popular with non-humans, since they all want it for some reason and will stop at almost nothing to get it in their hands. Matthew, a vampire is quite an interesting character that has you hoping they will get together.<br /><br />I believe this series could be the equivalent of the Twilight series, but for adults. Though it is better written, has a more interesting story line, and characters. If you begin to read it and are not too interested give it about 1/4th of the way through the book, that is about when I fell in love with it.

0385534639|5.0|This book was AMAZING. It has so many details that you feel that you are actually there while reading. It was so in depth that you can see and feel all of the characters. I have never read a book that I was in love with this much, and I can only hope that the author continues to write such great work. The book is set in the 1800's - 1900's, though I can almost guarantee that you will not be able to tell. It just seems as if she gives enough detail that it feels like home, something you fully understand and are surrounded by in day-to-day life.<br /><br />Celia is the female lead, you will first meet her as a child and watch how she grows into adulthood. Her father places Celia in a long lasting duel with a rival magician's person of choice. Marco, the boy that the rival magician chooses is just as interesting as Celia. You find yourself wanting to know more and more about the rules of the duel, but at the same time you are so enthralled by the masterpieces that the two are creating in the circus. There are way too many characters to name, but you will learn about each of them in the book and each one has their own part in the story.<br /><br />Just do yourself a favor and go purchase this book right now!
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I'm not an audiophile, however I am what I'd call a \\"discerning listener\\". I'm not out to spend $1000 on headphones and buy all my music on CD to rip in lossless format, but I do like my music to be recreated as accurately as I can manage. My general listening is done on the MOG service, which streams in 320kbps MP3 format. Not the highest fidelity out there, but certainly high enough to notice problems with the drivers.<br /><br />The headphones I use, depending on situation, are either Etymotic HF3 (in-ear buds) or Shure SRH-840's (studio monitors), through my Asus Zenbook laptop. The difference between with it and without it are night and day. What you need to realize is that if you turn your computer up to 95-100% volume, it's driving at max capacity, leading to clipping and distortion. Throw an amp on, and suddenly all that clarity and fullness comes through at proper quality, without having to push your device to its maximum capability.<br /><br />I've bought a lot of different audio products over the years, and the E6 was the first that I'd consider truly indispensable. I also clip it onto my shorts at the gym while I listen to music through my Galaxy Nexus smartphone, and whereas normally I'd need to have it turned up the whole way to get the music loud enough, with the amp on I sit around 50-60%, and don't have to worry about the quality dropping. To me, the amp isn't just about making the sound louder, although that's a factor. It's also about being able to make it loud enough without a drop in quality.<br /><br />The battery lasts long enough. I just keep a cable plugged in and whenever I'm not using it, I plug it in. There ARE the multiple settings, but I find them wholly unnecessary. The bass boost sounds, frankly, terrible. With ANY music, that boost makes it muddy and difficult to listen to. The second setting (red light) apparently boosts the mids, which does nothing useful, and the final (purple) setting turns it down a bit. I assume this is for the VERY high end drivers, but I've found no use for it myself. I don't want any artificial EQ going on, that's not what an amp should do. If I want a bass boost I can do that in software.<br /><br />Point being, buy this. It's phenomenal.VERY high end drivers, but I've found no use for it myself.

B003EY7IRC|5.0|Shadowfever isn't as amazing as the first fever series novel, however it follows the path of Mac facing darker enemies and thus becoming more 'dark' herself.  The ending felt a bit abrupt, but that may be because we've had to wait so long with every previous novel leaving us on the edge of our seats with a cliff-hanger ending... and all of a sudden, it's over and done with in shadowfever.  Still, I love the series! They take you away from your ordinary mundane life and let you escape into a world of imagination. Looking forward to the next novel by Moning.

B0078N2MTE|3.0|The concept for this film really sounded entertaining to me and I was very much looking forward to seeing it.  I really enjoyed the acting in this film.  These not so famous actors put forth a great effort and the film moves steadily because of them.  The main characer is done wonderfully and it is a shame this actor wasn't nominated for some kind of award.  I also really liked the story and character development.  It was solid and kept my interest.  The only thing that makes me give this film 3 stars is that I wish there was more to it.  I was very involved with what was going on in the film and the ending really left me wanting it to continue.  I suppose this is a great thing, since they engaged the viewer so profoundly, but I just wish it could have kept going to see how it all would have panned out for the characters.
B006ZBRMOU|5.0|Wow E.L James deserves some praise for this book, as well as the rest of the fifty trilogy. We been given the opportunity to see inside Christian and Ana's world and it was a pleasure. This book is eye opening and jaw dropping with twists and surprises around every corner. E.L. James is one to watch and I cannot wait for her next book (whatever it may be) to come out. I loved the extra scenes at the end replaying a few scenes from fifty's point of view. I hope we hear more from fifty.... Thanks for letting us see a new world through your eyes James!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Most of the novels in this series have the same ingredients, its very detailed and at times this can be a bit dull and boring, but there's also excitement, twists and turns of the plot, and also a lot of characters end up dying.  You would think you'd get used to a major character dying since Martin usually kills at least one of them in each novel.  But I keep feeling surprised when another dies off.  My favorite novel out of the series 'A Song of Ice and Fire' was def the third novel in the series, A Storm of Swords. A Dance with Dragons is just as good, it brings back those characters left off in the previous novel and continues moving forward with the plot halfway through the book.  The ending kind of shattered my world, but I won't spoil it for you.  I highly recommend it, it's a good long novel that will keep you entertained and yearning for more at the end.  I just hope Martin doesn't take long in producing the next installment.

B0036T31YY|4.0|I decided to rent Triangle based on the user reviews.  Many were descibing it has a very thought provoking film.  That peaked my interest, so I decided to see for myself why it was so entertaining.  First off, don't let the cover art for this film throw you off.  Definately looks like it's going to be a slasher/horror film, but it isn't.  I would say that it was very intricate and mind bending.  The concept for the film was interesting and I really liked how they changed my opinion of the main character right at the end.  I would have liked alittle more definition of the story however, just a bit more to beef up the plot and to really help you understand why what's happening is happening.  Nonetheless, it was an ok watch.  If you have an afternoon to waste, I'd say rent it.

B004Q7E0TA|5.0|When I saw Portia on Oprah talking about her struggles she went through when she first started in the acting world, I had to buy this. I can tell you, you will not be disappointed!
B002VPE1WK|4.0|This was absolutely great for me.  Got it when I was going on a Safari in Tanzania and needed something to transport all-in-one my Nikon D90 body, 300mm zoom lens, Kit lens, 50mm lens, my netbook, charging cords, coverter, extra battery, etc etc.  I had more room than I could use.  It was very comfortable to wear travelling such a far distance (32 hours of airport travel one way).<br /><br />I didn't give five stars because I'm not sure how durable this little bag is for the serious adventurer. Upon returning form the trip my shoulder straps were coming undone and completely fraying.  This was a good purchase to use on a one-time safari and the bag is still technically usable but if I was someone going out often and/or using as my primary bag I would be disappointed to have a bag last me only one trip (two weeks).  I had a Jansport backpack in High School that I beat and abused year after year and this never happend to the shoulder straps.<br /><br />The price absolutely can't be beat and I believe you get what you pay for.  I just expected this to last a little bit longer before falling apart.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I like it but for some reason it won't work offline...thus defeating the purpose of having it on a mobile device (kindle fire)
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I hadn't played this before I got it as the faotd. The only add I've noticed is when you first open it, before the start screen. It doesn't really bother me like it does others, but maybe their versions have more than that one add.... Anyway, I am still learning the game, but really enjoy it at this point.
B001974DG0|5.0|This was my second reading of this book and it was just as exciting as the first time. I also saw the movie sometime back and it was very good as well.
B0051HNMTI|5.0|Excellent, quick run through of ab routine anywhere you might be at the time. Especially good for the consultants/road warriors.
B006JV6F1C|2.0|I rented this movie for my kids through the instant video store. The movie itself was great and my kids loved it but the sound quality was horrible. It played fine on my laptop but when I tried to watch it through my roku box on our flat screen the sound was a few seconds off from the movie. Their lips would move and then we would hear what they were saying a few seconds later. I have emailed amazon about this and I have searched all over the website to find out how to fix the problem. It has happened on several different rentals but not all of them.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Plays great on the fire. Great time killer. It's fun to beat the levels and open new games. Five stars.
B00457WZEI|4.0|In this book the story is told by the horse which was a unique experience for me! The book is full of excitement and holds you attention well. A good portrait of the times in which it took place.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|Ash integrates the \\"Customer Development\\" methodology of Steve Blank with the \\"Lean Startup\\" work of Eric Ries in an easy-to-read-and-understand book that gives practical, step-by-step advice on how to refine and launch any new product or company.  It's especially valuable if you use the internet to create, deliver or distribute a product or service.  As an angel investor, I'm now REQUIRING all people who pitch our group to read the book and present a \\"lean canvas\\" summarizing their ideas.  Several have told me how profoundly helpful they found the book.
B004GYY714|5.0|its ok but I still lil it. not lik review review. I thought it would let me listen to wateve I wanted tl listen to. if better than this tell me by writeing a comment.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I've always like this game. This one is even relaxing as you can go as slow as you want or try to beat others timing.  Good to go!
B0063IH60K|4.0|cannot get enough of this game. would be happier if the spider ads would go away. to be honest they do not show up every game played.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|This is an excellent game, with upgrades and a storyline to boot, even the main character has some story/background! One great thing is it gets more challenging throughout the game, and you may even have to restart, and reupgrade your weapons and play mord wisely to be strong enough to beat a certain boss that's troubling you!
B006UKFFE0|5.0|This book contains essential advice for startups. I recommend to read this great book in addition to Customer Development (Steve Blank) and the Lean Startup (Eric Ries). These three books build the perfect foundation to learn how to build a successful startup.
B006G2124E|5.0|Excellent movie, keeps your interest,funny,all around great movie. It's one you can watch over and over. Educational, you can see what life was really like for people.
B004LE7PCM|4.0|I started reading this due to the recent movie and have been very pleasantly surprised by two things.  How good a job they have done on researching for the movie.  And secondly how pleasant a reed the Sherlock collection is.  As it is so topical at the moment it is great fun talking to others about these stories.  I hope you enjoy them.
B000MD7OKY|4.0|This is a pretty good movie if you are looking for the run of the mill catch me if you can type movies.  I have seen much better Hitchcock movies
B006OKOZGU|5.0|This is a legit movie classic, Cary Grant is excellent as always and Grace Kelly is Grace Kelly.  There has never been any one like her since, and never will be.  A must have for your collection if you are into classic movies like I am.

B001E9641K|5.0|My family and I enjoy this game.  In addition to teaching geography, it requires you to remember destinations and requires you to use strategy.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Worth the price.  LOTS of puzzels, not just easy ones.<br />I have the free mahjong and have purchased a few.<br />So far this one doesn't lockup or closeout after three games.
B006ON41FC|1.0|I am only giving this game one star because it has feint on by default.  I see no other purpose in feint than tracking users.<br />also the game harassed me to rate it with 5 stars.  bad customer experience over rules good game play.  thank god I got this as the free app of the day.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I was younger I used to read ALL the time. If I finished a book, I picked up a new one right away. I have not found books to be as thrilling as they used to be, until this one. (Although I am guilty of getting sucked into the Twilight saga).<br /><br />The Hunger Games brought me back to reading and not wanting to put a book down from the first page I was hooked. I've heard good reviews about it and never picked it up until I saw the coming attractions to the movie coming out, and instantly thought I have got to read this book, and I am so happy I did. All I can say is I cannot wait to read the second. (Great to be able to download on your kindle, instant read right under your fingertips!) :)
0553381695|1.0|Okay, I've read the reviews for book 5 and it still continues.  Tolkien only had 3 books + the Hobbit.  J.K Rowling had the Harry Potter series.  but this is a never ending series and I'm stopping after book 2.  As he is a Sante Fe NM native (and I am from the nearby East Mountains), I can tell you he is in it for the money.  Yes, he can write well and Obama promised us the world, but both are liars and only true to themselves.  I wish other writers would write as well as him but it's sorta like herion or meth: kick him now or get strung out reading lies.  No civilization could last the way these books are written - it becomes total BS.<br /><br />That's my opinion and you can follow it or drag on for multiple books and Martin has his Sante Fe mansion paid off.  Stop now and read the other reviews to find out what happens to Sansa, Arya, Jon Snow, Bran, Rickon, and the rest.  For me, I will re-read the Tokien trilogy, find a different series to read, practice classical guitar, and spend any extra time with my kids.  Spending money on over-extended but well-written stories is something I'll do when I find out the series FINALLY ends and I can use my library card to read the rest of the books - I shan't read them more than once.  I don't see myself on my deathbed saying \\"I wish I had read Martin's 3,204 book series more than once.\\"  Dear God man, end the series.
B0051HNMTI|4.0|This is a nice little ab workout app. While it is pretty basic the exercises are good and the instructional videos are well done. The app doesnt ask for excessive permissions and everything has worked well so far.<br /><br />The developer has other apps for different parts of your body but they are 99 cents each. I think he should bundle all these apps together and make one solid excercise app and charge a couple of dollars for it. That would definitely interest me.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a good game for the tablet to have for the times you just need to relax.  worth the free download.

B004RJMUJO|1.0|Why does this app need access to cameras and contacts? These were not part of the previous version. The developer should explain the purpose of these new permissions in the new version. Creepy! I won't upgrade until we know more about this issue.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is very good and fun and I just love everything about it is amazing and so so so fun it is cool

B0050DIWFC|5.0|Far better than Grisham in my opinion. I have seen some reviews that said the story dragged I strongly disagree. I thought it moved very quickly and was definitely a page turner. I look forward to reading more of this authors work and highly recommend this novel if you like court room drama. I thought it was teriffic!
B006ON41FC|5.0|This game is super addictive. it is kind of funny just to kill the squirrel. If you want to find an incredible app buy this.
0385342063|4.0|An antique emerald ring with two diamonds. In a family for three whole generations. So precious it was kept in a special bank vault. And Poppy Wyatt lost it. Yes, her engagement ring is lost! After frantically looking for the ring everywhere, Poppy gives her mobile phone number out to everyone with instructions to call immediately if the ring is found. Then her bloody phone gets nicked! (American translation: Her phone is stolen!)<br /><br />It is a coincidence that Poppy finds a brand new Nokia mobile in the trash bin. Someone threw a phone away! She scoops it up and uses it as her replacement phone, giving the new number out to all her contacts. The Nokia happens to belong to a Personal Assistant of businessman Sam Roxton. She makes a deal to forward all e-mails and messages to Sam in exchange for temporarily using the number.<br /><br />You can really learn a lot about a person by sharing a mobile phone. You can also really judge a person from their inbox too. And so begins the funny and unpredictable story of Poppy and Sam's lives through this one mobile phone number. It's romantic. It's hilarious. It's memorable. It's a must-read for Kinsella fans and chick lit readers worldwide.<br /><br />Sophie Kinsella never disappoints. Her characters are lovable, chic, debonair and hilarious. Poppy became my gullible-friend-in-my-head by chapter five. (And I mean gullible in the most respectable yet honest way.) The story is told in first person with 112 footnotes that really make you relate to Poppy and her way of thinking. She's definitely a favorable character!<br /><br />Favorite Footnote: What is the etiquette when someone's false eyelash is coming off a bit at the edge? Tell them or politely ignore?<br /><br />I've Got Your Number is chosen for the International Book of the Month! It's out now so scurry and pick up or download a copy today.<br /><br />Literary Marie of Precision Reviews
1451627289|4.0|First of all, let me start out by saying that for those who don't know Stephen King that well, this particular endeavor as far as the subject matter, is not your run of the mill Stephen King book.  That aside, I have to say that I really enjoyed the book.  There were parts where I thought there was a lot of rambling and excerpts that didn't need to be there, but I think King is just obsessed with giving the ENTIRE scope--and I do mean ENTIRE--of a character and the story arcs in the book.  I'm reading the new version of The Stand now, and my head is starting to spin, but I will reserve judgment until I finish it.<br /><br />But what would have happened if Lee Harvey Oswald had been assassinated?  Would JFK be alive still if he had?  This is the premise of the book.  Not my favorite book, but intriguing nonetheless.  If this is your first Stephen King book, then you should know that he is out of his usual element this time around.  I would recommend \\"It\\" or \\"The Shining\\" as a point of reference.  Enjoy!
B0051HNMTI|5.0|This is a great workout to do while watching tv, listening to music, whatever. No annoying instructor shouting encouragement. Had the free version and loved it, began to see results in just a few weeks.
0205632645|3.0|The stars rating is for the 50th Anniversary edition, not the content, which everyone knows is fantastic.<br /><br />The thin stiff cover with a stamped gold title on it oozes cheapness.  And while the book itself is also thin (thanks in part to thin paper), its dimensions are a bit of an awkward size.  Its a tad too big to easily fit in a pocket, unlike the paperback edition.<br /><br />I think there would be a sizable market for a nice compact soft leather bound edition of this classic book.  Unfortunately we're still waiting for it.  For now, save your money and get the paperback 4th edition.
B0030IIYYS|5.0|Nothing to complain about this product. It served its purpose, to entertain my daughter during long trips. Good packaging and delivery. Thanks a lot.
1612130283|5.0|Once I started reading, I couldn't stop. I literally read straight through Fifty Shades, Fifty  Fifty Shades Darker, and Fifty Shades Freed from beginning to end (stopping for work and sleep, of course). This book is exciting, comical, HOT and keeps you wanting to read more.
B005K17RU0|5.0|easy to use on the fire, really good for gettinfg a quick forecast just enter your zip and your good to go
B0038P80CO|5.0|There's just something about this one, I'm really not sure what it is, but this one just sticks with you. It was certainly great when I first saw it, as a combination of genres towards which I'm generally indifferent I really don't know what even drove me to it in the first place.<br />But Wow!<br />One of my all-time favorites. Really, just watch it, you'll be glad you did.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|Running Lean is essential reading for anyone involved in a start-up (or an existing business). The book provides a great introduction to current state of the art thinking on building business models that work. Written in a concise easy to read style, the book details tools, tactics and provides a clear methodology you can easily apply.  The book helps guide you through the process of creating a lean business model canvas, how to test your business assumptions using measurable metrics in order to build products and services people want and are willing to pay for. Illustrated with real world examples Running Lean is a must read business book that can actually help you get your business idea off the ground.
B004LROUW2|4.0|1Q84 is one of those books that is hard to summarize and I would actually recommend not reading anything about it and just picking it up and reading it. Basically its the story of two individuals who are lost and alone and their journey to fix this. It's a large book and a bit confusing at first but it makes you want to keep reading to see if you can understand what is going on and then keeps you reading to see what happens to the characters. Its not exactly a slow read at the beginning but for me I became more interested and my reasons to continue reading changed over the course of the book. This was the first work I have read by this author but I didn't find any problems reading this novel (which reviews my fans seem to imply would be the case) and am eager to read some of his other books. The overall story was great and I am just going to accept that some parts weren't meant to be fully understood by me. A few characters seemed to be thrown out and abandoned but as the main characters were taken care of I can ignore this. Overall it was an enjoyable read though the length may be daunting for some especially after the somewhat confusing start but definitely worth sticking with.
B006OFN0SE|1.0|Poor history, terrible movie. Contains just enough truth to make it presentable.<br />Seems to be caught between truth and a fiction.<br />The Hoover I remember was a publicity-seeking racist of the first order,<br />here he only has a few concerns. Waste of money purchasing this<br />DVD. Maybe Mr. Eastwood should consider retirement.

0679736646|3.0|This is frequently listed as among Dick's best, but I prefer the other three of his I've read (Do Androids Dream, Flow my Tears, and Three Stigmata).  Like Ubik, those three books question the nature of reality, but they also go beyond that to provide insights into the human condition.  Ubik is more focused on the philosophical question as to the extent to which our reality is simply a construct.<br /><br />Of course, it is a cool idea for a book, and the book is quite interesting.  This book also has a bit of humor mixed in.<br /><br />On the whole, good but not great.
0060763280|5.0|if you want a better understanding of why there just is not enough money to make it through the money you might want to read this book. It will provide you with a deeper understanding of how things really work when it comes to money and how to live a happier and wealther life.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This is a great book and insight on a person and the development of IT.  It will make you think and have a different view on Life itself and what truly may be important in your Life.  I recommend taking a moment to read and digest this book...42 chapters, but well worth the time and investment to read.
B003ZSH606|4.0|After letting myself digest Jamiroquai's latest album for a few months, I can say with confidence that Rock Dust Light Star, while it has some notable flaws, is well worth its price tag.  Let's start with the most obvious upside: the very first two tracks, \\"Rock Dust Light Star\\" and \\"White Knuckle Ride,\\" alone justify making this purchase.  \\"Rock Dust\\" is held together by a catchy guitar riff, and its vocals have a jaded, melancholy quality that's strangely compelling.  Although its lyrics are sometimes overly pretentious in their atheism (\\"I've never felt I ever prayed / Don't have to join in with the other slaves\\")--and I say this as an atheist myself--they are, in other cases, strikingly clever and memorable (\\"I'm a square pig in a round hole / Maybe there's no place left for my wounded soul / Maybe the King of Kings finally lost control of it\\").  Meanwhile, \\"White Knuckle Ride\\" has a smooth but hectic electronic feel that will readily stick in your head; it is not without reason that this was chosen as the first single from the album.  Both of these two songs are immediately catchy, yet durable, such that they have not become irritating or tiresome to me after many subsequent listens.<br /><br />Unfortunately, after this fantastic start, the songs begin to lag a bit.  There are a few other excellent ones, make no mistake: \\"Hurtin',\\" \\"Blue Skies,\\" and \\"She's a Fast Persuader\\" (the latter being a fairly unmistakable ode to oral sex) are particularly great; but these are counterbalanced by a few of the most cringe-worthy tracks that Jamiroquai has ever produced.  \\"Smoke and Mirrors\\" has my nomination for the worst single line in the album (\\"Well you're damned if you do / And you're damned if you don't / 'Cause your friends don't like his haircut / But he wants your lovin' tonight\\"), while \\"Two Completely Different Things\\" and \\"Never Gonna Be Another\\" strike me as being totally unforgettable and emotionally dry.  Still, my fullest revulsion is reserved for \\"Goodbyeto My Dancer\\" and \\"Hey Floyd,\\" which, whatever their upsides, make use of boring and emotionally uneven Caribbean instrumentation in a way that at once annoys me and puts me to sleep.<br /><br />I probably speak for the minority of my fellow long-time Jamiroquai fans when I say that Dynamite was my favorite album; I couldn't get enough of its hard, synthetic energy, as exemplified by tracks like \\"Electric Mistress,\\" \\"Black Devil Car,\\" and \\"Feels Just Like It Should.\\"  Rock Dust Light Star, the first real post-Dynamite release and also the first album that the band has produced without the constraints of their previous recording contract, has a much slower and more contemplative personality overall.  The quality of its lyrics has improved in some instances while deteriorating in others, and there's a noticeable absence of both experimentally vocal-free songs like \\"Didgin' Out\\" and politically-themed ones like \\"Virtual Insanity\\" or \\"Revolution 1993.\\"  (But then, I never really agreed with Jamiroquai's politics.)  When Rock Dust Light Star is bad, it's bad; but on the other hand, its strongest tracks are in some ways superior to my favorites from Dynamite.  I think that Jamiroquai fans and newcomers alike will be missing out if they don't get a hold of this album and enjoy those few engaging core songs.  Still, I do wish that the album were more of a complete experience, and that I didn't find myself routinely tempted to skip past more than half of its contents.<br /><br />Despite the tough love of my criticisms here, I would be remiss if I ended on a negative note.  Jamiroquai has been one of my favorite bands for perhaps a decade now; their catchy pop/dance/disco/funk/electronica sound, awesome vocals, and inventive wordplay distinguish them from the predictable and genre-bound artists who currently dominate the market.  Even at their worst, they are outstanding, and I'm not convinced that this is their worst title.  If you like Jamiroquai's work, buy Rock Dust LightStar with the understanding that it's something of a mixed bag.  If you have never listened to Jamiroquai, start by buying their last three albums, Dynamite, A Funk Odyssey, and Traveling Without Moving... and *then* buy Rock Dust Light Star.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm a huge fan of The Biggest Loser, and just fell in love with Jillian from watching the show (though I was at first scared of and entirely unsure of her). But her no-nonsense, super-positive attitude and extraordinarily gorgeous body won me over and I decided that I'd try one of her workout videos. I chose this one for no particular reason - it's inexpensive and only a short, 20-minute workout, which as a busy university student, I love. I'm about 5'6\\" and 120-something pounds. Not overweight by any means, but I don't believe you have to be overweight to decide to get (more) fit. I just want to get my heart healthier, build some muscle to get some physical strength, and tone up for my summer wedding. I've been using this DVD for 2 days, and I can barely walk. In a good way! First day was at Level 1, then I went to Level 2. I dread Level 3 a little, but I'm looking forward to working my body up to the point where I want it! I love Jillian's theory about the transcendence of physical fitness: That physical strength translates to mental strength. And when I'm about to quit, she really keeps me going with her words of inspiration. It's NOTHING like working out alone. If you want to simply tone up, or lose a ton of weight (like I really think this workout routine can help you do) - GET THIS DVD. You will thank yourself later.
145162445X|1.0|Waited a long time for this book, thought it would be amazing but I hated it. I feel dumber for having read it. The book should be called the history of cosmology. Too much speculation and not enough hard science. This is how the book reads, scientists thought so and so and goes on to explain... then says scientists found that was wrong and its like such and such then eventually explains how that ended up being wrong. That is why I feel dumber, he put information in my head repeatedly and then was like yeah we found out that was wrong. Basically the whole book he's saying cosmologists have been on the right track but are not necessarily right when it comes to the hard facts.

1588167461|1.0|If there was ever a book that put the interests of Esquire's advertisers above those of its readership, then congratulations Esquire:  you've succeeded with this guide.<br /><br />Given that the book was written in collaboration with Esquire advertisers, chomping at the bit to sell more of their cheaply made products, it is not surprising that the results do little to illustrate the true nature of men's fashion.  For example, the cardinal rule of \\"dress up\\" is not only lacking as the underpinning of the strategies and tactics listed in the book, it is completely missing.<br /><br />Look, if you really want a book that goes into the facts, evidence and logic of how not only to dress for success, but to dress in style, then men, do yourselves a favor:  purchase Carol Jackson's \\"Color Me Beautiful\\" (1987 Paperback...if you can find the hard copy of the book, that's even better), and learn from an expert about dressing with class, elegance and style.<br /><br />Remember:  Esquire is only a magazine and clearing house of advertisers who \\"think\\" they know what fashion sense is all about.  In reality, they don't:  they don't have the experience, the pedigree or the ability to demonstrate any competence, other than what their advertisers tell them to \\"spew.\\"
0439023521|5.0|This book just pulls you into Katniss' world and her experiences in life and the Hunger Games. Very engaging and I love how Peeta's character unfolds. The book is so intense in certain parts I found myself putting it down and pacing before I could move on. Just raw and real and vulnerable. Loved it!
B0050QV0RQ|5.0|This game is great. Brings back memories of old Ultima on the NES. The story is interesting and it can be more challenging towards the end. If you like RPG games get this game.
0439023513|5.0|I had read some of the reviews of the ending before starting the book and was expecting disappointment.. Really I am quite pleased with it other than the fact that there wasn't really closure with one relationship. I am ok with that simply because it just shows the imperfections of relationships and the imperfections of Katniss as well as others. I like the fact it wasn't some well rounded fairy tale with a big \\"happily ever after\\" and all the loose ends tied into a perfect bow! That to me just added more realness to it.<br /><br /> I also like the vulnerability of Katniss and the fact does remain that she was thrown into the games and thrown into a whole world that she didn't want in the first place. So being Mockingjay was never a role she just comfortably stepped into. It was always a struggle on top of all her loss.<br /><br />With all this in mind.. enjoy the third and final book in the series! :)

0143036742|4.0|I happened upon this book at a bed & breakfast where my boyfriend and I were staying to celebrate his birthday. There wasn't time enough to finish it but by the time we left for home, sixty-five pages in, I was already hooked. Luckily, the book was available at my local library.<br /><br />For a comic novel, I didn't find it all that funny; I mean it wasn't a laugh riot. I'm certain I didn't laugh out loud even once.  I certainly didn't find myself rolling on the floor. \\"A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian\\" is far more bittersweet than hilarious, even in its most hilarious moments.<br /><br />But that is what makes it a more powerful novel than you might be led to expect.<br /><br />The basic premise is this: An octogenarian widower decides to remarry. His two adult daughters are aghast. Their father is planning to marry a woman less than half his age, an opportunistic Ukrainian immigrant clearly looking to improve her station in life, enjoy all the material benefits of Western-style capitalism, and attain British citizenship for herself and her teenaged son.<br /><br />And Nikolai's daughters are right: Valentina is a tart with a criminal bent, a thoroughly rapacious creature looking to take Dad for all he's worth. The problem is that Nikolai sees it too...he simply doesn't see it, as do his more rational-minded daughters, as a sufficient reason not to marry the alluringly zaftig, more importantly, large-breasted Slavic blonde bombshell. For supremely rational as an engineer Nikolai may be, he is also a poet, a romantic, and a World War II survivor of both Stalin's communism and Hitler's fascism. He knows what it is to be desperate and terrified to escape a bad situation and he can't help but sympathize with Valentina's plight. And, of course, there are also the large breasts.<br /><br />Most of the humor in the book comes from Nikolai's almost Panglossian rationalization of Valentina's misdoings, his hope, in spite of his Schopenhauerian pessimism, that all will work out in the end, that love will prevail, that underneath those massive bosoms Valentina has a good heart.<br /><br />His feuding daughters, Nadia--the narrator of \\"A Short History\\"--and her big sister Vera are convinced of just the opposite and they form an uneasy alliance to oust Valentina first from their vulnerable father's life and, when that fails and things go from bad to worse to worst of all, get her thrown out of the country entirely. Nadia has always suspected there is more to her family's troubled history and their harrowing escape from the horrors of war-ravaged Europe than she's been told and she's right. Vera knows. Ten years older, she experienced it firsthand, but she won't divulge what it is. As she advises Nadia in rare moments of sisterly candor, the past is best left buried in the past.<br /><br />\\"A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian\\" is a tragicomic novel in the way human life itself is both comedy and tragedy. You scratch the surface and it can tickle but beneath the tickle there can be a universe of pain. As funny as it is serious, as engagingly well written as it is compulsively readable, \\"A Short History\\" is a truly unique novel that manages to be informative, entertaining, moving, and, yes, humorous, all at the same time. I thoroughly enjoyed it.ill work out in the end, that love will prevail, that underneath those massive bosoms Valentina has a good heart.<br /><br />His feuding daughters, Nadia--the narrator of \\"A Short History\\"--and her big sister Vera are convinced of just the opposite and they form an uneasy alliance to oust Valentina first from their vulnerable father's life and, when that fails and things go from bad to worse to worst of all, get her thrown out of the country entirely.

It also has the classic galaga feel to it aswell.<br /><br />The bad... i dont think that the guns were as creative as they could've been. there is 6 guns, but i thought by the next chaoter you would get another 6. Maybe i am expecting too much, but i would like a variety in it.<br /><br />That con isn't enough to take a star out of my review. 5/5
B0002TKFRM|3.0|My comments have mostly to do with the SACD sound, and not the performances here which on this disk are good, though I would not consider them the best or most \\"thrilling\\". After all, one buys a SACD not just for the performance, but for the sound.<br /><br />PERFORMANCES:<br />One may or may not have issues with these performances. Whatever your opinion on this aspect is, nevertheless, they are solid performances of well-known orchestral pieces.<br /><br />SONIC ISSUES:<br />For a SACD (Super Audio CD) one would think they are getting all the advantages the modern SACD format has to offer: extended frequency response, greater clarity, use of multiple channels, and more visceral impact due to the overall better sound capability that's intrinsic with the SACD format. Unfortunately such is not the case with this SACD.<br /><br />This disk is labeled SACD and certainly from a technical standpoint, the audio tracks on this disk are using the SACD format. However, where this disk fails to provide the sonic impact of a truly good SACD, in my opinion, stems from two factors:<br /><br />First, the performances on this SACD, were, according to the notes on the back jacket, originally recorded in three channels using front left, right, and center.  There are no other channels such as surround left/right, or surround rear left/right (applies to a 7.1 setup).<br /><br />So, whether you have a system set up as 5.1 surround or 7.1 surround, all your \\"surround\\" speakers will be totally silent with this disk.  The ONLY \\"surround\\" channel that WILL be active is the front center channel (and of course the front left and right (stereo) channels).<br /><br />The lack of better use of surround channels partly has to do with the era these performances come from: According to Wikipedia.com (do a search on \\"chicago symphony orchestra\\" at the Wikipedia.com site), the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under Fritz Reiner made their first RCA recording in 1954 and went on to make recordings up to 1962 using RCA's triple-channel \\"Living Stereo\\" process. And according to Wikipedia, RCA digitally remastered those recordings and re-released them as CD and SACD. So, from a technical standpoint, that piece of history explains why this SACD disk lacks any use of the surround channels simply because those channels did not exist in the original recordings.<br /><br />The RCA triple-microphone \\"Living Stereo\\" process is reminiscent of the Mercury \\"Living Presence\\" series that was very popular in the same period. Mercury Record's philosophy was to record performances in a very straightforward, clean way, without banks of microphones and hundred-channel mixers, so common with Columbia Records and the post-performance mixing and other electronic manipulation that was prevalent, and still done today.<br /><br />Similar to the RCA \\"Living Stereo\\" series, Mercury Records also used not more than three high quality microphones, strategically placed so as to capture an ideal combination of direct sound and the ambience of the hall. In fact, Mercury Records excelled in this type of recording which frequently surpassed the RCA Living Stereo records.<br /><br />I also own a good selection of both the original Mercury Living Presence vinyl disks and many of the same releases that were transferred to CDs.  I would add that not all of the CD were as successful sonically as the original vinyl versions. However, I mention Mercury records because of the similarity to the RCA Living Stereo philosophy.<br /><br />As with the RCA Living Stereo, the Mercury Living Presence recordings were landmarks for their day and still hold up very well, as do these RCA Living Stereo recordings, on today's audiophile equipment and speakers.<br /><br />More to the point, though, with this particular RCA Living Stereo recording, it would have been possible, during the digital remastering and transfer process for the SACD release, to derive ambiance information and utilize the surround channels for ambiance information.<br /><br />I suspect deriving ambience for the surround channels was not done either because it was not considered important at the time (perhaps not even considered), or perhaps because the existing recording, which hints at a certain amount of what sounds to be a bit of artificial ambiance in it's front channels, would have \\"detracted\\" from the finished product in the opinion of the engineers or producer.<br /><br />Whatever the reasons, it's hard to say why surround channels were not utilized in this remastered RCA SACD. And unfortunately, the back of the disk jacket gives no clues whatsoever regarding the remastering of these recordings.<br /><br />The second reason, in my opinion, has to do with the microphones available at the time. Good, high-quality mics certainly existed back in the 50's and 60's, but they can't compare to more modern mics in terms of frequency response and the incredible dynamic range they are capable of.<br /><br />Many of the compositions on this disk use the full range and scope of the symphony orchestra with heavy dependence on the percussion section. While the quality of the percussion, as recorded on this disk, is good, it does lack the impact and timbral accuracy better recordings of these compositions can demonstrate. Some select modern CD recordings of these same compositions render percussion with more accuracy than is conveyed on this disk.<br /><br />However, what is quite good on these transfers is the clarity of details in the musical texture and more importantly, a more realistic relative scale of instrumental sections, something that is frequently very badly conveyed with many recordings, even modern ones.<br /><br />For example, many regular CD recordings will fall short with how they convey a full brass section as compared to other sections. A lot of this \\"scaling\\" issue has to do with how the performers were recorded, where the mics were placed, and how the final mix-down was made all of which can dramatically alter, for better or worse, the final results.<br /><br />But such details are impossible to know just from listening, so one can only render a final determination on the basis of the final product and listening.<br /><br />MY RATING:<br />I gave this disk three stars out of a possible 5 because of the above issues. This is not a bad disk by any means and you will no doubt enjoy it. But I have these same compositions on regular CDs recorded with better modern recording methods and they are truly impressive with more visceral impact that this SACD provides.  Another SACD in the \\"Living Stereo\\" series available from Amazon,\\"Scheralazade\\", also performed by the Chicago Symphony, is considerably better sonically... if you have a good surround sound system and SACD player, that disk is one you definitely will want as part of your collection.I mention Mercury records because of the similarity to their recording philosophy. As with the RCA \\"Living Stereo\\", the Mercury \\"Living Presence\\" recordings were landmarks for their day and still hold up very well, as do these RCA \\"Living Stereo\\" recordings, on today's audiophile equipment and speakers.<br /><br />However, with respect to this particular RCA recording, it would have been possible during the digital remastering and transfer process to derive ambiance information and utilize the surround left and right and/or the surround rear left and right for that ambiance information. But I suspect it was not done either because it was not considered important at the time (or perhaps was not even considered), or perhaps because the existing recording, which hints at a certain amount of what sounds to be a bit of artificial ambiance in it's front channels, would have \\"detracted\\" from the finished product in the opinion of the engineers or producer. It's hard to say why without further information and the back of the disk jacket gives no clues whatsoever regarding the remastering of these recordings.<br /><br />The second reason stems more from the original recordings and what went into them in terms of the placement of the mics and more specifically, the actual mics used. Good, high-quality mics certainly existed back in the 50's and 60's but more modern mics, when properly placed, are able to pickup the impact of a bass drum, and percussion in general, in a way that mics from the 50s and 60s simply could not simply because they did not have a response down to 20 hz (and lower) as more modern mics are capable of.<br /><br />Many of the compositions on this disk use the full range and scope of the symphony orchestra with heavy dependence on the percussion section. While the quality of the percussion, as recorded on this disk, is good, it does lack the impact and timbrel accuracy better recordings of these compositions can demonstrate, even very good regular CD recordings render percussion with more accuracy than is conveyed on this disk.<br /><br />However, what is quite good on these transfers is the clarity of details in the music and a more realistic relative scale of instrumental sections.

0385342063|4.0|I was not a big fan of the shopaholic series. I found it a bit too stereotypical for city-girls, too much like sex and the city type of story... however, this was interesting. The main character Poppy is in a crisis because she lost her engagement ring!  (How many times have you accidentally lost your ring, or almost lost it when doing some dishes etc... Me once!!! and so I was right away empathetic to this Poppy character. I know how awful it feels when you have lost something valuable that you appreciate and that is hard to replace.)<br />But this was not all: she also lost her cell phone, and can't call anyone.  But then she finds another phone in trash... right.. how many times you will find a phone in a trash??? (not so likely) .<br />That's when the plot gets a twist and without telling you the details what happens next with her friends and her future inlaws....<br /><br />This is a great book for someone who likes chick lit and also light romance reading...

He knows more about how to play REAL blues than some who post reviews.

1891252089|5.0|I have other books on the practice of Ashtanga yoga. This is the best. The other reviewers have covered the book's excellence. I'll reiterate that it's clear, it's detailed, and it includes abbreviated sessions for those whose time is limited. I have also had the pleasure of being at a workshop led by K. Pattabhi Jois, the founder of the system, and David Swenson, the author, was a few mats down from me. I have seen him in person, I have his DVDs and I can vouch for his mastery. He is also a great teacher who underscores the importance of working at your capacity to avoid injury. Ashtanga is a very athletic and beautiful practice to watch, but the importance is the inside of it, and Swenson helps you work with that. You probably cannot learn Ashtanga from any book or DVD but, if you have a good teacher, this book will be a great tool. I also recommend his DVDs.

0553386794|3.0|A Game of Thrones, George R. R. Martin<br />Part 1 in A Song of Ice and Fire series<br /><br />A Game of Thrones, part 1 in George R.R. Martin's series, A Song of Ice and Fire, has been compared to both The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. Being a fan of both of those series, I looked forward to beginning Martin's. After reading the first book, I can understand the comparison to Tolkien's work, but find the comparison to Harry Potter a stretch (except for the fact that both are fantasy series told over the course of 7 books). Comparisons aside, I did enjoy reading A Game Thrones, and plan to continue the series.<br /><br />The book is told from the perspective of many different characters, which each chapter being told by a different person. At times, its 700 pages are very unwieldly and difficult to follow with all the bouncing from character to character and plot line to plot line. The action is also slow to get started, but by the end of the book the plot lines have begun to converge and the characters to thin out as many are killed off. The appendix is very helpful in keeping up with all the different characters and families presented in the book.<br /><br />I was expecting, largely from the comparisons to Lord of the Rings, more of a magical, fantastical novel with elves, sorcerers, and all manner of other imaginary beings/creatures. I found, however, that this book reads more like a King Arthur type of fantasy with kings and queens, lords and ladies, bold knights and even bolder traitors. It is not until the end that we start to see more elements of magic and fantasy, as well as more action. If you can make it to the last 100 - 200 pages or so (as I said it is a very long book and parts of it are slow moving) it is that portion of the book that gets you excited about the series and eager to read book 2, A Clash of Kings. In fact, I have already checked it out of the library and have it waiting to be opened and read.

0553381695|3.0|A Clash of Kings, George R. R. Martin<br />Part 2 in the series A Song of Ice and Fire<br /><br />A Clash of Kings, book 2 in George R.R. Martin's epic series A Song of Ice and Fire, is another massive book told through the eyes of many different characters. It is not really a stand-alone book, you really need to have read part 1, A Game of Thrones, to really understand what is going on. Much of it is told by some of the same characters that we met in the first book, although we do get to see the perspective of some new characters that were only hinted at before.<br /><br />Like book 1, this part of the series can get a little confusing by the bouncing from character to character and plot line to plot line. Maybe even moreso than book 1, as the chapters told by particular characters seem to be spaced further and further apart. Again, the appendix with its lists of characters, their families, and the connections between the families is a big help.<br /><br />This book continues the fascinating action of the series, with 4 kings vying for complete control of the seven kingdoms. It also fills in some of the history leading up to the present and why each king feels that it is his claim to throne that is legitimate. This book continues with the King Arthur feel, but we finally start to see more magic and more magical creatures with more plot lines containing sorcerers, dragons, and the mysterious \\"Others.\\" Again, Martin's strengths as a storyteller are most prominent towards the end of the novel, leaving you with a strong pull towards, and anxiety for, the next installment in the series, A Storm of Swords.

0385534639|4.0|The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern is a beautifully written (and edited - an often forgotten element of a good book), captivating story of magic and love. I've seen it classified as a sci-fi fantasy, but like Audrey Niffenegger's The Time Travelers Wife, it doesn't feel like a sci-fi fantasy. I have also seen it described as a literary / fantasy or literary / sci-fi hybrid, which I guess is a better description, although still unsatisfying. To me, it read more like a lovely, extended fairy tale. It is a book about imagination and dreams and the possibilities they possess.<br /><br />I give this novel 4 stars, but only because it circles, doubles back, and meanders through time much as the black and white paths of the circus itself wind their way through the various tents. It can get a little confusing, especially if you have can only read in small snatches of time. It is really the type of book that you should immerse yourself in and read in a few long stretches (or all at once if you have that kind of time and endurance!) Then you should let it float and shimmer - yes, I mean shimmer not simmer - a while in the back of your mind before putting on a red scarf (you'll have to read the book to find out why!) and reading it again. I bet, when I read it again I'll find new tents and bits of magic that I missed the first time around. Too bad I already returned it to the library; I guess I will have to put it on my list of books to purchase and keep.
0439023513|1.0|The Hunger Games.  Probably ranks among the top 5 best books i've ever read.<br />Catching Fire.  Amongst the top 20.<br />Mockingjay?  This book was a complete and utter dissapointing ending to the book.  I'm not sure what happened, maybe Collins had a deadline to reach that didn't seem plausible for her, so she speed-wrote the book with no regard for the characters?<br /><br />Katniss was a powerful, headstrong girl. In this book, she's an emotionless pawn who just watches her friends get killed off by all these unrealistic (if you can see what i'm saying there) death ploys.  Collins seemed to really hate the characters in this book.<br /><br />Killing off Prim and Finnick? I didn't even realize that either one had died until i read it, word for word, in the next chapter.  I had no clue that that's what was going on.  I just thought it was another meaningless page in the book, of which there were many.<br /><br />Peeta's brainwashing was completely pathetic.  That was one of the worst-written parts of any book i've ever read.  I didn't understand why they couldn't have just done it over and filled Peeta's head with the memories he already had.  I think Collins references this in the book; but blows it off for some non-apparent reason to keep the plotline going.<br /><br />Overall, i'd call a redo on this one and write a new ending to the trilogy.  You had me on edge for A WHOLE YEAR, Collins.  And that year of dreaming of a perfect ending by one of the best authors of our time is blown away.<br /><br />Oh, and the thing that got me the most? Gale.  Gale was meant to be an instrumental part of the triangle, but in this book, Collins does everything in her power to push him away. It was one of the worst-drawn triangles that i've ever seen.
0143038419|5.0|Eat, Pray, Love by Elizabeth Gilbert is, simply put, one of the best books that I have ever read. It is one of those rare books that I can read again and again, always finding some new inspiration or bit of humor, often in the same sentence. I first read it a few years ago, and recently watched the movie - which is actually quite good - and decided to read it again before reading the sequel, Committed.<br /><br />This is an everywoman's memoir. Ms. Gilbert experiences a wide range of emotions through the course of the book, and discovers that it is ok to fully experience all of them. After a long, painful divorce and the equally painful ending of a great love affair, she decides to take a year to experience the extremes of pleasure and complete devotion and to then try to find a balance between the two. She does this by living four months in what she affectionately calls \\"the three I's:\\" Italy, India, and Indonesia.<br /><br />Gilbert, for no practical reason that she can name, has always wanted to learn Italian simply for the beauty of the language. So she begins to study the language and discovers that she loves it, and she also discovers that when you find things that make you feel happy, you should not feel guilty or selfish about it. From this love for the language comes a decision to visit the country that is known for its indulgence in all things pleasure, especially food. And during her four months in Rome, Gilbert learns how to loosen up the ties of American Puritanism and actually allow herself to fully enjoy the language, the food, and the friends she makes there.<br /><br />The second stop of her journey is her Guru's ashram in India. This takes her from one end of the spectrum to the other as she begins a quiet period of meditation and prayer. At the ashram, they get up before dawn to chant, meditate, and pray before breakfast. Then they spend the rest of the day in spiritual studies and selfless work around the ashram (Gilbert is assigned floor scrubbing duties), with more praying and meditation thrown in as well. They eat a vegetarian diet that is quite different from the rich pastas and desserts that she enjoyed in Italy. But this life of devotion allows her to explore both the highest and lowest points of her existence, and also to connect with God, the divine love that is both within and without.<br /><br />Finally, Gilbert travels to the small island of Bali in Indonesia. She is actually returning there to study with Ketut Liyer, a medicine man she met two years earlier while in the midst of her divorce. He predicted many of the things that came to pass in her life, and also predicted that she would return to Bali. This leg of her journey is her attempt to reconcile the two extremes that she had already experienced and find a balance between the two. And she discovers that with the help of Ketut, a traditional Balinese healer and divorcee named Wayan, and a very self-indulgent group of expats, a balance can be forged between the two. She also blessed with the gift of love, and the courage to fully embrace it without giving up her self.<br /><br />While in Italy, Gilbert and her friends have a conversation about how each city and each person have their own words. For Rome, the word is sex, for Stockholm it is conform, and for New York it is achieve. After much thought, Gilbert finds that her word is antevasin, a Sanskrit word meaning \\"one who lives at the border.\\" As clichéd as it may sound, the word for the book Eat, Pray, Love is inspiration. I feel a connection to Elizabeth Gilbert in that I have always thought there must be some sort of middle ground between the pleasures of life and the blessings of God (a middle ground that many religions would deny exists). I have struggled with depression and guilt between the two extremities for years. I have felt too guilty and self-conscious to indulge in the things that bring me even a small measure of joy. But through her studies, experiences, and unique brand of spirituality, Gilbert has given me inspiration and hope, and has taught me that \\"when you sense a faint potentiality for happiness after such dark times you must grab onto the ankles of that happiness and not let go until it drags you face-first out of the dirt - this is not selfishness, but obligation. You were given life; it is your duty (and also your entitlement as a human being) to find something beautiful within life, no matter how slight.\\" I haven't figured out what my word is yet, but after reading this beautifully moving memoir, I think I am well on my own journey to finding it.

055357342X|5.0|A Storm of Swords is part 3 in George R.R. Martin's series A Song of Ice and Fire. And while the first two books, A Game of Thrones and A Clash of Kings were engaging enough to keep you reading to the end and then picking up the next book, they are just \\"good\\" books(as in  3 or 3 ½ stars) . A Storm of Swords, however, is where Martin comes into his own as a master of the epic saga (5 stars).<br /><br />The book continues in the same style as the first two, with each chapter being told by a different character. In the earlier books, this style slowed them down by making them somewhat confusing to follow at times. But in A Storm of Swords, it actually helps to propel the book forward and difficult to put down as the end of each chapter leaves you breathless with anticipation for that character's next chapter to come up. Then by the end of the following chapter, you are just as breathless over that character. This is one of those rare books that you could just sit and read in one sitting, if it weren't 1100 pages long (in paperback) and you didn't have any interruptions. This installment in the series is set apart because Martin has finally mastered the art of parallels - the plots and timelines of the various characters are woven together in a much tighter mesh, and the parallels between them are simply stunning. I love how Martin can take something as simple as a song (most memorably The Bear and the Maiden Fair) and by simply having it sung by various characters throughout the book remind you of earlier chapters. And while it is short on romance, this book contains elements of every genre imaginable - historical fiction, sci-fi/fantasy, humor, and even horror. I found myself crying, laughing, shrinking in horror at some of the more brutal scenes, and trembling with fear over the scary parts. Martin also does a magnificent job of turning the different story lines on their heads and keeping you guessing. The plots are anything but predictable as established, well-liked characters are killed off and more minor characters are brought to the forefront. There are even times when you find that you are suddenly sympathetic towards what originally seemed to be very unlikable characters.<br /><br />I simply cannot think of words to describe how exceptional this book is. As far as the series goes, you really wouldn't want to read it without having read the first two, but if you can make it through them (each book is massive with over 700 pages in the hardback editions) then you will fly through this one. I don't know if I can stand the wait until I can get the next book, A Feast for Crows.

B004RKXNDU|5.0|Wanted to read the book before seeing the movie.  This is my first John Le Carre book and at first I found it a little slow, but quickly found myself sucked into the world of George Smiley and the underbelly of secret agents.<br />Pure enjoyment and escapism, with well developed characters.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|If it is possible to apply lean principles, which is true for most businesses, this is the book to read. It is amazingly scientific. No things like \\"you have to be innovative\\". This is a step by step guide on how to go on with your business. I have read many books on entrepreneurship and I like this one most, because it is to the topic, step by step and \\"scientific\\" (how to approach the business, how to validate your assumptions, how to not get drunk by your own idea).<br /><br />If you are unsure, watch some of Ash's workshops on youtube. You will instantly realize how is this book different.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is just amazing... I borrowed it from the Kindle library (Yay Prime!) for free, but I would easily recommend buying it if you don't have a Prime membership.  I read it until midnight last night, and when I woke up at 6 for work I read another couple of chapters before even jumping in the shower.  That's how this book is.  Free up some time, people, because you're going to be reading like some Wool-Addicted crackhead.
1423140591|3.0|Riordan creates some pretty good characters so why does he persist in writing about Percy Jackson? The Kane family is an attempt but the characters in The Heroes of Olympus far outshine Sadie and Carter. However this time I almost detest Percy, the other five developed characters are much more interesting than he is and I see no leadership qualities in him that make him better than they are, at least in the amount of space developed in him. In his previous series, P. J. and the Olympians he was good but I do not think he comes close in \\"The Heroes of Olympus.\\" Riordan is up to his old tricks, combat is almost continuous and things look bad for our heroes but Riordan can pull deus ex machina at any time to rescue whomever he wishes or have them have some knowledge or ability either forgotten or concealed but used now as needed, how juvenile can you get? I agree he does seem to have some semblance of a plot but it is pretty well disfigured, but, well, it is juvenile. I shall continue reading and hopes he returns to the level of some of his previous work.
B0063IH60K|5.0|brief pop ups you can skip are a reasonable inconvenience for this great solitaire app. nice movement and I really like the option to be dealt a winnable game.
142311339X|3.0|Riordan writes child's books. As such it is necessary to descend to his level, or is it? If you descend to his level, you have wiped out the need for the book, I shall return to that statement shortly. Another level, an interesting one, is on the basis of comparative religion. Here fantastic vistas open before our eyes, Teutonic, Christian, Muslim. Hebrew, Egyptian, Hindu, Chinese, and perhaps hundreds of others, assuming animistic religions are different depending on the animals worshipped and their meanings. We see the need for good and evil, the relationship between Gotterdamerung, God and Satan (both Christian and Hebrew), and the questions they arouse. Some are compatible with present day beliefs, some have been modified to do so, and some do not support modern day science, such as those religions supporting magic, for example. Now to return to Riordan. In his Olympic books, all gods, and goddesses, if they fall from favor disappear and what they stand for decays in power,as belief and worship wanes. But the other gods and goddesses do not suffer. So advance to Riordan's present books, gods fight with other gods, but the world goes on, in fact those not practicing that religion do not know anything is happening. So the teutonic gods foght with the Giants, some one wins but who knows? Nothing has changed because they have no following. Just look at te Hospice of the Gods of the Egyptians, the gods disappear but no one knows except the hospice caretakers. So it will have to be in the modern version. Zeus, jupiter, Juno, Hera, Mars and Venus, Aphrodite and Ares, Mercury and Hermes, the Titans and the Giants, let them  fight; they hurt no one but themselves and those selfish few who have attached themslves to the combatants retinue in hopes of improving their status can gain nothing. Riordan  may try to hide this, after all he is writing juvenile books and he can pull juvenile tricks such as disregarding his own writings to create other possibilities but an adult should be able to see such pitiful attempts and disregard them as he sees fit. Certainly it should at least destroy all attempted suspense. Read the books if you enjoy such juvenile tricks.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|Running Lean is the closest thing you will find to a 'how to' guide for starting a business. There is no instruction manual out there but this is about as close as it gets. Would absolutely recommend. I'd also recommend signing up for Ash's newsletter at [...]

I love Heloise even thou i got mad at her at times and loved them going from New York to Paris and Rome and back. some reviews said it wasnt romancing enuf but it was it had character and romance. I am not a romancy romancy reader but i love a good story about the perfect romance esp since this poor guy Huges got the shaft in his first wife.

006197806X|3.0|I believe this is the first time in which I am delighted for such a cliffhanger ending! I tell you, the ending made my day, truly! and without a doubt, Oliver writes beautifully. But Pandemonium was a bit dragging on the first half. Things picked up on the second half but it is still not enough. Unfortunately for me, Alex being a flimsy shadow in this book is a blow I found so hard to take.<br /><br />Lena has grown to be a warrior, courtesy of the harshness of the Wilds. She became hardened by her uncomfortable new life and hateful by Alex's demise. It was not the life she intended to live when she ran to the Wilds. It was a good thing that Oliver did not shelter Lena's character too much. She developed Lena dramatically. Lena has to make the toughest decisions in order to survive. The one thing I did not like: Lena succumbed early to grief without assessing the facts. Is it less painful for her to accept that Alex is gone than finding a way to know what really happened to him?<br /><br />I think the concept of DFA is unnecessary. The dystopian element is not as direct as I expect it would be. It is more like delving with the effects of a society hell-bent on maintaining order despite the impending chaos.<br /><br />Pandemonium is very far from Delirium's delivery. It is not a personal favorite but I urge Delirium fans to read it still. I am a fan of Alex so naturally, I am resentful of this sequel. Requiem will decide whether I will love this series or not. So Ms. Oliver, I am sincerely hoping you do not disappoint me for I am majorly invested emotionally with your series. By the way, that ending: I freakin' love it! Serves you right, Lena. *snickers*

I have it on my android phone(Samsung Galaxy S) and on my ipad 2, and with the cloud service no matter which device i'm using I can always pick up where I left off from the other device.

B006QVRVJK|4.0|Adapted from an acclaimed play by Yasmin Reza, Roman Polanski's film CARNAGE is a darkly humourous tale of two happily married couples being gradually unmasked. After their son whacks another boy on the playground, Kate Winslet and Christoph Waltz visit Jodie Foster and John C. Reilly. What is meant to be a brief social call, where the parents discuss their children's conflict amicably, turns into a hell for everyone involved. In spite of their goodbyes and promises to arrange a later meeting, Winslet and Waltz can't seem to leave. And every time they are called back to a cup of coffee or a piece of cake, the tension in the room is higher and higher. CARNAGE expresses Sartre's view that hell is other people, but it also shows that hell is ourselves when we can't manage to get away from a stressful situation and regain composure.<br /><br />This is an elegant film which retains the simplicity and intimacy of its theatre origins. With a script stripped to the bare essentials, it has no other goal that to display the interaction between four characters over an 80-minute span, and in this it succeeds nicely. The only weakness, is Foster's performance, which rises too abruptly to hysteria and sometimes seems forced, and it's a bit hard to swallow that John C. Reilly's character is married to Foster's. Nonetheless, I found this a worthwhile black comedy and I laughed a lot.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This is a very clean app, runs perfectly, graphics are very clear and easy to see on my Droid2.  The story line is a fun addition, but the game stands on its' own without it.  I really enjoy playing this one.  Good job, developers.

I use autodesk products professionally for industrial and marine design, but my wife was looking for a sketch app for fashion design and this is awesome. It may take autodesk a little while to work out the minks but they always come through. I would recommend this app to professionals, anyone looking for a quality drawing app or for those that just want to Doodle. For the price it just can't be beat.
B004MYFOEW|1.0|To my great disappointment, the Kindle edition is simply a Guttenberg Project text, complete with their copyight notices prohibiting commercial distribution.

I will be informing Guttenberg project about this - they are being ripped off.

B0051HNMTI|2.0|Might be better if put together as a package and charge about 3 dollars. The whole paid series costs 5 dollars in total. That is a little too much for a full workout app, 3 dollars would be more appropriate. Nobody just does their arms or legs that I know of. Would be more saleable as an all comprehensive workout app. People would buy that more than bits and pieces of a workout if it was good enough. The videos are good and I like the small size of the app compared to what you are getting.<br /><br />The free versions only, not this one, do require full access to the net, phone state and identity to get your phone number and serial number, and access anything they want off your SD card files with the ability to read and write to the SD. The paid versions of all the apps do not have the permissions. Somehow I feel a little bothered by that. Ads in the free versions with net access to show ads is not that bad. Just bothers me on what they doing with the info on customers phone IDs and numbers and things off of the SD card that wanted to try out their apps before paying. Just makes you wonder about the integrity of the dev here asking for more than ads and net access for a free app. At least the paid versions do not have this, so you have options to fork out the cash for each app in the series if you wanna dance with the data miner wolves but also keep them at bay so they dont bite you.

0606231722|4.0|For those who don't know by now, this book is a collection of 1st person accounts.  Effectively it's a cohesive short story collection that maps the Zombie Apocalypse.  So rather than falling in love with one character and tracking them through, Brooks gives us a dozen interesting characters to love, hate, root for and hope get eaten.  The style is unique enough that I recommend the book to friends and coworkers just for that feel alone.<br /><br />Being a very solid zombie tale itself, without spending too much time trying to science-ize zombies, makes it also an interesting read.
B002SW8Y2E|4.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend and I have to say from the first page I was hooked!  The book takes you on an exciting, frightening journey with some good twists and turns with a climatic ending.  If you are looking for suspense this book is for you.

B002JCSRKC|4.0|I love these boots!  My co-worker (an unfashionable male) saw them for the first time, and told me the boots looked weird.  I just smiled...what does he know!  I have muscular calves (about 16 - 17 inch circumference) and these size 10 boots fit!  I can even wear them with skinny jeans, and they look so New England-ish with a long sweater.  And yes, these boots are a little stiff, but I can deal with it because they keep my feet dry!!  These boots are not made with lots of glue, which allows for leaks and soggy socks.<br /><br />The boots may keep you dry, but not warm.  They are not lined, so truly cold, rainy winter days may end in cold (albeit dry) feet.  I have not had any problems in this area, but then again the coldest temperature tested in these boots was like 40 degrees C.  I came to Amazon looking for a nice pair of Hunters or Kamicks, but I fell in love with the Crocs!  Many colors to choose from and they are relatively inexpensive.  Why pay $100 - $200 for a pair of boots that may or may not leak (check the reviews for those) when you can purchase 3-4 pairs of Crocs for the same price ...and exploit your inner rainbow!
0399159029|4.0|I liked this book a lot.  I was thinking at first that the author was going off into so many areas that didn't have anything to do with a mystery, but that was definitely not so.  I have several friends who have been urging me to read Rhilip Kerr mysteries so I finally took the plunge.  This was really good and different, but it did have some very dark elements to the story simply because of the time in which it was set.<br /><br />Bernie Gunther has every right to be depressed.  He's just recently completed a military assignment in Russia where he has seen the wholesale murder of Jews by the German military.  In fact, he actually participated in some of those horrific acts of rounding the people up and then being present and participating in their deaths.  When he is able to get back to Berlin and start doing police detective work again he welcomes anything that will take his mind off what he witnessed in Belorussia and anything that might take his mind off committing suicide.  He spends his nights contemplating exactly how he could kill himself.  While investigating the apparent murder of a man who was eventually run over by a train Bernie is later able to rescue a woman being attacked in approximately the same location.  Maybe by working on the case, tweaking the noses of the officials in the police department, and enjoying the company of a beautiful woman Bernie will find a way to put off that suicide one more day.<br /><br />As you can tell from my synopsis of the plot, this is a very dark mystery.  It takes place during parts of 1941 and 1942 and travels from Berlin into newly occupied Prague which the Germans will no longer allow to be called Czechoslovakia.  In the wake of the German victories people are not even allowed to keep the names of their own towns or countries and citizens are rounded up wholesale for slaughter.  The Author's Notes at the end of the story let you know that many of the people you have been reading about were real people and the incidents of terrible inhumanity were actually true.  I have to tell you that it made for a rather depressing reading experience and yet the author created such complex characters and political situations that I really couldn't stop reading.  I understand that this is the eighth story in this series and I almost wish I had read at least the first one before I tackled this.  There are references to past people and events which, while I could understand they were from different novels, would have probably made a little more sense to me if I had been more familiar with the series.  I jumped into the series with book number eight and survived, you can too.  I must say though that the author had Bernie be such a flagrant anti-Nazi that it seemed to me that he went a little too far with that concept.  I understand that Bernie did not agree with the policies being put into existence, but would a citizen really have been allowed to speak so openly and plainly to Gestapo officers and to the SS Generals he met during his investigation?  The privations and hardships of Berliners were so vividly described that I couldn't help but feel sorry for them until I realized all the horrors their fellow countrymen were engaged in.  The atmosphere of this novel is exceptional.

B0030Y11XS|1.0|While belittling capitalism, Mr. Moore has sure made a lot of money from it.  Mikey likes socialism/communism, where-in, the government decides how much money you should have and takes the rest away to give to others who have less.  Mikey needs to move to a socialist/communist country so that much of his money can be taken away and redistributed, instead of staying here and getting rich off of that old devil capitalism.<br /><br /> The problem with Mikey's beloved socialism is that the entrepeneurs and go-getters quit working hard because it's just going to be taken away.  Besides, they can make a good living just letting the government take it away from some other dummy who is stupid enough to work hard.  socialism/communism usually doesn't work too well because the incentive to work has been removed, examples, Greece, Russia, Cuba.<br /><br /> Mr. Moore, please move to one of those socialist/communist countries you admire so much, they would love to redistribute some of that money you made from the old devil capitalism.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Believe me when I say that I read A LOT of books and this book is one of the best contempirary novels I've read in a long time. Suzanne Collin's writing is similar to JK Rowling in that it gets you right into the story. At first when I read the summary I grugingly thought \\"Hasn't this type of post apocalyptic story been overdone?\\" but still I went ahead and bought the book. I'm so glad I gave the book a chance and I am not dissapointed. MOST PORTANTLY: THE DIALOGUE IS GENUINE. I can definitely hear people speaking and interacting in the way she has written her story. Try it.

Following the success of the ambitious concept of Quadrophenia with a recipe of a more straight rock sound, this is an album of a somewhat easier access and one which I somehow seem to revisit more often - a favourite of mine. That said, it doesn't mean I find it a \\"better\\" record than the aforementioned \\"Quadrophenia\\", it's just another trip.<br /><br />Pete Townshend is once again responsible for most of the writing - only a song out of ten being not his. It's a participative effort nevertheless where the whole band matters and has a chance to shine.<br /><br />\\"By Numbers\\" is a very strong, inventive album full of electric and acoustic guitars and a varied quality to it, from rocking numbers - \\"Slip Kid\\", John Entwistle's \\"Success Story\\" - to beautiful slow ones full of harmonies - \\"Imagine A Man\\", \\"They Are All In Love\\". We also get the classic \\"Squeeze Box\\", a perfect little tune, and \\"Blue Red And Grey\\", beautifully sung by Pete.<br /><br />I haven't felt the need to get a cd version of this classic as my vinyl still manages to produce a very satisfactory sonic experience, so I'm not able to tip anybody on the matters of digital remastering or booklet contents.

B005BOHYW2|5.0|I found this book different from all the other romance novels.  You are never quite sure how it is all going to work out, which supplies some suspense.  Overall an enjoyble and recommendable read.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|This short and insightful book is an excellent primer; it ties a multitude of concepts together and demystifies the road ahead. Start here first and you won't regret it, because the next 10 business books you read, espescially Steve Blank's \\"The Startup Owners Manual\\" previous known as \\"The Four Steps to the Epiphany\\", will be all the more clear after first reading \\"Running Lean\\".
B006UKFFE0|5.0|I have found that many entrepreneurs are frustrated with Eric Reis' \\"Lean Startup\\" because it's not actionable. Eric has written a very good book but \\"Running Lean\\" has helped execute lean quickly in a step by step fashion. It changed my view on product development drastically especially in terms of doing \\"problem interviews\\" and validating problems before beginning a solution. Ash's work has been my bible the last few weeks.

It makes Running Lean beautifully simple to read, understand and learn to practice. Brilliantly simple and choke full of golden nuggets only an experienced practitioner can provide. Five Stars.

B006UKFFE0|5.0|If you are in a startup (or considering one) and you believe in the whole lean customer development thingy, this book should be the first you read.<br /><br />This book was recommended to me by an investor and I bought a digital copy. I've found it extremely useful for startups. It's tactical and practical advice and really worth your time. I've referred it to friends often as I read it myself in a single session deep into the night.

0439023483|4.0|When I was in grade school I read Shirley Jackson's The Lottery and have never forgotten the wrenching sense of despair that I came away from that story with. It has set the bar for atonement for society's wrongs by sacrifice genre for all that have come since.<br />The Hunger Games starts off in much the same fashion, rural districts slaving to feed the elitist Capital whose iron grip is in its way a distinct reminder of France before time of the Terror and the lopping off of noble heads.<br />The it turns into an adventure story with all the adrenaline of any fast paced novel as the games begin. I won't say more of this as I detest spoilers in reviews but Suzanne Collins moves effortlessly between the two genres and The Hunger Games is a good example that some of the best fiction out there is to be found in Young Adult Novels.<br />The mistake to be made here is by those who say they will wait for the movie to come out. Do that and no matter how much you enjoy the film, you will miss out on a very good book!
B006UKFFE0|4.0|It seemed silly to pay for entrepreneurship advice when there's so much many articles floating around, but this book cuts through the noise and organizes Lean principles into clear and actionable steps.  I'm still going through them, so I can't say whether they work*, but they're certainly comprehensible.<br /><br />That said, the book is very focused on product development, and only touches on many of the other aspects of starting a business.  It's fine - you can't cover everything, but it definitely won't be the only book that you rely on.<br /><br />*The user interview scripts were a good framework, though I found that my users jumped off of them pretty quickly, and I had to play it by ear rather than forcing them back into the structure.

B005R2S04E|5.0|Heard of these guys many years ago. It is easy to get pigeon holed into thinking Krautrock is limited to Tangering Dream. I got the DVD of these guys quite a while ago but did not really show the early stuff and was not that interested in what I saw and heard. Thought I would try this and yes it is captivating listening. This is quite a bit more rocking sound in places but much less on the swelling, enveloping keyboards of other krautrock bands.<br /><br />I will be Ege Bamyasi soon and look forward to it. The good thing about being old is that you are more open minded and moreso have the money to sample what you would like. The downside is that you are old and dont dance as well anymore. Good album and the live disc is just as great.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B0038W0OIK|2.0|If you want a gaming headset that is reliable and durable, I would not suggest getting this headset.<br /><br />--PROs--<br />+ Great bass and sound quality + Retractable microphone is a step up from the previous SteelSeries 5H<br />+ Portability, being able to disassemble the headset<br /><br />--CONs--<br />- Left side of the headset started to die about 2-3 months of use.<br />- The headset connector WILL get loose after a fair amount of detachment and reattaching, this results in the headset losing sound.<br /><br />Overall I had a bad experience with the SteelSeries headset line, I ran into issues with bad build quality.<br /><br />I would not recommend getting this headset, you are better off investing your money somewhere else.

1400032717|4.0|Christopher Boone, who identifies himself as a socially-hopeless fifteen year old mathematician, writes an account of a portion of his young life that occurred after finding the neighbor's black poodle skewered with a garden fork. On the encouragement of one of his teachers, Siobham (pronounced Shi--like in ship--Vaughn, stress on the second syllable, very close sound to chiffon), he decides to write a murder mystery novel about finding the killer of that dog, as if he were Sherlock Holmes, a favorite problem solver of his. As a consequence of his investigation, however, he uncovers confusing and disturbing information about his neighbors and his family.<br /><br />Don't look for chapter one in this book, as Christopher uses the first twenty-three prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...) to order his chapters. Christopher does math problems in his head any time he needs internal peace from anxiety, fear, frustration, or claustrophobia. Based on some of the confusing and disturbing information he sleuthed, he and his pet rat, Toby, and using his dad's cash card, head from Swinden, his home town, to London, on a trip he had never made, on a train which he had never ridden, and through strange places he had never been.<br /><br />The reader encounters British figures of speech, like \\"losing one's rag\\" (losing one's temper), or \\"having a pig of a day,\\" or \\"take-away chips.\\" (These last two weren't explained, but the first means \\"having a very difficult day\\", and the second means \\"French fries\\"). Metaphors confused Christopher because he saw the world as a dichotomy of facts and lies. His brain thought in precise terms, like \\"I stepped back two meters\\" or he wore \\"brown shoes that have approximately 60 tiny circular holes in each of them.\\"<br /><br />Christopher knew many facts about diverse scientific and geographical issues and inserted them into his story, almost helter skelter, but they were always tied tangentially to the line of the story, or, at a minimum, to a word inthe previous sentence. That he called his story a mystery novel was surprising, since he thought novels \\"were lies about things that didn't happen\\" and he was investigating a real murder.<br /><br />This is a good read, a short read, a quick read. The adult reader will get a beautiful but painful sense of what it is like to be the parent of an autistic or Asperger's child. YA readers will get a lot of insight into how the minds of autistic or Asperger's kids work; it might help them be more understanding, more tolerant, and even more helpful to those kids.  Try renting the audio book from the library to get a better sense of the British context.
B006OGMEUI|5.0|It's important to note that Helvetios is a concept album. What this means is that the entirety of the album is to be taken together as a piece that attempts to paint a larger picture - with each song being an individual portion of that picture.<br /><br />For Helvetios, the album as a whole is a journey, the story of the Helvetii - ancestors of the Swiss from Ancient Roman times - told from their point of view as they fought against the might of the Roman legions, as led by Caesar and as later documented by Caesar in his \\"Commentaries on the Gallic War\\". (Fun fact: 'Eluveitie' is derived from an early piece of graffiti meaning 'Helvetian'). The prologue and epilogue speak of war, and individual songs are named after battle locations and take the listener along the Helvetians' journey as they fight for a place to live, settle, and ultimately come to terms with their demise.<br /><br />At its core, Helvetios is still very much Eluveitie.<br /><br />Without getting into specifics of individual songs, Helvetios exhibits something of an evolution. A lot of people will be wary when reading that Eluveitie may have changed their style with this latest album, and upon first listen, the album may seem to be a bit disjointed, with rougher transitions than previous albums, and less folk melodies. While this is all somewhat true, given a few more listens from beginning to finish, and the genius in the way they've laid out the last journey of an extinct culture begins to rise beyond a slight unfamiliarity with the style.<br /><br />It feels that Eluveitie is trying to tell a story first and foremost with this album, beyond even trying to make amazing music (which there is still quite a bit of). It's a story that has been forgotten by history, and the way that Eluveitie brings it back to life with Helvetios is something that should really be appreciated. The album as a whole may lack the singularly enthralling singles that previous albums were full of - although \\"A Rose for Epona\\"and \\"Uxellodunon\\" come close while being very fresh stylistically, and \\"Santonian Shores\\" brings classic Eluveitie - and some people may write this album off for it. But taken as a whole for the story that it attempts to tell, this is Elueveitie celebrating their folk origins through the hills and valleys of their culture and history and it's quite worthy, both for the story it paints and for the music it presents.

B000WV9XYG|5.0|I am in my senior year of high-school and am reading this as supplementary reading to Biology.  Some of Darwin's work and theories were in my Bio book and made me interested in reading \\"The Origin of Species\\".<br /><br />Although long, and written in a somewhat archaic style, I find that this book is interesting, well-informed, and intelligent.  Charles Darwin was an admirable scientist who weighed out each of this theories before drawing any conclusions, and he is quick to write that his theories are not necessarily true.  This alone is a refreshing aspect to \\"The Origin of Species\\".<br /><br />I believe this is an important book to read, in order to be well-informed about the Earth, and the many ideas and theories which intelligent scientists, such as Darwin, have formed about the Earth itself, and the many kinds of life which inhabit it.  Even if you do not agree with Darwin's theories, such as those of natural selection and evolution, it helps you to become a better educated person to be well-informed about his theories.<br /><br />I have been reading \\"A Mentor Book\\" edition of \\"The Origin of Species\\" (even if it is not the exact same edition as is pictured, it is very similar).  The small, paperback format is very helpful, as it makes this book fairly light and easy to hold.
0439023513|2.0|When I first picked up the first book, I read it cover to cover (well in my case, it was more like screen to screen on my kindle). The first book was truly amazing. I haven't read anything this riveting since the Golden Compass and it's been a long time since I've picked up any fantasy novel.<br /><br />I quickly finished Catching Fire afterwards and over the span of the last 4 days I completed the entire trilogy. I've lost sleep over this particular book not because I wanted to finish it, but because the will to read further - hoping that I'll eventually get rewarded by a progressively better story that will end my experience with the series on a good note.<br /><br />This was not meant to be.<br /><br />Everything felt rushed and depreciated. Things turned ugly.<br />The biggest betrayal.<br /><br />The Katniss I was introduced to in The Hunger Games was not the same Katniss I wanted to follow in Mockingjay. She was shrewish, whiny, annoying, and not at all the same girl in the arena. What happened to the fearless character we were introduced to in the first book? Where was she? I realize that there may be an element of PTSD that is debilitating to Katniss, but it didn't have to consume her entire mentality and distort her moral code. There was absolutely no doubt in my mind that the HG Katniss had a lot of potential to show her growth and her development in this book more than anything else. Peeta, who I've never liked, surprisingly grew on me in this novel (it must be because he was absent for more than half the book). Gale infuriated me. Haymatch was disappointing. But all of these character portrayals could've been rectified with a well developed Katniss.<br /><br />I don't necessarily hate the direction Collins has taken the book - no I'm sorry, I actually do.<br /><br />It's such a shame too. A character with so much promise and a shining beacon of \\"girl power\\" was diminished into a clueless tool stressing over a love triangle amidst a New World Order that she played a key part in. It just doesn't feel right to end like this. I'm taking this too personally and a lot of my outbursts are due to lack of sleep, but I really truly believed that the final product from the last two books could have been a lot better.<br /><br />I'm going to try to forget this bad literary aftertaste with a quick read of Lord of the Rings.
B005CKPQ7A|5.0|The writers of this series have tapped into a formula, a perspective that kept me on the edge of my seat - not answering the phone, the mail, email or cooking anything of significance on any schedule until I had seen the entire series - it's laugh-out-loud, bite-your-nails, grit-your-teeth, hold-onto-the-chair GOOD! Such addiction to a tale of the \\"substance of addiction.\\"<br />The writing is an amazing twisted success - I was constantly caught off-guard by the trail of the tale -<br />The acting is superb, understated - semi-nerdy \\"Hank\\" just isn't the guy one sees leading a life of high-end crime; his gorgeous, greedy wife, on the brink of final divorce, is more than happy to follow a trail of millions instead; his teenage son, with MS, is just trying to grow up 'normal'; his macho DEA brother-in-law grinds away at an investigation he has no idea leads to his own family; the mad-cap, price-gouging \\"criminal\\" attorney provides a ton of comic relief against this family back-drop for the emergent local Cartel Master-Mind, whose arsenal is replete with stand-up henchman, mutilations, cartel murders and maneuverings. And Hank's young partner, whose plights of drug-addiction, lost love and devotion to Hank tie a power-ribbon of tension, love and frustration around the entire jewel of a series (all 4 seasons) is irresistably appealing!<br />WHO IS really the \\"bad guy\\"? IS there a \\"bad guy\\"? See for yourself...<br />Don't miss what I call a ground-breaking, socially on-point contemporary masterpiece!<br /><br />THIS IS STORY TELLING AT ITS VERY BEST!

0156012197|5.0|The Little Prince has been one of my favorite books for four decades, a book I have read many times over. The story is fanciful and touching, showing the world of adults through the eyes of a child and revealing what is really important about relationships. The encounter between the prince and the fox, in which the prince learns what it means to tame and to be tamed, is priceless. I ordered this copy for a dear friend and was delighted by the quality of printing and color artwork in a paperback edition. An excellent value.
B006UKFFE0|4.0|This book is massively hands on and specifically targeted to people in the thick of developing a product. It is fabulous for this, but not really a book for general reading - every chapter has an assignment, so it's a great tool for actual development. That said, you will learn a lot if you can make yourself get through the read, but not a \\"readable\\" book - this is a workbook.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|This is one of the handful of books I use when consulting with startups about how to find a business model that can scale. What's useful is it cuts through the theory and gives you practical steps to defining and then testing hypotheses about your model.<br /><br />Maurya's concept of a business model differs slightly from that used by Steve Blank and Alex Osterwalder but the differences make it more useful in some cases - primarily where the model is simpler and has fewer external players.
1469984202|5.0|Epic.  Beautiful.  Intriguing.  This is the best new Sci-Fi I've read in a long time.  The character and story development are blended seamlessly and well-balanced.  I felt as if I were actually there, struggling alongside people I truly cared about.  I'm reluctant to return this 'borrowed' book as I do see it as a story that I'd like to revisit in the future.  If there are new volumes added to this tale, I would gladly pay money to read them.  Do NOT deprive yourself, read this.  You won't regret it!
1439192812|5.0|My parents were conservative Lutherans who refused to accept evolution primarily due to the fact that they possessed no scientific education whatsoever, and their church told them not to (you do not need to give up your belief in God to accept the evidence of Darwin's Theory). While reading chapter #1 of this unexpected gem, I kept thinking \\"I wish my parents were still alive so they could read this lucid explanation of evolution\\". Although not a book targeted toward young adults, I would have no problem gifting this book to pre-teenagers about to enter secondary school. What an unexpected surprise.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Tina Fey, to me is the whole package. She's one of the very few people in showbiz that can write it and then deliver it funnier than anyone else can.<br />The casting for 30 Rock is genius, which I'm sure she had a lot to do with. She is very unique in her approach to comedy and I am always amazed at where she gets her ideas from week to week on 30 Rock. This book gives you some insight to her thinking. I loved it.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|In a lot of ways, The Affair plays out as an origin story for Jack Reacher, telling the story of Reacher's last major investigation as part of the United States Army: a series of dead women in a small Southern town with a very large Army base population. Like the best Child books, The Affair never neglects Reacher's brawling abilities (though his conflict with some local brothers feels like a bit of an afterthought, given how quickly it disappears from the story), but its primary focus is always on the central mystery and Reacher's keen, probing investigatory skills. The case here is relatively simple and (a little disappointingly) clean-cut; while there are some intriguing developments and surprises, ultimately this one unfolds more simply than many of the best Reacher books. What it has going for it, though, is the nice sense of seeing where Reacher's tics and habits come from. The Affair wouldn't be half as involving for a newcomer to the series, but as a long-time fan of the books, Child does a nice job balancing the seeds for Reacher's future life with the ongoing story, never letting the book turn into a thudding foreshadowing job (like, say, Lucas did in the prequels). The Affair isn't up there with the best Reacher books (sad, since it breaks the streak of 61 Hours and Worth Dying For), but it's still a solid, enjoyable read, and another great example of how really talented, clever, and smart Child is at creating fascinating characters and gripping situations.

0316017930|4.0|A Review of Outliers By Malcolm Gladwell<br /><br /> Pico della Mirandola wrote a discourse entitled Oration on the Dignity of Man; in the article he wrote about the innate ability that humans have when it comes to destiny. He believed that one of the most unique attributes that set humans apart from all other species was the ability to decide their own fate. Gladwell discusses this topic frequently in his book, Outliers: A Story of Success. Gladwell sets the story by giving the definition of an outlier; noun, (1) Something that is situated away from or classes differently from a main or related body. (2) A statistical observation that is markedly different in values from the other of the sample. Then he continues with a summary, \\"This book is about outliers, about men and women who do things that are out of the ordinary. Over the course of the chapters ahead, I'm going to introduce you to one kind of outlier after another: to geniuses, business tycoons, rock stars, and software programmers. We're going to uncover the secrets of a remarkable lawyer, look at what separates the very best pilots from pilots who have crashed planes, and try to figure out why Asians are so good at math. And in examining the lives of the remarkable among us-the skilled, the talented, and the driven- I will argue that there is something profoundly wrong with the way we make sense of success.\\" He then proceeds to tell you the many different stories of success and how there really is no such thing as a self-made man. This book held me captivated throughout the entirety of it's whole. It gives a unique perspective of the human condition and what is wrong with the majority of modern day society.  Gladwell believes that it is what you do with the opportunities that are presented to you that determine success and not just dumb luck.

B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Angry Birds is essentially a puzzle game.  If someone crates a puzzle game, they have to strike the right balance.  It has to be intuitive and feel easy to catch on, but then it must present just enough of a challenge so that you want to keep playing.<br /><br />I bought this app mainly because of its reputation as an addictive game.  I played through a couple of rounds and lost interest.<br /><br />I didn't hit a board that was too hard, I just didn't care about it.  There's no back story as far as I know.  What did the pigs do?  Why are the birds angry?  Haven't pigs learned about more stable building material?  I ended up putting it down, though my wife picked it up and enjoyed it -- right to the point where it became too hard.<br /><br />I think part of this is the Fire screen.  The screen is just not precise enough of an input device yet to make a game like this work.  I know a lot of people disagree, but for me it was worth exactly the price I paid.

B006W5JF9Y|5.0|I have always wondered why more people don't cover Bob Dylan.  If you have ever been do a Dylan concert you find that he changes all of his songs over time which keeps them fresh.  This lends itself to interpretation by others as they cover his tunes.  That is what makes this such an interesting album, how his songs are interpreted by such a huge variety of singers and bands.  Sure there are some misses.  With this many songs you are bound to not like some.  Also if you are dead set on the songs sounding like Bob, forget it.  But then if I wanted that I would just listen to his albums not covers.  I just really liked how one man's songs could be covered by R&B, country, punk, pop and alternative artists.  It makes you hear the songs in a new way, which I think Dylan always likes.  He has never been stuck in time, why should this compilation.

He caught and held my interest throughout as he always does.  He is a master!  Guess I should have know by the price but I am still new at this  shopping and downloading  of Kindle books!
B004JPJHME|5.0|Fear and Loathing is definitely not for everyone. It is a two hour trip like no other. Unique beyond comprehension, it is often mistaken for something it is not the first time around. In my case I was expecting a slapstick humor movie based on the trailer and what I had heard. It is not by any means!!! If the movie intrigues you but you can't understand what is going on, read the book. You will have much more of an appreciation for the movie.<br />As far as the format goes, the Criterion Blu-ray is 100% the way to go. I have watched this movie on DVD, Streaming via Hulu and VHS. This is without a doubt the best way to go.<br />DON'T EXPECT CHEECH AND CHONG

B0051HNMTI|1.0|Not worth the download. Nothing new here. Just work your abs. Start on decline board. Do 10 slow, holding contraction all way up and down. Then do same, but turn body to left on way up, then alternate turning to right. Do a set of ten reps. Then do ten normal again. Work your way up to doing these three sets of 20 reps. Do every day. If no decline then just lay on floor n stick feet under couch and do them. This will give you strong abs.

B006UKFFE0|5.0|Running Lean manages to accomplish the difficult task of providing both:<br />  a) A clearly defined process for lean startups.<br />  b) Insight on why the process is like that and when/how you would adjust depending on your situation.<br /><br />Also, the author has been applying these guidelines himself, not only for previous engagements but in developing this book itself. So, the fact that you are reading the book is a demostration of the principles behind it. I know that sounds kind of confusing, but had to share how I felt ;).
1594744769|4.0|I picked this book up for my 10-year old daughter, but the disturbing image on the cover of the book dissuaded her.  (Yes, she judged a book by its cover.  We're working on it.)  In an attempt to see if the book was indeed as scary as the cover photo shows, I read it.  While there are elements of horror here, a \\"horror\\" book (or even a \\"scary story\\") it most certainly is not.<br /><br />Riggs has rather ingeniously incorporated 42 old, forgotten photos into his narrative of a young boy investigating the mysterious history of his recently deceased grandfather.  HIs grandfather, you see, told the most outlandish stories of his childhood growing up in Britain after fleeing the Nazis.  As he digs around, he soon discovers the stories were true, with very dangerous consequences for our young hero.  The first 30 or so pages are needed to build up steam, once Riggs finds his voice, however, the story moves at a decent clip.  What reeled me in, however, was the brilliant way in which the photos were incorporated into the story line.  I'll make another pitch to my (now 11 year-old); its an intriguing read.
B004ZNAXX2|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the last two Immersion sets, particularly the 5.1 mixes.  For some reason, this set didn't include a 5.1 mix. Only a single unimpressive DVD disc containing a couple of music videos and a short documentary.  On the plus side, the 2011 remastered discs sound excellent. I haven't listened to the live discs yet.  Discs 5 and 6 contains compelling demos, listening to them gives a completely different perspective of the album.<br /><br />I now have all 3 Immersion sets, overall, the biggest disappointment has been the lack of video content in all 3.  While the first two sets did include the impressive concert screen film scenes that they display on stage, it would have been nice to include a disc of a full concert from the supporting tour.  The Immersion set of the Wall, however doesn't even include concert screen film. And the one set that I would have expected to include a DVD or Bluray disc of anything related to The Wall would have been this one. If it had included The Wall Live on video, even if it had included The Alan Parker movie (maybe not a worthy inclusion, but the movie was just as much an important part of Floyd's history as any project), it would have been a trully immersive experience, living up to the word Immersion.<br /><br />Like the previous box sets, this one includes pretty much the exact same keepsakes, right down to the stupid marbles. I don't know why they can't include a second tray to hold the additional discs, the set will only accomodate 4 discs securely.<br /><br />I would give 5 stars for an excellent treatment of an excellent album, but I dock one star for including the exact same keepsakes.  No 5.1 mix on DVD or Bluray, minus another star. No concert screen film, minus another star.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like this game because it asks me if I want it to auto complete or for me to complete it and it asks me what type pf dealing I want it to deal so I recommend this game to people and hope they have as much fun playing this game then I do.

B005QYKD4I|5.0|I am giving this 5 stars because it is just a great action movie. The plot may not be too deep, the love interest is silly (she keeps those heels on while being attached by giant sentient robots), but you have Leonard Nimoy as the voice of one of the Transformers and the scene where the military jump in wingsuits and really cool. I guess what I'm saying is that if you liked Transformers 1 and 2, this one is more of the same -- fun action not deep drama.

B0053VKP8S|5.0|I bought this for my PC because I was getting some electrical noise through the analog audio out on my motherboard.  The noise wasn't horrible, but you could definitely tell it was there in quiet sections of a song.  I must admit, I'm pretty unfamiliar with audio setups and my PC audio has never been anything that I would consider impressive.  The difference I heard when switching to the D3 using Toslink is easy to hear.  Quiet moments in music are quiet and the clarity is definitely a step up from what I've been using.  This device is great value for the price.  For someone like me who doesn't have a ton of money to put into their audio setup, I highly recommend this.

B006UKFFE0|4.0|If you want a solid, easy to understand and action template in doing a lean startup, Running Lean is the perfect book. All the steps outlined in here are highly actionable and the book is structured in a way where you can draft your checklist of things that needs to be done during the customer development phase.<br /><br />I take one star off as the book starts slow while Ash lays the foundation and explaining some key concepts in the lean startup (and I found myself confused at certain points). But once you grasp it, all the puzzle pieces would fit into place immediately.<br /><br />Great book, highly recommend that you pick it up! :)

0525478183|5.0|I recently went through a binge of reading books by John Green. Of the 4 I've read, I've come out with 3 books that I would reccomend to anyone (Which includes an Paper Towns) and one I love so dearly that I'm afraid to share it with anyone else because it's so wonderful, and if they didn't feel the same way about it our relationship would be irreparably damaged (TFIOS). This is a fantastic book, with fantastic writing, relatable characters and so much more. Enjoy reading it and DFTBA
B005SFR7YE|4.0|I was horribly disappointed at the cinematic rendition of Phantom, featuring a cast of mostly non-singers trying very hard to hit the right note. The live production of Phantom is a spectacle, and everything you want theatre to be.  That said, I was doing back flips when I discovered this version existed. I'd been saying for years that someone needed to just film the stage show, as they've done with countless other Broadway shows. Well, if you want the stage show you may be slightly disappointed. All of the scenes are there, not rearranged or cut completely as in the film version. The exception is that, for whatever reason, the decision was made to perform in a concert hall and not a theater. The behind the scenes features explain the challenges this presented so I can be forgiving. The hall has no wings, or the traditional elements needed for the set pieces of Phantom to work. Still i was disappointed that one of the most dazzling things about Phantom, the set, was reduced to a giant projection. It's an impressive piece of technology, with shifting LED screens that project the sets, but it does rob the show of some of the magic. I understand this was probably the best option with the venue, but a better venue would seem to have been a wiser choice. Without alot of the set special effects, the spectacle is not so spectacular. To create the \\"spectacle\\" the cast was tripled to be able to fill the enormous stage. This isn't necessarily bad, but again, a smaller venue, with the original staging would have been better. The producers chose to do a full staging, versus a concert (like with Les Miserables) so for that I am extremely grateful. But, the chandelier does not raise in the beginning nor crash to the stage mid show, there's no quirky elephant with drunken stage hands, and the graveyard is lackluster. At times the giant projections work, like when Christine and Raoul are on the roof of the Opera, at other times it does take away from the magic and mystery. Still, if the choice was a staged concert, or this, I'll take this. At any rate it is a phenomenal improvement over the film. Nothing beats the live show, but now that the tour is ended, this is a comforting substitute.f the choice was a staged concert, or this, I'll take this.

1606860909|5.0|I recently went through a binge of reading books by John Green.

B007E6YYLO|1.0|I really hate the direction this show has taken regarding everything. I am also seriously annoyed at the gross gender stereotypes employed by the writers. This whole episode clearly separated the women and men, with the men going \\"outside\\" and handling it like real men, out on the open, fighting each other over their property (Lori), while the little women stay back on the farm and work the kitchen and have conversations, trying to talk and caress each other out of suicide and other feminine issues, given the sensitive and delicate souls they are.<br /><br />There is not one interesting or strong woman in the show and everytime someone does try to be, they are immediately shot down by the writers as incompetent bches who need to be put back in their proper place and predetermined gender roles.<br /><br />I also love how any woman allowed to make her own choice on this show IMMEDIATELY regrets it, reaffirming the backwards, sexist notions of these equally backwards writers that women really don't know better and truly need a man to make it for them.<br /><br />Andrea wants a gun to shoot and when she is finally given one, she accidentally shoots Daryl (to make the point that woman are incompetent as in \\"we told you so\\") and then gets her gun privileges immediately revoked by the men in charge. Dale never had gun training before, but he gets to automatically have one while Andrea has to earn the privilege to own a gun.<br /><br />Lori had a choice to swallow those pills and abort the baby, but she threw them up right after she took them and then Rick shamed her for trying to make that choice.<br /><br />Between the kitchen scene and Rick and Shane fighting over who \\"owns\\" Lori, I was in constant rage. Like women were property to be owned. Between Carol and Lori, I am not sure who is the bigger doormat. Lori's entire conversation in the last episode in the tent was about making sure Rick understands that he owns her instead of Shane. \\"Shane thinks he owns us, but honey, that is not true because YOU own us so set him straight.\\" Urgh.<br /><br />And in this episode Andrea is made to look like an ahole and has Lori yell at her for possessing insufficient skills to be dude property. Of course we are supposed to identify with Lori and take her side, as she has been portrayed throughout the show as the reasonable one  - since she knows her place - and Andrea has always been portrayed as the screw-up, the messed up rebel, so she couldn;t possible be right. And what, Andrea calls her queen bee? Who wrote this episode? Mr. Roper?<br /><br />The scene with Lori and Andrea is just indicative of the so many problems this show has with portraying women. It was disappointing to see them have that \\"working mom\\" vs \\"stay at home mom\\" conversation, like do we really need to go there now, I mean the world has come to an end.<br /><br />With every episode this show has managed to reach new and embarrassing heights with respect to pretty much everything: story, plausibility, character development...Also, nothing ever really happens. At the end of every episode, we're basically back to where the episode began. They leave the farm, the come back. They go into town, they come back. Lori's car crashes, but she is back at the end of the 45 minutes. Shane and Rick have an intesne talk and beat each other, their lives in danger yet they come back. People get sick or shot but they get better. Someone wants to commit suicide, but doesn't and everything is fine at the end of the 45 minutes. It is like those situational sitcoms where something happens and then the entire episode is about resolving that particular issue and at the end of the half hour we are back to point A as the issue has bene solved. There is just nooooo forward momentum! It is the same routine everytime. I can understand why people call this comatosely slow and that it feels like it is not going anywhere.<br /><br />And whats up with that whole \\"you can get it through scratching\\" thing? Someone bathes in zombie blood at least every third episode or has zombie blood splattered all over their open wounds or into their mouths, but they suddenly decide that scratches make you sick? Where did that come from?<br /><br />I will finish this season but as someone said, I really can't abide the Post-Zombie Apocalypse World As Run By Stupid White Men any longer. I suggest firing all aholes in charge of this show at AMC, rehire Darabont and start over as if the 2nd season never happened.

0802473156|5.0|I heard this book discussed on the Christian radio station K-Love.  They talked about how each person has a love language and that their particular love langugage is often not the same love language their partner communicates with.  I found the book in our church library.  I recommend it for anyone involved in a loving relationship.  It is geared toward adult partner relationships, but also discusses parent-child relationships with both adults and children.  I definitely learned from that section.<br /><br />Chapter 3 has the best description of falling in love I have ever read.  It follows with a great explanation of the normal cooling off that happens in a relationship after the initial infatuation is over.<br /><br />One partner can be doing everything possible to make his partner happy.  But if he is doing the things that would make him happy, and not what makes his partner happy because he doesn't know what her love language is, she feels that he doesn't love her.  He feels unappreciated because he has been trying so hard to show his love, but getting no response.  She doesn't feel loved because he's not doing the things that really matter to her.  It would be a really simple fix if they knew the love langugage of the other.<br /><br />The book is a very easy enjoyable read.  It includes quizzes to help you determine your love language and also has exercises you can do after every chapter.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|I first came across Running Lean last year as an ebook and I was floored. Here was a perfect roadmap to helping me implement all of the things I was beginning to learn about doing a Lean Startup. Since then Ash Maurya has not only rewritten it, but made it better! The examples that he lays out in the book are not only easy to understand but are easy to apply to your own venture and learning how Lean Startup works. For my own company we are currently using this technique (and the book) to help us launch something that people not only want but also help them solve a real problem. If you've read [[ASIN:0307887898 The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses]] or are thinking about doing a Lean Startup I highly recommend getting this book.

B004IFYMWK|5.0|[[ASIN:B004IFYMWK Fair Game]]<br /><br />With the exception of Watergate, I can't remember another movie that shows the corruption that abounds within the highest-of-the-high executive offices of our government. This is the story of how a CIA agent was outed and her husband's reputation smeared because he publicly exposed a blatant lie regarding shipment of material to Iraq from Africa. The lie was being used by the Bush Administration to help draw us into a war with Iraq.<br /><br />If you watch television at all you know the lead characters in this film. Valerie Plame, former CIA agent and her former ambassador husband,Joseph Wilson, played by Naomi Watts and Sean Penn. They played their parts with great skill and insight.<br /><br />The movie is a thriller and tells the story very well. The V.P. and his aide Mr. Libby,(Scooter) to those who are his friends, are all there.  The aftermath of Valerie's outing comes to life and the suspense builds.<br /><br />Most people who are breathing are aware of this story and no matter your own thoughts on the matter will enjoy this true-to-life drama. You can decide what is fact and what is fiction. However you lean, it is a good movie, well written and well acted. Buy it and enjoy.

B0052FG750|5.0|I am a huge doors fan and have just about all their albums, and yes I agree that they may be the greediest band in the world, The re-release and repackage stuff all the time. 1/2 of my box sets are just rehashed compilations but I am a completist and I get them. There boot Yer Butt set sounds awful but it is what it is. This is a awesome set for someone that wants to get all their studio albums for a great price, If you already have their original studio recording box set, perception set, or the individual CD's this adds nothing but like I said it is a really cheap way to get all their albums in one purchase. LONG LIVE JIM.

B006UKFFE0|5.0|I have followed the development of the Running Lean methodology as it progressed from blog posts to workshops to book 1.0 and finally book 2.0.<br /><br />The broad lean startup philosophy, as described in the book The Lean Startup by Eric Ries, has the potential to greatly improve the number of startups that succeed, reduce the amount of investment wasted in failed startups and enable entrepreneurship to be taught in schools and universities.<br /><br />The tremendous value of Running Lean is it provides a highly logical and practical overlay to the ideas outlined in The Lean Startup book. It provides a road map which anyone can follow to research and build a business around real customer needs. In the good old days of starting a business, entrepreneurs were expected to research and write a 100 page business plan, raise money from investors and 'go stealth' whilst they build a complete product or service ready for launch. More often than not the result was a product or service which met no one's need and was dead on arrival. The lean startup movement and Running Lean in particular has the potential to radically increase the number of businesses which succeed, and therefore it could genuinely lead to a revolution in business thinking.<br /><br />This is a must-read for every entrepreneur, CEO and investor.

B00475BUVM|1.0|So, I was looking at several 3d blu rays today in Best Buy, and asked an associate between a few of my ideas which one I should get, and he absolutely recommended this to me over the others, even though i said I wasn't sure I'd like it and that I don't like movies with bad plots and fighting like the movie 300, to which he re-assured me that this movie is entertaining.  As soon as I get home, I rottentomatoes this, along with my other choices, only to see that this has an AWFUL rottentomatoes rating, worse than the others.  Then I go to amazon, and see so many people arguing about it, many claiming it to be the WORST 3d in the world while many of you tried to convince me that it isnt THAT bad, just a typical B-movie with good effects.  Let me tell you, I have never fallen asleep 3 or 4 times across 4 hours and had to wake up and rewind back to what I remembered watching for any movie like this, only to still get about 1 hour in, not know what was going on, and not want to ever watch any more of this piece of garbage film that never should have been made.  And as for the 3d, where is it?  You can take the glasses off for most scenes and only notice a few blurry little areas on occasion, because thats generally the degree of 3d to this film.  3d only serves to make it look a bit clearer with a bit of depth, but has NO real stand-out 3d, at all.  Please, save your money for something better, like pillows and blankets so you can take a better nap than the one youd be taking if you tried to sit through this film.

B006UKFFE0|5.0|This is one of the essential books for lean startup practitioners. It isn't theory. You can tell these are real lessons from Ash's own experience running lean startups. This book is very prescriptive; telling you specific things to accomplish. The one thing I found really valuable was the focus on how to map out your startup using the one page \\"lean canvas\\". After reading this book, I really got it and elevated my lean startup game.

B004QK5N5W|4.0|The Good: This is great quality, and the picture is excellent when hooked up to my 58-inch plasma TV. It's crystal-clear HD. Using this with Netflix or StreamToMe (if you have your own movie library) is superb: travel with this cord and you've got any movie on-the-go! I use this with my iPhone 4S and the mirroring is fantastic. Quality is substantially better than mirroring through AppleTV It also works with an iPad (which I don't have). Apple smartly provided a secondary USB slot so you can charge the phone while this adapter is plugged in.<br /><br />The Bad: Overpriced! Apple has just about killed the secondary market with legal and software protectionism. With a monopoly on the cables, they are way overpriced.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: Your options are limited if you want to hook your iPhone or iPad to an HDTV. You can either use AppleTV or buy this cord. Streaming via AppleTV is less hassle with no cords and the ability to wirelessly manage your media from your couch, but this Digital AV adapter provides a better, more reliable picture. It depends on what you want! I always prefer quality over convenience.

158617262X|5.0|Great to have a critical version that is absent of the silly post modern reductionism of current literary critique.  Spot on with it analysis of what the author was trying to present not an explanation of the commentators opinion.
B006GHA9VQ|4.0|I remember as a kid wanting Christine to go with the Phantom. But as I got older, I picked Raoul too. So when I found out about Love Never Dies, I was very excited. I didn't do any research ahead of time (other than to see the basic concept), so I didn't know about any good or bad reviews. I was able to go in to the movie theater with an open mind. (For US residents, there's a second opportunity to view on 3/7/12 in select theaters.)<br /><br />While the production is fantastically eye catching, I wouldn't really call it a sequel. Some of the characterizations weren't very true (Phantom seemed too Emo; the Girys were exceptionally greedy) or weren't believable at all (really deep character changing flaws in Raoul). And there are a couple points in the plot that are very predictable, but still enjoyable.<br /><br />The costumes, makeup, sets, and music are beautiful. The costumes follow very well the change in both fashion and Old World (1895 Paris) versus New World (1905 New York) mentalities. I noticed another reviewer say that the music was average/not memorable and I completely disagree. Some of the songs seem a little forced to add atmosphere to the plot. But the core songs with Phantom and Christine are very memorable and moving. I purchased the CD the next day after seeing the production and as I listened to it, I found I even remembered some of the lyrics. And Christine's grand aria very much made me feel like it was part of the original Phantom production. The ending certainly follows the adage you either love opera or hate opera - there's no in between. The music and scene made me shed a few tears and feel deep empathy with Phantom.<br /><br />Overall, I would definitely recommend Love Never Dies to any Phantom fan. I am very happy I have the DVD on pre-order. But take it more as an alternate future and appreciate it as a stand alone based on Phantom. It's not really a true sequel.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good game to help pass the time. I also like that you don't need wireless internet to play. I think is a good download
0385342063|5.0|While I'm not a big fan of the Shopaholic series, Kinsella's  other books always are fun and enjoyable.  This was was no exception.
B003MC5N28|5.0|Book contains no profanity.  There are scenes of murder that a child might find disturbing because of who does it and how it is done.  In this society people (and children) are killed but it is not considered murder.  As far as sexual situations, Jonas describes stirrings for another girl, but I think it is quite tame.  The book would be good for middle schoolers to adult.<br /> Like Gathering Blue in that Lois Lowry reveals things without making any comparison to present day reality.  She takes us through typical days-in-the-life of her characters and we see how foreign this world is based upon the words and actions.  (The old adage of show it don't tell it)<br /> Another thing I love is how the story starts and ends in the middle so to speak.  Almost like a rolling start in auto racing, on page one the story is already in full swing and we are filled in on past details as we roll along.  Some might find the ending disappointing that it also ends in like manner but I quite enjoy that.  Although the ending in Gathering Blue leaves more to chance.  In the Giver, for the most part, we can guess at what will happen to Jonas yet I still like that it is not spelled out and resolved for us.

B004EBT5CU|3.0|after hearing her sing on hd.net live & on the radio, sirius etc was expecting so much more from the vinyl reproduction of her music, but the lp came scratched on side 2 which isn't that bad not worth the hassle sending it back to amazing amazon, but considering it's brand new in shrink wrap, shouldn't be huh!! that & using my dual 1218 it doesn't quite measure up to how the cd sounds & i don't have that prob with any of my other lps or comparisons, so can only conclude that this vinyl isn't up to snuff!! otherwise, luv her music, luv the songs, just not this particular version or format.[[ASIN:B004I1WIWU 21 (Vinyl)]]<br /><br />UPDATE: digital dl now works as of 3/13/12!! woohoo lol.

B004QHK986|4.0|I had bought the simple version of this album when it was released. I really hated it (you may find an old commentary of mine telling why). But, in time, I gave a second chance to the album and started to listen to the musics with more attention and trying not to be desappointed with the fact that there are many tracks that are only noise and a few ones with music. I have discovered great songs that started to figure among my favorites. When I saw this special edition with a live show, I selled my simple album and bought this one. Really like it. Talking about the show, I expected a little more. It has great songs, the band plays well, but I thought the show is too simple in visual terms. I have never seen a Linkin Park show, so maybe it's just the way they are.
0307719219|5.0|\\"Why Nations Fail\\" by Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson is an outstanding book about why some nations succeed, and others fail.  Acemoglu and Robinson discuss two different types of economies -- extractive and inclusive -- and explains why the extractive economies eventually fail, while inclusive ones tend to do well for many years.<br /><br />Basically, it all comes down to one thing: if a nation's politics allow people and institutions to prosper, they are inclusive.  If a nation's politics try to keep the already-rich elites in power while extracting every last cent from everyone else, they are extractive.  A nation can go from one to the other, but usually what happens is that an extractive economy (think \\"China,\\" \\"Mexico,\\" or most of Latin America) will succeed for a time; then, because too many people are shut out from the process, _and_ because there is a lack of what's called \\"creative destruction\\" (meaning there's a lack of innovation, because innovative products create both winners and losers and extractive economies won't gamble on anything even if the upside far outweighs the downside), they eventually stall out or fail (as we now see in Russia).<br /><br />Acemoglu and Robinson use many examples drawn from recent and ancient history to explain why this simple definition works.  Because if the economy in question is extractive, it doesn't matter if you've raised all sorts of interesting monoliths like the Mayans; eventually, it will fall.  And if the economy is inclusive, it will likely become more inclusive -- though there have been some times in the past where countries have \\"gone in reverse\\" and have become extractive after being inclusive, which causes nothing but pain for all concerned (save the elites, who are making out like the 1890s Gilded Age robber barons).<br /><br />Political processes, you see, are far more important than they seem.  That's why a country that favors innovation, like the United States has traditionally done, is an inclusiveeconomy where more people are able to make a living and be able to get their needs met; it's also why an extractive economy, like the former Soviet Union, eventually stalls out and ends up having to re-make itself both politically and economically.<br /><br />This is a highly readable, intelligent book about things that matter: politics.  The economy.  Education (an extractive economy doesn't want most of its people educated, because they might become innovators and unleash \\"creative destruction\\"). And even philosophy.<br /><br />\\"Why Nations Fail,\\" in short, is an excellent book that is witty, understandable, and interesting about a subject that most people (if asked) would probably say bores them to tears.  It should be read by everyone who has an interest in politics, the world economy, history, or just about anything else.<br /><br />Five stars.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />Barb Caffrey
B003ZSJ212|4.0|I'm not going to waste any time writing about the versions of Star Wars, how awesome Star Wars is, and who shot who. This review is about the Blu-Ray version of the Star Wars movies.<br /><br />First: Blu-Ray resolution -Perfect. The digital demons at ILM brought out the best possible picture. It's clear and perfect. The menus are good looking and the pop-ups are nice as well.<br /><br />Second: Sound -Perfect. ILM is good at what they do. I am not a big fan of 6.1 surround I think 5 channels are plenty, but the mix is excellent.<br /><br />Third: Packaging -Beautiful. The movies come in a box/book with each disc inserted into a hardcover book page with illustrations.<br /><br />-Fourth: Extra features -Average. All or most of the extra features are the same from the DVD. Thus a 4 star review. The commentary can be accessed from the pop up menu.<br /><br />The bottom line is there is not that much different than the DVD's if you are a snob for resolution and sound, then get the Blu-ray. It's worth the purchase price. If you don't care about picture and sound, the unconverted DVD should work just fine.
B006UKFFE0|4.0|I enjoyed Running Lean. It is a useful synthesis of several lean and non-lean business concepts floating around today. There is also some solid practical advice on implementation.
B002SJKWZ4|4.0|Bought this for the wife for christmas, she's a huge harry potter fan. She got a great kick out of it after we got it programmed and it was a lot of fun. It still works, but the novelty has worn off a bit. Only time it really comes out now is if someone new comes over and we want to show it off, or if they have a child that we want to mess with a bit by pretending we have actual magic powers.
B000JIHP88|5.0|We spent an hour comparing different mobiles before we settled on this one.  We  were not disappointed. It is one of our most used baby items.  At 2 weeks our daughter loved watching the motions.  At five months she still loves watching her rainforest friends.  I don't know how many times I have hit the rainforest sounds button in the middle of the night and she will happily watch until she falls asleep.  It is worth every penny.  I was initially excited about the 4 different classical but I really prefer the rainforest sounds. On really hard to fall asleep evenings we also turn on her Sleep Sheep to make a little extra white noise.  I've only had to change the batteries twice - so not too bad.

There's some other books about Lean principles for Startups out there, and not all of them offer the same blend of all the topics you can learn about. Definitely must read!

B000001Y5J|4.0|This has to be one of the most angry albums I own. When I got this years ago, I'd never heard so much rage and anger being conveyed on a record before. Trent Reznor was so mad at his record label that he decided to let them know with his songs and it was a bold move. It ultimately paid off because these songs are actually really well constructed and get the adrenaline pumping when you hear them. The lyrics are full of hatred, loathing, and frustration. Here's a track by track:<br /><br />1. Pinion: 3/5 (filler track that leads in to \\"Wish\\" that serves it's purpose)<br />2. Wish: 5/5<br />3. Last: 5/5<br />4. Help Me I Am in Hell: 3/5 (this is ok, nothing special, just an interlude)<br />5. Happiness In Slavery: 5/5 (my favorite on this EP)<br />6. Gave Up- 5/5 (pretty unnerving song that's really intense)<br />7. Physical (cover)- 5/5 (Awesome cover of the Olivia Newton-John song)<br />8. Suck- 5/5 (One of the best songs here, it's one of the unlisted ones on the album)<br /><br />This is without a doubt the most ANGRY Nine Inch Nails album. \\"Downward Spiral\\" and \\"Fragile\\" have their moments but nothing gets to this level of pure rage.<br /><br />The reason why I can't give it 5 stars is because it's an EP and on top of that, some of it is filler. Also, there are 99 tracks and that gets old trying to find \\"Physical\\" and \\"Suck\\" when you want to get to those. All in all though, if you're a fan of NIN, this should be in your collection.
B005MMJ84K|3.0|As I finished Delirium, the prequel to this book, I was completely on edge.  I couldn't wait for Pandemonium to come out so that I could find out what happened to Alex and how on earth Lena was going to survive in the Wilds.  Was she going to integrate back into society?  What she going to join the resistance?  What about Hana and Lena's mom?  While Pandemonium answers (or attempts to answer) most of these questions, I felt like it was the slightly neglected middle child of the series.  It seemed the book was predictable.  I couldn't see what was going to happen from the very beginning, but whenever one step was revealed, I could predict the next 10 steps.  When I talked to one of my students today who is currently reading Pandemonium, she asked, \\"Is it even worth reading the rest of the book?\\"  Honestly, yes.  Just because you have to get through this book to find out how all the questions we were left with at the end of Delirium are REALLY answered.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book. The writing was beautiful and the story was AMAZING. And then there is the ending! Let's just say, the wait for book 3 will be excruciating.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Evernote is a great place to write down your aspiring ideas. As an avid author,  beginner poet, and a person  generally full of words it is an opportunity to express myself, and keep track of my daily life.  Plus,  it's free!

B003YL4LYI|5.0|In my opinion this is the second best book in the series (the first one being my favorite). While some of my favorite characters didn't make it to book five there are still plenty of original characters still around. I don't want to give any of the story away but I promise it is a good one.<br /> The story is more in depth as well as character involvement. There is never a dull moment in this book and it was very difficult to put down. Which is why I am surprised about the bad reviews. I loved this book and the cliff hanger in the end made me excited for book #6. Please give this one a try, Im certain you will like it.

B002SJIO54|5.0|I'm a big sci-fi fan, and after watching this movie on TV in the past I decided to finally order it, and the two-disc edition was worth getting because of all the features, but mine actually came with a third disc (bonus disc) which shown some footage at comic con. This movie has one of the stories that leaves you wondering what will happen to the main character. It's really good to look into. Check this movie out as a rental from a store, or buy it from amazon, because the price is worth it and the movie is very intresting.

B000001ELP|5.0|I really don't understand all the hate for this album. ? I know music is such a personal thing to each individual who experiences it, and to me this is one of the best pieces of music I've ever heard! I definitely think it was the best album from KISS since maybe \\"Hotter Than Hell\\".<br /><br />Sure, it's a long way from the whole \\"Let Me Go, Rock -N- Roll\\" and \\"Rock And Roll All Nite\\", and I can understand how fans of that part of the whole KISS experience was put off by this release; but for fans of the deeper, more \\"complex\\", melodic stuff from KISS (like \\"Black Diamond\\", \\"100,000 Years\\", \\"Going Blind\\", etc etc), this was a dream come true.<br /><br />Ok, yes, it could have done without the whole opening number \\"Fanfare\\", and it sure as heck could have done without the entire hokey ending spoken word dialogue of the song \\"I\\". But other than that, this is in my opinion a true masterpiece of music.<br /><br />Every song on it, from \\"Just A Boy\\" all the way through to \\"I\\", this is one awesome musical journey, not a weak song in the entire bunch! I honestly can't pick a favorite, because I love every song on it.<br /><br />After, not one, but two horribly bad misfire albums (ok, \\"Dynasty\\" may not be as bad as some say, but \\"Unmasked\\" was a complete and utter disastrous disappointment), KISS brought in producer Bob Ezrin because they wanted to return to their earlier harder rock style. Some people (including some members of the band) say it was a huge mistake to do this, and some even consider this KISS' \\"Spinal Tap\\" moment.<br /><br />But, personally, I consider this KISS' finest moment ever; and too bad it pretty much was over for them after this. Sure, \\"Creatures Of The Night\\" was a lot heavier, and had some great songs on it, but for some of us, it wasn't KISS any longer: Peter and Ace were gone, and the music style changed dramatically; but I should save all that for another review, LOL.<br /><br />For those interested in collecting anything after \\"Alive II\\", I would suggest \\"Dynasty\\" and \\"Unmasked\\" to complete the collection, but I HIGHLY recommend this one! Thank you! :>)uld suggest \\"Dynasty\\" and \\"Unmasked\\" to complete the collection, but I HIGHLY recommend this one! Thank you! :>)
B00729GQ0A|3.0|I got 80% through the book and put it down. I was disappointed at one point in the book. The author has the ability to weave a great story. Great character development, decent plot, kept the story moving with no lag time. It is well written, but left me wanting more. Not from the story, but from the author.<br /><br />The story has a new take on old stories melded together. That's fine. However, I was disappointed to see the story jump, sort of, on the bandwagon of vampires and the like. I would have liked to have seen the elements described differently than being put within the confines of the endless vampire stories. Vampire stories are great if, and only if, you can get them into an area where your story is going to stand out. Blending the elements with the vampires was different, but there was little explanation of anything other than earth (vampires) and spirit (witch). Big rule as a pagan - all are balanced or there is chaos.<br /><br />I am happy the author decided to do a story on a branch of Paganism. There is little out there of new stories on a form of faith that is misunderstood but gaining traction in the world of mainstream religion. This is good, very good in my opinion.<br /><br />My biggest disappointment was the author did a great job at building tension between two characters and even building the internal conflict of these two characters. As things came to the edge, the author left me hanging - just disappointed. There could have been more umphf and there could have been more romance, with not being raunchy or a leading article for Flynn.<br /><br />The author has got the ability to weave a good story. I am apprehensive of buying a second book, however, there is a high possibility I will to see if she has perfected her ability to push herself - and her characters - to the limits.<br /><br />Kortney<br />Editor<br />Unforgettable Books, Inc.
B005AEQX0C|5.0|..... I'm on my dads account.... but I have loved The Wanted forever, and I'm so glad they are getting more and more popular every year, heck now its everyday!!!!!!! It's an amazing album, performed by an amazing group. Hopefully they'll stick around for a SUPER long time :D<br />I recommend you buy this, it's really good and there's at least one song that anyone will like. I love all of their songs though! Just listen, and if you think you just might like it, get it.
B004ZNAXX2|2.0|Pink Floyd is my all time favorite band and The Wall is a work that I can't say it is their best as it transcends all their work. It's not that it is their best album is that it is one of the greatest albums ever made. I have been waiting for an HD (24bit 96khz) version of this album ever since I first heard Dark Side of the Moon on SACD. When I saw that there was an immersion set for this album, my heart skipped a beat. When I read the description my hopes were crushed. This box set is a terrible value for any Floyd fan or music lover.<br />What they got right<br />* The CD portion is almost perfect. It includes a digital remaster of the album and unreleased album demos. I've heard bootlegs of the demos and they are nice enough but hardly a must have.<br />* The packaging is very cool, especially the printing on the CDs themselves.<br /><br />What they got wrong<br />* The CD portion should have included the film soundtrack. Basically the same album but is a different experience from the studio album. I got a bootleg of this and love the album.<br />* One big beef I have with the packaging is that it looks like all the discs are stacked into a tin. This looks like it would greatly increase the chances of introducing scratches to the discs while trying to take out the one you want. And yeah it'll be a pain to find just the disc you want to play.<br />* The scarf and collectible goodies are lame to say the least. What you get with the Immersion Dark Side set is much more interesting, scarf included.<br />* The DVD has so little content that it's the equivalent of using a TV size box to ship a bottle of vitamins. I'm pretty sure all these extras came with the film DVD of the Wall and if you are thinking of buying this set then you already own that.<br />* No The Wall movie included in DVD or Bluray. I can let this one slide but honestly for the price they are asking, it should have been included.<br />* But the main reason why this set shouldn't be purchased is the irresponsible omission of the HD surround remasters on DVD and Bluray that are included with all other Immersion box sets. If you look at the contents of the Immersion versions of Dark Side of the Moon or Wish You Were Here, the Wall version seems downright anemic.<br /><br />Bottom line is that this is a crappy cash-in that I can only assume was rushed out the door with little care. The real tragedy is that their may never be a true Immersion Version of this album, at least not until the next new format of music is developed.<br /><br />God willing they will make an Immersion version of Animals and Meedle that don't suck like the Wall.responsible omission of the HD surround remasters on DVD and Bluray that are included with all other Immersion box sets.

0756405890|5.0|The time was right for me to leave the safety and comfort of the many mysteries I read and to jump back to another favorite, fantasy, even though it means much longer books.  I have never read Patrick Rothfuss but was drawn my AMAZON reviews to give this trilogy a try.  THE NAME OF TH WIND is the first book in the The King Killer Chronicle, it is Day One.  It is the beginnings of the story of Kvothe, who now hides fropm his famous or infamous life, living as an innkeeper, as he tells his life to the Chronicler.  Book was is amazing and wonderful.

1400079144|2.0|I believe that Dan Brown referred to the US Capitol Architect as that \\"dapper African American\\" or some such thing about ten times - or at least it seemed that way.  Physical descriptions of characters are important to build an image of the book in the readers' minds.  Ethnic identities of characters may be relevant to the plot and theme of a book, fine.<br />But once we knew that he was an African American - it just seemed like really lazy, bad and cloying writing style to refer to the same character over-and-over-and-over again as being a \\"well dressed African American\\", \\"stylish African American\\", \\"dapper African American\\" - and whatever else kind of African American he was described as.<br /><br />If I remember correctly, Professor Langdon's race was never mentioned - and certainly wasn't repeated every time he appeared in the book.<br /><br />I enjoy the bits of history and philosophic/scientific mumbo jumbo that Dan Brown threads through all of his books - this one included.  But in his other books, he seems to have some hook that ties those elements into the plot or theme of the book - in addition to the fast-paced and adventurous plots.<br /><br />This book was not fast-paced, not too adventurous, not very surprising (nearly every big plot turn was pretty obvious from about two or three chapters before it was revealed.<br /><br />I generally enjoy Langdon's character - usually very smart.  In this book Professor Langdon was about as dumb as a stump.<br /><br />Other than all of those bad things - I guess the book was entertaining.  It was worth the $1.00 I spent on it at the library's used book store.

0062068423|4.0|Harry Hole is frustrated.  There is a Presidential visit and the Secret Service doesn't communicate adequately with the police force in Oslo.  Harry is not really permitted to carry a gun since he has failed the shooting test.  Harry and his colleague, Ellen Gjelten,  spot someone with a machine gun.  The gun is an Uzi.<br /><br />Ellen believes Harry Hole lacks natural buoyancy.  She has voluntarily aligned her own career with his, believing that he is the best detective on the force.  Rakel Fauke has an unbecoming hairstyle, a power suit, and a severe expression.<br /><br />Subsequently Hole is sworn to secrecy about his actions.  He has shot a Secret Service Agent at a toll barrier.  The error mostly resides with the Americans who failed to notify the Norwegian liaison officer about the placedment of agents at the scene.  To underline the point that Harry Hole acted correctly, he is to be made an inspector.<br /><br />Harry Hole has a short fuse where skinheads are concerned.  In the year 2000 a Muslim holiday conflicts with Norwegian Independence Day on May 17.  The Independence Day activities of the Neo-Nazis are to be looked into.<br /><br />It seems a Marklin rifle, a rare and powerful firearm, has been smuggled into Norway.  The gun owner and the assassination target have not been determined.  The story is told in two time frames, 1944 and 2000.<br /><br />The book is thrilling, surprising, and chilling.  The Second World War gave rise to ghosts and many resentments.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|A recommended read for those who haven't read any of the books  and [[ASIN:0976470705 The Four Steps to the Epiphany: Successful Strategies for Products that Win]] .<br />So one great book that distillates 3 books plus lots of startup experience.
0061784788|5.0|It was autumn, 1779 when Archard Fortescue hurriedly wrapped the unusual gold treasure in a buffalo hide and quickly handed it off to young Billy.  The Pale Indians had attacked, savagely massacring those who had uncovered the gold-plated skull, a skull that held the key to the union of the country.  Fortescue wanted the union to become a reality, but the treasure had to leave the Kentucky wilderness.  Billy would fly like the wind atop a panicked horse, the horse that would take him to Thomas Jefferson.<br /><br />Some secrets are meant to be kept, secrets that could spell doom if uncovered and disturbed.  Far removed in both time and place, Charlie Reed led his friend Trent into a forbidden area in Utah's Rocky Mountain area.  Trent was tentative as they approached the hidden cave, a cave that purportedly held not only a treasure, but also a curse.  Teasing Trent, Charlie told him that \\"Grandfather says whoever trespasses into the Great Spirit's cave is never allowed to leave.\\"  The young treasure hunters were shocked when they searched through the tunnels and found a cavern holding a \\"field of bodies, men and women,\\" Charlie's people.  The Great Spirit would soon arrive for him as well ... a shot rang out.<br /><br />There were riches in the cavern, both archaeological and those in the form of unusual gold plates.  The geologists arrived, the Indian activists began to stir, and the government sent its people.  There were stirrings in the Sigma Forces and The Guild, opposing entities.  Young Navaho Indian , Kai, would do the bidding of WAHYA, \\"a militant Native American rights group.\\"  She would destroy the opening of the cavern and rebury their people.  The explosion rocked the entrance, but it wasn't of her making.  The geothermal springs moved the ground creating unfathomable spasms.<br /><br />In Washington, D.C. Painter Crowe, commander of Sigma Force's special service reviewed the reports coming in.  One sentence caught his attention and chilled him to the core:  \\"'The ground ... it looked like it was dissolving away.'\\"  At the Kamioko Observatory in Japan they began to observe unusual bursts of neutrinos around the world.  They pinpointed massive bursts that Dr. Riku Taneka though were geoneutrinos.  Something was terribly wrong.  The secrets of the fourteenth colony, The Devil Colony, were coming to the surface.  Six million people had died before Jefferson's time, but this time would be different.  No doubt, \\"a doomsday clock was ticking downward, one neutrino at a time.\\"  Would two opposing forces join together or would that clock keep on ticking?<br /><br />This is a an amazing Sigma Force novel that will keep the reader breathlessly on edge.  This novel was fascinating on many levels as it expertly hopped around the world from one operative group or small faction of innocent people to its evil ones.  The author seamlessly wove the narrative, one that traveled through centuries, funneling down to a doomsday scenario that was totally entrancing.  Everything from secret operatives, Native American lore, ancient secret societies, to the mythical Devil Colony added to the excitement of the tale.  For me, this was a pick up and put down novel.  Initially it was one that held some interest, but once the action started to wind down in the last hundred pages or so, I was hooked.  It didn't spin out of control, but rather spiraled and spun with excitement as all the elements of good, bad, indifferent, and evil roared to an exciting conclusion.  This is one sizzling novel that will spur everyone's imaginations ... can this stuff really happen?  Is it happening?ore:  \\"'The ground ... it looked like it was dissolving away.'\\"  At the Kamioko Observatory in Japan they began to observe unusual bursts of neutrinos around the world.

B006UKFFE0|5.0|Running Lean is an incredibly good book; it covers all the key concepts of customer development and lean startups but what sets it apart is that it includes step by step instructions and useful examples of formats for interviews, metrics, etc. This is probably the best practical guide about how to develop the product and add features (using a pull approach and going into detail about how to implement this process), which most other books don't cover. And unlike the first edition, it can also be applied in borader settings and types of products.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Graphics are outstanding.  I'm not into comics but they're easy to skip through if you don't want to read them. Nice animations.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|well it is one of those games that i can play whenever and where i wanna play. everyone should play it at least once
B006UKFFE0|5.0|I purchased an early release of this book and really loved the techniques for identifying a market, capturing customers, and iterating through to success. He has a clear writing style that flows well and gets to the point quickly. I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

B0040HJNKC|5.0|Buddy Guy is still strong, sassy, and full of spunk as evidenced in this, his most recent venture. \\"Seventy Four Years Young\\" is his acknowlegement of his years as a hard-loving bluesman, and \\"Let the Doorknob Hit Ya\\" is a fun song with a strong beat.<br /><br />This album does not disappoint.
0439813786|5.0|This book is fascinating and I finished in couple of days.  I wanted to stretch the reading to keep the excitement going, but I could not resist waking up at 4 AM on a Sunday to finish reading it. The characters of Hugo, Isabella are much loved by kids and adults alike. The adults in the movie are also portrayed beautifully including Hugo's father, Papa Georges and his wife.  The suspense if riveting and the climax is great. The drawings are very well made and has over 150 pencil sketches on the book which are part of the story. My daughter loved this book and is in her collection now. She liked the hefty feeling the hardbound book offered!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love this game. I have always been a mahjong fan, so I thought I would try this out. Excellent game.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|There has been a gaping hole in the Lean Startup movement where the practical advice section should be.  Ash Maurya fills this void by laying out the process of building a successful business in bite-sized pieces.  I have the paperback version sitting next to me while I work so I can read a few nuggets of startup decision making gold every day.
B0060YIBLK|5.0|As an author in the mystery-thriller genre (BOULEVARD and BEAT) I value good research material where I can find it.  Robin Dreeke's \\"It's Not All About Me\\" is a perfect peek into human psychology, offering take-away lessons about the way the mind REALLY works.  The tips on reading body language and suspending one's ego in order to elicit information taught me more about how to develop strong, believable characters than any other source I've read.  Agent Dreeke has provided techniques I can try on my own, giving me the opportunity to learn this stuff from personal experience.  Once you've read his book it's hard not to see the world through his eyes.  It's illuminating, and enriching.  I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn what's really going on in typical human interactions.

0439023513|1.0|Book 1 was five stars...an outstanding satire on war. Book 2 was bridge to the ending...not quite a repeat of Book 1 as it was much weaker worth 3 stars. Less impact on the gut. Book 3 was a disappointment...as the finale it should have been better thought out. The message was that war is hell is an old one. The message that survivors, the Victors, will be forever changed is an old one.<br /><br />I grew tired of Katniss being perpetually hospitalized, unconscious, or catatonic whenever something bad had to happen. What kind of artifice is that for the protagonist? And again, the love element was just not there. Katniss was too ambivalent. At the end, you have to ask...what happened to Mom?... what happened to Gale?... what happened to the country? did anything change or is it the same thing to be continued?<br /><br />Not an ending that will be memorable or popular.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really enjoy playing this addicting game. just wish I had more games unlocked. fun, entertaining, and challenging. like how there's a bunch of games.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|The Wool series of short stories is quite simply one of the best and most immersive books I've ever read.  My only complaint was that the end of the story arrived and I was so immersed in the characters that I was heartbroken to find out there wasn't another page to turn to.  Hugh Howey has an incredible talent, and that is to feed you gradual bits of info without seeming to tease you intentionally.  You genuinely feel like you're in the Silo looking over the characters' shoulders.  You never know more than they do about where they came from, and he keeps you guessing right up until the end about where they're going.  If you are at all consider buying this book, please do it...you won't be disappointed!
B006UKFFE0|5.0|I bought an early digital copy of this book and thought it was a quick, actionable must read for entrepreneurs.  Takes the principles of lean startups and customer development and makes it more actionable, less academic, and easier to grasp.  Highly recommended!
B005RYF5JA|5.0|This is a must DVD to be seen, it is possibly the finest produced so far by the 'Celtic Woman'. I have all of their DVDs and this eclipses the others by far.<br /> Out of 10 - 9.5!<br />Ron
B0001JXQDI|5.0|I have the domestic SACD, the newer Japanese SHM-SACD and now this DVD-A. My AVR doesn't support DSD, so my Oppo player converts DSD to PCM -and- downsamples to 88.2 khz. I wanted to hear the DVD-A since my system will play these at full rez. I am VERY pleased with the sound of the DVD-A! I don't listen to the stereo mix, for that I have the SHM-SACD (which is stellar). The 5.1 mix is the same as the domestic SACD, but I can hear more. The details are crisper. One of these days, I'd love to hear full DSD, but for now, it's DVD-A all the way!
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I was intrigued by bookcover and without really knowing what the book was about downloaded  it, was not disappointed, I could not put the book down a refreshing pecular story I would recommend it. Thanks to Kindle Fire I have had the luxury to sample and explore writings of author I may not think about reading.
B006DQ1J0K|5.0|Leontyne Price and Carlo Bergonzi are well known in these roles, and both are magnificent here in 1961, before Price's vocal crisis (brought on by attempting Minnie in Puccini's \\"Fanciulla del West\\") robbed her of some of the sublime freedom she displays on this afternoon. Giorgio Tozzi is not quite in their league, but he is very fine here, caught in his full prime and in very good voice; later in his long career the tone would display more than a little rust. The really commanding performance here is Cornel MacNeil's as Charles V. In Act III he shakes the rafters with \\"O de verd'anni miei\\" and leads the great ensemble that follows with an \\"O sommo Carlo\\" worthy of Warren. Even if the others were not in their best voice (and they all all) this set would be worth having for MacNeil alone. The sound is very clear and full-bodied, although there is a little interference (alas, in Act III) but it's not enough to mar this splendid performance. As another reviewer has aptly pointed out, Corelli and del Monaco are the benchmark interpreters of the title role. Here Bergonzi, spurred on by MacNeil in an exceptional state of grace, challenges them. This is molton Verdi, pouring forth a flood of melodies, a truly profligate display of invention, sung by great voices who happen to be great singers as well, under a fiery young (gay) American conductor, Thomas Schippers. Verdi would be very pleased.

B005HSG3TC|2.0|I like this cover because it's light and easy to fold out of the way, but the \\"stand\\" doesn't work well and the elastic strap is already showing a lot of wear (starting to \\"fray\\").  Granted I use my KF several times a day, but I'm easy as I can be on it. Definitely way over priced for what it is and for the quality. If you're looking I'd suggest getting something else.
0307887960|5.0|Update March 2013<br />I am able to keep to weight of but have to stay very vigilant.<br /><br />Update december 2012 : lost 70 pounds and feeling great! I am done, the hardest part is keeping it off. I have been able to do that by weighting myself every day. When I regain 2 pounds I get back to a proteins day or 2 and re loose it.<br /><br />Merci doctor Dukan ! , You probably saved my life and for sure  saved my sanity!<br /><br />Posted last April:<br />I have been on this diet for 4 weeks and lost so far 15 pounds on it.I have been very serious so far, very little cheating.<br />This is why I personally really like this diet:<br /><br />1 I am never ever hungry while on this diet, I cannot take starvation diets<br />2 I am loosing weight which is not easy for me and loosing fast which is thrilling.<br />3 it does not cost me anything but the price of this book. (no gimmicks funky products needed.)<br />4 No boring meeting to attend<br />5 do not need to pump up iron, no need to hire a trainer, no gym subscription, walking is the exercise prescribe.love it!<br />5 I do eat only \\"natural food\\" no pre prepared industrial frozen, no can food , no liquid cans, no fake proteine bars.<br />6 No need to weight my food , no calories counting or cabs and no time consuming diary....<br />7 I can cook for myself healthy proteine as well as vegies and add some rice for my family, everyone end up eating healthy and I do not have to prepare special food<br />8 it is actually easier for me to never have the food that I love such as bread and chocolate than to eat small portions of this food and feel all the time deprived.<br />9 I feel much better since I do not eat any sugar and carbs.<br /><br />To the people who say that this diet is un healthy I would say, maybe it is not nutritionally perfect but who eat nutritionally perfect anyways? Most people rarely eat nutritionally perfect on a daily base.<br />This diet is very comfortable, and sustainable, getting thin and feelinggood in your boddy while eating fish, chicken, salads tomatoes etc in probably 10000 times healthier than being fat.<br /><br />To the people who claim to be bored with this diet, I really do not see why. There is a large variety of food and I use a lot of herbs and spices to flavor my food. You just have to use a bit your imagination. On the contrary, Dukan is very much for flavoring your food in order to be satisfied. Of course if all you eat is deli turkey and chicken breast, you get bored but that is not what this diet is about.<br />If you really do not like to cook or do not know how, use the recipes from the book. Actually you may start to enjoy cooking. For mr it is fun.<br /><br />Cons:<br />if you cheat even a tiny bit, you gain the weight back so before you start make sure that you are very highly commited.<br />If you need some carbs or fat in your diet, do not get this book. Eating any carbs or fat while on the Dukan will ruin the diet at best and make you gain some weight at worst. So in this case, you would be better off with another diet that allows some carbs or fat.<br />I do not think that I would get into this program if I had anything less than 15 pounds to loose.<br />If you enjoy to eat out a lot ( I don't) it may be difficult to find restaurant that cook without fat.<br />What I end up missing the most are fruits cannot wait to be done and eat 1 fruit a day!<br /><br />Tricks for surviving this diet:<br />I buy 0% Greek yogourt by the bucket and flavor this with a bit of stevia and vanilla extract<br />I have a large variety of teas: black, green white, jasmin, earl grey etc...<br />A large variety of mustards flavored with tarragon etc..<br />Take a daily vitamin supplement and use lemon to flavor your salad to get vitamins C<br />Treats:<br />Cappuccino with 0% milk, smoked salmon, scallops, hearts of palms, artichoke hearts<br />Drink lots of water<br /><br />Good luck all !
B000FA5TTW|3.0|Everyone raved about this book, so I finally bit the bullet and bought it. The story itself was very well written, but it was so disturbing. I read the book in a few days, but I had a bad feeling in the pit of my stomach the entire time. Maybe it's because I'm a parent that I found this book to be so disturbing. Because it was so well written, I probably would give the author another try with one of her other books.
B006UG90RM|5.0|The quality of these 13 song is much better than I expected. This had the potential of being a trainwreck, yet it is the exact opposite. There are no bad songs here. All are in the range very good to excellent. There's a few I thought were just good at first listen, but after hearing the entire CD more than 10 times, I really like every track.<br /><br />The words that describe this album to me are POWERFUL, FRESH, and VARIED. There's no ballads here, just in-your-face high energy hard rock. Eddie's guitar work is amazing, and David's delivery and lyrics are great (no more high-pitched shrieks like the old days, but that's OK with me). Dave's voice doesn't have the range it once had, but it's very good for his age. It's the attitude and swagger that only Dave can bring that helps make this record great.<br /><br />How anyone can give this a review of below 4 stars is incredulous to me...either they dont like rock music or they've only listened to the album once with a prejudged attitude. This album grows on you as you listen to it more. I've been listening to it each day since release with no desire to listen to anything else; it's just that good !
B0015DROBO|4.0|This book started off really slowly, but boy was it worth it if you keep going. There  was so much action towards the end of this book, I literally couldn't stop reading it. I bought the other 2 books in the series the day after I finished this book, just because I had to keep going.
0439023491|5.0|Yet another amazing book to the series! I couldn't put this book down either. However, in the beginning it was kind of slow and I was wondering what direction the rest of the story was going to take me, seeing how there is another book and all. After about the 10th chapter I couldn't put the book down and it made me so excited to get to the end of it. I can't wait to get to the next book and see how the ending will unfold.<br /><br />GREAT READ and I recommend to all those who feel like putting this down within the first couple of chapters to keep reading it DOES get lots better.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]]
B0015DRPJU|5.0|This was one of the best in the series. I don't want to give anything away, I want you all to enjoy it as much as I did. I went through the whole gambit of emotions while reading this book. Go and read it right now!

0471463396|5.0|I found this to be an excellent explanation of many key value investing concepts.  As an individual investor with little time to devote on a regular basis, i don't even try to apply these concepts personally (index funds/asset allocation!).  But I am very interested in the concepts of business and investment.  I think the author does an excellent job of explaining these concepts in a succinct and accessible manner using very useful real-world examples.  I regularly recommend this book (and the Essays of Warren Buffet) to anyone I discuss investment with.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|I had read this was a life changing book, and indeed that's just what it turned out to be for me!  I have been telling all my friends about this book and quoting passages for weeks now.<br />It should be a must read for everyone!

B003V4AK8E|1.0|This thing arrived yesterday still in package. I plugged it in to let it charge for a couple of hours, followed the instructions but it just will not power up if unplugged from the charge cable.  I let it charge overnight and still nothing. It does not appear to be holding a charge at all. The pinecone textured grips would be great if they were rubber, but as hard plastic they are uncomfortable Also, as soon as you plug it in it overwrites all other controllers for channel 1 so you have to reprogram them every time you plug it in. I will be sending this back immediately.<br /><br />** Update 2-march 12<br /><br />Upon requesting to return this for a refund, I was told refund was not possible if the original packaging is damaged. It is not possible to remove it from the sealed plastic casing without cutting so that seems like a very unfair rule. Hopefully I at least get a working product in round 2. I'll keep you updated.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|This backpack is a great bag, large enough to hold more than just your standard two glass. I am able to have 3 differents glass, 2 full size Nikon flash, extra filters, cleaning supplies and anything else I may need for a standard shoot. The compartments are fully lined for protection and even the smaller compartment fits my MacBook Pro 13 inch and is padded for protection. The side compartments hold my 1TB external drive and the Mac power cord  on the other side. Attached it holds my tripod on one side, and in the smallest front compartment is my iPad. Fully functional bag that I highly reccomend.
B004O4K4SQ|3.0|There are some good things about this game. It plays great on my Kindle Fire. Autofire is a good thing. I can't imagine tapping the fire button for hours on a touch screen. It has a decent storyline. Also, contrary to what a reviewer said, even though the update says it has to uninstall, you do not lose your progress.<br /><br />The multiple weapons seem like an interesting twist. That is, until you figure out that all you need is the disruptor laser. If you spend all your cash upgrading it, you can destroy anything. That lowers the replay value.

0142000663|5.0|To summarize the Grapes of wrath is to destroy the book. But This book encompasses feeling, story telling, and symbolism, and incorporates them. The book is set in the beginnings of the great depression, and the travel of the people between oaklahoma, and California, and in particular, the Jode family, (Tom Jode, Ma Jode, Pa Jode, Noah, connie, ruthie, Winfield, Gramdpa and Grandma, Al, Rose of Sharon, and The Preacher Jim Casy). Who travel to California in hopes of having a better life. But durring the journey, Grandma and Grandma Jode die. But after the drive, they run out of money and supplies, and wind up in a camp in California that is bullied on by the corrupt cops, to which they set on fire, and drive everyone out. After a string of bad misfortions, the Jodes wind up in a government camp with crazy people, and still no work, but eventually, they find work picking peaches, and live in a box car, where the story ends with the now not pregnant Rose of Sharon feeding a starving man.<br /><br />The grapes of wrath breaks ground on a lot of levels. Even through my fourth read i feel as though im still picking out new concepts. I suggest this book for study and to read because John Steinbeck is truly a master of story development. I feel that the characters are vividly formed, and his scenes feel real! But the grapes of wrath encompasses an element rarely used on this scale today. Many people see the grapes of wrath as a book that merely is about the Jodes and their journey across America. But to look at this piece of literature from that perspective is to miss the book altogether. The stories theam is far greater than one family. It uses metaphors to express the pain felt in America. In the beginning it makes a bit of mention of a tortoise whose heading towards a single direction. The tortoise is knocked down and forgotten. But it seems to be a metaphors to the solemn perseverance of the American spirit. But this is far from the greatest bit of expression in the book, Steinbeck purposely utilizes characters in the book for hidden meanings. The preacher: Jim Casey. His role as a character is to provide a slightly religious influence to the book. Though Jim Casey is a preacher, he has frustrations with religion. This seems to express some of Stienbeck's  views in religion. With the purpose that Jim Casey serves in this book, I believe that it isn't consequence that his initials are J. C. .  Another brilliant use of a metaphorical concept falls with rose of sharron. She through out the book held a fairly useless spot. She constantly was a \\"lesser\\" character than most, but stienbeck uses her to illustrate another theme.  The book ends with her and a starving man. The starving man cannot eat regular food without getting violently sick. He had no more options for food... Rose of Sharon just experienced her baby dying prematurely before even being born. So she has a source of food ( I found no other way of wording that...) so she feeds the starving man with her unused milk. To me it seems extremely strange that a book of this kind would end with a character as \\"unimportant\\" as this. He used rose of Sharon as a metaphor to how we as people look out for each other furring the hard times. Over all this book is a stellar book to read. It is full of vibrant illustrations, perfectly formed characters, and meaning on a deep level as an American, and as a human on this earth.ok, Steinbeck purposely utilizes characters in the book for hidden meanings.

B001M4YZ90|5.0|I guess because the beginning they're kinda introducing you to who's who and who does what. . .but by the time Mumbles and One Two did their second heist, I was hooked. OMG, it was hilariously funny. . .especially the two guys chasing One-Two. . I was laughing so hard I got a headache. . even Johnny was funny (the scene on the elevator with Roman and Mickey) .  The cast was perfect for this movie. I absolutely love Gerard Butler and it was cool seeing him in a role like this. . I really, really enjoyed this movie.  Again all my Amazon reviewers were right. .
B006JD48NM|4.0|I've been waiting for this to come to region 1, but I'll keep waiting for the Blu-Ray version. And don't tell me Blu-Ray is region free and the current Blu-Ray will work, because I've tried, and it doesn't.
1567184855|4.0|After reading some really bad books.. this is FINALLY a book that discusses cases of afterlife and souls..[see my other reviews regarding some pretty horrendous, biased, books] besides NDEs. I like the way the book is written and I do find the author credible.. however, I do in fact notice the same voice/bias in all the hypnotic regressions..<br /><br />You have to read this book with an open mind and discard any preconceptions about religion or the after-life.. or perhaps your already-existing beliefs will be confirmed, who knows.<br /><br />I am TRUSTING the hypnosis sessions were real. What bothers me about this book is the souls merely return to \\"earth\\" and other planets are discussed in very minute, brief glancing detail.. this book, to me, leaves a lot of open questions. There are few sessions, also, where the summaries refer to the person as \\"his, him,\\" but a female was being interviewed (and I am not mistaking the summary referring to a soul guide, etc).<br /><br />In summary, this is a book that discusses NDEs, \\"souls between physical lives,\\" spirit guides, and recounts multiple cases. I do find the author credible, but wish he'd have asked his subjects more questions. I am suspicious of some of his sessions because they last 1 minute.. makes no sense to me. But I do like this book very much and recommend it. I am wishing the author were more objective and would ask about \\"other planets\\" or reincarnation (as animals) but I have found this book to be far better than many others in its category.

0525423656|4.0|Crossed is the next book after Matched by Ally Condie which I loved loved loved. And though I can't say that I loved this book just the same, I still think it did not disappoint. They're just different and now I'm wondering how everything will end in book three.<br /><br />Determined to find Ky, Cassia left Xander and her family in Oria. She was sent in a camp and worked there with other Aberration girls. At the camp, she met a girl named Indie, and together they escape and travel the dangerous Outer Province to find Ky and the Resistance. But Xander has something to tell her... a secret that may change what she thinks about him and about Ky. Intriguing, isn't it? This kept me reading until I discovered what it was. But of course, I won't tell. *wink<br /><br />This book was told in two different POV--Cassia and Ky. Though it would be much better (I think) if Xander's POV is included, too. Anyway, I love this kind of narrating style because I get to see clearly both minds of the main characters. I get to see more of Ky and how he truly feels about Cassia. There were lots of times that I felt sorry and sad for him for suffering too much. The same thing I felt when Cassia sorted him out in the first book that led him out of the Society. I felt sad for Xander too, but this book gave me the chance to look at him in a different way. I have always loved Ky even from the beginning, but in Crossed, you'll see that Xander isn't who you think he is. He has a secret and you need to read this book to find out. I know that I still love Ky for Cassia, but Xander seems perfect for her too.  Okay, so it's kinda confusing, I love them both now! It's hard to choose between two good boys.<br /><br />In Crossed, you won't climb the Hills, but you will be taken to canyons and to the plateaus. You'll walk under big rocks and cross dangerous plains and poisoned rivers. This book was a whole new experience. You will meet a lot of new and interesting characters and unravel new secrets and mysteries surrounding them and the Society. The main characters are surprising, because you'll get to see the real them. Ky, Xander, Cassia--they matured, they evolved, they're different. It was so nice to see how these characters developed and become stronger as the story progresses.<br /><br />Crossed isn't as great as the first book, but it is still worth reading. A must-read if you loved Matched. I'm looking forward for the next book.ysteries surrounding them and the Society. The main characters are surprising, because you'll get to see the real them.

B002HHPVHQ|5.0|This is a superbly written story of McDonald's time as a trader at Lehman Brothers, and of the Lehman-related people and trades and financial position leading up to the failure. It has a strong story line, and reads like an excellent Michael Lewis book (Liars Poker, The Big Short), probably because it was coauthored by Patrick Robinson. Wonderful style, some really good phrases, and a narrative that just keeps moving along, never a dull moment.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />You might also like to read Hank Paulson's book (On the Brink) for his view from the US Treasury seat during the whole financial crisis. It too was a superb book in my view, because it was written as a first-person account by the guy at the very center of it all. I came away from that book having a much better understanding of how many people were necessarily involved in creating whole teams of people to focus on issues, companies, processes, and (of course, sigh) the politics of actually getting money allocated to the problem, and then delivering it within the restrictions of the US laws governing such things. Also highly recommended.
B000068FUS|5.0|This was my introduction to Drive-By Truckers, one of the very best bands in the USA this past decade-plus. I first heard this album back in 2003 and was immediately smitten. Great band, great tunes, great musicians, great lyrics. This is the total package, and I love it even more because they hail from the South ... my old stomping grounds too. Maybe it's those southern roots and the resultant music that resonates with me, or maybe just the fact that these guys write killer, heart-on-the-sleeve heart-pumping, wonderful songs. This is a double disc and a lot of music to digest in one sitting, but it's worth it, oh yeah, it's worth it.

But after I watched the first two movies, I put in the third disk (which was labeled Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, and had the picture of the actors on it), and it was actually Polar Express that started playing.  As much as I love Polar Express, it's not what I ordered.  I wonder if these movies are bootlegged, or if they are just being mass produced too fast and have quality control issues?

B006UKFFE0|5.0|The 2nd edition of [[ASIN:1449305172 Running Lean]] expands and revises the text of the first self-published version considerably. Like the first edition, the new edition is packed full of practical advice laid out in a step-by-step program. The new edition changes the example startup to one that is a little less self-referential (The first edition used the Lean Canvas service as it's example, whereas the 2nd uses a photo-sharing service for parents instead). Other changes include a reorganization of the book to show how specific techniques are derived from general principles, an overall expansion of the material to cover more techniques for maximizing learning from customers through interviews, pricing, and other means, and the addition of an appendix covering operational advice for Lean Startups.<br /><br />Unlike [[ASIN:0307887898 The Lean Startup]], Running Lean is not intended to introduce the theory behind the Lean Startup methodology with anecdotal evidence so much as its practice instead, based on the hard won experience of a serial entrepreneur. At that, while it is still written very much for entrepreneurs starting a very specific kind of venture (one based on a paid web-based service), much of the advice will be applicable to other types of startups, and an effort was made to expand the scope to include both network-effect-based business models and multi-sided marketplaces.<br /><br />About the only book that I expect to give Running Lean serious competition for a while is the upcoming [[ASIN:0984999302 The Startup Owner's Manual]] by Bob Dorf and Steve Blank.

0375758992|5.0|If anyone has ever read Isak Dinesen's famed memoir, Out of Africa and enjoyed it, they will surely like Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight: An African Childhood. The story line of both memoirs have many parallel components, perhaps with the sole exception being the writing style. Alexandra Fuller's memoir is written in an almost rough, edgy and choppy manner with a halting abruptness to it. Even so, it does not diminish the quality of the work; rather, it enhances the depictions of the fiery orange and arid African landscapes that are filled to the brim with a sundry lot of wild and dangerous animals, never mind the people and the assorted tribal clans. The jagged writing is almost done deliberately in order for the words to coalesce with the stop-and-go and often turbulent yet loving upbringing that she and her elder sister Vanessa (Van in the book) experienced.<br /><br />Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight is not a memoir in the sense that it is peppered with memories of games of cricket, safaris and a life of African luxuriance. It is not. It is a memoir of perseverance and surviving while struggling first in a war torn country, then having siblings pass away, then coping with a mother's unstoppable grief compounded with temporary alcohol induced madness and lethargy to a whole gamut of happenings that plague the family from one dilapidated African farm to another, from one African country to another, all in the beleaguered search to find a place of stability whereby all of the Fullers could finally call one location home and thus have roots established. Her depictions of Rhodesia, the Rhodesia Bush War, Malawi, Zambia, the house staff, the beloved dogs are acute and transportive, a reader can almost smell  and taste what she is recalling. Though there is a lot more in the book than what I have hinted at, the best element of the work is the family themselves. They are colorful characters who are earthy, hardworking and true. Despite all their hardships, the family unit always remained intact. They could all easily have split apart.<br /><br />Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight is laced with hilarious stories, beautiful animals, gracious Africans-and sometimes not-booze, poker, war, ethnicity, travels, heat, doubt, tenacity and childlike wonder and fear. It is a memoir that encapsulates so much. It has a punch to it. Upon finishing it, it made me kind of think to myself, I would like to go to Africa, too, one day. An exceptional memoir and highly recommended.

B005CMSDLE|3.0|This COULD HAVE been very good.<br /><br />Plot/premise:  A (German?) government agency does some DNA altering on embryos to make stronger, smarter, healthier \\"soldiers\\".  Then pulls the plug and kills off all the evidence - except for baby Hanna and agent Erik who get away (Hanna's mother is killed in the escape).  Erik who is NOT her biological father, hid Hanna in the wilderness and taught her physical survival skills and educated her including teaching her multiple languages.  When she feels ready to take on those who want her dead, he produces a signal box - Hanna (about 13 yrs old) flips the switch and waits for them to show up while Erik takes off.<br /><br />The question is WHY?  WHY would they do this? Why not slip quietly into the world and hopefully never be noticed by them, with physical combat skills to protect herself with if she's found?  Or, why not stealthily go after the person(s) who want her dead?  Why the major \\"come and get me\\"?  Why did Erik risk his life to save her, raise and train her to survive and then leave her so vulnerable?  There is no logic to going about it this way.<br /><br />This \\"WHY\\" ruined the entire movie for me.  Had they simply just been discovered one day in the woods, or had they tried to go after these people and not quite pulled it off and then those people came after them, it would've been a good enough story to work.  Doing it this way was just - stupid! It could have been very good otherwise.<br /><br />The acting is good, the action is pretty good, but the story has this big illogical flaw.  If you don't care about this flaw, you might enjoy this movie.

B003Y5H51K|3.0|About 25 years ago on a real-life cave diving expedition (Nullarbor), a freak storm collapsed the entrance to a cave and trapped 13-18 people. Andrew Wight was part of that expedition and drew upon that experience in writing this script.<br /><br />It's basically a man -vs- nature survival movie, with a background story going on with the relationship between \\"Frank\\" who seems a tough character, and his son \\"Josh\\".<br /><br />Actor Richard Roxburgh (Frank) puts in a fabulous performance, but while watching this movie I kept finding myself noting most of the other performances seemed poor (especially the ladies) as well as some of the interaction scripting.  (a bad sign in a movie)<br /><br />However, while it is not likely to win any acting or writing/directing awards - the struggle to survive will catch you up in it here and there, the cave visuals are realistic and incredible, the action is pretty good and camera work was very well done - which makes it worth a view.

I bought this wand not expecting much for the price but it looked just right to sit on top of a cake...Sadly the pieces didn't fit together correctly. I couldn't get the center to screw into each other. Being that I need it pronto, I super glued it together but now it can't go on the cake just on the side...no one wants superglue sitting on top of their cake!! Super bummed.

I have read all the Shopaholic books, but always felt like they were way too predictable and like the main character wasn't all there. I've Got Your Number is still a light read, but it's definitely more complex than the Shopaholic series... And the main character is a whole lot more down to Earth (while still having lots of those quirky, lovable qualities).<br /><br />When you're in the mood for a light girly read, pick this one up!

What I find myself doing is reading a bit and then make up what I think is going on.  It's kind of fun.  I keep hoping something will be said that will acutally confirm what I think is happening. So far that hasn't happened.  Actually, I believe I am creating a parallel novel.  I am going to read the whole thing as a challenge but honestly.....who understands this? I hope the movie is made for those of us who did not go to Cambridge.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|These are a good read. However the Kindle formatting stops at page 695 in the first book. Therefore once you get past that point I suggest you don't loose your page because the bookmarks do not work correctly. When you exit Kindle it will remember the last page your were on, but for some reason if you for instance want to look at the maps and then want to get back to your last position you are up the creek without a paddle past page 695. This also causes an issue when syncing with the amazon kindle cloud version of your books. Now I paid somewhere around $30 for this set of books that retails in hardback for upwards of $120, so I am dealing with the issues. Just beware if you are an avid reader and a glitch happens it isn't easy to find where you were in these huge books.:)<br /><br />On a bit of a different note, it would be nice if the end user had more control of the page formatting in Kindle.

A few other reviews have commented on the broken English and/or inconsistencies, but what really drew me in was the simple innocence of the narrator. To see the world through the eyes of a 5 year old boy who has never seen the world was thought provoking. I have a 2 year old son, and it kept making me pause and think of things through my son's eyes. I feel that this is one that I will be rereading. Definitely recommend.

B000NY12CI|3.0|I found this book to be an interesting read.  As an American, I found this extremely disturbing that there are people who live/believe like this.  As a Muslim, I find it EXTREMELY disturbing that there are Muslims who behave this way and have no problem saying that this is Islam!  My heart broke for the author as she grew up in such a horrible way!  As she became an adult, I still felt saddened for her.  What an extraordinary woman she became in spite of her upbringing!<br /><br />The problem that I have with this book, is that it leads one to believe that this is what Islam is.  It is NOT Islam, what the author experienced is cultural.  I do not know any Muslim who would agree with this type of life.  While I can appreciate that this is her story, I just don't like the  light in which it puts Islam.
B004EPZ00C|4.0|With the continued success of the James Bond franchise, the occasional spy spoof is inevitable.  The resurrection of Johnny English is likewise inevitable.  And while not totally successful, this movie made me laugh a lot and is ultimately quite entertaining.<br />Rowan Atkinson is perfect as the deadpan agent who invites disaster and mayhem.  He ranks right up there with Inspector Clouseau in comic ineptitude.  Gillian Anderson brings an icy persona as English's no nonsense boss; Dominic West is good as arrogant agent Simon Ambrose; and Rosamund Pike, a former Bond girl, is the sexy psychologist.<br />There are plenty of hilarious sight gags and many action scenes parallel some of the 007 films.  JOHNNY ENGLISH REBORN doesn't set any new standards in film parody, but I had a good time.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|At MaRS I work with dozens of early stage companies in a wide range of industries and with a wide range of experience from first time founders to serial entrepreneurs.<br />When founders ask \\"How do I apply Lean Startup to my business?\\"<br />My answer is \\"read Running Lean\\".<br />It provides an actionable roadmap that guides  a startup from initial idea to product/market fit.  I have field-tested it with dozens of startups and it's become a go to resource.  Highly recommended.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|Running Lean is business advice for founders of tech businesses. The book defines a process to create a business by first understanding customers. It is a rare source of sound advice in an industry overwhelmed with bad advice.<br /><br />Another unique benefit is that this book shows what to do when you have zero users. How to start from scratch. What to do if you're a little guy, and not a silicon valley darling with VC backing.<br /><br />Don't waste your time building something no one wants (like I did). Read this book first.
B006ON41FC|4.0|My 5 and 7 year old boys really like it.  I am annoyed that it kept repeatedly prompting me to review it, so I am just so it'll leave me alone.
0452273331|5.0|There is really nothing to say about this book in the ways of discussing philosophy that hasn't been said before.  In my opinion, it is one of the best books ever written, and if I had to choose, probably my personal favorite.  But that doesn't matter to anyone but me.  The Fountainhead is something that you read, and on the surface there will be a thousand different views or opinions about it.  But as with most books, it is your private, personal response that matters.    I think what is true about this book is that you are not just listening to Ayn Rand's own personal philosophy intertwined throughout, which she is trying to impose on you or get you to \\"subscribe\\" to.  You are hearing only the voice of a very sane and courageous person. Some will balk at the existence of such largeness and find ways to cancel it out.  Others may put the person on a pedestal and worship.  But what she is really saying is that you are Howard Roark by nature and the only way this world can break you down is if you let it.  Shame is such a deeply ingrained feeling within all of human culture.  I think that many people who have finished this book felt just a little bolder to hold their heads up high.
B006CHML4I|4.0|Just received the watch this week and love it so far.  Nice looking timepiece and a great value.  The band is a bit too casual for me and I didn't like the material; but it is functional.  I purchased a replacement band of solid navy leather.  It really dressed up the watch.
B006ZPJWBM|4.0|I think the reviewer who does not like Tony because he is 85 and has political views is out of step...review the product, not the individual. If you did not like the individual and feel this way you should not have ppurchased or watched. Your comments are childlike

0553381695|2.0|I read the first book and now I am about half way through the second, and I may give up the series after this.  I like the story, though it seems to have no real conclusion, it just keeps going and going.  And the author writes it in such a way that makes it hard to follow.  He writes each chapter from a certain characters point of view.  So chapter one might be told from character A's perspective.  Followed by a chapter from character B's POV.  Then the next chapter is told from character C's POV.  Then the next chapter is told from character D's POV.  Then the next chapter might be told, once again, from character A's POV. The problem with this method is that, by the time we get back to character A's storyline, we've forgotten much of what was going on with that character when we left him!  Example; when Arya gets captured there are 6 chapters before we return to Arya's storyline.  That is ridiculous!<br />Martin is also VERY repetitive.  I know that Tyrion is a dwarf.  Do I need to hear every time he walks how his short legs had a hard time keeping up, or how he waddles etc.?  And what is the obsession with what characters are WEARING? Do we REALLY need to know what every character is wearing, every time we see them?<br />Cumbersome reading to say the least!
B006UKFFE0|5.0|Ash gets jumps you straight into value: specific, actionable advice and strategies. There are many books talking about this stuff, many just use generalities to little effect. Yes, you should be smart about what you're building. Yes, you should have a good idea it can make money. Ash gets more specific without making you think there's a checklist for success. If you read one book of this nature, make it this one.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Purchased from Amazon for my Kindle at a good price.  I was glad I read this book since it was talked about in my family by young and not so young.  I found the book depressing and very much a downer so will not be reading the second or third ones in this series.
B004LWZW7O|3.0|This movie is an example of a good concept that has been poorly executed.<br />Tepid, watered down substance.  Palatable, but it could have tasted so much better.<br />The notion of a set time to live, time as currency and, of course, the hierarchy and bureaucracy that keeps the upper echelon on top and the poor in the \\"ghettos.\\"<br />A class warfare predicated on age old notions of the rich oppressing the poor.  Not far off base, but again...very \\"PG-13.\\"<br />Timberlake is really just fair in this film and, while Amanda Seyfried is just stunning her talents are wasted in this.  The modern day Robin Hood meets Bonnie and Clyde.<br />I get it, It was fun in the beginning, but as time wore on it...wore on and on and on.<br />Watch it for some minor thrills, some pretty faces and for a great concept that might make you think, but don't expect the movie to go too deep.  It doesn't.

B005JLN9ZI|5.0|Drake's latest album \\"Take Care\\" is currently ranked as the number one most streamed album on the Spotify chart. It is one of the most played albums at the moment on my personal Spotify.<br /><br />\\"Take Care\\" is a step in the right direction for Drake.  He grew as an artist - compared to his last two efforts, the lyrics are more reflective and he expanded his musical horizons. Drake is known primarily as a hip-hop artist, but this album is informed equally by R&B and down-tempo electronica.  It is a well-produced album with excellent beats, one of the most sonically pleasing I've heard on an urban album. Drake is an excellent MC here as always. As far as singing, he's pretty decent.<br /><br />You don't necessary have to be a hip-hop or R&B fan to like this album, since its genre bending and inventive. And hip-hop fans may not necessary like the album -it is light on hardcore rap, so hardcore hip-hop fans may be disappointed. This album is comparable to Kanye West's \\"808's and Heartbreak\\" (I was a fan of that album as well). It mixes the same genres and often features lyrics that are self-reflective and deal with relationships. However, there is no auto-tune on this album.<br /><br />My favorite tracks: Over My Dead Body (ft. Chantal Kreviazuk), Shot For Me, Headlines, Crew Love, Take Care (ft. Rihanna), Make Me Proud (ft. Nicki Minaj), Lord Knows (ft. Rick Ross), Hell Ya ******* Right (ft. Lil' Wayne), and Practice. In other songs, there are also appearance by Stevie Wonder, Jamie xx, Andre 3000, and The Weeknd.<br /><br />I look forward to see what Drake comes up with next.<br /><br />(4.5 out of 5 stars)
B005I6EU48|5.0|Received this cover today and could not be happier.  My Kindle fire fits snuggly inside the elastic bands.  The overall look of a \\"book\\" is gorgeous.  While not real leather, you could have honestly fooled me.  It feels and even smells like the real thing.  The red is a really striking color.  It reminds me of something you might see on a shelf in a old library.  This is a very pretty and well made product in my opinion.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|My kids love this charming little (short) movie. They like to watch it several times in a row. The animation is so nice too.
B0051CSIKQ|5.0|One of the few horror flicks done right in the last 5 years. Not over done. None to little cgi. Well thought out story. Easy on the shaky cam. I mean really. Us horror fans are pretty easy to please. Well done Stake Land.
B003WMA7BU|4.0|I watched the movie \\"Drive\\" before reading the book, as I'm sure a lot of its recent readers have. On the whole, I liked the book. I didn't love it. I probably won't need to read it again, but I will read the forthcoming sequel. As story goes, I preferred the movie plot, mostly because it had more notes of friendship and love. But as for the character of Driver, I preferred him in the book. We learn so much about him which, after watching the movie, was exactly what I wanted. He is an interesting character, and I'm looking forward to finding out what happens to him. James Sallis' writing was good and kept my attention, plus there were some killer lines of dialogue. I really wanted to like this book more, but for me, the out-of-order storytelling actually hindered the story a bit. Still, I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a quick, interesting read.
B004UID2LC|5.0|omg its so good you can downlad music videos and movies.u can also download as mp3 u should so get this app. c:

That being said, this book is flat out awesome!  It kept me riveted from page one!  The absolute best part, when you think it is over, it is only just getting started with a fantastic ending!  This is a double WOW for sure--you have to read this!
0446547654|2.0|I was very excited to get this book. I've read all the other NS books and generally enjoyed every single one. I started this one out and was bored from the get go. I kept going, though, knowing sometimes it just takes a while to get into a new story. But by the end the feeling never went away. The story was bland at best. I never had a feeling of real direction or connection to the characters. Some characters were introduced into the story only to be dropped a third of the way through and then picked back up again at the very end to somehow pull everything together in a \\"grasping\\" sort of way. It was also VERY predictable. Nothing suprised me - at all.<br />But the biggest complaint I have is that this story just seems to be a repeat or a conglomeration of Spark's other books. There didn't seem to be anything new here. I feel like it was a mixture of The Notebook, A Bend in the Road, The Guardian, and many others. Almost like he needed a new book but couldn't come up with a good story so he just took bits and pieces from his other books to make a new book.<br />I was very dissapointed.
B0068AWQQ2|5.0|The Twilight series made me lose complete interest in everything to do with vampires, so I was unsure if I should rent this movie.I'm glad I did! My favorite aspect is the portrayal of vampires as predators/monsters (the way they are supposed to be) and downplays the sexiness a bit. The characters were likeable, even the \\"bad\\" ones, and the acting was decent. Though it was a tad bit predictable in some parts, other scenes had me holding my breath. Overall, I thought this was a great movie.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This was the best of his three books. I only wish there were more of his books to read. It's a book that you cannot put down!

B001CTDH76|4.0|I never watched the show on major network and took a gamble on Season 1 because I ran out of good shows to watch.  It frankly surprised me.<br />The show is relatively low budget and sort of silly if you live in California since you really can't just hop in your car and drive from Sacramento to Oakland with<br />all the crime scene first responders still milling around. The edgy character Simon Baker plays is quite charming and the scripts are pretty good.<br />I have already ordered Season 2 and 3. Hope I won't be disappointed.
B002RI9YCI|3.0|Great idea for a story but this was not Alan at his best. Frankly, found it a bit boring. Once the Queen had started borrowing books it got repetitive.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|Pretty much all of the Lean Startup proponents will tell you that what you want is to be \\"lean,\\" as in, minimal, efficient, etc, not \\"Lean,\\" as in \\"some consultant came to my company and ran through his checklist.\\" That said, it's extremely helpful to have Ash's take on running a lean company. Whether you take his steps or leave them, after you read the book you'll end up with both practical examples of how to run various stages of your learning, *and* a much better understanding of what the principles other authors try to convey. Must Read, even if you don't put everything into practice.
B000JMLKCG|4.0|I chose this book because I had never read any Thomas Hardy. I thought the story was excellent and I loved the picture he painted of the times, but it was very slow.  I stuck it out to the end though and quite enjoyed it.

B005M4K94G|4.0|To clarify the Finland review:<br /><br />This is an SACD - DSD hybrid recording.... it is NOT an HDCD format as stated in the above review.<br /><br />SACD is an entirely different format that is not HDCD compatible. SACD uses a much higher sampling and bit rate digital encoding system known as DSD or Direct Stream Digital. A disc that has a DSD layer will require a playback device that is compatible with that format. . HDCD is a process that is added to Redbook(regular CD's) developed by Pacific Microsonics. Last I read Microsoft bought the rights to it and made it compatible with XP given you have a 24bit sound card. It is a playback only decode system, which means that it's benefits are applied during the playback of standard Redbook(normal) CD's and is only compatible with that format.<br /><br />Please correct me if I am misinformed.<br /><br />Mofi has a great reputation sure this disc is a great remaster. This and SRV Could'nt stand the weather is on the top of my list of new releases.

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|[[ASIN:0307454568 The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest (Vintage)]]<br />I actually read this book from the paper book version.<br /><br />I've books so many books this year, Larrson's Hornet's Nest however, is the best yet.  Masterful, flowing text. A story line that never let's go. Characters we all know and are rooting for, as well as the baddies you just know will get their due. This story picks up where \\"Playing With Fire\\" leaves off and answers many questions but is capable of being a stand-alone book as well, although I would strongly advise any new Larsson reader to start with Book Number One, \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.\\" The first two illustrate clearly how capable Lisbeth Salander is, kicking butt while solving difficult math theorem's in her head...simultaneously.<br /><br />In this, the last of the trilogy, she spends the majority of the book recuperating (and yes, of course, plotting) while being cut off, denied visitors for her safety, after brain surgery lands her in Intensive Care. If you recall from \\"Playing With Fire,\\" she was in the fight of her life with her father and his \\"associates,\\" one being the psychopath Niedermann, who she learns is actually Zalachenko's son, making him her half brother. He buries her alive and leaves her for dead. He, like so many other men, underestimate the will of this woman, and will come to regret his actions, he actually buries her alive.  Lisbeth is nothing if not resourceful.<br /><br />Blomkvist & Co. of course, have uncovered all kinds of dirty secrets that are very far reaching, high too, way higher than they could have imagined, so high these well guarded secrets go all the way to the very top echelons of government. And these are the people who have long been guiding the fate of Lisbeth Salander. It is unthinkable, for even a portion of this to leak out now, it would bring disgrace and ruin to many respected figures who have held exemplary, above reproach careers within the Sapo Offices of The Swedish Government. These secrets and these officials reputations must be protected at all costs, even the ultimate one. Everywhere Mikael Blomkvist turns danger lurks, more than one person wants to shut him down, one way or another. No one knows who to trust, the secrets are so explosive just knowing them puts you at risk.<br /><br />The last third of this book is \\"The Trial\\" and it is a most compelling reading. You the reader, I pretty much guarantee this, will remain enthralled by not only the words that are written that comprise the story but also his gift for turning a phrase, as well for his surprisingly lyrical prose. The Trial of Lisbeth Salander is really about  two separate issues. The first being the aggravated assault and attempted murder of her father, Russian Defector Zalachenko. The second involves her right as a person to and her constant battles trying to prove she is not mentally ill. Her fight to remain free of Dr. Teleobrian, who you will remember from Books 1 & 2 as the psychiatrist involved in the cover-up which had her committed and who ruled her insane all those years ago is back at it again. And yes, they are trying it again. Even as she is recuperating from a bullet wound to the head! These Sapo people really want her out of the picture! She has agreed, grudgingly, for Anninka Giannini to represent her in her in court. Ms. Giannini being the sister of Mikael Blomkvist.<br /><br />Larrson does an incredible job keeping control of all these threads, weaving them in and out, drawing you in, moving everybody along to the finish after (what can be, at 820 pages) a very long ride that is well worth the time. I truly loved this book and was sad I finished it, because what a tragedy for the world when Stieg Larrson passed away, after the first beginnings of what most assuredly a very promising career as one of the elite in the field of publishing.Government.

0307352145|5.0|This book has opened my eyes to the people around me: friends, family, coworkers, and MYSELF! I feel like I understand myself so much better now and don't need to try to become something that I am not, even though our society tries to convince me otherwise. Cain's book is so applicable to so many real life situations and now I know how to handle myself in those instances. She provides meaning to why people are the way that they are. Now, I can classify the people I meet as \\"introvert vs. extrovert,\\" and because of this book, I will be able to treat each relationship according to Cain's philosophies.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|Tons of real, practical advice that we apply every day in our business. Ash takes the fuzzy art of entrepreneurism and breaks it into measurable, repeatable steps.
0439023513|5.0|The final book in the trilogy, really and truly brought so much to the series. It did not take the \\"live happily ever after\\" path that so many stories take. I believe this is truly what made the book. If only it was another 27 chapters longer.<br /><br />Suzanne Collins has greatly improved as a writer as well between the first book and last in this series, it made me almost want to take back my review on The Hunger Games saying she seemed inexperience.

0783225482|4.0|This movie always makes me laugh. Meryl and Goldie are a wonderful combination.  Bruce playing such a sissy man, is halarious.  The fight seen always has me rolling.
0132350882|3.0|I wanted to love this book, but instead I just sort of liked it. This book is a member of the extensive genre of books on how to write clean code. It sits alongside books like _Code Complete_ by Steve McConnell and many others. Where _Clean Code_ promised to differentiate itself was in the use of three case studies -- about a third of the book -- showing Martin's code cleanup techniques in action.<br /><br />However, I was disappointed by that section. As someone who codes and reviews code professionally, the case studies were not particularly enlightening. As seems obvious in retrospect, watching someone clean-up code in fairly straightforward ways is not interesting if you do and see that everyday. What I really wanted was a book on being a better code reviewer with advice on how to spot areas for improvement and convince others of the value of those improvements.<br /><br />The examples could be useful for someone who isn't in a code-review-heavy environment. Martin does a reasonably good job of taking code that may seem reasonable on the surface and improving its readabilty. That said, his comments indicate that he often has a higher opinion of the cleanliness of his end result than I do.<br /><br />As for the general advice and discussion of how to make clean code, I agree with a lot of his tips and disagree with others. Code cleanliness is an area where the core of just-plain-good ideas is surrounded by a nimbus of sometimes contradictory standards that people pick and choose from. The details of what you choose from the nimbus generally does not matter so much as consistency. (Of course, the real trouble occurs when people don't agree on what belongs in the core and what belongs in the nimbus.)<br /><br />The book definitely was not a bad read, but it did not fit my needs.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Admittedly, I just started reading this book. I'm actually in the foreword, the part about the woman who turned her life around. And this should be the basis for me trusting the rest of the book, but I got issues right away.<br /><br />First, the author admits in a note that the story of the woman is told by her and not confirmed by her researchers, though similar research apparently confirmed her story. Then he offers verbatim quotes of what the researchers told the woman. Really? Okay, I'm fine with some literary leeway in order to make the story readable. But then he describes how she visited the pyramids in Giza and the 'vast endless desert around them.' That's beyond me. A quick look at Google earth or a glance at a tourist guide could tell you that the pyramids are largely surrounded by Cairo's suburbs. That's just sloppy writing to add drama where it isn't even needed.<br /><br />So, with that as a start, I know I'm going to have some trouble believing this book. But I'll give it a try and report back later with my final rating. Maybe the message is worth it.<br /><br />Update: I've now finished the book. It offers some interesting insights (and some scary ones when it comes to Target tracking us). And it was a quick and easy read. Overall, though, it gets added to the list of books that take one premise, put all observations around that core idea and make you think you're reading an eye-opener. Malcolm Gladwell is the best one at doing this. Then you're done and you sum up the book to your friends and realize that for all that reading, the central idea was actually pretty thin.<br /><br />Still, I got some new insights, had a good time reading it, so I hiked my rating.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a great group of games that are easy to get addicted to.  The only reason I didn't give it a fifth star is the same issue I have wth these &quot;so-called&quot; &quot;free&quot; games is that to make any real progress is if you are willing to pay money to buy game points, game dollars, etc.
B0054LJGWS|1.0|Sorry to say that I thought this book was a waste of my money.  I could not plow through it, and I rarely give up on any book.  I couldn't find any sense in what was touted as a FUN read.  Not for me.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|Most business books weave a good story, but you don't get much out of them: the actionable tips and ideas can be summarized in about 3-5 pages. Running Lean breaks that pattern. It is an amazing business book filled with page after page of concrete action steps that will help you better understand your business, customers, market, and product.<br /><br />Running Lean is based in the so-called \\"Lean Startup\\" movement, which teaches startup founders to focus on learning while running their company, but its principles can and should be used for anyone interested in creating a new product line, entering a new market, or changing their business.<br /><br />This isn't a book about theory that sounds great in the classroom but doesn't work in the real world. This isn't a book about success stories that are impossible to emulate.<br /><br />Running Lean is a book about doing: it will teach you the steps you need to take to give your business the best chance it has to succeed.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Although I felt that some of the \\"story line\\" of this movie was very disturbing, especially, from<br />a \\"racial perspective\\", I nonetheless enjoyed it very much. The acting was superb, and the beginning and ending of it was satisfying. I do not always gravitate toward drama, especially, with<br />\\"racially charged themes\\", but this was quite interesting and well done.
B004XNPQUO|5.0|When I first saw this FAOTD, I thought to myself: wow, not another space shooter game.  But I was surprised...it's not a space shooter (well, not a standard shooter anyway).  If anything, it's more like a puzzle game just with a space theme.  Some of the levels take a bit of thought and a few retries to destroy all the ships and hit the achievement stars.  I usually dump space shooters after a couple of hours of play because they are all pretty much the same thing over and over again, but I'll be keeping this one for awhile (at least until completion).<br /><br />BTW, I don't have Adobe Air installed (and never will) and this app runs just fine.
B002O385GC|3.0|It's a fun movie, great for kids, lots of slap stick humor.<br /><br />  Had problems with the streaming though which interrupted our movie (I checked my connect, and the problem was with Amazon not my connect which was average over 25 Mbps at the time).  Don't mind poor streaming as much when its prime, but when I just paid for it I get unhappy, it ruined family movie night.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is really fun and my daughter and I enjoy playing it. it gives you challenges and I have yet to accomplish those goals. the owls are ruthless! Lol
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Good narrative of challenges of becoming a Navy Seal, becoming a sniper, and great insights into the wars we are involved in.  A gritty and true story of a great hero
B004NELBPC|3.0|I love reading the HuffPo for its variety.  This app is easy to use and easy to read.  The main gripe I have with this app is sometimes the slideshows don't load.  Also, most of the time the related content at the bottom of the article is not relevant.  Those are minor issues, though, as the articles load fine.
1451627289|3.0|since I read a Stephen King book.<br /><br />Loved Cujo, Misery, and this one short story dealing with \\"lady fingers.\\"<br /><br />I so struggled through It and The Stand.<br /><br />Overall, I'm no longer interested in the same type of books I was when I was in my 20s, but I was interested in King's 11/22/63 based upon the favorable NYT review.  Reading other reviews of the book that included King's discussing his fan base--horror, non-horror, and looking to find fresh blood--and recapturing those fans he's lost over the years, I pre-ordered 11/22/63 because of Amazon's price.<br /><br />I admit to enjoying the read within the first couple of pages, appreciating the late 1950/early 60 nostalgia on so many pages, the story line keeping me interested, my liking the various characters, the building up to Dallas, Dallas, and then...ya kidding me?<br /><br />I'm one of the few that was disappointed in the ending.  There was so much detail leading up to Dallas and then I found King's writing to \\"wrap it up\\" to reflect a \\"keep it under 1,000 pages\\" pressure.<br /><br />Three Things:<br /><br />Even though I did not like the ending, I'd still recommend 11/22/63,<br /><br />I look forward to reading another King book as long as it's not on the lines of It or The Stand;<br /><br />I'm not a fan of Kindle but lugging around this book made me seriously consider purchasing one.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I'm becoming more and more of an eBay addict and this app is helping fuel my addiction!  Easy to use for searching items, checking on auction deadlines, and checking the status of shipped items.  The only thing is, I can't check my purchase history which is fine--I have a computer for that.
1594203334|5.0|Just awesome to read, if you are open minded!<br />All future Moms/and actual moms should read that book.  Got some serious wake up calls regarding american parenting...  Lot of things changed at home after reading it.
B00526ZKYS|2.0|I had read some pretty good reviews of this book. But it was a big disappointment. The story about two young would-be-lovers is rather juvenile, but what makes it worse is the writing style itself is unbearably unimaginative -- I imagine a not very nicely written romance novel aimed at the teen market would be written like this.  If you are intrigued by the premise of the book -- love is considered a disease and the government mandates an operation at age 18 to cure the disease -- and want to find out how it plays out, it is mildly intriguing, but I found the going awfully painful and, in the end, not worth the trouble.
B0063IH60K|4.0|There must have been an update because I only get ads before every new deal and nothing has been random. the game itself is very smooth (I'm using the kindle fire) and I have no problem with the size of the cards. I do wish the card faces could be changed to more traditional looking cards, as the single big spade, etc. make them all look like aces.
B003EI2EH2|3.0|I like the whole concept this book presents but it is a long detailed read. I can appreciate all of the research Tim  did for this book but wish he had been a little more selective in giving it. I ended up buying the review that another author had out to get the basics that I was looking for. Of course didn't know that would happen before buying this book. lol
B006MQRLSA|5.0|This was an entertaining movie to watch and charters were well placed in the story line.  I'm real basic.  This was not a waste of time.  Glad we rented it.
B0002FR0TC|1.0|I will be returning this DVD. It does not work in my DVD player. There's a symbol \\"G\\" on it and when I try playing it, an error message comes up on my tv screen and says, \\"Disc cannot be played in this region\\". What ever that means! It must be a foreign disc which really upsets me.
B004EPZ0AC|5.0|I saw this movie in an IMAX theater in 3-D and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm 58 and I went with my daughter, my 5 year old grandson, my fiancee and her 14 year old son. Everyone enjoyed it. I liked it better than the first one and I liked the first. I'm not sure what people are expecting but it is a great family movie. No cynics need see this.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|what can I say about this cd that has not been said,  Garth was the pioneer in 'flying' across the crowds during concerts , he was the greatest at that time and still is today.  Will buy from this seller again
1449305172|5.0|Ash teaches how to apply theory and concepts in real life. If you'll follow the instructions and lessons in the book, you'll find yourself validating problems and building solutions that work for customers instead of just \\"reading\\" another book about startups.
0670020745|1.0|I think it is important to realize this is one person's account.  I actually find the account offensive and it leaves very little room for someone that had a different experience or thoughts.  I feel the account is just a story designed to sell books and get on Oprah.  The fact that she wants to make a movie about it says it all.
B005D0RDIE|5.0|Had pretty great seats.  They filmed my little section of friends but I guess we ended up on the cutting room floor. It was great live and it was great on DVD.  What else is there to say.  They just keep rolling along.  But wait, I didn't see the Paul Rudd segment on the DVD? Is it hidden or just not there?
B004XNPQUO|5.0|100 it is a good app. it is a very good app you should get it if you are good at solving things
B0006N2EZ0|2.0|This movie is embarrassingly bad and deserves every poor review it got when it first came out. I find it embarrassing to turn it on again having watched it for the first time a couple weeks ago and will throw out the DVD. The movie had really bad production values and seemed like a TV movie. All the acting is below par except for Kevin Costner, the script is LUDICROUS and makes light of the sister character's death, which defies belief. Whitney Houston's costumes are bizarre and not of that time or any time, something the director cooked up for no discernible reason except to objectivize her. There's nothing realistic about the actress' side of life, they tried to make the bodyguard activities realistic. You'd think they would have put more into the details of her life, but they made it super cheesey, gave her unbelievable, super naive employees, and convenient but unconvincing relatives. She doesn't seem that committed to her career, has no problems or issues to deal with other than safety, and it's hard to believe she'd be up for any award whatsoever, let alone a best acting award. The relationship between Houston and Costner is unpleasant, boring, and they have no chemistry.<br /><br />The director and writer deserve the blame for this movie and watching them on the DVD extra features they don't come off very well. Based on this movie they should stop making them.<br /><br />Whitney Houston could have performed far better had she directed by the right director. She's OK in a couple of scenes where she gets to show her desire to be with Kevin Costner. He doesn't seem to like her even when he does. Dopey.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really like this app...very entertaining for the children... they have not stopped playing it since it was downloaded...more points needed to open up more games quicker.... continue to make more games like this, its worth it...
B000QCS9NM|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was a light read, only took me a day to finish it but the story was very compelling and unique. I like this author's style of dark humor and sarcasm. It's interesting to see how he can change your view of a character from good to bad and back again. I would recommend this book!
B005LAIGZU|5.0|I really liked this movie,, it was I would say, intense, acting was par, but very good anyway, I would definitely go see it again
0307719219|5.0|Every once in a while, a book comes along that I want to recommend to every educated person that I know.  \\"Why Nations Fail\\" is one of these books.  Its authors advance a theory about success and failure of nations throughout history that seemed so obvious once I read it that I almost lost sight of how creative and robust it really is.  This is one of those books that has the potential of changing your view of the world forever once you have read it.<br /><br />Their theory (that institutions, whether \\"extractive\\" or \\"inclusive\\" are what make long-term economic prosperity and political stability possible within a polity) is not entirely without precedent.  A form of this thought arose as far back as the Enlightenment era when, as Jonathan Israel points out in his book \\"Democratic Enlightenment,\\" European thinkers clashed over whether societies like India or China lacked democratic institutions because of inherent geographic or cultural factors or due to more contingent historical factors that caused them to be poorly served by their ruling classes.  More recent efforts in this direction, however, tend to reflect the political split between left and right that may hinder original thinking.  (Thus, for example, Dierdre McCloskey's recent editorializing, in an otherwise interesting series of books about the bourgeois mind-set and economic progress, that government should be slashed to the bone.)<br /><br />\\"Why Nations Fail\\" is refreshingly free from knee-jerk political rhetoric.  The authors do not buy the ultralibertarian assumption that government's function is simply to \\"get out of the way\\" and let the chips fall where they may.  Their theory of a successful nation requires a government strong enough to centralize political power and prevent endless factional wrangling or exploitation by local elites.  (Speaking of antecedents, this insight was also expressed in a different way by Ramsey MacMullen in his books on the Roman Empire, when he noted that during the late Imperial period the weakness of central authority did not result in a libertarian paradise; instead, local land-owners were free to exploit the powerless, who had no recourse to a greater authority.)  The authors even have some praise for the ultimate democratic effect of the French Revolution, that bete noire of conservative thinking since Edmund Burke.  On the other hand, they believe that left-wing Communist governments were among the worst because their \\"extractive\\" nature, abusing people in favor of a self-defined elite, ultimately resulted in nothing more than failed states.<br /><br />What the authors are after is an \\"inclusive\\" society, where economic benefits and political power are shared among all segments of society.  Importantly, this does _not_ necessariy mean \\"socialism\\" or even a social welfare state.  There is a broad scope here for what \\"inclusive\\" means in terms of actual institutions, and a robust and free-wheeling capitalism has also led to societies the authors would call \\"inclusive.\\"  The only thing that is really off-limits is a situation where the government (or a group that the government is unable or unwilling to control) sees its role as extracting wealth and power from the common people.  The classic example of this, of course, is slavery or variants thereof.  But the authors provide a vast parade of good and bad examples, including the Mayans, Venetians, Romans, Chinese, England under the Stuarts, the Congo, the Spanish, the Dutch, the Soviets, the American Colonies, and the Turkish empire.  The book is full of historical anecdotes, in fact, that makes it a fascinating read.Imperial period the weakness of central authority did not result in a libertarian paradise; instead, local land-owners were free to exploit the powerless, who had no recourse to a greater authority.)

B000A0GXGA|1.0|I have never been so shocked at a purchase in my life.  I just knew there was a mistake when I purchased this product for $79 to only receive one disk with 3 episodes on it.  This is truly highway robbery. This is a gift that was specifically requested, however, I doubt the requester knew that only 3 episodes is on the disk.  I am returning this gift.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this buuuuuut.... I do not get how some of you have so much money and so much more space and stuff and food than I do!!! but I still love it and play every day!
B0051HNMTI|1.0|how is this the top free app.its not even free and to get good abs do pullups and situps. duhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. this is a stupid app. i would put 0 stars
B004LP3AYI|1.0|I would give the novel itself four stars. Not as good as Wizard's First Rule, but still quite decent.<br /><br />The kindle version, however, should get zero stars. The amount of errors in the book is just... laughable. I counted roughly FIFTY grammatical and spelling mistakes scattered around, along with an entire section completely out of place. Obviously, there was no proofreading done whatsoever. The frequency of such errors became distracting after a while, and I spent more time marking the mistakes than I did concentrating on the actual plot.<br /><br />Honestly, I have seen better care taken with fanfiction.
B0063GORYU|5.0|If you love playing cards you are going to love Spider!!! I just totally love to play this game as well! Giving five stars for perfection!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this game takes lots of skill my mom had it on her phone, so i got it on my kindle fire! it works great, so fuuuun!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the most excellent Bible app out there!!! And with youversion and all their reading plans you can't go wrong!!! I'm so very addicted to reading my bible now than I ever had been before!!!!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I have just recently started this app...and it great to have access to the Bible at my fingertips . I know the reading plans.I just happen to be reading one of Joyce Meyers books and one of the daily devotionals coincides with what I am reading.

B004VMUS9G|3.0|Hope it is a good app in the long run<br />I rate it decent could be better though give it some more time and see
B0035OC7PO|4.0|Well written, funny in places, easy to pickup anytime/place and gives you an insite of places most people will never visit. Worth a read.
B004XNPQUO|4.0|Fun and challenging game... simple controls but requires a lot of creative thinking... could have background music and better graphics but we'll worth the download.
B005FLX2WC|4.0|If you like blues, you'll like this cd.  Maybe some songs sound a little overproduced in places, but \\"I'd Rather Go Blind\\" alone is worth the price of the cd.  Etta James must be smiling in her grave.  Joe's guitar licks are especially good on this number too.  And Hart captures Billie Holiday's tone and mood perfectly in the title song.  This cd is easy to listen to by itself or when shuffled with others.  Miles just melt away on the freeway when I play it in my car.
B000KITQK2|5.0|I used this as a DI/ modular for my Martin HD-35, via a Dean Markley soundhole pickup.  It produced a warm sound that really matched the acoustics of the guitar played without amplification.  The only draw-back would be a lack of \\"muting\\" the output through the pedal.  The pedal only turns off/on the modulation, but doesn't mute the sound output.  Overall I am very pleased with this purchase.

The mouse game was aggravating as you can not skip it and I could find only one way to free the mouse finally after many tries.

0061733199|5.0|This is a great book for preparing anybody on challenges one may face in the wilderness. This book covers a very broad range of just about every aspect of wilderness in many environments and regions. The SAS survival Handbook covers a lot of very logical and primitive measure to take to stay alive in many scenarios. I would highly recommend it!
0439023483|1.0|I have to admit I wanted to like this book even if I knew it was for teens. Though I read the whole thing in a couple of sittings, I have to admit the book leaves you hungry for more....more substance, more plot, more story. It is as unsatisfying as an empty stomach. There is far too little background as to what happened in the past to make this world the way it is; far too little information about the Capital except \\"they are the bad guys, we hate them\\"; and not enough information about why i should care about Katniss or Peeta either for that matter. And for goodness sake, could there be any more food descriptions? If the writer had spent as much time on character development and storyline(WTF is with the mutts!?They just appear out of nowhere. If the games are always televised wouldn't they know about the mutts?)then maybe this book would be better. Here's hoping the movie is better.

B003XCVQ3C|5.0|So far their has been no flaws in the product. I on the other hand ordered without researching that it doesn't get sound. On the other hand for getting acces to more than one screen on my laptop where ever their is one accessible its great!! It is of course powered by the Laptop so I have to keep it plugged in, no biggy. I might be paranoid about the mini display jack but I like to keep it propped up and not hanging from the laptop. Just so it doesn't loosen the port up. Does everything its suppose to do.
B00785P2QC|5.0|awesome game! addicting and fun!<br />cool graphics. earn money when not playing the game. get free cash for certain achievements .

1609611543|5.0|When I bought the book Wheat Belly my life changed so much. For years I have struggled with food always being hungry even though I had just eaten till I was full. I would get light headed, my vision would become blurry and I just would feel awful. Little did I know the healthy whole wheat I was eating was causing me to feel this way. I highly recommend this book to everyone and not just those that need to lose weight, everyone who wants to live a very healthy energetic life!
B004SBQGHS|4.0|What the title is...... so, um. yeah. Really, save yourself a dollar, and just buy the version with adds, for free
0385341679|5.0|I can't rant and rave enough for this series. My little words and limited vocabulary just aren't going to do Mac and Ms. Moning justice. Suffice it to say that this novel, this entire series, gave me exactly what I wanted, what I needed from a book. When all faith had been lost in my favorite genre, all stories beginning to immitate the next, out walks Mac from the shadows.  Thanks so much to an author who opened Pandora's box for all of us. :)

0374275637|5.0|The topics that Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman addresses are both complex and integral to the human mind: He asks you to think about thinking by considering how your mind habitually contradicts itself, distorts data and misleads you. His prose is lucid, his reasoning rigorous and his honesty refreshing - more than once Kahneman illustrates conflicted thinking with examples from his own life. The result is a fairly slow read, but an ultimately rewarding experience. getAbstract recommends this book to anyone interested in neuroscience and neuroeconomics, and to all those who want to improve their thinking about thinking.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|this app is a great app but the only thing is u have to stay on the game non stop so the people will not be angry on the and also when the people get mad at u,u lose a bunch of money from your bank.

I don't know what I would have able to accomplish without his book Thanks Ash. Keep on iterating!

1935670913|5.0|Sometimes you read a book that you don't want to share/tell others about because you want the content/info all for yourself. This is one of those books.<br /><br />I've dipped my toes into the Kindle waters recently and have had some interesting results. I picked up Locke's book because, face it, ain't nobody who wouldn't want the same results. Will I see it? No. Locke is writing an entirely different kind of book with a different kind of audience but ... there is a ton in there for me.<br /><br />Locke is a writer with a big imagination and a ton of books. I'll admit, I've never read any of his fiction stuff (but probably will at least try, and I assume that's part of the reason why he wrote this thing) but what intrigues me is the system and the methodology by which he sells so many stinking copies.<br /><br />Is he Hemingway? No. Does it matter? No. That's not the kind of books he sells.<br /><br />It's one part understanding your audience, one part understanding the economics of digital books, one part social media marketing, and one part pure tenacity. All four parts are covered. No flowcharts or checklists here, mind you, but a pen and paper and a few hours and you could flow the whole thing out. I have, and it's on my wall, and I'm not sharing ;-)<br /><br />We're in a new age of publishing and this book does a better job of explaining it than anyone else. Yes, there are the Seth Godins of the world but they started in print and ended up eBook heroes. Funny thing is, John Locke started here, and they're now printing his stuff too.<br /><br />My whole Kindle/eBooks strategy has changed as a result of this book. I've already done a few things very differently and will have the rest of this year to put his stuff to the test. I'm even considering getting some software written to help me do what I learned in this thing.<br /><br />If you're ever considering playing the eBook game, you need to pick this thing up.<br /><br />One of my new years declarations was that I'd read a book every week. Join me on this journey? [...]

1451627289|5.0|The King could have mis-stepped easily with a subject so particular to so many minds, to postulate in a manner that would have been jarringly nonsensical, but his decisions on where to take it were, in my opinion, perfect...not wrapped up in a bow but wrapped in synergistic time-travel writing.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|I think if someone was to ask me to name the most underrated film in the last twenty years I would probably name this film. I know there has never been a film with so much heritage to live up to than this film. Think about it. How many Star Trek films have there been? How many fantastic versions of Star Trek are there? This film had so much to live up to a lot of people said no matter what was produced it would fail.<br /><br />All I can say is, that the first twenty minutes of Star Trek (2009) was the best minutes of any Star Trek production and possibly any sci-fiction film period. The first scene was just simply a masterpiece and there is no other way to put it. The first scene if there has been a perfect scene in Sci-Fi this was it.<br /><br />As the rest of the film, it was warp nine and phasers full the whole way. This film was like a explosion in that from the very beginning to the end it was pure adrenalin. I personally went in expecting an ok film, such as all the other Star trek films have been but I was so surprised. This film, for my money is as good as it gets. Sci-fi at its very best. It didn't take itself too seriously nor did it offend those of us who grew up loving Star Trek.<br /><br />The purpose of this film was if anything to reboot out minds in what to expect from this type of film. And it did with bells on.<br /><br />Plot wise it was nothing particularly deep, bad guys comes and the good guys have to defeat him, so it wasn't the plot of the film that made it so good it was the journey it took to tell the tale.<br /><br />For those of you who loved the very original cast, you will not be disappointed. It was so obvious that almost all the actors studied at great length their predecessors not so much in that they mimicked them but honoured their acting style and honoured the characters they originated. With two exceptions, Uhura and Chekov. However these two characters were never fully flushed before so the new actors re-invented them and made them so much more interesting and admirable.  Chekov is a boy genius and very likeable and Uhura exceedingly bright and refreshingly sexy. In the film her and Spock are a couple.<br /><br />So as you can see the film is amazing. The only thing I would ask is to watch it on a big screen with a good sound system. This film is supposed to be bigger than life and on a small screen it would lack so much.<br /><br />The extras on the DVD/Bluray are fantastic. The interview with Abrams on rebooting the franchise is great as so is the gag (blooper) reel. However, the deleted scenes steal the show. I would have paid the price of the DVD to just to get them. I wish they had inserted them into the film though.<br /><br />I think I have blubbered on enough about this film. Buy it and enjoy it. You will, I promise.them so much more interesting and admirable.  Chekov is a boy genius and very likeable and Uhura exceedingly bright and refreshingly sexy.

B00740FMTS|5.0|This book is really a wonderful back story for rapture and all of its characters. A quick read and absolutely a page turner.
B006OV7RQ4|2.0|Initially I thought the movie would honestly portray the conflicting life styles of one sister who's living as the trophy wife in a professional middle class material existence with her soul searching communal sharing sister. But, about a third of the way into the movie the uneven, over-the-top and exaggerated portrayals of each raised some flags. What's the point I asked myself? It got even worse when the script got into into typical media exaggerated stereotypes. The middles class family is focused on appearance, partying and the spotless oversized home. The commune sister joins the other young women as a household slave and as a sex slave to what might be inbred male members. The commune that professes sustained farming and similar ideals as a goal instead shoots cats, robs homes and kills innocent home owners.<br /><br />No real ending just another ambiguous ending too often a result of writers enamored with their own cleverness. If it's your story, you should finish it. Every beginning in life has a ending unless you're into infinite parallel alternative universes.

I get out of Openfeint and the app crashed! I deleted the app and redownloaded it hoping it wouldn't happen again, but just today, the same thing happened d on my Kindle Fire!

B005NPLXJ4|2.0|A collaboration of the two is/was an intriguing prospect --- to combine the Metallica sound with Lou Reed's noisy sort of free-form guitar playing, which I always liked. My reaction is that musically, the combination works well. The extended music interludes on Lulu are satisfying to me. Lou has often been at his best when he lets other musicians have deep impact on his music, like Velvet underground and Nico (Cale et al),  Rock N Roll Animal (Hunter et al), Take No Prisoners (Fonfara et al), and Blue Mask through Live in Italy (the great Robert Quine).<br /><br />Unfortunately, from the opener, Lou spews out random stream of conscious-sounding words like a mentally incontinent senile curmudgeon. Yes, Lou's &#34;vocals&#34; have always been difficult for non-fans; I am past that. But his lyrics over the years range from superior to abysmal; it's the latter here.  Claim it poetry, philosophy, art, interpretation, or whatever Lou Reed thinks makes this worthwhile - but it is little more than bad sounding words thrown front and center like someone relieving himself next to your table while you try to eat. In a twisted way, it is supposed to hurt the listener and evoke such response, which might work for a single pass through a museum, but not for enjoyment/listening pleasure.<br /><br />In contrast, Berlin (1973) also was a tough subject for a concept album, not a subject for listening pleasure so to speak, but on that he managed fine, coherent  musical composition and lyrics; it was worth revisiting a couple of years ago. But Lulu harkens back more to the aural assault on the listener (and record companies, and retailers, and whoever else was in its line of fire) that was Metal Machine Music; this time a verbal assault.<br /><br />I have listened end-to-end several times; again, some very promising musical moments, but the words too frequently disrupted the pleasure. Best analogy would be what Yoko Ono was to Live Peace in Toronto. If you like that, you can likely find a way to like this one. I never could.<br /><br />Two stars instead of one because I like the music in between the word shards; it is a long offering with good extended music periods (by both Lou and Metallica) and eventually I will find a way to filter out the really bad and leave some decent stuff with skipping and editing -- but not today.<br />Update 2014: It still sucks.<br />Update 2017: It still sucks.r could.

B004I744AS|5.0|I have this Farlex Dictionary along with Dictionary.com because it has quite a few featurettes that Dictionary.com doesn't have such as, \\"News of the Day\\", \\"Word of the Day\\" and the weather for your city to name a few. Overall, it's actually more useful than Dictionary.com. Like 'em both though!
B003F3FJQO|5.0|I liked The Scorch Trials as much as I liked The Maze Runner. This second novel picks up right where the first ended; that is, Thomas and the others are sleeping after escaping WICKED, supposedly safe. Thomas hears Teresa calling for help in his mind, but cannot get himself to wake up. When he does wake, he finds his rescuers hung from the ceiling, the windows bricked up, and Theresa gone. On her door a plaque says, \\"Teresa Agnes. Group A, Subject A1. The Betrayer.\\" An alarm sounds, the rescuers' bodies disappear, and the plaque changes to say, \\"Aris Jones. Group B, Subject B1. The Partner.\\" The Gladers also discover that they have tattoos on their backs. Thomas' says, \\"To be killed by Group B.\\" Rat Man of WICKED appears behind an invisible shield... By this point, Dashner has created several possible realities, and he nails down the uncertainty by having Rat Man tell them that in this second test they should not believe everything they see. An intense story follows, overflowing with suspense, action, mystery, and emotion-ending with a real cliffhanger. I must warn you that the violence gets grisly, but I couldn't put this book down, and it left me brimming with questions. I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review.

B004XNPQUO|1.0|The idea was appealing, but the execution is a bit sloppy. After you fire the missiles your own base disappears while the missiles loop and slingshot to your target. When there are multiple targets your shot includes enough missiles to hit all targets. So the objective is to fire a single shot to take out all the targets. Sometimes this means doing a full orbit around a planet to hit a secondary target.<br /><br />The game is 18MB, twice the size of yesterday's app that was laden with videos, and this game has no real motion to it. This coupled with the sticky intents permission point to a haphazardly coded app. With some revision and effort this could be a good game, but for now this is a pass.

B00479SVBU|5.0|This is a great little problem solver for not a lot of money. My car stereo only has an AUX port but not a USB port, so if I wanted to get away from cd's I had to either get an ipod which I don't want or  need,or get an aftermarket stereo which I didn't want. With the Soundfly Aux I can keep thousands of songs in my car on a handful of thumbdrives. It also accommodates SD cards as well. I can't  speak on the fm transmitter part of it as I use the aux cable, but for me it works great. ADDENDUM: It's been almost a year since buying this MP3 player, and it's still working just fine (and I use it every day for several hours a day). Judging from this product, I would buy another item made by Satechi without hesitation.

B006ISJQ1W|5.0|Do not try to pick this movie apart without first realizing exactly what is going on; Johnny Depp, who has done a magnificant turn as Hunter S. Thompson twice before, once as narrator, takes it on again... this time portraying him in 1960 Puerto Rico.  The movie takes most of its material from the Hunter S book of the same name, but rather then try to be really 'based' on the 'Story' (the book itself is more a diary then a story)  it is more about the actors paying homage to the characters as they envision them. Opposed to necessarilly how Hunter S. Thompson portrayed them.<br />This movie didn't have a narrator like other S. Thompson based films. (Ever check out a film called 'Where the Buffalo Roam' with Bill Murray?) I felt like it didn't need one. Johnny Depp is the public preception of Hunter S. His dialougue played out as if the whole thing was in the point of view of Hunter S's narrative... as opposed to being the acted out versions of actual narrative from the text itself, ala Fear and Loathing.<br /><br />Some of the bits were even adapted from other works. The characters in the book, for instance, never take morphine and stare at a lobster tank rattling off about the American dream. John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon are never mentioned in the book and there are instances where two characters in the book are combined into one (Sanderson is also Yeamon...and while Sanderson is succesful, he's hardly the Mad Men Playboy type we see here...) It's obvious that the film tries to combine all of Hunter S. into one story rather than just the young 1958 version that Hunter S. wrote it as.<br /><br />The movie takes you on a Hunter S. Thompson ride, not perfectly, but if you want perfect then read the books. This is some actors giving their own personal interpretations of the charcters they play.  The action unfolds under them into a noirish fifties paperback. The girl is sexy as hell, the cars are cool, the dialougue is sharp, the scenery is great, the music is wild.... The whole thing goes under...on to the next chapter... most likely, more twisted then the last, but how?....

B003L77GH4|5.0|Amazing show. Great actors and great storyline. All seasons are wonderful. And Ian Somerhalder is terrific as Damon plus he's so hot.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|This is the second book in the three book series. I knew I wanted to read it and I was anxious enough that I was willing to pay the price for it.  Overall, I liked it well enough and I am really looking forward to the final book.  It was more action than the first book- though I actually liked the first book more because of the way it set the stage.  And I must admit that I wish there was a little bit more of the love triangle in this book because I feel that I would like to see more plot line with the guy society chose for her so I can see why she's so set on being with someone else.  But based on the format of this book with the 2 characters alternating between telling the story, it is obvious who the girl will choose in the end.  As things are now, I just feel like I am being forced to want her to choose one of the guys that the author is spotlighting whereas I feel the whole situation needs to be expanded upon so I can make my own decisions as the main character is doing.  I hope to see that fulfillment in the 3rd book so I can feel satisfied with the author's ending
0756404738|4.0|I just finished reading the second book in the Kingkiller Chronicles. As I experienced with the first book, I was frustrated to end the story so soon and with so many open questions. (I hope Rothfuss does not take 5 years for the last volume).<br /><br />Kvothe once again proves to be quite the character, with his magical inventions, his confrontation with the fae, his brutal training with Adem mercenaries and his unique ability to find trouble--whether from his lovely Denna, or the Lord Maer. And all by the age of 17!<br /><br />I thinks what surprises me most about Patrick's writing is that it seems less like a novel than the recounted adventures of a close friend. And I am once again hanging on the edge, waiting for the next chapter.

0316017930|4.0|\\"Outliers\\" is a book about the interplay of luck (or good fortune) and ability in explaining individual success.  Gladwell make a strong case for the importance of being the right person, at the right place, at the right time, and acting upon the opportunity.<br /><br />The book left me thinking about questions about a related, but slightly different, topic.  Why do some organizations attain great success and have the ability to maintain that success over time?  What is the interplay (if any) between the elements of great personal success and those of sustained organizational success?<br /><br />The book is well written, engaging, and thought provoking -- a good read.
B005ETA5K2|1.0|I bought this one wifi antenna due to its compatibility with OS X lion and holy hell, it craps on the alfa awus036h that I previously used. I switched because the chipset used in the awus036h is no longer supported to work with lion. Although there was a work around to getting the awus036h to work with lion, it wasn't really a solution since I was required to boot into 32bit instead of using the native 64bit. With the awus036h I would connect to my network with an average 80% signal strength, this bad boy connects me to 100% consistently! I have not tested to see if it is fully operational to work in backtrack 5 yet. But I am definitely happy with this purchase.<br /><br />*UPDATE*<br /><br />So its been about a month since I purchased this unit. Sadly this unit took a dive for the worst. The unit still powers but cannot find many networks compared to what it used to find. Initially I would pick up roughly 15 surrounding networks and now I can only 3 networks. My macbook pro's network card can find more networks.  It worked great for the time I had it but its crap now...

It's so disturbing, and disturbing to see so many 5-star reviews from people who think this was a good relationship.<br /><br />People, this is NOT a healthy relationship. Travis is NOT a romantic hero. He needs help. Abby can't make a decision she sticks with. She needs help too, but not as much help as Travis. Of course, within a few years she'll probably need a LOT of help when Travis realizes she didn't solve all his problems and starts beating her.<br /><br />***********SPOILERS****************<br /><br />If Travis were REALLY a romantic hero for the current generation, here's how the end would have gone. He would have said, \\"Abby, I love you, but I'm screwed up. I would only end up hurting you, physically and emotionally, and I don't want to be that guy. I am going to go to therapy and learn anger management and respect for women. I've heard that women actually AREN'T all madonnas or whores, but I need to really believe it. I need therapy and I need to mature for a couple years, and you do too. Let's give it a few years, grow and mature, and try to overcome our issues, and then try again.\\"<br /><br />Yeah, that didn't happen. TEEN MARRIAGE DOESN'T SOLVE PROBLEMS. I can't believe this book didn't end with one or both of them dead. Instead, it has a happy ending that isn't really happy, because...TEEN MARRIAGE DOESN'T SOLVE PROBLEMS. Marriage isn't going to cure Travis of being a stalker. He's only going to become more possessive and dependent on Abby, who now has no identity except as \\"Mrs. Maddox.\\"
B006X8GFBQ|4.0|Before I launch into my review, how can it be that the Kindle version ($21.96) costs so much more than a hardcover version ($17.43)?  It was enough to make me think twice about buying this at all, but in the end I bit the bullet and went with the immediate hit of the Kindle.<br /><br />Anyway, kudos to Reynolds for a novel that I felt is written in a very different voice to his other work.  It is hard to pull this off across so many pages, but Reynolds normal aggressive, punchy style is toned down for a more languid pace that reminded me of Kim Stanley Robinson and Neal Stephenson.<br /><br />He has also toned down the technology in some regards, which is a blessing and a curse, because Reynolds has a first-rate imagination and usually channels that into some very sexy kit, most of which was either totally enigmatic (\\"[[ASIN:0441015026 Pushing Ice]]\\") or leaning toward the explosive end of town (think the \\"[[ASIN:0441009425 Revelation Space]]\\" series).  Of course, there is still a ton of high-tech gadgets and wizardry, but they are a supporting cast not really exciting in their own right.<br /><br />The plot is straightforward enough: a set of mysterious clues from a recently departed doyen of a solar-system wide trading family lead a recalcitrant brother and sister on a merry chase, causing them to clash with their cousins and thrusting them into a web of debt and deception to fund their search.<br /><br />Of course, it's what you do with the plot that matters and Reynolds has never been shy of painting on a canvas as large as the universe itself.  This time his scope seems limited to near-Earth (in galactic terms at least) though he does introduce a bit of a curve ball about half way in that expands the protagonists horizons somewhat.<br /><br />I really liked that Reynolds got us under the skin of his two main characters in a way reminiscent of Iain M. Banks and Michael F. Flynn.  Their emotional state is laid bare; their motivations explored; and their lack of self-awareness gently raised so that we can fully appreciate the tone and tenor of 'why' they are doing what they do.<br /><br />So far so good.<br /><br />But, I really, really, really dislike ambivalent heroes.  And lead character, Geoffrey Akinya, is one of those \\"I'd rather be anywhere than here\\" types who is actually more than ambivalent (though such traits surely are not allowed in this utopian future?).  He is pushed and pulled by anyone and anything, displaying very little backbone, in a way that my pop psychology brands as passive aggressive (indeed, Geoffrey actually does get physically aggressive, at which point the overarching 'Mechanism' that monitors everyone's thoughts and actions steps in and punishes him for such lowly intent).  Perhaps you can blame it on the Mechanism, but Geoffrey seems to accept 'debts' accrued on behalf of others as his own way too readily, especially given that he's eschewed the Family for so long.  And the less said about his elephant fetish the better!<br /><br />His sister, Sunday, is way less passive and so I found her way less annoying than Geoffrey.<br /><br />But both siblings, having stepped out of the family to pursue their own objectives, can be pretty frustrating.  And perhaps there is a degree of \\"why are they doing this\\" in their system-wide steeplechase, because they'd spent so long actively fighting being part of the Akinya trading empire that suddenly lurching into action seems counter to their nature.  (To Reynolds credit, his characters do explore this conflict and come to no more clear conclusion than I could.)<br /><br />Even less credible for me was the Mechanism.  Everyone on Earth is patrolled, both physically and mentally, to the point that they'd make those housewives in \\"Valley of the Dolls\\" look positively manic.  Fortunately, the Mechanism does not intrude too much on the story arc, and is used a couple of times to prod Geoffrey along in the right direction.  So that's OK I guess, because once you start to think about such power being deployed you can't but think about such power being abused and despite the references to resource wars and global warming, the \\"we've come through bad times but we're better people now\\" does not really stand up to scrutiny against human nature.<br /><br />But those are minor niggles.  \\"Blue Remembered Earth\\" has strong enough themes painted on a wide-enough canvas that it remains enjoyable even as I shout from the sidelines for Geoffrey to just \\"F****N do something\\".  There are various bit players, whole ecologies of transformed humans and a couple of bad guys in the Akinya twins Hector and Lucas (who would have been killed at birth by the Mechanism if there was any justice in the world).<br /><br />Plus loose ends sufficient for a sequel.<br /><br />Reyonlds writes good sci-fi and this another of his books that's worth a read.  I'd think that if you've enjoyed Kim Stanley Robinson \\"Red Mars\\" trilogy, China Mi&eacute;ville's \\"Perdido Street Station\\" or Neal Stephenson's \\"Reamde\\" then you'll find \\"Blue Remembered Earth\\" equally satisfying.art to think about such power being deployed you can't but think about such power being abused and despite the references to resource wars and global warming, the \\"we've come through bad times but we're better people now\\" does not really stand up to scrutiny against human nature.<br /><br />But those are minor niggles.  \\"Blue Remembered Earth\\" has strong enough themes painted on a wide-enough canvas that it remains enjoyable even as I shout from the sidelines for Geoffrey to just \\"F****N do something\\".

0062082353|5.0|I watched Chris on Imas in the Morning and had to read his story. I believe that everybody entering the miltary service should read this to learn the real hardships on married life. Chris was extremely fortunate to have married a strong level headed woman. As any veteran can tell you that Dear John letters and failed relationships are abundant in war. I shared some common interest with Chris. I owned the same BB guns as a kid, I wanted to be a cowboy and rode bulls and bareback horses and worked on ranches, I started chewing tabacco at the ripe old age of 14. But due the fact I started wearing glasses about the same time I gave up dreams of being a piliot or sniper ect. and just wanted to get in and get out of the service. I was married only 6 months when I went to Viet Nam we didn't have text messages or cell phone so the separation and poor mail service was torture. I was empathic with the rules of engagement that Chris had to deal with. That is the biggest reason that we should not be in places like Viet Nam, Irac, and Afganistan. It is just wrong to train a warrior to kill and then send him to trial for his action. If we would declare war then the rules would loosen up and a lot of that would be included as causualties of war. I am really greatful to Chris for his service and to his wife who deserves just as much praise for her sacriface. Having his wife incert her feelings throught the book added a great personal touch. I was glad that Chris paid tribute to Carlos Hathcock, who is the Babe Ruth of snipers. I also enjoyed his mention of Marcus Lattrel, I wish everyone could see the statue of Danny Dietz, one of the heroes who was with Marcus, The Lone Suvivor. On a side note I wonder if Chris knew that a Seal Team mate of old scruf face is a local in Steamboat Springs. The one critism I have with the book is the use of the f-bomb but we expect that from Texans. Last there is a missed spelled word on page 109.
B004KV92ZE|4.0|Loved the sequel and thought it was very funny. Enough to keep an adult interested but easy enough for my three year old to enjoy.
B0051HNMTI|5.0|Seriously why don't u &amp; ur fellow trolls try to do all of us a favor by leaving something like USABLE REVIEWS. If superman75 leaves reviews (1 star or otherwise) at least he's...ummm FUNNY. Please let's leave the humor to those who are...ummm..how would u say...FUNNY.<br />I'm ordering this app based on REAL REVIEWS!
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|OK, It's not Dawson's creek, but with a character named Dawson I had to get that in. I am a Nicholas Sparks fan from notebook days on. This book didn't hit me as hard as that, but it still jerked a few tears. Don't read without tissues nearby!
0553801473|4.0|As many other reviewers have noted, this book spends most of its time moving characters into place for the end of the series. Its value stems more from its place in the series than from anything else.
0307454568|5.0|Stieg Larsson deserves all the kudos he's received for his amazingly well crafted books. He's an icon in his genre of criminal mystery novels.  Larsson leaves no loose ends. He ties together the many complex subplots he develops in each book.  Many less skilled mystery writers trick readers, misleading them down blind alleys to suddenly come up with surprise endings, often leaving their readers feeling cheated. Larsson maintains his readers' interest without deception or trickery.<br /><br />  For the best reading experience the reader should read all three of Larsson's wonderful Millenium Series books in sequence since they build on each other. This is especially true in regards to reading The Girl Who played with Fire before The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.  Larsson's third and final book follows the lead characters he developed in earlier books and directly takes off from the point where his second book left off to conclude his plot. Larsson's masterfully crafted grand finale successfully ties together themes he developed in all three books to deliver a satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />  Reading the almost 2200 pages of material these three paperbacks offer may seem  gargantuan to some readers.  However, the pages seem to fly in what are exceptionally well written novels featuring interesting, complex, and very human characters. Although Larsson's villains are pretty one-sided: all-bad and lacking any socially redeeming character traits, his leading characters which appear in all three books are sufficiently well developed to have character flaws.  Larsson designed multiple intricate plots to maintain the reader's interest in the complex imaginary world he created which he ties together before concluding each book. It is doubtful this reader in unique in wanting to just keep on reading, regretting Stieg Larsson's premature death, and wondering what it would be like to read Larsson in the original Swedish
B006IGZWB2|5.0|The movie moved me to tears. This is a good and movie and a good story too. It brings life how people struggle to present their problem in the prescence of fear and retalition.
B004XNPQUO|4.0|I watched the video and loved the concept of the game.  Sadly, all I get is the black screen.  Maybe they will fix it someday.  I'm just happy it was a freebie.  it has potential.<br /><br />After realizing Adobe Air is required, I installed it and the game work as advertised.  I've only played it a little bit but I do really like it<br /><br />V^^^^V<br /><br />After playing the game quite a bit now, I really like it a lot.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book is well written and everything in the story just fits. Even though it is set in a world that is not like ours, the events never strike as improbable. Good build up of characters. It makes you feel intensely for those living under war circumstances.
B0051HNMTI|5.0|How does she get her hair to fall the same exact way every time?  Craziness!!  Pure, pure craziness, I tell you!
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|I got hooked the first episode of Season 1 and have watched each episode after that 3 more times. I could not get enough of the show and the characters. It was a masterpiece classic. I bought the Blueray dvd of Season 1 and anticipated for news about what to follow. It was a long wait for the much anticipated Season 2 and for the icing on the cake, The Christmas Episode.  When it came, it was worth all the waiting and the wishing and the guessing on what will happen next and the beloved characters came out rolling with a punch.  I have watched each episode on PBS over and over again and subequently bought the Bluray dvd and enjoyed watching each episode over and over again.  The actors are phenominal. The show touches your heart and your spirit. Now, I can not wait for Season 3.
0307352145|5.0|First, I didn't love every paragraph. Some of it seemed off target, but as an introvert who married into a family of mostly extroverts...who lives in a world of extroverts, who has learned how to be more out there--it is a joy to find a book that speaks about we who are exhausted by noise and others. Give it a whirl.
B005K17RU0|5.0|great weather app! I installed this on my kindle and it looks great! You can customize the color on the screen too! love!!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|The week that PBS ended Downton Abbey Season 2, my DVD copy with extra scenes arrived in excellent condition. No problem with this vendor.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Got this as the FAOTD and am impressed.  Can't find anything wrong and it's immensely fun: )<br /><br />Try it you won't regret it...
0545425115|4.0|Having just finished the book, I have mixed feelings.  The book inarguably starts out phenomenal.  I'm typically a bit of an ADD reader, but I was rivited to this book.  About 1/2 to 2/3 of the way through, I thought it lost a bit of its thunder and didn't live up to its beginning.  But I think it comes down to what you were expecting out of the book.  Without giving anything away, the theme I was expecting/hoping to see really hammered home seemed to fizzle into a side note.  So it seemed a bit of a disappointing finish.  But depending on what you're looking for, this will either be a fantastic book, or, at the least, and intriguing read.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|I too am one that is old enough to remember when MTV actually was a Music television Videos. This series is so much better than oh lets just say the trend of seeing how the younger generation has taken morals to a new low. I am tired of seeing how many times you can get drunk and make idiots out of yourselves.<br />This series is both entertaining and keeps you guessing. It can go in so many directions with all new plots all the time. GOOD JOB to all involved in this
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Wonderfull acting, witty writing, and complex characters.  This second season of Downton, though it didn't quite top the first season for me, was still my very favorite show of the year.  Extremely well done and definately worth purchasing.  the only drawback:  It's never long enough!
0393312836|5.0|A Clockwork Orange is an interesting book worth reading for almost any (age-appropriate) audience.  It's not a long novel, and not a difficult read, aside from the use of unfamilar slang; I never had too much of an issue with the slang, but a few words took some heavy contextual reading to figure out for me, when I first read the book at the age of 14.<br /><br />The beauty of this book is that, despite its simplicity, it still presents philosophical points about morality and the development of a young teen in his maturing to adulthood.  The choices he makes have a great impact on his present and his future.<br /><br />I would agree with other reviewers that this is one truly left best to the imagination.  If you have the opportunity to read the book before seeing the movie, you won't regret it.  The book became one of my favorites before I ever saw the movie, and I don't have much interest in the movie as a result.  I don't know what your experience will be if you view the film first, but my recommendation is to read the book first to capture the elegance of Burgess's writing at certain points which, while novel in film, do not strike the same philosophical cords as strongly in my opinion.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|This book would have been much better had it not become a series. I somewhat enjoyed reading it but the other two books killed even this partial enjoyment. I was hoping something more interesting will come along but was let down by the lengthy gruesome books.
0812973992|5.0|This is a beautifully told story about life, love, committment, and redemption, all set with the backdrop of the August 1974 tight rope walk of Phillippe Pettit across the twin towers.
B000UJ48UO|5.0|I enjoy the beginning part of this movie, during the training.<br />But the part when they go to war , It's a little bit dragging.<br />Anyway, I usually watch the beginning part of the film, I enjoy it.
B006QKKMBA|4.0|Was on the gorrie side, but all and all it was a good movie that keeps u on the edge of seat. And ends with a twist, not like in the other movies.
B00124BNF4|5.0|This is a great collection of their hits. . The recordings are very clear and the songs never sounded so good! I enjoy the downloads very much
B0054JZC6E|4.0|game includes a lot of very simple games.  haven't played long enough yet to learn about unlocking more games.  also have yet to suffer any problem with an update.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|After deciding to declutter and minimize stuff around my house, this was an awesome first book to get me started.  With a family of 4, it's almost impossible to become a  minimalist, but Francine helps you to cut back on the unnecessary clutter.  Thank you!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this set of games is a lot of fun and I enjoy playing it. this set of games has variety and different options.
0553382179|5.0|A truly inspirational and amazing book!  I've followed the fly lady for years, but until I purchased the book did I really truly benefit from her teachings!  Thank you!!
B004XNPQUO|5.0|The name alone had me excited to give this game a shot. I have to say that the controls are intuitive yet simple enough to learn quickly. There is lots of content and it's the type of game that can be expanded easily. Kudos!
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Midnight in Paris<br /><br />If you have, as I, followed the career of Woody Allen from the early days, and one of his great fans, you will like this movie, because it is a fresh dose of Allen shtick. The elements of this shtick are: upscale, self-absorbed couple, usually a writer (guess who?), swank dinner parties, elevated conversation on art, politics, etc., man in emotional crisis, infatuated with an elusive, unobtainable beauty, and all the while counseled by a father figure. We've seen it all before, from Annie Hall, onwards, which made Allen's films, while flawless movie-making, all a bit dull and predictable.<br /><br />While he uses his same ol' shtick, Midnight in Paris is different. This movie after all is about a love affair, yes, but Paris and the lost generation of American expatriates and other avant garde artists living in Paris in the 20s are subjects. The script is inventive and orginal, and the characterizations of Hemingway, Fitgerald, etc., are dead-on. So while the elements of the Allen shtick are present -- I mean, who talks about art in their daily conversation, anyway? The only time the people I know talk about painting is when it covers the walls -- the movie is fresh, alive, and original, and a joy to behold. Owen Wilson especially seems to have been born to play this role. He is, as Allen remarked, a natural actor.<br /><br />So if you like Woody Allen but think he had gotten a little predictable, try this movie out. You will like it.
B0015AARJI|1.0|It is a good controller for the price functions normally, yet the plastic doesn't feel like OEM does. I bought one from Walmart after getting this one and the one from Walmart was just like OEM. This controller got little weird analogs they got jerky glide to them seems like  worn out got lots of play \\"loose\\". If you just need a cheap controller i recommend this one. IF you have 50 bucks to spent just get one from target walmart or Gamestop!!<br /><br />L2 stopped working with in 2 month stay away its fake. Just get a real controller
B0067Q42BY|1.0|Before I bought it I checked to see if it was compatible with my kindle fire. It said that it was. so I bought it. Now it won't download on to my kindle.  I want my money back. It has never even been put on to the device. Waste of money and time.
B0048WQDIE|5.0|I just wanted to throw my own review in here with the hundreds of others since this my favourite book. I was always a reader since I was very young, but this was the first book that I ever read that made me want to dissect it. It made me understand why classes and in-depth reviews and studies are done. I scrawled notes on every page.<br /><br />The book can be difficult to read for some. Chronologically, it's broken, and it rewards people who read it in as few sittings as possible. I find it amazing that such a shattered story can make so much sense and be so wonderfully strange and understandable at the same.
B005EGXNLS|5.0|You know you are reading a great author when you are worried about the survival of a character who is narrating the book!  Cornwell keeps you on the edge of your seat in Uthred's adventures and you forget everything but the moment.  I can't wait to see what is next for Uthred.
B000FC130E|3.0|The writing was good, but I never felt very connected to the characters. The whole story seemed rather rushed. The premise was interesting, but I never felt fully engaged in the world the writer had created.
