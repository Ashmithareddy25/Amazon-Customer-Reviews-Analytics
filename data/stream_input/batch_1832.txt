158270208X|5.0|Lovely book, with beautiful uplifting and inspiring quote throughout. Very well made with a ribbon book mark (oh, how I love the little thoughtful things like that!) I use mine everyday...Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!
B0009MAO46|5.0|when I watched this movie in a theater for the first time, I thought it was fantastic.  And this DVD proves me right.  It has everything you remembered from watching it in the theater and the &#34;Special Features&#34; section is just fantastic as well.
B000W796OM|4.0|My granddaughter is the one that wanted this movie! I ordered it and it showed up quick and in great condition!!! Love Harry Potter Movies!!
B003Y5HWK4|5.0|Anyone who loves the back in the day movies, will love this prohibition era series. We have loved every episode and highly recommend this series
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is so fun for all ages. I have downloaded the game two times ha ha. its so cute and has a lot to do in the game.
B005LAJ1HW|5.0|Started watching this show and now we are hooked, great show and series. Very entertaining and a history lesson to boot.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The best book I ever read!!!<br />I enjoy the characters thoughts and how Katniss is so brave to fight in the Hunger Games again.  The Hunger Games is awesome.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I'm writing this review after the Newtown shootings and can tell you there seems to be nothing in this book that Dr. Alexander relates to us that helps make any sense of what om had in mind when it was decided our souls would spend time in this meat suit and deal with the \\"restrictions\\" of our physical minds. In fact,  the opposite seems true, if we can do no wrong, then noble and ignoble acts have the same value, if the only goal is experience. The bad news is, if you opted for this experience because of your spiritual shortcomings, you'll probably have to purchase the sequel. Does this sound familiar?
B0064NTZQ2|3.0|I watched the pre-screener version of this movie so I was extremely disappointed when I received this and it wasn't the same one I had watched. Unfortunately I think the only way to get your hands on a pre-screener version is to bootleg it. The film is still good but the pre-screener had better music and I liked the pre-screener ending better. I also higly recommend watching the 70's film &#34;The Driver&#34;.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I've watched a lot of zombie movies throughout the years but this one outdoes all the rest. Maybe it's because it has a great plot vs. a simple &quot;kill all zombies&quot; theme. Whatever it is, i really enjoy it and so does everyone in my house!
0307895475|3.0|I would have liked it more if the text was not so hard to read. I found going to Google has been a better choice because I can at least size the text in the browser to be able to read it. Trying to read such a large book with a magnifying class is a pain in the you know what.
B004QKNXIQ|1.0|I was not impressed by this movie and could not watch it past 15 minutes.  I am afraid that after Aladdin, most of the animations Disney has put out seem the same.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This was a great tribute to Ms. Grandin as well as to HBO. I thought the production was well done and has led to a greater appreciation for the benefits of being different rather than trying to &#34;fit in&#34;. Of course, like most things, the trust and self confidence begins at home.
B002GHHHKG|5.0|Was shiped to me on time. Was packaged right arrived  in good shape. Like the movie. The movie  wasn't expensive.
B005G5PPGS|4.0|It took me years to get to it, but I'm glad I finally read it.  A fascinating story/read.  I do believe that there is \\"something\\" to  style of thinking about baseball; however, I do still believe (and I think history has shown) that talent ultimately wins out more often than not.  I know, I'm still a heathen.
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|I enjoy playing this app during the Christmas season. It doesn't have a lot of easy songs on it. Even the normal songs seem kind of challenging. I have the free version of Piano Master as well. It seems to have some easier songs to play.
B000VECAEO|4.0|i hate that this is the last season cause i  love seinfeld but again some dvds pick randon times when they want to play or maybe a dvd won't work at all??? not sure what's that about but over all good dvds and great show!
1451648537|5.0|I've never really been drawn to biographies, but this book is fascinating from beginning to end.  Not knowing too much about Jobs beforehand, I walked away with a very deep sense of respect for his efforts to \\"make a dent in the universe.\\"  His very eccentric, often obnoxious, behavior and his unique hippy/hacker philosophy make him one of the interesting people I've ever read about.  I've often felt a CEO's effect on a company is typically vastly overstated.  However, after reading about Jobs' drive and perspective, it became clear that even though he did very little of the actual programming behind Apple products, it is distinctly his vision.  Likewise the actual influence he had on modern society and culture is not to be underestimated.  Finding out about some of the huge breakthroughs Apple has contributed to technology (the first word processor, the first graphical user interface) and taking a step back to understand the way Jobs' products have changed several media industries (music, retail stores, computer animated movies, advertising) made the entire book very enjoyable.
B00005LOUQ|5.0|We bought this movie when it first came out after we had seen it in the theaters.  Jim Carrey makes the entire movie and I don't think anyone else could of pulled the role off as well as he did.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game! It is so fun and easy. I wish there were different levels but this works. I love how you can choose characters.  best of all its FREE! !!!!!!!<br />YAY!!!!!!!!!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Does what it says...I use the clock every nite for the source of time...illuminates just as it says, so glad it has different tones to choose from for the alarm...no need to upgrade if you don't care about the music to wake up to...
B007PVHANM|5.0|Amazing DVD finally one that you can learn so much about him. Family and friends documentary and also him speaking,, where he grew up, the political rivalties and how he really dies. Soo inspirational smart, given, a trully rasta man, just get it!!
B004AKCME8|5.0|I wanted to see this when it was in the theaters and I missed my chance. Picked it up on the &#34;fly&#34; and I don't regret it, just wish I had a bigger tv because, wow, what AMAZING animation. That alone makes this film worth seeing. That being said, it is *not* a young child's film, it does get a bit violent and sometimes disturbing. I also have to mention, I've never read the books (and I'd say 95% of the time the book is better- not that you can compare a few hundred pages or more of detail condensed into a 2 hour movie). I am positive there are plenty of details in the story that was left out because the plot line and background is not always totally clear but you can follow it fine. I just can't give it less than a 5 because the intention with the story is very well-meaning and inspirational (good vs evil, typical of youth/animated films), and I just can't say enough about the beauty of this film. Visually awe inspiring. I lost my breath a few times.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|Dickens well done!  Beautiful, moving characters as only Dickens can create and Andrew Davies can bring to life in film.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|While this is apocalyptic fiction,in light of recent real events,12/14/12, I found everything a great read has. Suspense, real and well developed characters, creative and fresh plot, with hope in each book. Have already recommended to all my fellow readers.
B000X2H8G4|4.0|This device seems to work well on listening to TV or a specific sound. What you need to remember is it will pick up all sounds. If it is quiet and your listening to TV or talking with somebody it seems to work well. If there is more than one noise in the room it can get disturbing.
B000IDGDPA|3.0|Don't remember much about it. More More Mofe More More More More More More More More More More More More
081297381X|5.0|well written and engaging material. highly recommended for anyone interested in the 'what if', or a more analytical approach to other nagging existential questions.
159514188X|5.0|This compelling novel is centered on a boy named Clay Jensen thinking he is the reason for Hannah Baker's suicide. He is sent a box of tapes and each tape describes one of the many reasons Hannah decided to kill herself. Thirteen Reasons Why depicts the hardships of the teenage years and how some people are pushed too far. This book is an essential read for adolescents, especially those attending public high school. It is a great example of how every little thing you say to a person and how you treat them can impact a person more than you think. Those reading this novel should be mature and aware that these issues are harsh. This book can be a good read for anyone, but sensitive readers should read with caution. Thirteen Reasons Why will leave you haunted with every turn of the page.
B00A757EFW|4.0|I like the game it's like the origanal.but I do not like the controls very much.it does not have any lag and its fun I enjoy it.its a cool game and I think you will like it to!!!!!!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Looking forward to the next book. Not happy about the wait, I am hooked on the lives and journeys of these demigods
034580404X|5.0|Haven't heard of this book until my friends told me about it. It's one of those books you just can't put down.
B000MKD9P6|5.0|I ordered this for my daughter. I saw the movie when it came out a few years ago and I enjoyed it.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|I've always felt the series starts strong and fades a bit, but a compilation worth getting for fans. Really liked the audio commentary by Ridley Scott, which helped explain how things went off the rails a bit.
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|I loved this film. This is a gift for my sixteen year old daughter who had this movie on her Christmas list.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|Great difficulty, nice hint system, a map, and pleasant graphics make a nice adventure with Nikola Tesla. Fully recommend to all.
1451695195|5.0|Eben Alexander is a neurosurgeon who became very ill with bacterial meningitis. He was put on a ventilator and was in a coma for many days. While in a deep coma, Eben left earth and he went to heaven. This book is his account of what he experienced in heaven. His descriptions of the afterlife are so beautiful and comforting. You will want to pass the book along to everyone in your life.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It catches your attention in every page love this book,clearly written and understood :) you should definitely read the book !
B003ZHR6RK|5.0|My 16 year old son had this film on his Christmas list. I saw it a couple of years ago and I did enjoy it as it has a great storyline.
B009MO5960|3.0|\\"My name is Alice and this is my world.\\" Alice (Jovovich) is back and is once again fighting off zombies. This time though she is stuck in a building the Umbrella Corporation has set up that no one has escaped from. But as you all know by now nothing is impossible for Alice. This review will be pretty short. This is the fifth movie in the series and for those that have watched the other four I'm sure you will end up watching this one too. For those that haven't seen any of them they all tie together so it's best to watch them in order. I will say that this one had the coolest opening of any of them and this one had more of a video game feel then the others as well. Again though this is one that you will already see or not see no matter what I say so I will just say that this was fun to watch and had a ton of action. Overall, another fun and exciting addition to the series. I give it a B.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Amazing Xmas gift! Exactly what I wanted. Got it within 3 to 4 business days after placing order. Extremely nice packiging and got 5 disc and a really nice collector book showing arts and making of the movies. More than what I needed. Got all 3 movies for less than 9 bucks each. Highly recommend it!
B0092QITO2|3.0|\\"Maybe I need my mind messed with.\\" Dennis Quaid (Farrell) is tired of his boring life. One night on an impulse he goes to a place called Recall to get a new memory that he can look back on. While there something goes wrong and Quaid finds himself the target of very powerful people, and his wife...or does he? For those of you (like me) that grew up with the original movie this is probably one you were looking forward to but hesitant to see (at least I was). I will have to say that it was better then I was expecting. There were quite a few call backs to the original movie and some were really funny when they were thrown in. Not giving anything away but instead of going to save Mars in this one Quaid tries to save Australia (it's a future version but still). To me that was a little hard to get behind. For the most part though the movie did a good job of being new while not forgetting the original. This just wasn't as good. Overall, another remake that isn't as good as the original. I give it a B.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Perhaps the best of this series. I couldn't put it down! I'm on the edge of my seat waiting for the next installment.
B00AFEY354|5.0|\\"Welcome to the island of misfit toys.\\" Charlie (Lerman) is a very very shy boy just starting his freshman year in high school. From his first day he counts down the days till he graduates. He meets two seniors Sam (Watson) and Patrick who help him adjust. There are few movies that can suck you in in the first minute. This is one of them. This is a movie that has a character that everyone can relate to, which is very rare these days. There are also movies that are so good that words can not express how good they are. This is also one of those. I honestly can not express how great this movie is and can not recommend this highly enough. I was actually fighting back tears almost the entire time (I almost made it) and for me saying that about a non-sports movie that is saying a lot. I really have nothing else to say except this is an absolute must see movie. Overall, WOW...just WOW. I give this an A+.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|This CD contains many of the classics with a new twist. His voice is beautiful. I am especially fond of the Ave Maria featured on this CD.
B009POCG5Y|4.0|\\"Anybody who uses computers doesn't know a damn thing about this game.\\" Gus (Eastwood) was at one time the best scout in baseball. He is starting to get outdated as computers seem to be the new way of evaluating player talent. He is also starting to lose his eyesight and it makes it harder for him to see what a player can bring to the team. The problem is that he doesn't believe any of that. This first and foremost is a good and entertaining movie. Eastwood once again plays himself and once again it works. Amy Adams however steals the movie and if any one could be Eastwoods kid in a movie it is her. It was probably just my wishful thinking but I was hoping for this to be more of a baseball movie then it was. The movie was really good but it was more about Gus and Mickey's (Adams) relationship then baseball. That isn't a bad thing but I was hoping for another \\"Moneyball\\" type movie. I do recommend this and this is a good time though. Overall, not what I was hoping for but still very good and I did like it. I give it a B+.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|needless to say I love this game! if you love theese types of games you will love this one works well I have played it for over a year and have never had a problem with it
B0095J0AL6|5.0|It's simple, I choose this product because I love One Direction and in my country don't sell this album edition.
B005JZBPHS|5.0|i ordered this as a xmas present for my girlfriend. she hasnt opened it yet but i know she will love it. nice box that is comes in.
B004LWZWGK|3.0|Batman has always been an obsession, so I am predisposed to like any Batman product or anything with an appearance by Adam West.  This movie was fun, a little like Mad Max, but I was expecting a bit more.  There were some good surprises, so that was the redeeming feature, but some things were bothersome.  For example, Bain's mask served no apparent purpose.  If it was giving him oxygen, there certainly wasn't enough to last long.  Knock a couple pieces loose and he was weak.  What was the story with all the fluorescent lights in the prison?  It made it seem rather modern rather than some ancient facility. Why climb the rocks if you can get pulled up with the rope or tie a homemade grappling hook to it?  For me, the story was a real let down from the philosophical musings of the Joker.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|The Harmonies Just Blew Me Away Brian & Mike Did It Again I Highly Recomend This It Eill Take Back To The Beginning Track One Is Some Of The Most Beautiful Harmonies Like God Only Knows!!!
B009FB3W9G|5.0|This was a well done video.  The tribute to Ms. Striesand was heartfelt and well done.  She seemed to enjoy it as well as her personal performance which was as usual outstanding.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I like how challenging the game can get when you reach the higher levels. my son and step daughter love to watch me play.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Just purchased this app and so far I am very happy with it. I find the books easy to read and mark.
B00005N6KG|5.0|Got it quickly. Never shifts around when I'm moving. They are adjustable so my son can also use them and they don't go into the ear (kinda gross).
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|Got this as a free app of the day.  It's pretty fun &amp; I was happy to have happened across the fact that it does have zoom.  The main thing I would change is the dialogue.  While it's great that you can turn it off at each step, I would prefer to have the option to turn it off altogether in the settings.  I don't really care for it....it just slows down the game for me and it's a pain to have to click it off at every puzzle.
B005NJU8PA|4.0|Tim Ferriss has done it again! The 4-Hour Chef is a book not only about cooking, but also about meta-learning. I'm sure you'll find at least a couple of useful tips there.<br /><br />It's a hefty book, but I've read it in less 20 hours (and I'm a slow reader). Tim's humor, present in all his books, makes the journey a lot more pleasant.<br /><br />I'm taking away one star because the book is a lot *more* about cooking than I've expected. I've really thought I'd find more tips on learning faster there, but that was a very brief part of the book (and I guess one would have to work really hard in order to apply the learning methods taught in cooking, his &#34;learning vehicle&#34;, into other areas). IMHO, his first two books (especially 4HB) were better, even though 4HC looks more professional and apparently required more individual and team work.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|As I read this book so many times I would \\"recognize\\" things that have become truths for me.  My \\"knowings.\\"
B003EI2EH2|5.0|This book has everything: looks, charm, amusing anecdotes, good tips. The slow-carb diet once helped me get from 18% to 10% BF in just a few months. Then, after a long time of too much work and no play, fueled by quite a lot of crappy food, I got back to 21% BF and have just started the SCD again. In just two weeks I am at 19%. The diet works, makes sense, and is not hard to comply.<br /><br />I've followed many tips on this book and can testify they seem to work. This is a dense book which can sometimes be overwhelming, but it's definitely worth reading it a second time, let alone buying it and keeping it on your bookshelf (or reading device) forever.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I absolutely love love love this game. I play at least 5 times throughout the day. I highly recommended downloading. Seriously!
B002361MLA|5.0|I've read this book quite a few months ago, but its message changed my life. I've always been so heavily focus on my future and my past that I had a lot of trouble simply living the moment. &#34;The Power of now&#34; helped me change that, and now I live a much more intense life, simply by trying my best to focus on the present.<br /><br />It may sound like a simple and even silly solution, but it's much easier said than done (I, for one, am still on training wheels).<br /><br />This is a great book, well worth your time and money.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I absolutely love this app! It is great for anything! You can make a lot of different designs and affects with this app!
B004DNWPY4|5.0|Stanley and Danko's book is almost two decade old now, but it still provides much food for thought. In spite of their geographically-limited research, the authors do a great job in busting the whole high-rolling lifestyle myth commonly associated with rich people.<br /><br />This book will show you what the truly rich really value (tip: it has nothing to do with fancy cars, big mansions and trophy wives).
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this alarm works really well and it never seems to fail! i've tried many alarm apps and this is definitely the best one! definitely recommend it.

B00000F14B|5.0|Iowa(y) is about hafl way 'cross the country...and Iowans never do nothin' half way...and this cinematic representation goes way over the top.<br /><br />We have an excellent short documentary on the making of TMM with Shirley Jones, Buddy hackett, and Susan Luchey, from 1998.<br /><br />There appears to be additional material in the jump from stage to screen (afficionadios, correct me if I'm wrong), including a Robert Preston version of GARY, INDIANA and a new song by Shirley Jones.<br /><br />Funny, ironic aside: Jones recalls that she was three months with child as she played Marian Paroo, the \\"spinster\\" Librarian, and ofcourse the Director had to shoot *around it*. Today, the character would have proudly proclaimed her \\"condition\\" - no diversionary terchnique - while Harold Hill would have spent most of his time being lectured, instead of conniving around those \\"hawkeyes\\"!<br /><br />Talking about going over the top artistically, getting 1000% engaged, Robert Preston *owns* every single frame - an amazingly expressive actor, singer, dancer. He appears to be much older than Jones here but his talent takes over...from frame one!<br /><br />Great quality on this VHS product.
1451662432|4.0|Every so often I will hear my son in another room start to chuckle.<br />\\"What are you doing?\\" I ask. \\"Reading Arnold.\\" This book is very readable and engaging. Arnold is a one-of-a-kind personality and the Bodybuilding, Acting, and Governating are merely backdrops for his amazing story. In fact, the best parts usually involve everyday happenings rather than important events and people. It slows considerably when Arnold discusses his governorship. One-star off for boring politics - but four stars for a fun read.
B00008CLOA|5.0|Playing in surround sound, you feel like you are immersed in the music.  The soundstage is huge.  The front speakers sound like they are 50 feet apart.  You look toward the sound and there are no speakers.  Just amazing

B000641D2Y|5.0|This is a movie from my childhood. Nostalgic and convenient to now have on DVD. Arrived promptly and in tact.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Brandon Sanderson is a great author and this story just shows his skill. You get plenty of good characters with great motivations, a wonderful storyline and enough &#34;Ah Ha&#34; puzzle-falling-into-place moments to keep anyone happy. I really suggest this one.
B000GBEWHA|5.0|Grease on DVD! This is also a movie once watched on tape with my mom. Reminded of those moments now thinking &#34;How was I allowed to watch this as a child?&#34;
B00A23MVHA|5.0|I bought it because I will watch this over and over with friends<br />First in movies and twice in the house only regret it wast four hours long so funny you laugh so hard you miss other funny statements I saw three times still hear new lines I missed.
B0018OIK0E|5.0|Incredibly funny and a new way to look at the Zombie apocalypse. Watching this will allow you to look at such experience with humor.
B005LAIHYU|3.0|I had read the reviews and thought this was not going to be good.  However I love vampire movies and with Abe Lincoln how could I resist.  I was in the mood for a good popcorn movie and this filled the bill.  It was not a great movie by any means and you need to suspend reality quite a bit.  But this movie was not as bad as I had been lead to believe.  The action was awesome and I like the way the film looked.  All in all had a very good time for an hour and a half.  Maybe in the summer or Halloween I will watch it again.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|Perfect humor. Had me laughing the whole way through. I wish I could have a cabin fever and not go to school
B009PAETCG|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It gets really addicting. When I start playing I just can't stop. Time just goes by so quickly and I forget that have been playing for an hour.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|In short, absolutely worth the wait. Beautiful arrangements, sonically fascinating and every listen reveals some new layer. This offering is just as I remember, furious and uncompromising. I will be listening for awhile.
B00A7Z8KAU|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I love this app to death, but there are many, many things wrong with it. Also a heck-load of bonuses!<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-More paint options. There are now 6 pages of paint tools instead of 3! But one of the pages is is a little lame. The brushes are grass and flowers and bark.<br /><br />- I like the new menu. It's a whole lot more accessible than Sketchbook Mobile, and it just looks nicer.  You can keep brush options visible while drawing, so that's really cool.<br /><br />-AWWW YEAH! A RULER! Straight lines AND eclipses!<br /><br />-This is my absolute FAVORITE upgrade: you can flip your drawings every which way!! Very useful when drawing humanoids, because if you flip it upside-down and backwards, you can see what's wrong with the drawing.<br /><br />-The new layer bar is very nice. Now you can just add a layer instead of it asking if you're sure you want a layer or whatever. A lot faster.<br /><br />- You don't have to switch back and forth between the color options and the brush options.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-No smudge tool. I mean, SERIOUSLY?! NO SMUDGE TOOL?! iPad got it, why can't Android users too! Painting and shading is now such a pain without a smudge tool.<br /><br />-It's locked in landscape mode. Ugh. I never even USE landscape mode. Sure, you can tilt your device sideways, but then you have to tilt it back again to change your brush or whatever.<br /><br />-It seems a little slow to register that I actually put my stylus on the screen and started drawing. Very slow reaction time, unlike PicArt, which is REALLY fast. Sketchbook should take a hint from them.<br /><br />-Six layers? Come on! I normally use 8 or 9.<br /><br />-Only 6 fonts, and all stink. I have to upload my drawing into PicMonkey to get a decent font! I don't mind entirely, but it takes FOREVER!<br /><br />- No horizontal symmetry line. That doesn't bother me too much, but it might bug some other people.<br /><br />-It might just be me or my kindle fire, but whenever I click on the brushes, the app fails. Super annoying.<br /><br />-There aren't as many options for editing your brush.<br /><br />All in all, it's a wonderful app with not that many cons, but I think the cons outweigh the pros. HELLO?! NO SMUDGE TOOL?! What's with that? But if you really still want this app, go buy an iPad and get Sketchbook Pro on there, seriously.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|John Carter (Of Mars) is a labor of love based on the E.R.B. books from the early 20th century that inspired the entire super-hero genre (starting with Superman and moving through Flash Gordon and MANY others), the star-spanning sci-fi genre (including Star Wars and many others). This is a fantastic movie that does almost everything right! It takes the source material seriously without BEING serious. It's fun. It's also chock full of great action and heart-warming sentiment that doesn't get schmaltzy. Love having DVD and Bluray and digital copy all in one package. My only negative comment would be that I wish there were more DVD/Bluray extras like story-boards, commentary tracks, and behind the scenes video, etc. Awesome! I hope you enjoy it as much as I did! (5 times so far)<br />  [[ASIN:B005LAIH3G John Carter (Four-Disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D/Blu-ray/DVD + Digital Copy)]]
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Good book from A Bourdain's early career. He is an interesting person, and has some good stories to tell. O
B005K17RU0|5.0|my app to plan for the day to make sure I do not overdress or under-dress my daughters and myself.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|When I read this book I cried, laughed, and smiled. Then probably cried a couple more times. Every time I read this, well let's put it this way, My eyes were glued to it. So ultimately I LOVE THE HUNGER GAMES!!!!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I ordered this by mistake.  What I really wanted was the Blu Ray combo pack.  The HD was received in pristine condition, but I returned it as soon as I received it.  I received credit by Amazon in a reasonable amount of time.
B000PFUAO6|2.0|I have been a loyal DT fan; but ever since Train of thought they have been making heavier and more angry sounding records. I can't relate to that stuff, and I don't like it much. The older I get, the less I dig it. Unfortunately, this album doesn't have 1 song on it that I enjoy. I think that metal enthusiasts will enjoy it, but if you're like me and like the early stuff, this may not be a winner for you.
0545265355|5.0|My son asked for both the Hunger Games Trilogy boxed set and the Hunger Games Tribute Guide for a birthday present.  Both were ordered together, and were received together, both in excellent condition
B0009A1AS2|4.0|Since Train of Thought, DT has been putting out heavy albums that don't seen very well thought out. Of those albums, this is probably my favorite. There are a few really good songs on Octavarium. Since Metropolis Part 2, this is the only DT record worth having in my opinion.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I tried the free version of this app, and have been SO impressed and SO completely satisfied with the functionality and stability of the app that I have now purchased the 'no ads' version. I cannot imagine that everyone who purchases this app would not be similarly impressed.<br /><br />Wayne
B000002HK4|4.0|This is a really good album. It's mostly covers from bands like Kansas, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Journey, and Queen. Most covers don't do it for me, but Dream Theater has it covered. Pardon the pun. This isn't one of my favorite Dream Theater records, but it's great. Even their weaker albums are better than most bands best albums. If you haven't heard this record yet, it's a great one to own and enjoy for years to come.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|I highly recommend this series, this is the 3rd season, MUST WATCH THE FIRST TWO. Not for kids or individuals that find adult themed shows offensive.
B000021XS0|5.0|This is the continuation of the Metropolis story told on their 2nd studio album. This was the 1st DT album I heard, and one of my favorites. It's also the 1st with keyboardist Jordan Rudess. It's really hard to put the greatness of this album into words. Some of the bands best songs and instrumentals are on this record. Metropolis Part 2 showcases the things that make DT one of the best bands ever. If you haven't heard this album, you're missing a masterpiece. If you thought rock operas like Tommy and Quadrophenia were good, you'll think this is better!
0786915749|5.0|Loved this series, definitely have to read the other dragonlance books to get a full appreciation of the books. I love it.
B000002HPT|4.0|This is a very different Dream Theater album. There are some really heavy songs, and some lighter and moody ones. It seems to me that there is no middle ground. I either really love a song on this album, or I don't like it at all. This record has a few of my favorite DT songs on it. Hollow Years, Take Away My Pain, Burning My Soul, and Anna Lee are great, but none of the others do anything for me at all. I think that this album seems a bit more percussive than some of the others. It's still really good, and a must have for DT fans.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|The entire movie is great yes it does have its slow moments and is uncomfortable to watch with others but is an all-round masterpiece. The cd itself is a work of art.
B008TMA1LY|1.0|it is such a baby game it is like dinner dash but even more boring it is what my daughter is into so I cant complain about the game itself it is so Baby type.
B000J103PC|5.0|Definitely one of my favorite movies. Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway and Emily Blunt were wonderful. I don't usually buy dvds but I felt the need to own this. The pace is wonderful and is really funny in the cutest way. Definitely a feel good movie.
B000YHG72E|5.0|The movie is for the whole family.  It is fun and uplifting and gets you in the spirit of Christmas!
B0064NTZJO|5.0|Spoiler Alert:<br /><br />This film is not for the sensitive or meek of heart ... if you are looking for the Notebook or Crazy, Stupid Love Gosling give it a miss.  This is Gosling at his art house finest.  Shy, quiet, sensitive, nondescript ... a compartmentalized killer capable of extraordinary violence in a heart beat.  He drives.  He controls his environment. He's scary lethal that only those calm killers can be: Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lector, Javier Bardem's No Country for Old Men.  But in this film Gosling is the latent Hero defending Irene & her son Benecio who have awoken his heart and humanity.  He is human being. He has a heart.  He loves them ... enough to leave. He is the scorpion, its his nature to kill.  Gosling's phenomenal performance is on par with Half-Nelson and with a terrific supporting performance by Carrie Mulligan.  The elevator kiss bathed in pure gold before plunging into the darkest violent hell was extraordinary.<br /><br />Gosling has always been an \\"Actors Actor\\" ... He is the best of his generation.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This one kept me on the edge of my seat and is essential to read if you want to conclude the first book and begin the third.
B002NZK5TG|5.0|Fabulous movie!
0470901071|5.0|I have been reading this to stay refreshed with what may be new in the field. It has covered a lot of topics that I found not hit upon in previous books.
B005LAII12|1.0|As a fan of the \\"stupid-comedy\\" movies, I found this movie extremely distasteful. It didn't help when discussing how popular Ted made him and if he didn't have Ted he would've ended up like \\"the Asian at Virginia Tech.\\" As a VT grad and extremely proud to be a Hokie, I wish I could have turned off that movie right then and there. I tried to look past that, but the other jokes weren't even in good taste. Terrible movie and I don't recommend it.
B0091REZMW|1.0|This is the worst game ever..Do not waste your time on this game. It is a total ripoff. Read Olivia's review. Everything she said is true. I love find and seek games but this one stinks.
B000066C6Z|5.0|This is a movie from my Youth and eventually, we just had to break down and buy it!  It is hilarious!  This spoof predates the Naked Gun movies and is just as funny.  If you have never seen this 80's classic, check it out.  You will not regret it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Finished it in one day, thought it was all hype and no substance but it surprised me.  Will be buying the next books
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was  a good story with just enough heat. I liked the tables turning beginning with them married and finding the reasons to stay that way.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Just purchased full game. So far so good. Great graphics and great story line. Great price too. Keep games like these coming.
B00908DDZM|5.0|What a great collection of music! Macklemore tells stories that are real, sometimes funny, sometimes heartbreaking but always set in reality. The musical arrangements from orchestral to hip hop make this disc a joy to listen to. And to think he produced, recorded and released it without any backing! Score BIG TIME for the independent artist!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele is a great singer and I enjoyed every song on this CD.  Her voice is beautiful and her songs have a great beat and good lyrics.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|Zeppelin can STILL get the led out! Jimmy Page continues to be a guitar-God and others do not disappoint! Buy this now!
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|I got this game when it was free. I just beat it. The game play gets repetitive and only slightly challenging, but overall I enjoyed it. The banners on the screen get in the way, and it is easy to penalized while looking for items. The story line is not interesting, I usually skipped through the dialogue. But the actual playing was good for what it is. The graphics are decent. There are twenty something levels. You can zoom in, by the way. I beat it on my kindle &amp; it worked fine. Overall, 3 stars. Fun to play, but I wouldn't pay for this game. It just wouldn't be worth it to me.
B006FE83U4|5.0|The combination of the DVD + book - at a great price as well- was the PERFECT holiday gift for a friend and didn't break the bank!  Looked beautiful together!!
B009YP9L7U|2.0|Very good read I totally enjoyed the read especially on my new kindle<br /><br />Easy and fast and very clear to see
0061743526|5.0|The combination of the book and DVD was the perfect gift!! This book is lovely just by itself. And the price was right!!
0810970686|4.0|I added this to my boys' collections a couple of Christmas' ago.It is an amusing series and they still collect them.
B00005B7CK|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I ever saw, just a total insult to the intelligence and to the south.  Mindless.  Idiotic.  Worse than the 3 Stooges.  I can't believe such garbage was ever produced.
0810979772|4.0|I have bought all the books in this series for my sons.Even though they are now 17 years old they still get a kick out of them.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This has proved itself helpful more than once. I always read the reviews before getting an app and this one was highly rated. Not mistakenly! My first gen Kindle Fire does have the little battery Icon up in the corner,  so I can see how full it is, but this app lets you know Exactly how much battery power you have and times for usage on different apps!  It goes immediately to Battery Pro when I plug it in and also has a plug Icon so I KNOW its charging. I have poor eyesight and the little Icon at the top of my Kindle is often hard for me to see - this is great!
B008I15774|5.0|I completely agree that this is one of the most characterful Beethoven cycles out there. It is fully energized, without affectation. The \\"tang\\" of the French winds and horns is fantastic! The \\"Eroica\\" is one of the best documented I have heard, raw and powerful, quick, but not breathlessly so; the other reviewer has it right: somewhere between Toscanini and Furtwangler. This is not ponderous Beethoven. The mono sound is perfectly acceptable, and the acoustic of the venue comes through really well. The Bruckner, also is excellent. That had been my primary interest when buying this box, but my focus has shifted to the Beethoven.  EDIT: I believe the Beethoven 9 on this set is in stereo! This is a major plus. There is too much spacial separation for this to be a mono recording. For years this was released as a mono recording with the rest of the cycle. At some point (apparently) Testament released a stereo version of it. This would appear to be that version. For collectors this is a major boon. Even if this set conatined the mono Beethoven and the stereo Bruckner, it would be a deal. Throw in a stereo Beethoven 9 and it is a HUGE bonus, especially with a 9th as good as this one!

B005KWL2IW|5.0|What can I say I am a old school Anthrax fan and will always be. It is nice to hear Joey back with the band but I also like the work with Bush too. It would not break my heart to have both singers with the band all the time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|very exciting and mesmerizing...fast moving action... had to read all books at one time,,,  cant wait to see the movies
B000H6SXMY|5.0|It was so much fun following the whole storline for all of the characters. I have never laughed so hard for so long!
0375869026|4.0|Perhaps it's my unfortunate cynical nature, but I'm always suspicious of books that receive such wide and universal acclaim.  They can't be that good, can they?  I was not sold on this book initially.  Unlike other reviewers, I did not find Auggie's voice believable.  I had not paid attention to who wrote the book and within pages was wondering if it was a woman.  Auggie did not sound like a fifth grade boy to me.  And indeed the author was a woman.<br /><br />But then something changed.<br /><br />While other reviewers may not have liked the repeated changes in point of view throughout the novel, I felt that they truly distinguished this book and made it one that I would love to teach.  Though I didn't buy Auggie's voice at first, I did buy his sister's voice and the voice of her boyfriend and her former best friend.  I bought the voices of the children who became Auggie's friends and eventually I bought into Auggie himself.<br /><br />If anything, I wanted to hear from more of them.  I would have loved to hear from Julian or one of Auggie's teachers.  In the beginning of the novel, it seems as though Mr. Tushman, Mrs. Garcia and Mr. Browne will be major characters in Auggie's story, and I wish we had heard more from them, because in an environment such as Auggie's, everyone contributes to how he faces life.<br /><br />The descriptions in this book were excellent.  In particular, the sensory details that describe how Auggie hears both with and without his hearing aids puts you right there with Auggie.<br /><br />This is an important book.  It is a book about empathy and how the little things we do in life both hurt and help those around us.  It reminds me, in that way, of a child's version of \\"Thirteen Reasons Why.\\"  \\"Thirteen Reasons Why\\" deals with suicide, but also, again, the little things we do that impact someone's life.  While Auggie's story is much more uplifting, they are, in some ways, companion books.  \\"Wonder\\" being a book for 8th grade and younger and \\"Thirteen Reasons Why\\" being for 9th grade and older.<br /><br />I would give it five stars, but for what I felt were the missing stories, the missing pieces.  I guess the author had to draw a line somewhere or have a book that was a thousand pages long, but I miss those stories and if I were teaching this book, have my students fill in the blanks.\\"Thirteen Reasons Why\\" being for 9th grade and older.<br /><br />I would give it five stars, but for what I felt were the missing stories, the missing pieces.  I guess the author had to draw a line somewhere or have a book that was a thousand pages long, but I miss those stories and if I were teaching this book, have my students fill in the blanks.
B006ZPJWBM|5.0|Beautiful!  Had looking forward to get it for a while now.  Made a perfect gift too.<br />I totally recommend it.
1419705849|4.0|I just read \\"Wonder\\" which references the infamous \\"cheese touch\\" made famous in the Wimpy Kid books and goes to show how much this series has entered into our cultural consciousness.  It's always a challenge, though, for authors like Jeff Kinney to keep a series current and interesting when it is an open-ended series.  It's not like Harry Potter.  We all knew when the series would end.  Greg Heffley, unfortunately, is forever trapped in middle school.<br /><br />I did not enjoy Kinney's last book \\"Cabin Fever\\" which seemed to be one of those books authors start writing when they're tired of writing but know they have to continue a series in order to make money.<br /><br />The good news is that Kinney's latest \\"The Third Wheel,\\" seems a return to all the things that made the books so enjoyable.  Greg, unlike most characters in fiction, never changes.  Much like Bart Simpson, he never grows.  He is still selfish (which in this book seems like a genetic trait when his uncle comes to live/mooch off of them.)<br /><br />He is still plotting, trying to get the things he wants in life mostly by using his best friend Rowley, trying to get him elected to Student Government, trying Rowley out as his \\"wingman.\\"  All of Greg's plans fail repeatedly, though I really like his plan of maintaining and keeping his own bathroom stall at school.  And who can't relate to the horrible toilet paper used in schools?<br /><br />And perhaps in a sign that Greg and his friends are getting older, Rowley develops his first pimples.<br /><br />I believe this series has life in it still and I admire Kinney's restraint in only releasing one book a year.  They are a quick read and it would be a series that you could quickly burn out on if not careful.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I like it very much - it is lightweight and I like the cover and the fact that you can recharge and not have to take it out of the case and easy to keep clean. I feel it protects my Kindle well and I am very satisfied. I like the elastic to keep it closed. The standup thing on the back is not that useful as it is floppy, but I don't use it much that way anyway. But it is usable -- just not very good at making the kindle stand up. It could be that I just don't do it right as I seldom use it that way.Other than that it is great.
8866130931|5.0|I love moleskine notebook/calendars. They are well made, intuitive in the information you may want, and have plenty of space for all the writing/notes you make to remember appointments. They also last, so your calendar isn't falling apart by the end of the year. Awesome product.

B000KKPN5C|4.0|Perfect for my Nikon D3000 when needing extra flash.  Price is great as well which made the purchase that much easier.
0375507256|3.0|I had heard that this was a unique novel that was a must read, so I read it.  The book was good.  It wasn't too difficult to get through; the only real chapter that was, at first, difficult, was Adam Ewing's story.  My personal favorite \\"chapters\\" were Timothy's and Somni's. These chapters were the most thrilling and kept me on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />It's hard to say how I feel about this book, except that I have finished reading it and I feel disatisfied.  Individually, the different stories within the novel were compelling and beautifully written.  However, I am at a loss for a feeling of resolution or a deeper meaning.  I see how all of the stories intertwine, yet this notion seems more like a fact to me than a profound feeling.<br /><br />I recommend reading the book only because it's one of a kind, but don't expect too much.  I appreciate it and gave it 3 stars simply because of its uniqueness and because of the individual stories on their own.  This novel could have been outstanding if the author had somehow achieved a more emotional resolution.<br /><br />Note for future readers: if you're going to read this book, be sure to start reading during a time in your life when you know you'll be able to consistently read the book.  I took a month to read the novel because of my busy schedule, and I found myself forgetting key components to some individual stories, like minor characters names, where the chapter had ended, etc. (which are key for when you continue an individual story later in the novel). Word to the wise!
B0013K1ALE|5.0|I had seen this a long time ago on TV, but as others was not impressed.....This version is much better. I am glad I purchased it for another run....it was worth it.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|Unique voice and genre-bending talent.  I love it for now, until these songs get overplayed on the radio like her last album...but that's not her fault, is it?

0231161166|4.0|This book is accessible to a general audience and is very good read.  A great introduction to epigenetics and the right balance of detail.
B000ATQYT2|1.0|I am extremely disappointed that this version is not the full movie.  I made the mistake of the purchasing the Instant Video version without reading the reviews first, and while watching it the first time immediately realised that the song \\"When Long is Gone\\" is gone!!  How dare they remove this beautiful song, that adds so much more to the movie.<br /><br />I wish that I still had a VHS player so I could watch the whole thing again.  :-(
1455519006|2.0|This book was a page turner. I could not put it down for the first 400 pages. The ending is absolutely ludicrous and so contrived that you wonder if you picked up the wrong book. The case was never convincing. If the evil Talal really wanted to do his evil deed did he really need Will Robie around forever? This reminds me of the Batman TV show where the bad guys always wait far too long to dispose of the dynamic duo. You would think after the 45th time they were thwarted they might learn their lesson. The upshot is this book was entertaining and absurd.

B004J88SGC|2.0|Let me preface by saying that the primary reason we bought this concert DVD was, we were so impressed by Billy Joel's performance at the Sandy benefit concert. He was amazing at that concert, so we assumed he would be equally great at this concert, which was recorded in 2008. Wrong!!! The vocals were odd and frankly unpleasant, one viewing was enough, we gave the DVD away!!! Maybe there's a great Billy Joel performance DVD out there, but this ain't it!!
B00020HEL6|5.0|This compilation exceeds my expectation.  Her voice is wonderful and she knows how to make the best of the songs chosen for this cd.  I can't believe she was only 14 when she recorded this!  I love this cd and can't possibly pick a favorite!

B009HV2JT8|5.0|I downloaded this movie to watch while traveling and had no expectations other than I would be diverted for a bit while on several planes.<br /><br />As a history buff I like the blending of fact and fiction.  As a person who knows the world is grey, I like the lack of black and white in the motivation of the characters.  As a martial artist, i love the fighting scenes reminiscent of well produces Asian films.<br /><br />And as someone who believes you can take control of your life in dire circumstances, it was nice to have that message as a subtext throughout the story.

B00632HWOG|1.0|I absolutely LOVED this app; it worked great and sent me something to let me know I had a message.<br />Now, I am so angry at this app. The screen, for everything, says &quot;Loading&quot; and will not do anything. I've had my friends message me, but still nothing. Please change it back.

B008LV05EG|3.0|I started hearing about Rita Ora about 3 years ago - heard that she was being developed by Roc Nation and was working on her album which wasn't expected to be released in the US until 2013.  However earlier this year a certain Roc Nation client began to \\"act out\\" and all of a sudden, the PR for Rita Ora went into overdrive - she was being featured on blogs daily, being squired to radio station by none other than Jay Z while also getting a thumbs up from the Queen Bee herself which rubbed a whole \\"navy of fans\\" wrong.<br /><br />The perception was (and still is by some) that Rita was being groomed to take Rihanna's spot and given how messy Rita's introduction to the US audience has been, I'm not sure that she can recover enough to make any kind of impact on the audience here which is a shame because she can sing and seems to have a bubbly personality that would otherwise pique people's attention enough to give her music a chance. I also hope that she can get new a&r and/or management because I don't believe that those involved with building brand Rih will actively help build brand Rita.<br /><br />I think this album was pretty much thrown together in an effort to just get it out there and see whether it and she would \\"stick\\" with the audience.  I heard some of the tracks that were released overseas but none seemed to gain traction here so I bought the cd from a UK seller for fear that it wouldn't be released at all. As debut albums go, it's very \\"ok-ish\\" - it showcases her voice and some of the songs are catchy but I don't have any idea of what type of artist she intends to be nor is there a real standout song that new listeners can pinpoint as a \\"Rita Ora track\\".<br /><br />The songs I really like are: ROC THE LIFE; R.I.P.; HOW WE DO (a little too long but I still like it); LOVE & WAR f/ J. Cole (midtempo track); HELLO, HI, GOODBYE (shows off her voice); HOT RIGHT NOW (she's featured on a DJ Fresh track); UNEASY (Fergie-esque) & BEEN LYING.<br /><br />The only 2 songs I dislike are: FACEMELT & FALL IN LOVE f/ Will.I.Am(an auto-tuned mess).<br /><br />I hope that she gets touring experience and develops a stronger sense of her self in the crazy music business so that she can stand up for herself with regard to her image, styling and music because if she continues to let others run her as they are now, she won't get a chance to record a 2nd album.gs I dislike are: FACEMELT & FALL IN LOVE f/ Will.I.Am(an auto-tuned mess).<br /><br />I hope that she gets touring experience and develops a stronger sense of her self in the crazy music business so that she can stand up for herself with regard to her image, styling and music because if she continues to let others run her as they are now, she won't get a chance to record a 2nd album.
B000B6CO52|5.0|I watched this movie years ago and absolutely loved it so I ordered it for my ten year old son who also fell in loive with this adorable movie.
B009P5S11G|3.0|Another year, another Rihanna album.  This one shifted gears away from the raunchy lyrics on both LOUD & TTT to songs that brag about her wealth & lifestyle (much like rappers), touch on her relationship with Chris Brown and reveal her seeming bemusement with her fame.  That being said, there is no real introspection in the lyrics of this album and again Rih retains an icy, distant, automaton demeanor which keeps me from totally investing in her as an artist.<br /><br />This album like the previous 3 was rushed and had her still recording vocals almost 2 weeks prior to the release date which shows on some tracks that have virtually no lyrics and are uninspiring; one other thing that I must comment on is how distasteful I find her use of the 'n' word on some of these songs.  I wish that word would be abolished or there was some magic memory loss drug to make everyone forget it but I digress.<br /><br />The songs that I really like are:<br /><br />GET IT OVER WITH - although I get that this song is a kind of \\"ratchet\\" ode to weed, the production is dreamy and evokes the feeling of floating on a high;<br /><br />DIAMONDS - Rih sounds great singing this song that is like an \\"earworm\\" with just enough lyrics so that I was able to quickly learn them to sing along;<br /><br />FRESH OFF THE RUNWAY - I had a sense of deja vu the 1st time I heard this song & after listening to it a few times, I realized that it reminds me of a Kelis track called, 'AW S***'.  Although Kelis' was produced by Bangledesh, both songs feature frentic production as the artists kind of rap/sing over the music;<br /><br />WHAT NOW - I like how softly this song begins and builds to her belting out the chorus of 'what now';<br /><br />STAY f/ Mikky Ekko - very interesting ballad on which her vocals shine;<br /><br />NOBODY'S BUSINESS f/ Chris Brown - when I saw the track listing, I viewed this as another PR stunt much like BDAY CAKE earlier this year.  A tactic to get people talking about the album, their relationship, THEM period. However it is a well constructed enjoyable song that sounds like a late '80s track and finds Chris doing his best Michael Jackson impersonation as they trade verses about their relationship status being \\"nobody's bid-ness\\" but theirs;<br /><br />HALF OF ME - great autobiographical lyrics which ring true given how she has to live out loud due to the heavy paparazzi presence around her but we don't really know the real her<br /><br />LOVE WITHOUT TRAGEDY - a really good ballad whose lyrics touch (again) on her beating and;<br /><br />DIAMONDS (David Aude remix) - love it!  He was able to exceed the original by speeding it up a bit and adding a phat beat  that made it sound more like a dance anthem.<br /><br />The tracks that I can take or leave are:<br /><br />NUMB - this is a really lazy track as there are basically no lyrics but the music production is interesting (wish I could get an instrumental);<br /><br />JUMP - although I don't care for the lyrics, the arrangement makes me want to dance;<br /><br />RIGHT NOW - feels like a \\"been there, done that\\" track, it's not special nor does it stand out;<br /><br />LOVEEEEEEE SONG f/ Future - I like how her lyrics were sung in a higher register and sound sweet vs his auto-tuned vocals (especially at the end as they sing together) and;<br /><br />POUR IT UP - again, dicey lyrics but great arrangement/production.<br /><br />Finally I don't like:<br /><br />MOTHER MARY - very dreary 2nd half of a long song, it doesn't really go anywhere (although I do like the line that references her growing up on an island never dreaming she'd become such a big star);<br /><br />NO LOVE ALLOWED - forced \\"breezy\\" sounding island track;<br /><br />LOST IN PARADISE - truly unremarkable track and;<br /><br />DIAMONDS (Gregor Salto downtempo remix) - just don't care for his arrangement of the song.<br /><br />On the superficial side, although the album is housed in digi-casing, it's certainly the most original I have bought thus far.  It's bigger than traditional cd packaging and contains both the cd & dvd as well as a pictorial booklet (which unfortunately feature a lot of pics of her smoking and/or drinking) and the album liner notes (which although squeezed onto one side is presented much better than the TTT liner notes so that I can actually read it).  The dvd is a brief glimpse of her upcoming LOUD tour dvd.<br /><br />I rated the album as \\"ok\\" because oddly the more I listen to it, the less I like it.  Overall I don't enjoy this album more than her previous releases but the positives are: there are a few songs that I do like, I can hear improvement in her singing (although the smoking isn't going to help in the long run) and I admire the fact that she & her producers/song writers switch it up every time and try to have her cover multiple genres so that she can appeal to a wide audience of music lovers.<br /><br />I'd recommend this deluxe version to fans because of the extra tracks and the dvd.ve bought thus far.

B0091LS07E|5.0|I've been an AKeys fan since she debuted and just realized that after listening to this album for the 1st time, there's always been at least 1 song on each album that knocked my socks off the first time I heard it: on SIAM it was TROUBLES; on DIARY it was IF I AIN'T GOT YOU; on UNPLUGGED it was STOLEN MOMENTS; on AIA, it was LESSON LEARNED/LIKE YOU'LL NEVER SEE ME AGAIN & on EOF, it was UNTHINKABLE/TRY SLEEPING WITH A BROKEN HEART.  And sometimes when a song floors me on an album, I'll listen to that song(s) over & over almost exclusively while giving the rest of the album a much more cursory listen but with GOF, the reverse happened - it's a well balanced 13-track album and there is not just 1 single that I've fallen in love with, the whole album has grown on me to the point where I have multiple tracks on repeat.<br /><br />I think this is a really good album that will grow on people if they give it a chance.  My favorite tracks are:<br /><br />DE NOVO ADAGIO (classical intro) that melts into BRAND NEW ME - love the lyrics and how softly it begins and builds to the chorus;<br /><br />WHEN IT'S ALL OVER - great lyrics which seem to be directed towards her son as she speaks about how important it is to love people while we're here because once you're gone all that's left is the love;<br /><br />LISTEN TO YOUR HEART - while lyrically simplistic, the message is powerful;<br /><br />GIRL ON FIRE - honestly I HATED this song the few times I saw her perform it and wrote it off as another bad lead off single going back to NO ONE on AIA but it grew on me as I've listened to the album and I don't think Nicki's verse detracts from the song;<br /><br />FIRE WE MAKE f/ Maxwell - sultry ballad by an unexpected pair (I honestly expected Alicia to duet with Prince before Maxwell);<br /><br />THAT'S WHEN I KNEW - her vocals are raw & passionate on this track that seems to speak to when she found herself falling in love with her husband;<br /><br />ONE THING - her vocals remind me very much of early Prince - an airy yet vulnerable falsetto;<br /><br />101 - haunting stripped down track as she admits that she knows about the gossip of her husband's philandering ways but hopes to be the \\"1\\" of the previous 100 who makes him change his ways.<br /><br />I applaud the fact that Alicia knows who she is as an artist and has stayed true to herself since she started - like two of my favorite artists, Sade & Teena Marie (R.I.P.),  Alicia never chased trends or tried to fit herself into a genre that is inauthentic to her so I found it funny to see comments from people wondering why she hasn't hopped on the euro-pop bandwagon like Usher & Ne-Yo.<br /><br />I also truly appreciate the fact that she hasn't allowed her husband to shape a \\"new sound\\" for her using his production skills because although I respect the fact that he is a successful hip hop/rap producer, Alicia is a different type of artist and their sounds might not necessarily mesh well.very much of early Prince - an airy yet vulnerable falsetto;<br /><br />101 - haunting stripped down track as she admits that she knows about the gossip of her husband's philandering ways but hopes to be the \\"1\\" of the previous 100 who makes him change his ways.<br /><br />I applaud the fact that Alicia knows who she is as an artist and has stayed true to herself since she started - like two of my favorite artists, Sade & Teena Marie (R.I.P.),  Alicia never chased trends or tried to fit herself into a genre that is inauthentic to her so I found it funny to see comments from people wondering why she hasn't hopped on the euro-pop bandwagon like Usher & Ne-Yo.<br /><br />I also truly appreciate the fact that she hasn't allowed her husband to shape a \\"new sound\\" for her using his production skills because although I respect the fact that he is a successful hip hop/rap producer, Alicia is a different type of artist and their sounds might not necessarily mesh well.

B000O59A2K|5.0|These movies are some of my favorite movies featuring John Wayne. El Dorado was one of my favorites because of the Edgar Allen Poe poem, El Dorado, that James Caan always recites. I had to learn that poen in grade school and I still remember it. Hatari is a great movie also with Red Buttons as Pockets. It is a funny movie. I would recommend both movies highly. They are both great.

B003YL4LYI|3.0|GRRMs last two books in the series have kept me reading for one reason, to get to the end. I no longer hold my breath whilst turning the pages, rather I mundanely press forward hoping to get to the end. He sinks in the talons by placing a few of our favorite characters in peril so that we will be sure to buy the next episode. I feel that he has lost touch with the characters and run dry. I hope he finds them again for book six.

B005LAJ16I|5.0|It was highly recommended by a fellow superior officer and he was absolutely right.  I watched it with great anticipation from the beginning to the end.  The character Claire Danes portrayed was a little over the top but still very good.<br /><br />I look forward to the Second Season when it is released.
B0079M8R6Q|4.0|A compelling and informative book.  It is hard to believe what is going on in North Korea and the book implies that it will be very hard for the sort of popular uprising that has smashed other totalitarian regimes to occur.  As the poor continue to be underfed and malnourished with the concomitant decline in the intelligence of successive generations and only a few well fed like the ruling family an uprising seems unlikely.  What a terrible country!
B007LNJ4YW|5.0|I loved Teen Dream. There was a complete and far reaching \\"catchyness\\" to each the tracks. Enough bubble gum on the icy surface and quite enough warmth below that.<br />Bloom is something else entirely. The sweet tension is there and reaches out tickle our ears. But there is more meat here. This time around they choose to punch the melodies through us.<br />I found myself not really enjoying the full experience at first. After a few listens I realized I needed to fall into the songs. Not expect them to pull me in. Its a wonderful warm blanket.

0446572764|4.0|Child 44 reveals Stalin's Russia in true detail. And the author gets across the obvious: A country's loss of individualism and privacy. Reminding me of 1984 and Brave New World. I think Child 44 will lend itself to future stories about lost freedoms in an ever growing world of public sharing. I very much loved Raisa and Leo's evolution as a married couple. Vasili is very easy to hate. I pondered his demise the entire book! I cheered Leo and Raisa from the beginning of their woes. Leo's conviction is what holds the book together. I felt like I was living in 1950s Russia. Many twists and turns too! I think the end was slightly short worded, compared to how detailed the entire book is, but it's an exceptional piece of work for a the author's first novel!
B009K45Y62|5.0|I thought there would be more features on the disc but other then that the actual piece is great.  A must have for any batman fan.  Plus my order came quicker then I thought it would.

B0011WL8MK|5.0|They're both great. Benny and Lombard are their usual selves and perfectly cast in WWII'ish black and white. Early Robert Stack.  Color remake with Brooks and Bancroft a jazzed-up hoot.

Having owned the first version, I am glad I bought the newest as it has a lot of good updating for the digital age.
0425263908|5.0|A friend made me promise to read this book and I'm so glad that she did.  The story and characters grab hold of your emotions and don't let go.  There is passion for each other and hot sex, but this is not just a book about sex.  Eva and Gideon are complex, driven, and broken people trying to keep it together for each other.  Their actions make sense when you know their circumstances and their emotions are raw and their pain cuts you just as deep while you are reading.  Eva and Gideon make concessions that they would never make for anyone else, and you want everything to work out for them because they deserve it and because it two so very broken people can try as hard as they do, it just has to work out.<br /><br />This book is a must read, but be prepared to not put it down and to feel caught up in their world and their emotions.  I can't wait to read the next one.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I very much enjoyed the courageous ness of the author in writing the book.  The description of the afterlife was unique and amazing.  I wish he spent more time on that then worrying about what other doctors would think of his experience, honestly who cares?
B004H1V5RU|5.0|This was requested as a Christmas gift by my 10 year old nephew.  He didn't have many things on his list, but this one was at the top.  So, hopefully he will enjoy it when he opens it at Christmas.  Received my order quickly, with no problems.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|and it looks amazing!! you can easily sink into this movie if you have any inclination for Sci-Fi films. I think what makes the 3D great in this movie is the slow shift of the camera angle in many scenes. In other movies, the 3D effects always seems overwhelming because the action is all happening at the front end of the screen for the 'pop' effect, but everything is moving so fast that you end up with a blurry picture and a headache at the end of it. I felt that Tron had a good balance between the fast action 3D and the slow but powerful environment effects... it really makes you feel that you're there with them! In other words, if you want to showcase the awesomeness of your 3D TV to others and convince them that it's the future, then this movie is for you. No one will ever leave disappointed.

B009NQKPUW|4.0|The service/shipping was fantastic.  The movie itself was very very good.  Not excellent (not the first two Alien movies) but shows a lot of promise.  I'd highly recommend it.
B001A50716|5.0|We got this movie because my wife is a Depp fan (okay, I am too).  It's a strange movie... the characters are very odd... but it's great fun to watch.  Jerry Lewis was hilarious, Faye Dunaway was amazing... and oh yeah, Johnny Depp was great, as usual.  The story hangs together well, in spite of the &#34;Wonderland&#34;-esque happenings.  But what's with that fish...?<br /><br />Not a kid-friendly movie, but for grown-ups who like strangeness, it's worth seeing.
B004ZGI2KK|3.0|This had all the potential to be a really great movie but it kind of fell short. Just seemed some what disjointed and the lines were weak. The bones of this movie are great but the writing wasnt. Good cast but they shouldve had better written lines.
B005LAIGW8|4.0|This sequel is interesting... it's a different feel than the first Ghost Rider movie.  This isn't a bad thing; but if you're hoping for more of the same, you will be surprised.<br /><br />Cage has given Johnny Blaze a crazy, quirky aspect that makes Ghost Rider even stranger.  This may have been patterened after later Ghost Rider comics; maybe the 1990s era books.  This movie is even more surreal than the first... a possessed construction crane?!  Wild!  And is that Daimon Hellstrom or isn't it?<br /><br />If you're a comic geek, you'll like it.

0552166758|4.0|I've got the entire Discworld collection, and have loved every page.  Pratchett's character development has kept me hooked all the way through, and his handling of Sam Vines has been great.  From a drunken beat cop to the city's foremost legal authority, he's come a long way, and the author has taken us along wonderfully.<br /><br />So, I had high hopes for this book.  Unfortunately, it didn't really live up to them.<br />The character voicing and dialogue just isn't as snappy and clean as in previous books.  All of the characters seemed to lean towards monologuing, rather than the usual Pratchett snappy patter.  They didn't seem to have their distinct personalities, either.<br />The storyline was good but cliche; very similar to things he's done before in this series.  It was also a bit awkward in its flow.  Previous Discworld books have had a rich, complicated tapestry of things going on, that weaves itself into solid, satisfying conclusions.  This book had threads, but not too many, and they didn't seem to tie up as well.<br /><br />I have to rate this book highly, simply because of the impressive and entertaining body of work that Terry Pratchett has given us in the Discworld series.  Snuff definitely needs to be on the shelf with the rest.  But new readers, start with something earlier (like The Color of Magic), so you can really appreciate the genius of his work.
B00A3VLJCE|4.0|I am running this on the 7\\" Kindle Fire HD 32G. The basic useful features of Photoshop are there: Magic wand select, rope select, Special effects tools, etc. They all function well, and probably better if using a stylus. (I haven't tried it with my Dagi stylus yet). Using my fingers require a bit of patience and several passes when selecting masking areas. It's hard to tell exactly where the tablet is picking up my touch underneath my finger.<br /><br />My main complaint is that imported images must come from images saved in the \\"Downloads\\" directory. You can not select a directory path for the source of your images. Also, saving your images ,\\"Save to Gallery\\", saves your images to the folder \\"sdcard/Pictures/Adobe Photoshop Touch\\". The folder path can not be changed, and does not have the ability for selecting a folder to save it into. Hopefully, they will add this ability in the future. Until then, I will just have to move my files around to where the app wants it.<br /><br />The only other complaint is zooming. It would be more helpful for selecting areas of an image if I could zoom in a little more than it currently allows.<br /><br />Other than these 2 complaints, (that could eventually be fixed with software updates), I am happy with the way this app runs on this tablet.

I go through mouses a lot at work so I stocked up on these rather than dropping $75 on a Logitech each year. I still use the Logitech G series at home for gaming but this mouse could certainly get you by.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie in the theater, and re-watching it was not disappointing.I like it because it is entertaining but also has a good story about being independent. My daughter loves princesses and so we're hoping that Merida is a better role model than some of the other princesses.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. When I originally started reading it, I thought it was going to be like any other book about kids with cancer. How I was wrong. This book shows all the ugly sides of life and, somehow, shows all the beauty within all the ugly. Definitely recommend it; it was worth my money.<br /><br />The only thing I am deeply disappointed with is, that the movie is starting production, and it was released that the director will be Wyck Godfrey, aka, the director of \\"Twilight\\". I probably will not be seeing the movie. Actually, I refuse to watch the movie at all costs.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This is by far my favorite Christmas movie of all time and I think a lot of other people would agree with me on that! Full of a million and six memorable quotes, this movie is one that has stood the test of time when it comes to comedy classics! Can't go wrong with this one :)
0099503204|5.0|Liked it even better than Ender's Game this 2nd time through. I won't even try to go into the plot since it's very complicated. My family listened to this one on a long road trip and we were all captivated and couldn't wait to get back into the car to finish our story. Ender is still in this book, but it is set 3000 years in the future. Everyone he knows, except his sister Valentine, is dead. Those two have been traveling through space for almost 25 years (he doesn't age as centuries pass). Anyway, he goes to a new world to Speak for the dead, and we meet a new species--the Piggies--that humans are trying to understand. This story had great morals hidden within the plot, and deep questions that keep you wondering long after the book is through.

1596912863|4.0|Jane, a 30 something year old New Yorker who is fed up with romance because of her Mr. Darcy obsession, is left a 3 week vacation to Pembrooke Park in England in her great aunt's will. There she is thrown into an Austen like world, complete with costumes, actors, and scripted plots to make rich women's fantasies come to life. This story didn't really grab me. I found Jane a complete ditz, falling for any man she saw way too easily (drove me crazy). The writing is witty and fun though. This author knows her way around words and is enjoyable to read (especially if you're into Austen books).
B005Q6TB62|5.0|i love the packaging its small and all the movies in one box come together its amazing set for a resonable price
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I enjoyed this book better than Fifty Shades of Grey. It left me wanting more and more...I could not wait to see where Anastasia and Christian would end up. Every chance I got I would steal a moment to read a few pages. I just can't wait to finish Book 3.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|I got this to replace the one my god baby took when he came over but I still needed one for my house so I got another one for him to watch here. Plus the price was great.

B004K8WPUQ|4.0|Pros: The audio performance this thing captures is astounding. It's easy to set up and is conservative with battery life.<br />Cons: Switching out batteries is not the most convenient (9V aren't very convenient either).
B001CEE1YE|5.0|The sound and video are so much better, crisp, clear and beyond my expectation! Only thing that could be better would be 3D
0062183591|4.0|I read this book as an assignment for my Forensic Research and Analysis Class.  I am a student at Carlow University and am enrolled in the there Master's of Science in Fraud and Forensics [...].  I enjoyed reading this book.  I read it because of school but this is definitely a book I would read even if it were not assigned to read.    In this book Dan Ariely does a great job at telling the reader of many different aspects of how or why people cheat.  He performed a lot of different tests for to determine whether or not people would cheat.  I found most interesting that when people are in a group, according to his test, that there is a greater chance that they will cheat.  People will let themselves cheat and say it is ok because they are helping others.    I did find this book interesting in many aspects but I also found it repetitive that I felt I was reading the same study over and over.  He uses his experiment with the matrix's a lot through out the book and I would find myself loosing attentiveness.  I also would like to have seen these tests performed on other groups.  He would always test college students and it would be interesting to see if the same tests received the same results if performed on a different age group in a different setting.    Even though I felt this book repeated a lot of the same things I still found it interesting and like that it was a very easy read.  This book has provided me with a lot more insight on why maybe some people cheat and why others do not.  In my professional career I will be able to reflect back on this book to let myself try and understand the motives as to why someone might have done something.

B0013F1D02|4.0|I really enjoyed the book that this movie is based off.  And surprisingly, this one was a fairly good adaptation, even if they did change the ending to be happier than that in the book.  Add in some great actors, and this was an enjoyable watch.<br /><br />Tristan has no idea that he is the son of a woman who is from the other side of the Wall.  That Wall being the border between his world and another that no-one is allowed to cross.  Yet, when a star falls and lands somewhere over there, and the woman he adores requests he get it for her, he is determined to get it for her.  Little does he know that in that world, the star is a woman, and she isn't thrilled to go with him.  Add in a couple witches who want the Star's heart to restore their youth and some competitive brothers that want her necklace, and Tristan has his work cut out for him.<br /><br />Characters:<br />Charlie Cox: Tristan Thorn<br />Claire Danes: Yvaine<br />Michelle Pfeiffer: Lamia<br />Robert De Niro: Captain Shakespeare<br />Sienna Miller: Victoria Forester<br /><br />There's a pretty large cast in this movie and quite a few well known names.  And I liked some of them, and didn't like some of the others.  Cox and Danes weren't the greatest actors in this movie, but luckily the movie was good enough on its own that you could ignore them.  They just didn't have chemistry together and some of the acting seemed forced to me.  Sure, they had some shining moments (because Danes played a star, ha!), but largely I found their performances average.  Pfeiffer and De Niro on the other hand were excellent.  I loved the sometimes inept but brutal way that Pfeiffer played the witch.  She seemed to really enjoy her role and that showed.  De Niro as Captain Shakespeare was hilarious and this role was completely different than most of the others ones I've seen him in.  The supporting actors did a good job as well.<br /><br />The plot followed the book pretty well.  Sure they changed the ending, but that's because Hollywood seems to prefer happy endings.  And I guess that's ok in this case.  There are some risque scenes in this movie, but nothing to overt and I can't think it would be inappropriate for teenagers or pre-teens.  They see worse in commercials.  And there really isn't too much violence, yes a couple of murders, but they are done in a dramatic comedic way and aren't as harsh as you would expect.<br /><br />The cinematography in this movie is excellent.  From the flying ships capturing lightning to the magic done by the witches, it was very vivid and realistic looking.  And I liked the way that the did the shining for the star, it just added to the whole mood of the movie.  The fight scenes were well choreographed (and even humorous at times) and weren't the least bit frightening.  Musically this movie had a bunch, but nothing really stood out for me.  I can't tell if that is a good thing or a bad thing because it just means that it probably fit in with the movie's scenes well.<br /><br />A very good movie, even in comparison with the book.  It's definitely one that I like to take out now and again and rewatch.  Great for older children and adults alike, this is a good rainy weekend movie.<br /><br />Review by M.

B009FZHYKU|2.0|After 6 episodes, I was hooked. Then Season 2 kinda lost me. Now I'm done. I should have known you can't drag out these end of civilization shows this long. It just seems like the writers are grasping for anything now. The tension and scare factor from season 1 is gone. Glen is the only character I even &#34;care&#34; about anymore.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a very functional calculator. When it's up and running, it looks so much like the real thing then when holding my device in my hand, it's as if I were holding an actual calculator in my hand and not my phone. Very good job. Now if there were a way to add by means of a flip switch of some sort, perhaps a few scientific functions, it would make it the perfect calculated app. :-)

1449410243|3.0|Avid followers of The Oatmeal will love to have this for posterity's sake and get some enjoyment out of the book. People new to the humor of The Oatmeal may find it enjoyable as well. However, this follow-up to &#34;5 Very Good Reasons to Punch a Dolphin in the Mouth (And Other Useful Guides)&#34; was sub-par to its predecessor. While I love Matthew Inman's artistic style throughout the book, the humor was not quite there for me like it was in &#34;5 Very Good Reasons...&#34; The Bobcats happen to be one of my favorite characters out of the list of characters from The Oatmeal but the cat theme becomes tiring and the remainder of the cartoons just weren't as funny or informative (as some of the cartoons in &#34;5 Very Good Reasons&#34; were).<br /><br />...But, I'll still look for a follow-up book and continue to peruse TheOatmeal.com every week.
B00005JNQS|4.0|This movie is a classic! Everything about it, in my opinion, is great. From the acting, to the story, and the humor! This film will have you rolling laughing (just don't watch it too often). My favorite part about it all is the message of the film, about helping each other out and doing what is right.
B005COO1X6|3.0|Nice story with interesting premise but ending was abrupt and unsatisfying. Not the usual rich characters, backstory, and detail King usually delivers.
B00005JN8Z|5.0|This movie is a classic! Everything about it, in my opinion, is great. From the acting, to the story, and the Christian overtones. A great film for the family!

0920668372|5.0|I love this book and reading that there are some that think it is in any way bad to read to your child makes me sad. I have read this to My Son many times and most of those times from the time he was a small boy to the time I gave him a copy that I had talked into last year and he is now 20 I have cried. There is nothing bad about this book. It shows a love between a Mother and child..nothing more. If you are a sick person and want to read more into it then I feel bad for you. I will continue to enjoy it. And hope my son shares it with his children in the future.
0066620996|5.0|We buy these books for our management team to develop their leadership skills. We have received great reviews from them on the book's content and say its very easy to follow.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Wonderful series, cut off too soon.  The intriguingly incongruous premise - the &#34;Wild West&#34; in the outer space of the far future - is ably supported by fine writing and fine acting by an unusually well-chosen cast.  One wonders, though, had firefly continued would we have Castle today?
0425263916|5.0|Definitely a great book , if you liked Fifty Shades of Grey you should definitely read this book . .
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Very good film.  A fitting wrapup to the unfortunately short series.  An intriguing premise - the &#34;Wild West&#34; in outer space; well written, well acted.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I choose this rating because it  deserves to be viewed that many times....<br />I do like this book because it shows my grammar when i put something in wrong....<br />I would recomend this book because it will get u ready for school and collage basically the rest of your career......

P.M .9 years ago ... a person named Jerry got dared to sleep in a house that was belived haunted.The ... next day his friends waited for him out side the house.... ..... ..... ..... They had to go inside and search for him. They went through every room exept the attic.He wasn't supposed to sleep there. He was supposed to sleep in the living room they went into the attic. They saw Jerry's corpse and they just left because they were scared. But that night they all died because of their friend. He killed them all for making him sleep in that house If you don't send this to 11 comments you will die tonight by Jerry. Example 1: A man named Stewart Read this and didn't believe it. He shut off his computer and went through his day. That night while he was in bed he heard something outside of his door. He got up to look. And now he's dead. Example 2: A Girl named Haley Read this in the morning and she got scared but she didn't send it. She wanted to know if it was true. She went to school (She was only 13 years old) and that night she died. If you don't post this on 11 comments tonight Jerry will 'visit' you (FYI im not takin any chances so im postin this srry
B00A2LFXVI|5.0|This was very enjoyable.  I just wish they would make more and LONGER animated productions.  The 72 minute format can barely get any character development going.
B004HO6HWA|5.0|i love this dvd. i have watched this dvd more times in last couple of the days than in any other dvd.
B00785P2QC|2.0|And kinda boring.  I'm just playing because it is free, but I would never buy this.  It is also kinda confusing.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|i bought this movie since i have watched it every Christmas since i was little. i wanted to watch it this year too.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|First I want to say, I really enjoy authors like Grisham,Baldacci,Flynn,Silva etc, they've kept me up at night, made me late for work, forgot to do laundry and burned food all because I couldn't put a book down...now having said that, this book has a few spots that will make you keep reading,but overall the story is far from the best thriller you will ever read, the premise to the story is about a con, how a plot is executed (don't want to give anything away in case you're going to read it so I'm purposely being vague here)and believe me when I say, it's not believable BUT it's a fun read. I did enjoy the book, but it's not on my list of \\"must read again\\". This felt like a book a student of Grisham would write in one of his classes if Grisham were a teacher and gave an assignment that was \\"try to write a book like I would write\\" , the emphasis on the word \\"try\\"  - it's good, it has interesting parts, but all-in-all not a great book.<br /><br />Short review:<br />Good - not great, thrilling - sometimes, forgettable - yep !
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|i love this movie. it is funny and violent at the same time. i can't wait to watch it again.
B009MF5BXK|3.0|This one is a little over the top (if that's possible) compaired to the original. The caracters were not as well developed as before. Arnold was just not belieavable and Jet Li dissapeared way too soon. Chuck Norris was OK but could have been left out alltogether. I think the writers and producers tried to include too many aging action stars in one movie and it just did not come together.
1451648537|4.0|I choose this rating because I really learn about Steve Jobs, and also about Apple and the quality of its products.  Moreover, this entrepreneur is a symbol of motivation and also an example of persistence.  I would recommend this book to my brother who has an special passion for computers
B005K17RU0|4.0|pretty good. I like to watch the storms roll on on the radar. very good waether app. you'll like it.

B0094BB4TW|1.0|The app sucks. It only shows a few of the most current items, then the rest is just text. Please fix.
184195392X|5.0|This is a fascinating story.  I can't imagine how much time and effort went into researching all information on how to survive on a  boat adrift in the ocean.
B009FBX5M0|5.0|I enjoy this soundtrack during road trips but think EON should require the artist performing the movie theme to allow it to be included on the movie soundtrack to be considered for the movie project. All in all excellent music from a spectacular movie!!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I finally bowed to the pressure and read the Hunger Games trilogy. This one has to be the best one. I enjoyed the plot line, character builds and scenery description but all the stops in thought are a little much.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|An awesome book!  I've now read a couple of Scalzi's books (this and Old Man's War) and I've become a fan of his writing.  I don't want to spoil the hook, but Redshirts deals with the sci-fi genre in its narrative and does so well.
1452110581|5.0|Very funny!  I Could Pee on This captures the mood and temperament of the average cat and provides lots of laughs.
1449410243|5.0|I'm not sure what else to write here.  I haven't read it all yet, I'm saving it to read during the take-off and landing portions of a flight when I can't use my Kindle.  But so far its been exactly what I've expected.<br /><br />Some of the comics are rehashed from the site, but the few new ones I've gotten to were just as good.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|Loved the idea! The person on the other end said I sounded like I was in a box. I ended up returning the item.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I found this funny, well written, well paced and well thought out. A good story that does a good job explaining rather complex technical concepts yet does so in a way that they are accessible.  I also loved that face that it was funny as hell.<br />I'm really looking forward to his next book.
B000V63BN6|5.0|This is another collection but is a collection of some of the best stuff ever sung  I am a big fan.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|I enjoyed the intrigue of this story. Once involved in the search for Annie, it was hard to stop. I think I spent some hours the first time. thanks.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|New Girl is perfect. That's it. I wish there was a more eloquent way to sum up this show, but that's pretty all there is to say. I've watched the entire first season repeatedly, way more times than I'd like to admit. Can't wait to own season two as well.
B008ASLK8A|3.0|it was not as great as first movie.  it was kind of confusing.  i fell asleep the first time i watched it, so i was hoping the second time would be better, but no..
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|I rate this movie 5-Stars. This movie is very entertaining and contains beautiful graphics. I recommend to friends and family.
B003DZX44I|5.0|It is such a beatiful movie for young children.  Teaches a valuable lesson that you should love someone for who<br />they are and not their appearance.  In today's world full of bullies, it is a terrific story.

B0053O89KG|5.0|My husband has watched each DVD so many times that I know each show by heart.  He just finds Castle totally interesting and he is looking forward to the next series.  He hates it when they get bumped for some other show.
B00962341U|5.0|I've been a fan of Leona Lewis since she debuted on the music landscape with her first release &#34;Spirit&#34;. Her monolithic vocals have placed her strongly in the DIVA category right along with Celine Dion and Christina Aguilera. After her second release, &#34;Echo&#34;, I was mildly disappointed in the direction her music was going but with the release of GLASSHEART, I'd have to put this release as MY FAVORITE of 2012. Each track feels much more authentic and emotive than those found on &#34;Echo&#34;. Leona moves between contempory pop, power ballads and club smashes. She showcases the emotions of her 3 strongest tracks into her acoustic versions of &#34;Trouble&#34;, &#34;Come Alive&#34; and &#34;Glassheart&#34; which are avaialable on the 2 disc Deluxe Edition. It's a shame that GLASSHEART, is not available in the US because it is a superbly crafted gem that should be included in any music collection.
B0098460O4|5.0|I had seen the duo on Britain's Got Talent and just fell in love with their voices.<br />I play the CD often and everyone of my friends and family that have heard it, said they really enjoyed them and sometimes we play it twice.  Every time I listen to it, I enjoy it more.

030758836X|4.0|Nick and Amy seem to be a blissfully married couple living the life in New York City. But when something horrible happens and brings them to a small town in Missouri their delightfully married life turns into their worst nightmare.  Amy goes missing and someone is to blame. The story will always keep you intrigued with solving the mystery of who did or didn't kill Amy. Throughout the book the theme of revenge teaches you just how crazy your life can be when you become consumed by the thought of getting back at someone. I definitely think that it's a book worth reading and If you are person who enjoys mysteries and a thrilling story then Gone Girl is a book that you have to read. The twist and turns will always keep you on your toes and wanting to know more.
B00886XQO0|5.0|I absolutely love these headphones.  They provide a great surround sound quality that allows you to hear all opponents approaching from any direction.  The sound of battle has never sounded so great...explosions and shots are amplified, creating a realistic sense.  You're also given many other features such as blue tooth capability, allowing you to answer your phone or stream music during game play as well the voice morpher, which is another feature i highly enjoy.  Amazing product, would highly recommend it.

1419705849|5.0|My eight year old grandson has read this book at least seven times before I got him a copy.  He just loves to read these books. Perfect for a third grader.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|I like the way this case feels in your hands, and how snug it is on the phone. It doesn't add too much bulk to the phone either. There is a lip around the screen, so there is a slight level of protection should it fall face first on a flat surface. The case also comes with a screen protector if you feel the need to install one. The case has the cutouts for all of the ports, even the apple logo. Would definitely recommend this case for those that need a little protection on their iphones without sacrificing aesthetics.
034580404X|5.0|Bought this for the Wife who loves to read. She said although it wasn't what she thought it would be,  it was actually a very good story and enjoyed it.

B0083IU84Y|4.0|CD by Jake Bugg is a pleasant experience into the music coming out of the UK.  Good sound and pithy lyrics make this CD a treat.  Very pleased with the number of songs...not a skimpy offering like you see in some more established musicians.

B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is one of the very few movies in recent memory that is not an animated/CGI movie that is rated G. I don't understand why Hollywood can't make more of these. This movie proves that it can be done. This has a great story and great acting, you won't be disappointed if you get this.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|With today's love affair with the same scripts being rehashed over and over again it is refreshing to see a new take on an old classic. Great series, great casting.

0061766089|4.0|As business books go this one is pretty refreshing.  Although the examples within may be an advertisement for IDEO the authors company, they do get their point across. If I could get it across in ones simple phrase, it would be: \\"Give the Customer what he really wants!\\"  So much sales and marketing today are about selling ice to Eskimos if you will, trying to make you want something you really don't.  A company I worked for nearly nine years just laid me off, it was a business decision, a bean counters decision, and one my management said was no reflection on me. In fact there were many better choices, except I was a contractor, so we were first on the list.  Lets go back almost three years ago, I asked a question of one of the main managers in a large scale meeting about an emissions technology. The question I asked was why, when the industry did not embrace the technology we were working on, and more than half were in favor of another technology, why did we persist?  The answer was that of a politician, he acted like he didn't hear me right, and answered a different question, as if I supported the companies technology.  Problem was it was a loser, and three years later, failure after failure to develop the technology they embraced, led to downed sales, corporate raiders buying up stakes, and having to borrow 800,000,000.00 dollars.<br /><br />The company had to come around, and use the technology, that most people had wanted from the start.  Our CEO only sought some sort of glory for himself as an innovator, and did not listen to his customers, his own engineers, and the practicality of what he was trying to do.  Of course he golden parachuted out, along with some other failed leaders, and it's now left me without a job, and the company in a shaky situation.  Even if they succeed in getting the right emissions technology, it will be decades before they recover the talent, the competitive edge, and the market they once had.  If I had had a crystal ball back when Ifirst got this book, since I've been a bit behind in my reading, I'd have mailed a copy to the CEO in the hopes he would have read it, and not gotten in this kind of scrape.<br /><br />The examples in the book are pretty good, this is one way to court success, if you look to how people are changing, and adapting, and their needs as well.  Who would have thought that many businesses would be nearly paperless today with the advent of computerized documents.  It all happened in just a few years, the writing on the wall was there for all to see.  The problem is that this won't work everywhere, because many managers just think that its is up to them to innovate directly, and hand it to the engineers and designers to realize the vision.  They do ask the customer to some extent, but unless you really get involved with the customer directly, you can miss new trends and needs that are largely evident with a little observation.
B008602KQI|5.0|Considering some of the other books-to-movies that have come out haven't quite come up to par (Twilight in particular), this was an unexpectedly good movie.  I had just read the first book when I saw the movie and the movie explains a bit more than the Hunger Games gave out in book one, which was helpful to my husband who hadn't read the book.  Acting was good, the changes from the book were acceptable, and I'm anxious to see Catching Fire.
0446585025|1.0|Seriously? Are you kidding me? All I have to say is that if you found this book worth the money get a life! I purchased it on iTunes because I sometimes watch her show and I find it mildly entertaining. There was endless rambling, pointless gap fillers, idiotic subjects...I could go on but I will just say this is by far the worse book I have ever read. Even if the point of this book was to be funny and lighthearted, it was so poorly organized and poorly written that it failed in every aspect. I finished reading it between naps because, unfortunately for me, it was all I had to read on my iPad on a long flight. Seriously, the only reason it was even published is who wrote it. I guess star power can buy you publishing even if the content is lousy. Sorry Ellen, nothing personal.
B0017SWPXY|2.0|I felt I wasted my money purchasing this book. A friend recommended it and all the great reviews. There was nothing enjoyable about the story, characters, anything. Don't bother.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It was a good book. Looking forward to reading the next two books. enjoyed the book better than the movie.
B005K17RU0|1.0|This app made me think I was getting a bunch of snow this week!  After checking the radar map, I figured out it had my town mixed up with some location in the mountain. Seems like there should be some  verification after you put in your location that the app has the right place...also, I know there are two little weather reporting centers nearer to me than the nearest major city which often has different weather than us anyway.

B008Y7J1Y2|4.0|My wife and I really enjoy this movie during the holidays.  Winslet, Black, and Law are great!  Diaz is annoying and overacts like she always does but she's not a deal-breaker for this entertaining movie.  We also love the relationship between Iris (Winslet) and Arthur (Wallach)--believable, funny, and endearing all at the same time.
0525478817|5.0|Everyone was making a big fuss about The Fault in our Stars. I read the Amazon synopsis. It’s about kids with cancer. So I was expecting something lighthearted, right? Well it was quite a bit more lighthearted than I thought it would be. But still. I think it may have surpassed the famed 1996 reading of Where the Red Fern Grows for “most tears making it out of eyes.” But it also inspired more actual laughter than anything else I have encountered by myself in my new studio. It may be a very sad book, but it is the perfect vehicle for the philosophical insights John Green weaves into both story and text.<br /><br />I am always wary of books written by middle-aged men told from the point of view of a young girl. John Green did an excellent job. There were some phrases which I didn’t think a 16 year old girl would really say, but some of that may be a regional dialect I’m not familiar with. Also the first person did not bother me as much as it usually does, say in The Hunger Games. I don’t know if I could just relate to Hazel more than I did to Katniss or if John Green’s writing was just more what I’m used to (i.e. academic) so the first person was less jolting. But either way, the first person just blended into the story and didn’t bother me.<br /><br />Read this book. But read it alone. The emotions I experienced were not proper for displaying on public transportation or a coffee shop. You’ll want to experience the emotions, not suppress them. It was worth it. Feel ALL THE THINGS. But perhaps you won’t want people interrupting the flow of the story to ask why you’re crying or sniggering. Maybe you will. It would be good publicity for The Fault in Our Stars, I guess.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Alien/Aliens are classics and by far the best of the 4.  Alien 3 changed the aliens' appearance but the fearful nervousness was still evident in this David Fincher-directed 3rd installation.  Alien Resurrection was the &#34;gimme&#34; movie of the Anthology.  Not well written, I would rate it as average at best.  But the Anthology set is great!  Fantastic artwork, packaging, and the holographic-like alien on the front and egg on the back are impressive.  Blu Ray picture and sound are incredible, as the digital transfer was very well done.  Highly recommended set, especially if you're a fan of these movies!
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Usually I listen to exclusively Christmas music after Thanksgiving. But I got this album at the end of October and it's been pretty much what I've ben listening to since. The songs seem to be on average less mellow than their first album. I do appreciate mellower songs, but this was a great album for end-of-semester working. And like I said, it pushed my Christmas music aside, so it must be good.

B009NQKXYK|3.0|I can remember seeing Alien when it first came out - it was terrifing and remains one of my favorite films. With minimal effects and decades prior to CGI the superb performances, excellent writing and character driven piece set itself apart from virtually anything that came before or after.<br /><br />Promestheus is a visual powerhouse but it lacks the constant sense of dread ALIEN maintains throughout the run of the film. Reading about how much Ridley Scott wanted to test these same waters again. I was hoping for much more than the constant parade of parlor trick CGI and forgettable charactors. I can't recall a single one and although not having seen ALIEN in years there's not a moment or charector I can't forget .<br /><br />The reason is simple, we cared abut them and spent most of the film afraid for them. It's a disapointing journey from In Space No one Can Hear You Scream.... to In Space No one Can Hear You Snore.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I liked the innovative use of story structure. Now that he has our attention, I sure hope Andy is working on another book.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Man, I find myself playing this game for hours at a time, ignoring all forms of life around me! It's been around for a while, so chances are you've either heard of it or played it on an iPad. Completely worth downloading, especially for the price! &#34;Free&#34;
B008673ZAQ|5.0|In my review of Barred to You (Crossfire #1) by Sylvia Day, I commented that the storyline had Fifty Shades overtones, but that it was its own fabulous story. Well let me tell ya something, folks, Reflected in You (Crossfire #2) dumped the Fifty Shades feel completely. Reflected in You was well written in Day's smooth style, and I was so sorry when the story of Gideon and Eva came to an end--for now.<br /><br />The relationship between Gideon and Eva is most volatile. The ups and downs of their love affair will keep you on an emotional roller coaster wishing that someone would make a good decision. Especially when one of Eva's ex-lover's is thrown into the mix. Eva's decisions can be somewhat frustrating for the reader, however, they move the story into many fiery directions.<br /><br />I must say that I can't wait for May of 2013. Of course I will be looking forward to the warm breeze of spring and the daffodils blooming with their sunny faces, but moreover, I will be anticipating the third book of the Crossfire series: Entwined With You.

B005LLSZNM|5.0|I'm obsessed with this show - Thanks for giving us another option to view this without all the hoopla. :-)
B003Z0BWRM|5.0|But I am glad to say I did venture to read it. After seeing another view reference \\"Harry Potter Similarities\\" and although it could be construed as an replica of Harry Potter I certainly did not see them as they are not blaringly obvious (and I am fairly well read of the HP books). This books stands on its own in a world that one can get so mentally involved that you get the book and won't resurface from it till you feel like it.<br /><br />Highly recommend this book.
B007ZYK3CE|4.0|Another excellent Paddy Considine (written & directed by) movie - But I missed about 30% of the dialogue.<br />The same happened with Dead Man's Shoes (starring Paddy Considine).<br />I don't know why just a hand full of the Instant Movies here on Amazon have Closed Captioning, but these are excellent movies, driven by great character acting and realistic dialogue.<br />Amazon - Please give us the option of Captions on more movies.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I really like this story line and the characters. The description of Matthew and Diana are great, although the author could have made her more attractive. Matthew on the other hand is dead on...no pun intended. Forbidden love is always a good story, but this is also a good historical read as well. It ranks really high on my greats books list. Good job Deborah!! Looking forward to starting the second book.
B007XIC1GI|4.0|This book was definitely an interesting read, and provided a good deal of insight into the man behind the rock star persona. It balances humor, wit, intelligence, and things that just plain make your stomach churn very well. The only thing I didn't particularly care for didn't necessarily have to do with the book itself-- it's just been my opinion and experience that Manson tends to embellish: not just on his stage persona, but on almost anything with which he regales those willing to listen to him. It seemed to me that that was also the case in this book. Sure, it was an entertaining read, but it leaves me wondering how much of it is actual &#34;autobiography&#34; and how much of it is &#34;fiction.&#34; Regardless, I doubt that you'll find this book boring, so if you're looking for something new, give this a try.
B008KNUKVI|5.0|Pentatonix have a great sound, and most of these songs I like better than the \\"original\\" versions. I'm addicted and have been since they were on the Sing Off. I couldn't ask for a better acapella group, and frankly, I couldn't ask for a better band period. Many times I forget that these are vocals only, no instruments, no techno tweaking, nothing but pure amazing talent. I normally get sick of songs after hearing them a few times, but I can't get enough of these, especially Aha!, Somebody That I Used to Know, and Love You Long Time.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|It is a romping world of fun.  Silly and serious, but all-Disney. My brother liked it but not as much as the Secret of the Wings.  Thanks.

Absolutely intoxicating.  My husband can't wait for the 2nd edition!
B008X9Z4I8|4.0|This zippered pouch is a nice way to keep the Kindle Fire HD protected.  I keep my stylus and power cord in there too.  The Kindle can be left in the pouch to charge, just plug it in and zip to the power cord from both directions.<br /><br />I am getting another case though now so that I have a stand for the Kindle so it is propped up easily for Skype, but will prefer this Belkin pouch for tossing it in my purse and traveling.  I am hoping that the other case will fit inside this Belkin cover too!

B005KR6NJU|5.0|My son loved it. It rekindled my love for the franchise, while sparking my son's interest as well. Some of the dialogue can be a little silly, but it was made for a younger demographic.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|We can divide Grisham's work into two categories: a) Grisham; and b) Non-Grisham novels.  Grisham novels have a theme of redemption and usually focus on a lawyer's redemption.  Non-Grisham novel don't have the same style and from my mind's eye, don't even seem to be written by him.  Some of these novels have the central focus is redemption, but no lawyers are included in the storyline.<br /><br />I have read the following novels \\"Grisham novels\\":  THE FIRM, THE PELICAN BRIEF, THE CLIENT, A TIME TO KILL, THE CHAMBER, THE RAINMAKER, THE RUNAWAY JURY, THE PARTNER, THE STREET LAWYER, THE TESTAMENT, THE BRETHREN, A PAINTED HOUSE, SKIPPING CHRISTMAS, THE SUMMONS, THE KING OF TORTS, THE LAST JUROR, BLEACHERS,THE BROKER, THE APPEAL, THE ASSOCIATE, FORD COUNTY, THE CONFESSION, THE LITIGATORS and THE INNOCENT MAN.  I think that is all of them!<br /><br />\\"Non-Grisham novels\\" I have read include:  PLAYING FOR PIZZA, A PAINTED HOUSE, SKIPPING CHRISTMAS, and BLEACHERS.  These Non-Grisham works (with the possible exception of BLEACHERS) typically do not reach the level of excellence of his normal work.  He also have a series of children's books with the central figure Theodore Boone.  They're great for kids to read!<br /><br />THE RACKETEER is an unusual book because it seems to fit into both categories.  In fact, it seems more like something Agatha Christie would write.  The style is very similar to MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS.  What do you think?
B00005JSGK|5.0|A great, old school movie.  John Wayne plays a fantastic role of a game wrangler for the world's zoo's.  Loved this movie when I was young, and love it even more now that I'm older since i get a lot of those adult topics I never understood when I was young.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|A must see program from Season One thru Season Two finish. And the reason the complete Season Two is not yet available is because the final episode just aired 12.16.2012 at 10pm on ShowTime here on Long Island. The intensity is amazing. Try to second guess the ending of each episode. The thought process that went into developing the story line is brilliant. But since the original concept was developed in Isreal, a nation that has been under constant terrorist treat since it's inception is what makes the program so real, so authentic. And to get to watch the entire Season without delay is worth the price.
030758836X|5.0|Gillian Flynn rocks.  I am now ruined.  Flynn, (Tana) French, and (Kate) Atkinson are now the only 3 mystery writers I can read.  They stand head and shoulders above anyone else (that I've read, anyhow) in crafting edge-of-your-seat mysteries/thrillers w/requisite twists and turns, deep psychology (i.e., great 3-dimensional characters), and legit literary punch.  Having read all of their works, I just have to wait for one of them to write something else - unless and until someone can turn me on to a 4th author of their ilk.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|All Americans should read this book.  The story is thrilling--not least because it is true.  It is also very satisfying to read the details of the successful mission.<br /><br />In case you didn't appreciate our military--in this case, particularly our navy SEALs--you will after reading this book.  The sacrifices and dedication of these SEALs is mind boggling.<br /><br />Owen leads in to the bin Laden story by giving some background about his own life and how he came to be a SEAL.  He details some of his earlier missions.  This helps give the story its necessary context.<br /><br />I was impressed by Owen's humility.  He does not come across as arrogant at all.  He also seems very sincere about his motivation for writing this book and it is not at all self serving.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|How about Anais Nin?  Or Colette?  Or if you're really into s&m, why not try the master himself?  I am talking about the Marquis de Sade himself, of course.  But sex lit can be much better than this.  Don't tell me you're reading this for the love story.  Literature is full of wonderful, magical love stories where authors actually make love to the words as well.  Aaaahhhh, I am getting orgasmic thinking of it.<br /><br />Even Madonna's \\"Hanky Panky\\" is better written.  And it's got music.  And a hell of a rhythm as well.

B003YUNEUQ|3.0|I think these are well made and a good shoe overall. The sizing was as advertised & I like that they held up well after being washed.  The Crocs soles are my favorite for shoes after many years of abusing my feet with high heels.  My only issue with the shoes is that they rub the top of my big toe on both feet, even in socks.  I'm not sure if I have abnormally large toes (doubt it), but I've not experienced that level of skin rubbing with any shoes since I gave up the heels....

B004V43ZQC|3.0|I would have gladly given this book 4 stars, but for the unnumbered \\"half\\" chapter \\"Parenthesis\\" inserted between chapters 8 & 9. It was like I was suddenly reading a different and very bad novel(?). I almost put the book down, or at least stopped and moved on to Chapter 9. \\"Parenthesis\\" is a rambling, self-indulgent, disjointed, whining diatribe on the nature of love...yawn. Not only does it needlessly disrupt the otherwise excellent narratives, it is poorly written and may easily have been penned by a lovesick adolescent making his/her first attempt at writing prose. To his credit, Mr. Barnes lets the reader know it is parenthetical to the rest of the book, but it would have been much more to his credit if he had just left it out altogether. I recommend the book, but when you get to \\"Parenthesis,\\" SKIP IT! It is a waste of time.

B008NABUU8|5.0|This app was well put together. It almost didn't work on my tablet though probably because it maxed out my tablet capabilities(archos101) great puzzle game would recomend to others.
B004WESFZW|5.0|What a great movie...the acting was awsome, the storyline was a mystery at first and the writers lead us by the nose into the movie, so far I coulld not turn back.<br />Like mild thrillers?

B000OCXMAE|3.0|There are a few good songs but the rest is not my case. I guess it because their music is gradually getting worse and worse...
1594202842|4.0|I read this book very quickly. It was very entertaining, though it did get a bit heavy, repetitive, and intense at times with the whole strict parenting theme. I find it interesting how this mother grapples with eastern and western parenting styles, and in the end I think the lesson is that she isn't strictly one or the other, and that kids are different, and one method will not work for all. To each his own! Haters...give the lady a break! We all care for our children and we all try to do what we think is best!
B002NZK5TG|5.0|This movie is a must see. One of the best movie remakes of all time. Our yearly Halloween tradition :-)
B0063IH60K|2.0|The game has great graphics and many good features and it is free. All the good features are negated by the awful pop up ads. They are repetitious and quite annoying.

B000SEGEKI|5.0|This book uses great and memorable analogies and is easy to read.<br /><br />Have the benefit of hindsight before creating your next software project.  That's essentially what this book will teach you to do.  Understand how you can make your software flexible and scale-able as well as maintainable for future engineers.  I would highly advise taking notes as you read this book as you will want to reference the principals taught in the book in the future.

0307887898|4.0|The Lean Startup teaches an interesting way of building a new technology product.  Eric Ries introduces a Build/Measure/Learn feedback cycle with what he calls Validated Learning.  This prescribes that the product being built is verified and has demand through customer validation before investing significant resources into building something no one really wants.  Many Startups waste resources (money and people's time) creating something nobody is willing to pay for, convinced that their vision is going to change the world.  By the time they discover that no one wants what they're selling (or is willing to pay for it) they've wasted a lot of resources and may not have enough time to right the ship.  If read with an open mind this book can influence how entrepreneurs take product to market.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Quite a book! It was one of those books that you can't put down. The story of a boy and an adult Bengal Tiger surviving in a life boat for over 300 days at sea in the Pacific ocean was compelling to say the least.
0446547573|5.0|I ordered Safe Haven and received in a few days later. The book was well written and the plot has a surprising twist. I thoroughly enjoyed it.

B0053O89WY|5.0|Best comedy series to come out in the last several years.  Makes it cool to be nerdy.  Nerds you can rejoice.
0439813786|5.0|My son requested this for his 10th birthday. It is a beautiful book. We are all very happy with it. It isn't at all what I expected- many sketches, few pages of text. There is something wonderfully fantastic about it, though.<br /><br /> The pages seem thicker than normal. They're framed in black, giving the book a quiet, almost magical feel.<br /><br />The only drawback, but I cannot in good conscience take away stars, is that many of the pictures are two-pages and to see them well, you must break the spine of the book... and even then, you must live with its seam. I suppose the only way around this would be to shrink the pictures or enlarge the book... but that might steal some of the magic. So... there you have it. We are happy and this will be a much-loved book with a broken spine. We'd rather it be worn out, though, than never read at all.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Excellent series and great to see it on blu-ray.  A must for any serious Firefly fan, or any sci-fi buff.
1781164150|4.0|me gusto mucho el diseño de los personages. el libro supero mis espectativas, es muy recomendable para los que gustan del arte de peliculas
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This series is addicting.  LOTS of GORE, blood, guts, hanging flesh, people being eaten by zombies, it's not a show for the faint at heart.  But suspenceful and the character development is excellent!
B0085YNML2|4.0|Munch Time is a cute, fun game, similar to Cut the Rope. Good graphics &amp; game play. Glad I picked it up as the FAOTD, but after playing it for a while I believe $1 is a great deal.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|My daughter loves the series of Tinker bell movies and this one was just as exciting.  I recommend this movie
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Brand new, good packaging, and, of course, I love the movie. It could have stuck to the book a bit more, though.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|I really like this album, long time fan and have seen them once live. This cd is one of the best, hard to choose thogh as I like them all. I like the title song a lot and hope it gets more air time.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Very interesting read. I wasn't sure at first, but once I was a few chapters in, I was hooked. I have a hard time putting it down. The time changes are well marked, which makes it easier to follow. Great details.
1423140605|5.0|My son loves this series.  Read it in about a day.  He enjoys all of Rick Riordan's books.  It keeps his interest and teaches him about mythology.
0316098329|1.0|Most boring repetitive thing I've ever read.  I couldn't finish it - I like the concept but I just couldn't keep my eyes open for the tedious &#34;'child talk&#34;.  Right up there with The Incident with the Dog and the Night - or whatever that was called.  BORING.  Was put in the donation bin.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I have used this mouse about a solid hour testing out Guild Wars 2, The Secret World and casual browsing/surfing the internet.  My review comes from having tested various wireless and wired mice before, mostly Logitech brands and Microsoft brands.<br /><br />This mouse has a good feel to the hand if you have medium or large hands, it is extremely light like a feather and even with all of the weights added is about 1/2 as heavy as a former Logitech MX610 that I had.  My large hands became accustomed to heavier mice so it takes getting used to to have a light mouse like this.  I noticed right away the sensitivity is fantastic, plugging it in my mouse zipped across whole 24\\" screen with just a fraction movement, had to dial back the mouse sensitivity in the Windows mouse settings right away.<br /><br />No skipping, tracking good, the scrollbar works well.  The thumb resting point with rubber is very comfortable and a nice touch. My thumb rested on it pleasantly, your thumb always touches the thumb buttons but they are sturdy enough they don't accidentally get clicked.<br /><br />The button above the scroll wheel is easy to forget about and hard to press in a natural motion due to it being so far up on the mouse but this is a minor thing.  Overall the mouse is fantastic, and the price is very good for the mouse.<br /><br />Only cons is the mouse is very light even with weights, this may not be a con for most but takes getting used to if you are used to heavier mice.
B00AMBMF1Y|5.0|We love these movies. Filled with cast whose characters and storyline follow life. However, most folks will not take away a renewed spirit to be better people, better citizens, better Americans, more patriotic, just plain more &#34;good.&#34; Good guys win, bad guys don't. Gotta' love it! Eastwood keep on hitting the balls with the meaty part of the bat clean out of the park! Well cast. Story moves right along. Predictability Non-issue.
B0096DFBZQ|4.0|This game is fun and easy to play.  Controls are a little sluggish but okay for some diversion while out and about.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Okay, this game is absolutely adorable and is perfect for people of all ages. I found this while trying to find an app for my neighbor to play with while I was babysitting her. I ended up playing as well and ended up addicted
B001UHOWXI|5.0|This movie never gets old and it's so much better to see it at my own pace without the commercials.  Having the colorized version is not something I care about but is good for those youngsters that know nothing about the stark beauty of black and white.
B004132I20|5.0|Above excellent in suspense, intrigue and cleverness. Well done as usual by BBC. Good gift for all those people you want to impress with your &#34;good taste&#34;.
B002ZG983M|5.0|this isn't the average super human crushing the villains show. It is a well told story with well thought out characters<br />and a nice twist at the end. I recommend it to any one who likes action in a movie.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|What a powerfull, engrossing series. Well written and wonderful engaging characters! A must have for any geek or just plain discriminating viewer. BBC has certainly done it again.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I set aside those ads they don't show them that much. I like to play the game. Plus it gives me hints which help me out. I naturally like the game solitate but now I can play it more fun and frequently!
B00AHSINKO|3.0|I went into this not really expecting too much...but, it was a decent rental.  I think the message and story line may hit too close to home for most people, which might cause some not to like it.  But, I think it's worth watching, especially with such a good cast.
B009JBZH54|5.0|excellent presentation.<br />the sending  was very fast.<br />all items are fine and the movie quality is awesome.<br />it is recommended.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Kept me up several nights reading in bed. Unpredictable story line in remarkably beautiful written language. Plan to now read her other books
1907590331|5.0|Yes, I loved it. Nobody can depict characters of people the way Steinbeck can. He also has the power to take you to where the story is set and makes you one of his characters. You feel with them...you live with them, you hate and love people around you...
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book really changed my perspective of those that I have been much to quick to judge. It made me understand what could be going through the mind of someone I may not choose to embrace or let in. It's a very inspiring story and one of the most EYE-OPENING books I have ever read.
B0042RJWTC|4.0|I love the series I think it was really well done. My only problem was the packaging, a couple of my DVD's were scratched right out of the package. Pulling them out of those cardboard sleeves scratch them. That made the DVD's freeze once in awhile.
159420411X|5.0|Ever wonder why some people are just better at some things?  Ever wonder why some people think they are good at something but really are not?  Well this book won't answer that for all cases, but the insights are incredible.<br />How our personal bias influences our decisions, every decision to a greater or lesser extent, even if you recognize your biases and try to account for them.  And why it isn't necessarily a bad thing.<br /><br />This guy is smart, incredibly so, moreover he is insightful when commenting on human behavior.
1451695187|4.0|FYI, Dr. Alexander DOES describe his near-death experience (NDE), but the bulk of the book is dedicated to PROVING there is an afterlife and that NDEs are NOT simply the result of the human brain under stress. He wants people to know that heaven is real AND GOD DOES EXIST and there is now SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE to PROVE it! Again, a great (& quick) read!
B008645YEE|3.0|not what i thought it would be. maybe you should enable people to listen to the songs on the cd before buying them
B000I9S69K|5.0|Anyone who has seen this movie knows that it is a fantastic classic. Amazon's online video service makes this movie even more enjoyable by having it in great quality.
B00004STPT|2.0|same commentary as stated above. i guess it is better to record the life performances than hear the whole cd
0425263908|5.0|Love the way the romance develops and carries a real story line, enjoyed it a lot, and gave my my husband ideas ;)
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|If you were even mildly involved with pop culture and video games during the 80's, this is a great book to read.<br /><br />Taking you down memory lane in an future world, there is enough pop culture references to make anyone smile, and it turns out it is a great page turner / adventure on it's own for a younger modern audience.

B003VANOFY|4.0|This is the best pair of headphones I have owned.  I have used Plantronics, Bose, Klipsch  and a handful of other brands and this headset is the single best combination of all qualities I looked for.  For a little over $100 I got crisp clear voice recording, a very comfortable and easily adjusted fit and excellent sound quality.  I don't use the buttons on the side much, but they are handy when I do need them, and when I choose to leave the headset plugged into it's USB cord there is plenty of length for me to function.  I did struggle a little with the fit of the USB plug (it was very tight) but I consider that to be an advantage when I am using the headset in a manner like a corded version as the connection is unlikely to fail.  I have put this headset through some abuse and dropped it a few times and it has not failed at all.  Other headsets may outshine this in one or two categories but if you want something convenient, and comfortable with high end sound without hurting your wallet too much, then this is a great option.<br /><br />For the TLDR folks:  Comfortable, easily adjusted, easily set up.  High quality microphone for voice, and high quality sound.  Functions flawlessly in a wireless configuration and there is plenty of cord and a firm plug to allow it to operate as a wired headset.<br /><br />Update:  After using this headset for a couple of years I have noticed that it periodically loses it's wireless signal.  Other customers mentioned this in their reviews but I never encountered it consistently until recently.  There are times when the signal cuts out every few minutes even while sitting next to the transmitter, so I took a star off.  I still think it's a great deal and I don't regret the purchase.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|It is a sad story, but very suspenseful, I guessed the correct perpetrator, but didn't like the ending!  Enjoyed reading it.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|This sweet, heartfelt book reminded me of movies like Waking Ned Devine or The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain. It even had some Forrest Gump-ian characteristics (without the Southern accent or the meteoric run through historical events). But despite some similarities, this was a unique book with a story all its own.<br /><br />Harold Fry recently retired from his job, and now doesn't feel motivated to do much of anything. His very presence seems to irritate his wife, Maureen. But then again, their relationship has been strained for some time, full of hurt and anger both spoken and unspoken, especially since their son, David, left home.<br /><br />One day, Harold receives a letter from an unlikely source--Queenie Hennessy, a former coworker he hasn't seen or heard from in 20 years. Queenie wrote to tell Harold that she is in hospice suffering from terminal cancer, and wanted to say goodbye. Harold is shocked by this news and touched by the memories Queenie's letter stirred up, so he quickly dashes off a note of support, and heads to the corner mailbox. Yet as he arrives at the mailbox, he realizes it is a nice day outside, and decides to keep walking to the next one.<br /><br />On his journey to the post office, from where he figures sending the letter will allow it to arrive quicker, Harold has a chance encounter that changes everything. And then he decides he must keep walking, all the way to visit Queenie in person to help save her--despite the fact it is a 600-mile journey from his home in Kingsbridge to the hospice in Berwick-on-Tweed. Not to mention he hasn't had much physical exercise in many years, and isn't all dressed for that type of journey.<br /><br />But walk he does, much to his surprise, and Maureen's shock, anger, and chagrin. Harold's walk opens his mind to memories both good and painful, as he relives his friendship with Queenie and tries to figure out exactly where his and Maureen's relationship went wrong. \\"Life was very different when you walked through it,\\" he said, and along his walk he comes into contact with many different people and realizes that each has an interesting story to tell.<br /><br />\\"The world was made up of people putting one foot in front of the other; and a life might appear ordinary simply because the person living it had been doing so for a long time.\\" Harold's journey takes many interesting twists and turns, and people's reactions to it become almost indicative of the world we live in today. And during Harold's absence, Maureen tries to figure out the root of her anger with Harold, and whether her life is worth living without him.<br /><br />This is a compelling, enjoyable, and warm story about the unlikely journeys we take, sometimes simply to prove we still have life inside of us. It's also a story about the things we say and don't say to those we care about, and the ramifications of both. I liked this book quite a bit, although I could have done without the events around the public's embracing of Harold's pilgrimage, as I felt it took the book into more satirical territory than the story needed. Beyond that, however, this book had charm, the special charm you feel after a whimsical movie like the ones I mentioned above.
0811875555|5.0|Beautiful book with hundreds of full color pictures and graphic sketches.  Perfect for the serious graphic artist or for the budding artist in your family.  Nothing like learning from the best, and Glen Keane's work will inspire any artist.  An added delight was the background info of how the story of Rapunzel evolved to the big screen.  Highly recommended.

B008XNZMOU|5.0|Red   You would think that writing about past boyfriends and fairytales in a song would not get you far. Taylor Swift has been doing that since the age of 16. She has become one of the most popular country artists of the decade. With arenas selling out within sixty seconds of the time the tickets went on sale for her Red tour. Taylor Swift has become one of the biggest stars of the decade.  ` In the beginning, Taylor Swift was only 16 years old when her first cd, Taylor Swift, was released in 2006. Since she was only a new comer only thirty-nine thousand copies of the cd were sold within the first week. Two years later she released her second cd, Fearless, selling 3.2 million copies by 2009. In 2009 she became the youngest singer to headline her first tour. After her first tour she released her third cd, Speak Now, in 2010 and it was her biggest album yet. Speak Now sold over a million copies within the first week. Now, \\"Red\\" has become one of her biggest albums. It was expected to sell 1.1 million copies within the first week. Red was released on October 22, 2012 and within four days it sold over nine hundred thousand copies and over a million within the first week.   Over time, Taylor Swift would write about the things she has experienced with past relationships, her friends and family, or just by observing other people. Her songs have more meaning to them than other people may realize. However, some people may disagree because to them it is just another song. In her songs she never tells her listeners word for word what exactly they mean it is more putting the pieces together like a puzzle yourself. For example, in her song \\"Red\\" she says, \\"loving him was like driving a new Maserati down a dead end street.\\" She basically says that she was in a relationship that may seem good, but in reality it is going nowhere. She would also write about people she would just observe. For example, her song Stay Beautiful (Taylor Swift & Liz Rose) - \\"After hearing my songs, a lotof people ask me, `How many boyfriends have you HAD?' And I always tell them that more of my songs come from observation than actual experience. In other words, you don't have to date someone to write a song about them. This is a song I wrote about a guy I never dated! Wow, right? Haha. This song is about a guy I thought was cute, and never really talked to him much. But something about him inspired this song, just watching him.\\" Another example would be her song Fifteen which is basically a message to young high school girls. In her song she sings about her best friend Abigail. In her song she says, \\"Abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind.\\" From a young teens point of view they would think Abigail was just madly in love, but the young adults think different. Whatever the reason is her music speaks to everybody.   Taylor Swift has sold out tickets all across the globe for her new Red tour in 2013. Her first set of tickets went on sale a few weeks ago and arenas sold out within sixty seconds. What makes her concerts so special? Previously on her Speak Now tour in 2011 she made her songs come to life. It was like watching a music video in person. Her whole stage had a different scene for every song. For example, when she sang her song Love Story the stage had a huge castle on it with stairs connected to both sides and people were dressed up in ball gowns dancing around and Taylor was as well. Another example would be on her Fearless tour in 2009 her opening song was You Belong with Me and she was dressed up as a band geek and so was her band like in her music video. Basically it is like going to watch a play at a theater. It is all one big event.   On the other hand, other people may disagree. In recent concert reviews parents have complained saying they do not like the way she performs and the music is too loud. The parents say the concert was a waste of money, but that their kids enjoyed it. Maybe this shows Taylor Swift is not for everyone. Maybe only the ears of teens and young adults enjoy her.  So, what makes Taylor Swift so popular? Is it her unique crossover from country to pop that attracts the fans? Or is it the innocent country girl that everyone can relate to? It could easily be her music that young girls everywhere relate to! It is all of the above and so much more. She has become an inspiration to all young girls across the world. All of her music is appropriate, but for her older fans they can take her lyrics into a deeper meaning. She writes stories and messages in her lyrics. Her albums are like a book written into lyrics. Taylor Swift is the biggest singer/song-writer in the world. With her sold out tours, over a million copies of her cds sold, and just her narrative lyrics is what made her the person she today.    Swift, Taylor A. \\"All The Awards Taylor Has Won.\\" [...]. T

B002L7O7XG|5.0|AWESOME SERVICE & ACCURATE DESCRIPTIONS. I think others should tell about the scratches on the discs instead of lying about it. This person said \\"NO SCRATCHES\\"! And he was honest and precise. Thank you. Now as far as the movies go, I WOULD RECOMMEND GETTING THE BLU RAY BOX SET INSTEAD OF THE DVD'S. It is a United Kingdom release, but the disc's play in \\"ALL REGIONS\\". Apparently the \\"police academy\\" movies are even more popular across the sea.

B00AKKGX4W|4.0|4.5 Stars<br />Reviewed by FRANCESCA & posted at Under the Covers Book Blog<br /><br />Another winner from Ms. Milan\\" ~Under the Covers<br /><br />If there is one thing I've come to realize about Courtney Milan's books is that she has come up with some unique plots for her books.  They are well thought out, researched and executed.  Her writing style flows and keeps you turning the pages effortlessly.<br /><br />In THE DUCHESS WAR we are introduced to yet another set of unique characters.  From the opening scene to the closing of the book, I couldn't stop reading.  It consumed any free time I had and I read this in less than 24 hours.  Why?  Because I felt compelled to know more, to find out what happens next.<br /><br />The Duke of Clermont, Robert Blaisdell, is hiding a secret.  But then again, so is Miss Minnie Pursling because she is not who she says she is.  They come from two completely different backgrounds and lifestyles but they are very similar deep down.  Minnie is trying to hide her past and Robert is trying not to become his.<br /><br />Robert was a good hero, not great enough to be \\"claimed\\" material, but flirtatious, idealistic, strong and determined.  Also he was quite the smooth talker  Very direct in his approach of Minnie.  Maybe it's just that, as he said, when she was around she couldn't think and did stupid things.  There were several moments that their banter made me laugh.  But in the end I thought he was a bit naive himself, and I'm not just talking about the fact that he was a virgin.<br /><br />Minnie, on the other hand, has known the darker side of life.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm definitely loving season 3 of this show.  Season two was a little slow developing sometimes, but I believe that has been addressed in this season.  That isn't to say season 3 is all action devoid of story, in fact the story is the best part.  It has the intensity you would hope for, with cliff hanging intrigue that everyone loves and hates in a series.  I like how the show approaches the topic from a more realistic (if you can call it that) aspect of how people would make decisions and how they would handle day to day life in a zombie wasteland.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|This camera bag is very specious. It can fit camera body, 4-5 lenses and all the accessories. All compartments are separated with nice and thick padding. It is waterproof as well.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this DVD!!!! I have only been doing it for a week, but OMG I can feel a difference!!! I haven't seen too much yet, but from where I started a week ago (not being able to finish the first workout, and feeling so sore I could hardly walk for two days!) I am now able to complete the first workout AND walk just fine the next day! I have noticed my endurance and stamina improving!<br /><br />I am about 50 pounds overweight, and not naturally athletic! Infact, other than dancing in high school, I have always hated working out! But Jillian has such a good personality and she really pushes you and makes you think! Just when you want to give up, she tells you \\"you can do it!\\" \\"If 400 pd people can do jumping jacks so can you!\\" And that runs through my head each time I do them, because instead of getting tired and stopping I think that if they can do it so can I!!!<br /><br />I can't wait to see where I am on day 30! :)<br /><br />Just purchased her 6-week abs and No More Trouble Zones, so I can't wait to try them! SO much more convenient, fun and WAY less expensive than a gym membership!! GO JILLIAN!
072325804X|3.0|I did not think it happened to me but I received a different cover book of Beatrix Potter The complete Tales.  I saw one review already mentioned it.  The book had different cover as very simple Peter rabbit inside of over shape, hard cover with blue back ground.  As I adult, it looked good to me but not for my neice who aged only 6 years old.  I decided to keep it for another teenager neice and placed an order again.  I reported to Amazon and they also wondered they had different version of it.  New order will be arrive today afternoon and I'll tell Amazon which one I get this time.  In addition, my order came late even I  ordered it with special offer of one day free shipping from discover card.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Don't listen to what anybody else says this app is really good.<br />Its the best photo editing app yet!<br />Amazon just needs to fix the actual kindle.<br />Hope the new one is better. (:<br />-g
192076920X|4.0|This is the second largest novel I have ever read, but I was not bored. I still remember most of it even if I read it a year ago. The book vividly describes the living conditions of the people in the slums of Bombay and the underground criminal culture. I can't say the book sheds a good light on the city of Bombay but the human element is highlighted and you see goodness in the common people, especially in the slums. Sometimes the stories sounded too simplistic and sometimes they were too dramatized like a movie, but it looks like that was the intent of the author. I am glad this was mostly fiction. Had it been a true biography, my review would have been different, but for entertainment purposes, the book hits the mark.
1607066017|5.0|I love books, but have never been interested in comics at all; it was always difficult for me to keep myself invested in their stories, so when a friend touted this comic as something that I absolutely had to read, I was skeptical. I ended up ordering it for another friend as a Christmas present and when it arrived in the mail, I began to flip through and was immediately hooked. I read the entire thing in less than 30 minutes and was craving more.<br /><br />It is a beautiful story with gorgeous artwork, and the pacing is brilliant. By the end of the comic, I felt as if I had not read a comic, but had watched an incredibly well-produced and compelling movie. An excellent buy, to be sure.
B00632HWOG|3.0|like the new ui,  cleaner with better functionality. However, still has one major bug, crashes anytime I try to delete messages. hopefully a fix is on its way.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|it is a very fun game to play. and a lot of people just love like and hope I can play forever
B006KX3GXO|5.0|all u guys who say this app sucks lies because I never got any ads that's actually what I think is awesome about it!!!!!!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I like it so much that we can slice food up it is do much and never can stop playing I can't get it out of my head
B005LAII1C|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters and within the first 10 mins I knew I had to own it once it came out on blue ray. I loved this movie. It is hilarious and a very original idea. Definitely not appropriate for children but a great adult movie.
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|While Young Girls is a weak, and cliche'd opener, Locked Out of Heaven is a great choice of the strong single for the album, and it's what drew me to checking the rest of his songs out.  For me, this album has a lot of love / hate.  Treasure is a feel good song that has nothing standing out for it, but I can't stop listening to it.  Moonshine, in my opinion is the best song on the album.  It reminds me so much of Michael Jackson.  Love the ballads he does, those are his strongest songs.  When I Was Your Man is a song I wish I wrote.  If I Knew is bland, but enjoyable.<br /><br />Let's talk about Gorilla.  It starts off sounding like some weird 90's boy band hit, and then proceeds to uncomfortably gross sex scenes that just don't do it for me.  He can write metaphors around so many other topics, why did he choose to be so literal with a drug induced sex romp?<br />Natalie is also another pointless song that neither fun, emotional nor artistic.<br />Show Me has such a recycled instrumental part that I can't listen to it at all.<br />Money Make Her Smile, I didn't listen to more than once, uninteresting.<br /><br />So, 6/10 enjoyable songs on a pop album is a big win for Bruno Mars in my book.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|My boys love this movie and I love Dr. Suess so I don't mind watching it with them over and over. Arrived on time, no complaints.
0062183591|4.0|I am a student in the Carlow University Master's of Science in Fraud and Forensics (MFF) course on Forensic Research and Analysis. The MFF homepage can be located at the following link [...]. Dr. Ariely's book was part of our assigned literature in this class. Usually I am not a fan of assigned readings, but this book was definitely an exception. I found myself hooked from the first page that I had read.    My favorite chapter in this book was chapter 5, Why Wearing Fakes Makes Us Cheat More. I am very in tune with my sense of fashion and before I even began to read this chapter I knew that I was going to enjoy reading it. The idea that when people wear fake designers they tend to cheat more than people who wear authentic brand names is something that had never even crossed my mind. This chapter and many others have opened my eyes to an array of different insights into the way that humans think.    I think that the only critique that I have for this book is for Dr. Ariely to expand his experimental settings and sample sizes. By doing this it would help to cut down on some of the repetition throughout this book.    I think that while pursuing my career, and even throughout my career, this will be a book that I will always remember and frequently refer back to. This book provides insight into every day life situations, which will be helpful to me as an investigator in the field.
B000065U1N|5.0|Good movie, it arrived on time. No complaints about the product or ship time. If you enjoy true stories you would enjoy this.
0060899220|5.0|Get ready!  its one crazy ride! i also bought this book as a gift for my dad and he enjoyed it as much as i did....Love you Anthony Bourdain!
B00005JKGK|5.0|I love this movie and could watch it over and over. It arrived on time with no issues. If you haven't seen this movie you should definitely watch it. I also loved the book and would recommend you also read that if you like this movie.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I can't stop listening to this cd . . . it's unbelievable great!  I highly recommend it to everyone who likes music!
B001QOGYBI|4.0|This movie is definitely strange but my children love it. It has a good cast of voices and the story isn't bad.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This app works exactly as expected, isn't buggy at all, and keeps me entertained for an unreasonable amount of time.
0062086529|5.0|My boys who are 6 and 7 have me read this to them every single night before bed. The book is very simple but fantastic. Its a great classic that all children will definitely enjoy.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book was better than I imagined, It deserves all five stars. The series is even more interesting than it sounds.
B0072OFM28|5.0|Awesome! The new actors were a little hard to get used to at first, but they really did a great job capturing the essence of their respective characters...definitely a worthy addition to my collection...plus got an excellent price by pre-ordering!!
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|Sound effects are great, movie is very enjoyable and excellent for this season.<br />I have watched it twice within a week and I am not the type of person to watch a movie twice very often.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|This was a VERY nicely done prequel...an awesome way to introduce and develop new characters without 'upsetting' the original fan base :)
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I found this book too degrading towards females. It did, however, get great reviews but it wasn't for me. I didn't read the whole book either.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|What can I say? Nothing beats the original! This series is one of the few I've been captivated by in a really long time. It is shocking, gruesome, bloody, and oh yeah, unbelievably addictive!! Hats off to the original cast and everyone who contributed to this production.<br />R.I.P. AW.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Easy to navigate. I find spider solitaire more challenging and much more interesting than regular solitaire. I'm glad I bought it.
B008G59IBI|4.0|I laught out loud every time people complaint that Green Day songs sound alike and there are a lot of fillers in their albums. First of all, I wouldn't take any GD album seriously neither in its content nor its form. And when there was an album to take seriously (American idiot-2004) it caught me by surprise listening to \\"Jesus of suburbia\\" while I was going, \\"Um... what happened with the nuts GD I used to know... this is AWESOME!!!\\".<br /><br />Anyway, &iexcl;UNO! was a really great \\"punk-rock\\" album that went straight to the point, &iexcl;DOS! was more like a fun record to listen to remembering some 60's or 70's vibe in the songs that were there. Now, &iexcl;TRE! goes back and forward in that matter. By times it sounds so superfluous and by others a little bit more serious. Personally, so far my favorite songs are \\"Sex, drug and violence\\" (this one reminds me to an old GD..a la 2000 light years away), \\"99 revolutions\\" (great, great song... enough said), \\"Missing you\\" (GD architepical song... this is pretty cool too), \\"The forgotten\\" (eventhough it sounds a little bit pushed in the sound... it's a great tune from GD). This is a record to enjoy just because.<br /><br />Personally, now that I listened to the three records i would place them in the following rank: 1.- UNO, 2.- TRE and 3.- DOS. Each and everyone of them has its appeal. it depends in what mood you are.
0062502174|5.0|A classic novel, and it's easy to see why.  Apart from being inspired, I really liked the story line.  Highly recommended.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|what a fun movie!!  I saw it in the theater and loved it and the Blu-ray did not disappoint either!!  Great extras and again I've watched the movie a bunch of times too.  Can't wait for the next one!
B001GKWBO6|5.0|Wonderful, soothing music. I listen to it at bedtime to relax. The music was in the soundtrack of The Intouchabales.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I was lucky enough to grab it when it was around $20 and I was blown away by the packaging!  It's in a book format and the discs are held snugly in while having just great artwork to admire for each movie.  Love this series!!
B009JBZH54|5.0|All three movies in great detail and an abundance of special features.<br />Audio 10/10<br />Video 10/10<br />Special features 8.5/10<br /><br />What's not to like?
B000AJIF4E|5.0|These are without doubt the best headphones I've ever owned.  The sound quality is incredible- rich and full without over-emphasizing any part of the sound spectrum.  Bass is amazing and brain scrambling.  Mid range is clear and precise and not at all obscured by the lower and upper registers.  Highs are crisp and clear.<br />When I put them on for the first time, the fit was comfortable.  They are very good at blocking outside sounds.  The first music I found on my IPod that I wanted to hear was Dvorak's 9th Symphony.  Wonderful.  Instruments were distinct and clear.  Horns sounded rich and full.  A little Springsteen and the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper confirmed that these phones will handle a broad range of musical styles.  Sgt. Pepper was the album that made an audiophile of me back in the 60's when it was released.  At that time, I had a cheap portable stereo with a tilt out turntable and fold out speakers.  I wore out Sgt Pepper on that thing, and then, a friend happened to have it playing on his parents' high end Marantz receiver and impressive speakers when I stopped by one day.  I heard things from that music on his system that I had never heard on my cheap stereo, and I was hooked.  These phones at less than  a hundred dollars give me everything I heard on that high end system all those years ago.  I've seen headphones listing for a hell of a lot more, and I can't imagine that they can sound that much better than these Sony's to justify spending several times more for them.  I consider these to be an incredible bargain worth every penny.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This is just a great story and an absolute easy read.  Even for a NY giants fan.  And I really can't stand the eagles

1579121306|5.0|An amazing number of puzzles.  Worth it alone for the number of mate in one and mate in two puzzles as I recall.  Nice format very direct no fluff.  Just do the puzzle and if you're stuck look up the results.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a really fun and great app! a lot of fun and challenging games to compete at. lots of games so you never get bored. always something different to play  no matter whet kind of mood you are in.
B009X01C64|5.0|The Marware Revolve Protrait and Landscape Standing Case for the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\" in Black is a beautiful case... and I'm not just talking about looks - although it is a nice looking case! If you've read some of my other reviews and heard my complaints about cases esp. lack of padding/protection; you'll understand the minute you have this case in your hands why I like this case SO much! You can tell the moment you take it out of the package it's better \\"than the average bear\\"! The soft black leather outside was cushiony; not the least bit stiff like the others I didn't care for - the ones I feared wouldn't offer the protection my precious device would need!<br /><br />This Marware case is made specifically for the Fire 8.9 HD, so it's not going to work for the Fire, 7\\" HD, or any other tablet for that matter. When you place the 8.9 on the shell and push down, the Kindle \\"snaps\\" right into place, letting you know it's secure! Afterwhich you can rotate it either horizontally or vertically within the case - which ever gives you the perspective you need at the time or whichever gives you the best viewing angle.<br /><br />The Revolve also comes in several jewel tone colors - which would please even the pickiest... for our oldest, the practical one I would choose black, for our daughter who's a \\"free spirit\\" I'd choose purple, the same for her brother who's also her best friend, and orange for our youngest because it's his favorite color!<br /><br />Aside from my rooCase for Nook, this is my favorite case! The rooCase is RED! It has more inner pockets, a place for the stylus, & the inside is a bit softer, layered, padded, and sueded. Could NOT believe they didn't make one JUST like it for all the Kindles! I'll have to see if I can use the rooCase for one of my Fires since the Nook quit working after a year! (LOVE the case, unfortunately NOT B&N! Bought a 3 yr warranty - which they won't honor!) But I digress...<br /><br />This is a \\"Top Notch\\" product and I recommend it completely!it completely!
030795062X|5.0|If this author's thought process is representatitve of most Japanese people, then they are both weird & fascinating to me. On the flipside they might say the same about westerners. Anyhow do yourself a favour, open your mind & read this book. A thought provoking & sensual book.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|If you like John Grisham's books (and I do), you'll like this. The protagonist is the typical John Grisham; I'd like to see him stretch a little. But a good quick read.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|We love watching It's a Wonderful Life through out the year, but especially at Christmas time.  Christmas would not be Christmas without watching this wonderful classic.  Wish things were still as innocent as that time.

0345803493|5.0|This is my favorite book in the Fifty Shades Trilogy! There is just SOOOOOO much going on! I couldn't put the book down. Each chapter end leaves you wanting more, so you have no choice but to start a new one!

B001AQO3QA|5.0|Great price. Fast delivery. Awesome collection. Best on bluray. Also purchased Prometheus on bluray 3D. Very proud to own such a collection.

0679420266|5.0|I had somehow gotten the idea that Camus' writing would be beyond me. I can happily say that I found this book to be an excellent read.  I prefer to get hardcover books over paperbacks.  This Everyman Library edition has become A welcome addition to my library.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|even in my youth i was NEVER a rod stewart fan and i was really surprised at how much i liked this album.  it is  one of those  that can stand on its own i.e. i usually have to mix songs from many albums to be content.  but this album has many more keepers than exclusions.
0679437223|5.0|Many years ago, I was given a paperback copy of this book by a WWII Army Air Corps veteran. He told that it would tell me all that I needed to know about the War.  I have since read this book over again many times. I have given my copies of the book to other as recommended reading.  I was pleased to find this Everyman's Library edition available.<br />Also, I won't tell you about &#34;Snowden's secret.&#34;  You'll have to  read the book to find out........
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Samsung Infuse ...Enjoyed the game ...some parts easy &amp; some challenging. l had no problems w/zooming (using my fingers to make picture bigger or smaller). The only downside was that each time the screen is touched it counts against u. Overall, it's a very good game.
B009JBZH54|4.0|I love these movies, I'm probably in the minority here but my favorite is Batman Begins. This box set is an excellent value!
B005CFWO0C|5.0|Very comfortable.  Just wish they came in more colors like red or navy!  Would definitely add more to my closet.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|AMAZING!  This album is fantastic and  I love the sound/feel of Unorthodox Jukebox.  Bruno's voice is beautiful and every song is great.  This is an album that any music lover will enjoy.
B005PWPUW6|5.0|I bought this so I could connect an analog only sound bar to my flat screen TV.  I had wrongly assumed that my TV had analog audio outputs and there was no way to connect the sound bar I had recently purchased.  I liked the soundbar and so rather than returning it, I bought this DAC to convert my optical signal to analog stereo and it works perfectly.  This particular unit has both coaxial and optical inputs which makes it a little more versitile than others in the same price range.
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|It would have earned a solid four stars if it wasn't for the constant nag reminder to rate the game. I hate being nagged. Contrary to other reviews, the game can be saved between levels and you can zoom except for the &quot;spot the difference&quot; puzzles. You could really use them then, too. So yeah, about a three, which so go up with the removal of the nag reminder.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|This disc arrived on time. A minor scratch to the disc was noted, but hopefully will play without a problem. My mom was tickled to receive this!
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|The game has a cute idea to it, sister goes missing you try to find her, but its lacking in a few areas. The lag in the game is rather annoying, kind of like when a Cd skips, and when you zoom in it counts against you, same when you try and zoom back out. There are also things you have to find that occur more than once so you don't know which one is the right one and the wrong choice counts against you. Overall cute game but lacking.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|My husband and I only watch this show on the DVD box set....its's too torturous to watch only an episode at a time on TV :) We wait months for the newest box set to be released and usually watch it all in a few days...sounds weird probably, but to us it is worth it! This season (7) arrived on time and was wrapped nicely!

B003VS0CX8|5.0|A classic!  My only regret on this purchase was not waiting a couple more weeks as the price dropped.  :)
B001PUBLF2|5.0|Excelente trabaja de esta banda con este desenchufado siempre impecables y con una sonorida incre&iacute;ble y los arreglos a sus temas para este concierto y los covers dan a entender que ellos tienen pasta para rato.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Given that I consider The Godfather (1 and 2 anyway) as the greatest American film of all time, I expected to love it.<br /><br />I was very pleased with the quality of the &#34;restoration&#34; version.  I had viewed the one earlier DVDs and was glad I waited to purchase the Coppola one.  I never saw this version on DVD so, can't tell how it might compare with the BluRay but, the BluRay (on 1 and 2 anyway) is wonderful to view.<br /><br />PS: Seems like some (many?) of the special features were done for the Coppola version. Not certain if they deleted some that may have been present on the earliest (was ir 5-disc set) DVD. IF SO (and I'm not certain it is) such would be a loss.
B008OJ291W|5.0|Este señor sigue sorprendiendo a todos recopilando sus mejores éxitos de la carrera de la banda que fundo en este increíble trabajo el cual volvió a grabar todos los instrumentos y ademas el ingrediente más importante es que el mismo Jeff interpreta casi todos los instrumentos simplemente el &#34;MAESTRO&#34; Gracias Jeff.

B00881VLCE|4.0|good app but the lack of ability to change the background is frustrating.  many of the pieces are hard to see against the dark blue background.
B004MOMT2M|1.0|I purchased this in hopes of hearing this wonderful album in 5.1 surround sound and what I wound up hearing was lots of reverb.  I checked my receiver settings, all was well, set to Straight (no dsp effects turned on) and still, that damn reverb was there.  Why? Simple.  No 5.1 surround mix was ever done.  the \\"audio engineer\\" simply processed the stereo mix through a dsp to create the illusion of a surround sound mix.  It's just plain awful.
0743270754|4.0|The book was in great shape for a used book. I was very happy with it. I haven't completed reading the book but it is very interesting.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Although I pre-judged it as being monotonous and boring, I enjoyed every moment of this movie.  A beautiful, touching story, with a great sense of humor.  One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.

B007TBZ63Y|4.0|After forcing my dad to buy me the book, I sat down and began to read. Little did I know I would become addicted and unable to do anything else while the book sat unfinished. Really, I thought this was a pretty good book but maybe not quite up to par with The Lost Hero and Son of Neptune.<br /><br />Cons were...not many. There was definitely lots of action from the very beginning, even within the first chapter. Drama and romance was to be expected as well. I was a little disappointed that we didn't get to read anything in Jason's POV or Frank's or a few other characters, the main ones being Annabeth, Percy, Piper, and Leo. MOstly Annabeth and Percy, which I am not sure I liked. They already got five books dedicated completely to them! Not to be a spoiler, but I will say that Annabeth gets a crazy amount of attention in this book. So Annabeth fans be happy rejoice and buy the book. Frank fans, be a little disappointed, very little Frank Hazel action. However he is still very cool with his shape shifting abilities. The end is a little rushed, that's what I felt anyway. Maybe I was just reading to fast....<br /><br />Now for the pros, e do find put what Leo Valdez has to do with Sammy Valdez. Plently of Percabeth and JasonXPiper. We find out what exactly the Mark of Athena is. LOTS of action!!!!! It had me from the very first page. I couldn't put it down without a little voice calling me to pick it back up NOW. I thought the actual Doors of Death were very clever (won't say anything else about them...) and that the demigods learn some good lessons within this book especially Percy and Annabeth. I am huge fans of them. And the huge cliffhanger at the end!!!!! Wait....the cliffhanger isn't good, oh no!!! This guy loves cliffies:( RIODRIAN!!! Are telling that I have to wait another YEAR for the next book to come out?! Unfortunately yes. That is exactly what that means!!! The House of Hades comes out in the fall of 2013 *sobs*<br /><br />Dispute this review maybe coming off as negative,it is not meant to be negative. I loved the book and it has earned a spot under my favorites section on my kindle. I highly recommend the Mark of Athena and will support the Heroes of Olympus until my last breath.<br /><br />Thank you for reading!!! Now buy the book!!!!
B006G83G2O|5.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns is a breathtaking story set against the volatile events of Afghanistan's last thirty years, from the Soviet invasion to the reign of the Taliban to post-Taliban rebuilding, that puts the violence, fear, hope and faith of this country in intimate, human terms. It is a tale of two generations of characters brought jarringly together by the tragic sweep of war, where personal lives, the struggle to survive, raise a family, find happiness, are inextricable from the history playing out around them.<br />Propelled by the same storytelling instinct that made The Kite Runner a beloved classic, A Thousand Splendid Suns is at once a remarkable chronicle of three decades of Afghan history and a deeply moving account of family and friendship. It is a striking, heartwrenching novel of an unforgiving time, an unlikely friendship, and an indestructible love, a stunning accomplishment.
B0016NF06O|5.0|What can I say? Picture says everything - two great musicians performing together. Warm, easy listening music for everyone. Another great CD after &#34;Here we go again&#34;.

0756686970|5.0|This book is AMAZING - full guide through all Lego Star Wars and Lego Clone Wars figures. Every figure has full description, in which part of Star Wars you can see it, in which Lego set you can find it and also showing different version of any figure. If you collecting them,  this is perfect book - you can see which figure you are missing and when you want to buy any (for example on Amazon) then description will tell you if particular one is rare and worth to pay a little bit more or help you to find out if this what somebody offer is not &#34;fake&#34; figure, build by someone using different Lego bricks.<br /><br />This book has also one exclusive figure which can't be found in any of Lego set - at least this is what I've got.<br />My son is reading /watching this book on and on, love it and help us to buy some really unique figures.<br />Be aware - you will be addicted to it!!!
B009JBZH54|5.0|I bought this to have it in my collection Love the Box art and glad to have it in my collection I bought 2 of them so I could open 1 of them.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I love this cover. I also bought a gel skin case, but because I put this on first, have never used the other. I love this because it covers up the screen also. I can throw it in my purse, in a bag or wherever and not worry about the screen. The folding part really helps so you don't have to hold the Kindle all the time.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|I feel that Expendables 2 is better than Expendables, however it is still a entertaining movie.  Enjoyable to watch and fun one liners
B007FDE4Y8|5.0|This is an excellent stabilizer system. It's the best unit that I've purchased for the price. I wouldn't ask them to change anything about this product.
B009MF56GC|5.0|In my opinion Expendables 2 is way better than the first one, it has everything that I expected from the First movie.
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|Im a huge fan of Adeles and when i heard she was doing the main song for the James Bond series i was very excited! I had bought the soundtrack to Skyfall when the movie 1st came out and did not include the Adele song on there so i was very disappointed. I was waiting to see if they would come out with a single version of this song and happen to find it on Amazon by accident. I was so happy that i just got it Saturday and i have the complete James Bond song collection. I have the cd that has all the music of James Bond till Quatum of Solace so Amazon comes through again with 5 star service that cant be matched and also the price it was a steal to get Adele and complete my Bond series! Thank you Amazon waiting for more items ive ordered to come cant wait!
B0000669JL|5.0|I love this CD.  After watching Bob Marley’s documentary, I was compelled to purchase his music. This is the best CD I have ever purchased.  The music and words are riveting.  I could listen to it every day - all day.
1401937519|5.0|I have never ordered 10 copies of a book to give to close friends. I have done this with this one! You are probably not going to be among the lucky ones who get this book for Christmas - so buy it yourself! A boundary-breaking experience to read, transformative and hits the nail right on the head in presenting non-duality, that everything is love, and that true healing is to be YOU.
0316223239|3.0|Not a new subject for fiction - kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment, serial rape, sexual bondage. But Donoghue's method of telling it, from the point of view of a five year-old child resulting from all this, gives it a very original twist. And she maintains this POV well, making it seem quite genuine, with the language, together with the sense of innocence and wonderment. That part is very well done. The problem is it begins to wear a bit thin after a hundred pages or so. And the book does not really take off until about 125 pages in where a kind of climax is reached. Then it gradually goes downhill, tapering off to a most anticlimactic ending. And I call it an 'ending' because no particular 'conclusion' is reached.<br /><br />My wife and daughter loved this story of Jack and Ma, found it quite gripping. Women in general seemed to love it, in fact. But I thought it was just okay. And I do like a lot of women's book. This one just failed to move me. Clever, well-written, an original sort of premise. Yet it failed to really engage me. Not much really 'happened' here, but I don't think that's the real problem. Maybe the sense of danger, terror, horror - whatever you might call the central point of this story - is more real to a woman. I dunno. The truth is, I wish I could have liked it more, but, well ... Catchy, short title - ROOM. And a very small room at that; in the end, however, just not all that interesting - to me anyway.<br /><br />- Tim Bazzett, author of the memoir, BOOKLOVER
B006JPS1OM|3.0|One of the best hidden object, puzzle games I've played, very addictive etc.... However there is a problem with accessing saved games in the unlocked full version, the developers are working on this and have assured me that it will be sorted as soon as possible.....

0399160450|5.0|\\"Tom Clancy with Mark Greaney\\" is not quite the same as Tom Clancy at his prime, but they're still pretty darn good.  If \\"Patriot Games\\" & \\"Clear and Present Danger\\" were10's, then \\"Threat Vector\\" was at least an 8.5.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this 850 page tome; thriller fans will not be disappointed.  I was blessed to snag it from my public library during publication week, but if I had paid for it, I'd consider it money well spent.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|Obviously, i knew te movies, but i wanted to have all in a unique box, but this in not impressive, por example if we compare with Lord's of the Ring product (sorry for my english)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It has been a week since I read Wool and the first two parts of the prequel series Shift. I cannot get the silo world out of my mind, it's that addictive. I've searched for other works since then in the hope of finding other new stories and worlds but so far none compares with Hugh Howey's Silo universe, his brilliant story-telling and descriptive writing.<br /><br />Part of the magic ingredient that I think is making the silo series spread like wildfire and become so popular is the incredible realism of life in the silos. Add to that the quick release of new episodes to the big picture story line. I'm an addict waiting in line for the next fix, I want to know more. I really like the concept of waiting only a couple of months between the ebook release of parts to the story, though eventually I plan of getting print copies of the Wool/Shift/Dust trilogy from Simon and Schuster to sit right alongside my classic sci-fi collection on the shelf.<br /><br />The world that Howey creates, illuminated through the trials and tribulations of believable key characters, feels like it really could happen. I am morbidly fascinated by the world described in each sub-story and find myself wondering how the tale is going to eventually end ... hopefully not before another 6 or so novellas delivered every few months! I have a gut feeling the story will spill from a largely sci-fi following into a mainstream fiction audience ... and make a great movie.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|The best Sherlock Holmes series yet.  Great to watch over and over, the chemistry between Holmes and Watson is unequaled and the story line is directed for a modern audience.  Not my mother's Sherlock!!!
1451695195|2.0|I don't doubt that he experienced all of these things, but the story wasn't the clearest to understand. I didn't like the going back and forth with the story, and unless someone had a tape recorder in the room, the conversations with family members are acted as if they are being told verbatim, which is unlikely. His NDE was difficult to follow. I'd have liked to find this free vs. paying for it.
B004LROMQG|5.0|The series is only 5 seasons and has so much packed into every episode.  This will be enjoyed for many years to come and is very family friendly.
B0086700CM|2.0|I love this game and the app I have on my phone and my ipod touch work great but the kindle fire app sucks! Its either too sensative and jumps was to high or turns too far, or it isn't sensative enough and doesn't respond to my fingers :-( Im sad bc this is one of my favorite games
B0077EBWVI|2.0|I was \\"forced\\" by a friend to watch this movie. It was horrible, especially in comparison to the original one. And that's saying something. Cheesy acting, cheesy script.
B007L6VR12|5.0|it was amazing. Wes Anderson did it again! I love this movie and believe everyone should watch it! thanks so much!
B000002MNL|5.0|Sultry voice, cleverly worded verses, hilarious song titles and thought-provoking subject matter... How can you not love Morrissey?  He is the crooner of the new age, and with a more clever sense of humor than The Rat Pack.  Don't get me wrong, I love Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr and the rest of them... but it's Moz that really makes you melt.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Just started playing....Don't know yet if I like this game or  not. Graphics  look good, so far, but  I haven't yet understood what the goal(s) are.
B008DKBPTO|5.0|This is my original review: \\"Although it is supposedly sized for \\"Kindle\\" I couldn't even force my keyboard Kindle into it. Wish the description had clearly stated which Kindle it does NOT fit, sad to have to send it back.  :-(\\"<br /><br />I have to say that once I realized that this product was intended for a smaller Kindle although I had been satisfied with my regular, older Kindles, I liked this envelope and its size so much that I started looking at the newer Kindles and ended up buying a Paperwhite, which I now love and use almost exclusively for my Kindle books. Once I knew I was going to keep the Paperwhite I immediately repurchased this envelope. My Paperwhite fits in it perfectly.  This case provides good protection, is very well-made, seems to have a liquid-resistant coating on the material, yet is light and fits into my purses very nicely.  Very pleased with the cover and would highly recommend.
B005LAJ22Q|3.0|The story unfolds in rural Georgia, and expands to Atlanta, with various interesting side shows, which may thicken the plot. Overall, a good story, which may make you to continue to watch.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie yet, WAIT and read at least the first book of the series! This movie does such a fantastic job going from paper to the big screen, making this rare gem of a movie worth watching every minute. Even if you don't read the book first, the story is brought alive with the talented cast and enough special effects to keep you rocking in your seat throughout!
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|is so violent and illogical that it is not for kids.<br />So who is it for, and who can get anything positive out of this stuff?<br />I really thought this was nonsense, and that Batman voice was terrible.<br />The idea that a fusion reactor is so small and portable and can be tossed around like a basketball is curious.<br />A terrible movie.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Excelent Product<br /><br />It arrived before the estimated date.  The package ontained exactly what the description tell.<br /><br />It arrived without any damage.

0891419063|5.0|This book walks you through the transformation of the soldier as the regard for  the enemy desends from respect to utter disgust.

B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Great game from the makers of 4 elements. Graphics are sharp and the sound is pretty good as  i well. I definitely recommend.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Very smooth game,  worth the price.  Nice amount of game time any it has great replay value as well.  It would help to have a big phone and remember to turn up your brightness.
B005DOKL3E|5.0|I wanted to bundle accessories for my Kindle but did not want to spend a ton on a cover. For my use it did not have to be leather or hard cased. Just needed for protecting my device.<br />I have had no issues with carrying my Kindle in my purse with this sleeve. The kindle is very protective and i think it is a good add on to a kindle purrchase
B009AMALGM|1.0|Not even bad in the scary, dirty way.  Just bad.<br /><br />That I actually gave another human being 15 cents to watch this cash-in on the PA series is shameful enough--truth be told, I gave $20.00.  And TAX.<br /><br />Watching this was possibly the only time I have found myself hating children, and I know that's wrong, but I did.  I hated the kid on the screen who was supposed to be spooky because he lived down the street and didn't seem to have a Mommy, I hated the teen actresses who were genuinely bad at acting, I hated the pimping of the storyline from the excellent previous film, and hated myself, again, for paying the money to see this piece of s***<br /><br />Basically the plot line is as follows: somehow, Katie (Katie Featherstone, who I always love to watch \\"acting\\") has moved down the block from another family who is also cursed with the ooga booga wealthy related demon curse.  She moves in with Hunter, who she snatched in the second film.  I'm assuming all of this, but it's all assumption, since the actual movie never makes it clear.  She cracks another person's neck.  Does that even count as a spoiler?<br /><br />The directors have been getting lazy since the first one and have been cashing in more and more since the third edition, and not just in this series.  Do NOT put your plastic, helpless credit card through the stress of being scanned by getting it near Redbox to rent this movie.

B007CW2FIE|5.0|Very happy to see this set, finally offering all of the English Concert's superb Vivaldi recordings in one box.  If you haven't heard Simon Standage's incredible solo violin work on the Four Seasons (not included in Archiv's first English Concert Vivaldi box), it will take your breath away with its power and virtuosity.  Everything else here is equally well performed -- a not to be missed set.

If you love Michael, I can assure that you will be touched in your heart. I got very emotional when I read the book.<br /><br />Sincerely Pia Hansen

If you like dry and slightly black humour, this book is also for you. I have read thousands and thousands of books over the last fifty years and this one has to rate well within the top twenty. A bloody brilliant effort! I cannot see why it only cost so little. This book is a rare find. Read it!
B009S33I68|4.0|With more details of the battle, and insights into the Americans and Vietnamese that fought there. More than just a faceless enemy, the Vietnamese are seen by Moore as a worthy and valiant opponent.

B000XR4OC0|1.0|This is my fourth pair of Toms. I love them for work, simple and comfy. I ordered a size 8 (I normally wear a womens 8.5-9). The sizing was all wrong. I called my local shoe store who informed me that Tom's changed the sizing of their shoes. There is no information regarding this on the website or amazon. When I contact Amazon to explain the situation, I was informed that there was nothing they could do. My only option was so send the shoes back and then place a new order. These were a christmas gift for my friend who now will have nothing to open :( Bad customer service!!!

B00024I31C|2.0|Stone River is a great song, and there are a couple of other decent tunes, but the rest of it is crap. If you love the old JJ, you won't like most of this cd.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|I found this movie very profound. It touches on the nature of human soul, and how love and death mingle together. Not just the topic is profound and interesting but the movie is very well done. The characters go well, the soundtrack is perfect, the sequence of shots that sometimes goes a bit back and forth is great. It has these moments of 'unreality', which I love in a movie because they portray in my opinion a much more faithful narrative of reality that what the eyes see.<br /><br />Jung believe that the unconscious is what makes us feel alive (not the rational part), and from it come creative and destructive forces. I think this movie is a lot about that.
B00A2XU9IS|5.0|This is a fun app. You will like it if you tested it out . It will keep you guessing on what is going to be happening for the next day or days to come. Keep up the good work on making more app. Thank you and have fun.

B004HO6I4M|5.0|was baby sitting six McCaws.  5 reds and 1 blue.  3 would talk and the other would just look at me and walk up to me in the cage.  had to get this movie
0545425115|5.0|I actually watched the movie prior to reading, and my next step of thoughts was that I had to read the book. Now, a half a year later, I finally grab the chance to. It was late in the night when I got the book, and I thought maybe a chapter or two could settle for today. Ummm, no. I actually ended up overpassing the bedtime and had to stop myself from going further, since it was 3 in the morning. I just had to give the author for that: your hand is somehow glued into your hands! It cannot be out of reach. Every time I try to stop reading, I can't!<br /><br /> Before writing the review, I actually read the book over 6 times since it was so fun: even if it still was a fully- read book, I couldn't let go of it! It is just so much fun to read. All this time I spent with books, I never felt a book like this, so full of tension and exhilarating moments, that I literally had to beat myself to let go of it. Fortunately it was not a school night, or I would have been in serious trouble.<br /><br />Since I really do not want to spoil anything to the possible future readers out there, all I can say is: congratulation Mrs. Collins for an epic five-star new York times bestseller. I am really looking forward to reading thoroughly through the series, and will be enjoying every line I come to.<br />Happy hunger games everyone, and may the odds be EVER in your favor.<br />Read it!
B009E3EY38|5.0|Great sound and video was very cool to see. I wasn't overly impressed with Page's playing but to see the band together and Plant's voice sounding excellent was a treat.
B009FZFONO|5.0|One of my new favorite shows! Used Amazon Instant Video to get caught up and now watch on TV, can't wait for new episodes in 2013!
B008KMHFJY|4.0|I enjoyed this book. I brought it as I had not much to read and didn't think much about it. Once I stated it I found that I couldn't wait to get back to it and finish it. I was reading it in my work breaks.
1452110581|5.0|This book is for you if:<br />-You are a cat lover<br />-You are a cat hater<br />-You have never met a cat but might recognize one if you saw it walking down the sidewalk<br /><br />Whether you're a crazy cat lady, you want to set your mother's cat on fire, or you only really know cats by general reputation, this book is bound to make you smile.  The poems play on so many different aspects of feline personalities, and I know I definitely see some of my own cat's habits put to prose.  There were definitely some laugh-out-loud gems in this collection.  I bought this book as a gift for my cousin but before sending it her way, I had to read it myself... and passed it around to several family members and friends.  Highly recommended!
0395389496|2.0|I ordered this book that was rated in &#34;like new&#34;/ &#34;excellent&#34; condition.  When the book arrived the book jacket was frayed around the edges and a title page was actually missing.  Since I am giving it as a keepsake gift for my kiddos, after our first ride on the &#34;Polar Express&#34; to go visit Santa, I am dissappointed.  I should have just paid full price and bought new.
0316078913|1.0|This was my first encounter with David Sedaris and I'm sorry to report that it will probably be my last.  I was severely underimpressed with this collection.  The very first story about working as an elf in Santa Land elicited a few small smiles, but beyond that, most of the stories were rather dull, or I waited for a point to be made or a humorous twist, neither of which ever came.  I am usually a fan of the dark and sarcastic humor that Sedaris is lauded for, and this book just missed the mark for me.

B00881VLCE|5.0|This is the best jigsaw puzzle app I've found. I love the free puzzles and just bought a Christmas puzzle pack. My only complaint is that it doesn't always start when you open it.

B00632HWOG|4.0|It was a great app until it told me to update.  After the update, it no longer loads emails or functions.<br /><br />Update as of March 14:<br />Since the complaints, their latest update in January has fixed the Yahoo Mail and it works again.  Yahoo Mail on the Kindle Fire is quite easy to operate compared to the computer version.  On my Kindle Fire, I can see all my emails and delete them and respond to them just as I can on my computer, but I just need a few taps.  When new emails arrive, a notification shows up at the left-top screen as a push to let you know to check your Yahoo Mail for new emails.  Once you delete the email from your Kindle, it's also deleted from your computer version.  This makes it easier to manage.
B0076DELIG|5.0|This is standard Michael Connelly style. First part of book is a little slow, building the charters. Then it picks up and is hard to put the book down.<br /><br />Very good read, but I like and have read all Michael Connelly's books.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|I bought this while it was in stock at jinx.com. Paid $34.99 for it after my son earned the money. This is exactly what it says MICRO world. It is 480 pieces, but they are all small pieces. Fits in the palm of your hand when build, seriously! I know Minecraft is huge right now, but this set is nowhere near worth $100+. My son loves the set and wants another to build a bigger world. Unfortunately for him, he will have to wait for this price gouging to end. It is not worth a penny more than the $34.99 Jinx has it for when in stock.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|Everybody has their own version of the truth, and the way we frame our own stories may have a great deal to do with a higher level of consciousness for which we all strive. Such is the gist of Yann Martel's 2001 bestseller which is the basis of this visually stunning 2012 adventure drama helmed by Ang Lee ([[ASIN:B000ICXQS8 Brokeback Mountain]]). I read the book several years ago and remember thinking it would make a great animated film by someone as creative as Hayao Miyazaki ([[ASIN:B000CDGVOE Howl's Moving Castle]]). CGI, however, has evolved so dramatically in the past decade that the story can be now inhabited by real actors and awash in gorgeous abstraction that melds the fantastical with the intimate quite seamlessly. Shot mostly in a giant tank in Taiwan as well as on location in India, this movie is a unique example of how technology's endless possibilities can well serve an allegorical story focused on human survival and our own individual coping mechanisms.<br /><br />Adapted by David Magee ([[ASIN:B006S009IY Finding Neverland]]), the story is framed by an interview in Montreal between a Canadian writer, a fictionalized version of Martel, and an unassuming middle-aged man named Pi. The first part of the film is a flashback set in a family-run zoo in Pondicherry, a bucolic former French colony in southern India. The central protagonist is Pi as a child whose sternly sensible father runs the zoo. We learn the origins of Pi's unusual name as it relates to an impossibly pristine pool in which his uncle swam in Paris. At once, you get a sense of the importance of both water and mathematics in Pi's early life as well as his unfiltered concept of religion. In Pi's fertile mind, which religion is a moot point as he adopts Hinduism, Christianity and Islam concurrently and despite his family's resistance. A life-endangering confrontation with a Bengal tiger under their care proves to be a turning point for Pi as he is warned by his supportive family to stay away from it. Later economic hardship prompts his father to decide to move to Canada where he plans to sell the animals.<br /><br />The stormy journey by freighter turns tragic around the Mariana Trench where the now-teenaged Pi finds himself on a lifeboat with an unlikely menagerie in tow. The party eventually dwindles down to two, and this is where Lee imbues the film with a surreal spirit befitting the tale as we watch the seemingly incredulous situation of Pi co-existing on the lifeboat with the same tiger we saw in his childhood encounter. Dubbed Richard Parker due to a previous mix-up in paperwork, the tiger is integral to a series of eye-catching episodes that involves flying fish pelting them with force, a plethora of glowing jellyfish at night, a breaching whale nearly capsizing the boat, a disastrous storm that carries them to the brink, and a bizarrely florid island overrun with carnivorous plants and curious meerkats. None of these episodes will surprise readers of the book, but the execution is enthralling thanks to the masterful work of Chilean cinematographer Claudio Miranda ([[ASIN:B002C4YYEU The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button]]) and the visual effects generated by the Rhythm & Hues Studios.<br /><br />Similarities to Robert Zemeckis' [[ASIN:B0026O475M Cast Away]] and Alfred Hitchcock's [[ASIN:B000UL26NS Lifeboat]] are probably not without intention on Lee's part, but this movie manages to hold its own. My one complaint about the film comes toward the end when things are spelled out a bit too deliberately considering how symbolic the story has been expressed up to that point. Pi is played by four actors depicting the character at different ages. Suraj Sharma effectively portrays Pi during the challenging lifeboat sequence and obviously makes the strongest impression, but Gautam Belur and Ayush Tandon are also affecting in conveying Pi's evolving psyche during his tender childhood years. Irrfan Khan ([[ASIN:B0011Y13YG The Namesake]]) plays Pi in the presentwith his becalming demeanor seemingly at odds with the incredulous story he tells Martel. Khan's movie wife from \\"The Namesake\\", Tabu, shows up as Pi's understanding mother, and G&eacute;rard Depardieu appears inexplicably in a cameo as the freighter ship's nasty cook. Rafe Spall ([[ASIN:B005NQ94KS One Day]]) plays Martel in a rather nondescript manner. It's not a perfect film, but many of the sumptuous images will likely stick with you for a long while afterward.with his becalming demeanor seemingly at odds with the incredulous story he tells Martel.

0307346617|2.0|This book was so disappointing. It should have been called An Oral History of Weaponry, since that's what it's really about. Even worse was I had to read over 60 pages to hear the POV of a woman...at first I thought maybe this is just a man's book. Then a man at work saw me reading it on my break and asked me how I liked it, turns out he couldn't get past the 2nd chapter, too boring for him.<br />I hope the movie took a lot of liberties and is better than this.

B005LAII8K|5.0|Time travel. It's an idea that's so incredibly simple to start, but so amazingly hard to complete in a logical sense. For years, sci-fi film/TV geeks like myself have debated ad nauseam how certain films break the basic rules of time travel when one goes back in time, because no matter what, your actions are going to have consequences on the future. These possibilities of varying futures were discussed to some end in the film THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT, but sadly, because it's not a very good film, it's made to feel trite. But here in writer/director Rian Johnson's LOOPER, those ideas are put to the test, and it's a test that it passes with flying colors in every aspect of the story it's telling.<br /><br />It begins in the year 2044. Time travel has been invented, but it's illegal. We have Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a specialized assassin called a \\"looper\\" who works for an organized crime syndicate whose boss (Jeff Daniels) is from the future. The deal is, when the mob wants someone disposed of, they send them back to the loopers (who know the exact time, date, and arrival point of the target) packed with bricks of silver as payment, the loopers kill them, incinerate the bodies and that's that. Although, the life expectancy of a looper (who are usually in their twenties) is only about their late 40's, and every so often, a looper is forced to kill their future self, which is termed \\"closing the loop\\" and then, the looper's contract is terminated, they get a big payday, and then go off and live the rest of their lives until they're sent back to die. But one day, Joe meets his adult self (Bruce Willis) as one of his contracts, and he escapes. This is not something the syndicate allows (as evidenced in one absolutely horrific scene), and the syndicate is sent after both the young and older Joe, despite the younger one's promise that he will find and kill his older self. This wild cat-and-mouse game sees the young Joe make his way to the rural outskirts of the giant city and to the farmhouse of Sara (Emily Blunt) and her son Cid (Pierce Gagnon), while the older Joe is stalking the city for reasons of his own.<br /><br />Now if this was just another simple time-travel sci-fi action film that didn't give much thought to character, dialogue, or plot, it would be somewhat interesting but like THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT, it would have fallen flat. But since this is Rian Johnson, a writer/director who is rapidly reaching a strange hybrid of journeyman AND auteur status with his two previous (and quite brilliant) films, the high-school neo-noir BRICK (also starring Gordon-Levitt) and the con man comedy-drama THE BROTHERS BLOOM (with Adrien Brody, Mark Ruffalo and Rachel Weisz), you're not getting the standard summer fare. Johnson very smartly spends less time dazzling us with millions of dollars of eye-popping set design of futurescapes and also concentrating solely on the action of the film, and gives us an ultimately fascinating character study of two men who are the same man, but products of two very different purposes and motives. We see the life that the younger Joe leads as well, which is a life of semi-luxury, endless clubbing, tough-guy posturing and drug addiction. We also get glimpses into the life that is eventually led by Joe after he \\"initially\\" closes his loop without incident, and we get a real sense of a man who will justify anything, including some pretty horrible things to prevent the future he knows is coming for him.<br /><br />Now this is not to say that Johnson skimps on the action or the set design. The future is a pretty dystopian place, littered with junker cars and super-sleek hovercycles, and no one is safe, unless you're one of the privleged. The action scenes have a breath-taking bravura that is intense, disorienting and highly stylized to fit Johnson's aesthetic. Even the weapons used have a strangely old-world feel to them, with huge old-west style pistols and the looper's blunderbuss which is a combo of future and past.<br /><br />The performances are excellent. This is absolutely Willis' best work in some time as he gives his aging killer real gravity and world-weariness as he ends up traveling to the past in order to fight his tragic future. Gordon-Levitt continues his streak of fascinating and layered performances and continues to show that he is one of the great actors of his generation (the prosthetic work done to make him look like a young Willis is pretty nice too). Emily Blunt is the major standout here, though, as the fierce-tempered Sara, who's only goal is to protect her son, despite what her son is and what he might become. Jeff Daniels and Piper Perabo don't have large roles, but what they do with them are substantial. The real discovery here is young Pierce Gagnon, who plays Cid with a number of different layers, which is surprising for an actor of his very young age. He never seems out of place in this film, and his performance is pretty amazing. Paul Dano and the (surprisingly) ever-menacing Garrett Dillahunt also do a great deal with small roles. Another fun character here is that of Kid Blue, a wannabe shootist (Noah Segan, another Johnson regular), who is both menacing and comical at the same time.<br /><br />The effects work here in this film is seamless as well, as some characters also display telekinetic ability (one much more so than the other), but is left largely alone in the film so that when it does happen, it happens with maximum effect. There is also a particularly disturbing sequence when one character fails to close his own loop and the syndicate gets their hands on the younger looper's self, and we see in real time what happens to the older self as the younger self is... well, you'll see.<br /><br />What makes this film so different from other time travel films is that you see actions and consequences not just in the physical world, but from a character perspective as well. There's an absolutely brilliant scene with the two Joes at a diner where they discuss the ideas of time travel, and as it's played by Willis and Gordon-Levitt, it not only helps put the whole idea of time travel in a unique perspective, but it also frames the events of the film in a way that no other time travel film has tried to do, or has done nearly as successfully.<br /><br />While those who are looking for a popcorn-munching action film are likely going to be disappointed by LOOPER, people who are looking for extremely intelligent, well-written, well-acted, well-directed sci-fi action fare will find themselves EXTREMELY pleased. LOOPER is indeed one of the best films of the year, and will likely find a better and more discerning audience at home than it could find in the theatres.ast.<br /><br />The performances are excellent.

B00785P2QC|3.0|This is an easy to use game on the tablet, it could use a little less app recognition during the game.. it causes pop up's to happen and gets very frustrating when you are trying to keep track of what to build next. Could use a better layout for buildings to be built.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|5 stars!I loved this book!!!!! Can not wait until the next one is released!!! May cannot get here soon enough!
0062183591|4.0|I read this book for a course I am enrolled in through Carlow University's Masters of Science in Fraud and Forensics ([...]  I was excited to read it as we had already been exposed to some of Ariely's work in previous courses.  I find his writing to be easy to read, as well as intriguing.  In a Master's program that is quick moving, it's nice to have a reading assignment that will keep you turning pages rather than looking to take a break.<br /><br />As I started to read this book, I did wonder a bit about the true scientific nature of his studies.  Some of the assumptions behind the hypotheses seem obvious. For instance, it's harder to make good decisions if your mind is overtaxed seems obvious to a parent of a toddler, who is working and going to grad school.  However, the more you delve into the book, the moral is more that even if you have a gut instinct about something, you should try to prove it, as your first instinct may not always be correct.<br /><br />I thought one weakness of the book was the obviousness of some of the experiments.  The one that I became stuck on was an experiment in which he places a plate of dollar bills and a six pack of Cokes into a refridgerator in a college dorm.  The Cokes disappear, while no one takes the dollar.  Ariely's assumption is that people are less apt to take actual money, but will take something else, like a can of Coke.  If I saw a plate of dollar bills in a shared refridgerator, I would assume that someone was monitoring whether anyone would be willing to take them.<br /><br />I do believe that this book will remind me as I move forward with my fraud education and career, that it is not always safe to go with your gut.  You really should look for stronger evidence to back your assumptions.

B00AMBH70S|1.0|That was was the worst movie of the year, nothing at all of the first three a joke and then I paid 4.99 on top of it. Very boring and I had rented with family over too it shouldn't even be put into the category of action, it was about being dependent on pills seems the only way they need to live,
B009H442DG|5.0|Unlike Olivia Newton-John's album, \\"Christmas Wish,\\" this is a much lighter album with the accent on the Pop-Christmas songs.  There is some beautiful singing, great harmonies and fun arrangements. The new song \\"I Think You'll Like It\\" is tons of fun. It deserves to be a hit single....  Most folks will love this album, as comfortable as having a cup of coffee and Christmas cookies in front of the tree.
B004ZGI2KK|5.0|I loved this movie and I would recommend it to anyone over 12.  It kept me glued to the chair all through the movie. Scary Good!!  P&T Bears
B0084I9QIW|2.0|Here's an honest review with clear glasses vs. the rosey glasses that most seem to be wearing. The good news is that MJ is on top of his game here and gives a great performance, but the video quality is absolutely not up to par. I think it stinks, compared to todays standards. As a perfectionist, my guess is that he would not have wanted this released, because of this. This is \\"clearly\\" a money grab...The video quality is VHS like and there's no debating that. IMO, this release should be purchased by only the hardest core MJ fans or \\"completists\\". I regret my purchase. It was an impulse purchase at a big box store. Because of the poor video quality, even two stars is kind...I don't think I'll be watching again. Overall, Michael Jackson: Live in Bucharest, is a far superior DVD. It's video quality is night & day compared to this one. Also, I suggest buying some \\"pro shot\\" bootlegs of his more recent concerts if you want HD or modern quality. There are many, if you look...I wish reviewers would give honest, non biased reviews/critiques...<br /><br />Update, Interesting how people are (still)giving this 5 stars while admitting the video quality stinks...? Most of us prefer that people rate the product, not the film itself...Objective vs. subjective...Many of us rely on ratings when making purchases but so many somehow blindly look past the poor picture quality. They're rating MJ, not the DVD...and that doesn't make much sense. I guess thats where the term 'fanatic' comes into play. This DVD is actually made from a VHS tape and it shows. Still a great performance though.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Typical Mitch Rapp. Had enough guesses to make for a quick read. Flynn had some great one liners that cracked me up
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Nice to finally see the conclusion to the story.<br />The artwork (?) on the CD is plain black, not much to look at.<br /><br />I was collecting the special edition of these movies, but &#34;Deathly Hallows&#34; parts 1 and 2 Special Edition (DVD, NOT Blue-Ray) were issued for a VERY short time and now the scalpers are selling them for a really high price, so I was unable to get either of them in Special Edition, what a shame...

B0054R6BFM|1.0|I wanted this book to be good so badly I actually finished it even though I didn't like it.  But some books shouldn't be finished.  Succinctly, all of the characters came out very flat.  Any depth in the characters came in the form of some kind of twist in their chapter, but the &#34;twist&#34; came out formulaic and unsurprising.<br /><br />Frankly, the book was uninspiring and I felt didn't capture what someone about to commit suicide would feel or even act like.
0751537519|1.0|I enjoy Mitch  Alboms books. I have read many of his books, and enjoyed them all.  I also have given this<br />as a gift to mjy friend.

B000UBMSB8|5.0|I wish it had the Workprint version as well, but I have the main four cuts of the film, plus and I like the packaging and this particular artwork on the disc. If you're just into the films and the making of aspects, this will do for a great price.

B00005S6K8|5.0|Never watched the Hepburn original but this Ford Ormond Kinnear trio REMAKE IS DELICIOUSLY ROMANTIC - THE NEW CLASSIC<br /><br />I seldom rewatch a movie multiple times.  Surprised myself for having watched this over a dozen times (ok...a decade ago)<br />Up there with the Cary Grant, Humphrey Bogart classics.  Here Ford's Bogartesque performance coupled with Ormonds Hepburnesque character has set a NEW BAR not to mention the new dimension of Kinnear's unique can't say Grantesque persona - works magic for me every time.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|The DVD was brand new and my boyfriend loved his gift that I got him. It came in great time too!

B000JMKQX0|5.0|I was initially skeptical in regard to the chances that I would actually enjoy reading a book about a zombie war, but my concerns were quickly alleviated.  This book is great!  It is very well written and although it is about a fictional zombie-apocalypse, Brooks manages to create the feeling of a true historical narrative.  I highly recommend this title.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I grew up country but really not my music, it was my parents music. But even so like this sound track.
0743270754|5.0|I'm not finished with it yet, but it has been great so far. Everyone should read it. I'm done now.
B000HF0KXU|5.0|I first heard of Swordfish when I saw that Paul Oakenfold had done the soundtrack, but I missed it in the theaters.  Paul is a favorite DJ of mine, so, I enjoyed the music first, but I was left wondering about the movie - until now.  I can honestly say I was glad I finally got to see it.  Now, this is not a particularly deep movie - there are lots of explosions, bullets flying, pretty computer graphics, gratuitous nudity, etc.  But if you can come to it expecting only to be entertained, I think you can count on that.  And Swordfish succeeds on that level.  Actually, as far as hacker/espionage/action thrillers go, I'd say that there really isn't anything particularly wrong with this movie.  I realize that some people hated it... maybe they were expecting too much?  I thought the acting was quite good - Hugh Jackman's facial expressions were right-on, and Travolta was over-the-top, as expected.  Convoluted story line... but hey, again that was expected - it's THAT kind of movie.  I actually enjoyed the story, and I think you will too (just don't come expecting anything too deep)!
0525953728|5.0|This is great. I know that any one will enjoy it. I'm running out of words. Read it. Two more words.
0062183591|5.0|I am a student in the Carlow University Masters of Fraud and Forensic and read this book as an assignment in the Forensic Research and Analysis course.  [...]  In all honesty, I did not think I was going to like this book when I began it.  I had to do some personal reflection to figure out why I didn't like this book in the beginning and it finally occurred to me, I do not like liars.  I had a bias against this book before I even began it.  Once I worked past my personal bias and began to read it, all of my walls broke down.  I loved this book.  My favorite Chapter was Chapter 5, Why Wearing Fakes Makes Us Cheat More.  I joke about this with my significant other (made him read the book when I finished).  Ariely's humor shines through which makes this book an easy read.    As with any book, there are a few critiques.  I would love to see more studies done by Ariely in different settings and with a larger sample size.  I think that his work has shown some great results and I would love to see more of it.    I think this book will be one that I will be referring back to from time to time during my career.  Even if I do not find work in the field of fraud investigation, this book deals with everyday life.  This book keeps bringing an important point to the forefront, people cheat but only by a little.  This is important to remember in the fraud field because generally speaking people that embezzle/steal do not take large sums of money from the beginning.  It starts small and works its way up.
0547884591|5.0|Tim Ferris's latest is a fascinating, highly entertaining, interactive read. It's a book about Meta-Learning, i.e. learning how to learn and cooking is the vehicle for this.<br /><br />The book is packed with beautiful photos, illistrations and graphic design work. The quotes chosen frequently shock, inspire and make one burst out laughing.<br /><br />Tim covers such topics as the simplest Osso Bucco recipe I've ever seen, Modernist Cuisine (aka Molecular Gastronomy) and catch and release techniques for hunting urban quail (that's right, hand catching pigeons).<br /><br />I've found the recipes in the book easy, so far, and it has renewed my interest in cooking, learning new techniques and innovating.<br /><br />Thanks Tim for this fantastic read!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Very good edition and it cost only 36$.Everyone must buy this perfectly done film.Many hours of special features and interesting parodies.

0553381695|5.0|How in the world does one fit everything in A Clash of Kings into one review?! I give up, I'll just stick to the important bits. This book is great but ginormous, and it's a whole lot of book to take in at once. I'm a multi-book-reader, but while I was reading this one, I had to put basically everything else aside for a while. This is a massive story, and it's only a small part of the whole epic tale.<br /><br />A Clash of Kings by George R.R. Martin<br />As it is sort of indicated by the title, this book is chock full of guys wanting to be kings and kick other kings butts. The two people who probably have the most legitimate claims are Daenerys and Stannis, but I'd definitely just go ahead and give the North to Robb. They're never going to settle down up there now unless they're burned out by dragon fire (possible now since Dany has dragons), but it would be easier to just Robb have his own kingdom and deal with the White Walkers and wildlings on his own. Also, Robb is all kingly and stuff...let him have a kingdom! One without backstabbing, twofaced, nasty Theon in it. Darn you, Theon. You made me sad-face so much!<br /><br />There are multiple storylines that thread through the main plot of who-gets-to-be-king-now, and I thought that Daenerys, Davos and Arya had particularly interesting threads. I didn't expect to like Davos as much as I did, but he was really fascinating once you knew his backstory and got to watch him deal with suddenly-crazy Stannis. There are battles and alliances and betrayals and bargains and dinners and journeys galore in this book. It is definitely an epic story with a massive cast of characters.<br /><br />Deciding which character is my favorite is too hard. Tyrion was FANTASTIC. He's so incredibly clever and awesome, and I love how he got to kick some serious butt in this book, both mentally and physically. However, I really think Arya is just the best. She's so feisty and indomitable, you just know that she's eventually going to come out on top. Or at least she should, but Martin's evil and likes to kill off totally wicked characters... I also really wish that we could have gotten to see more of Robb in this book. I like him bunches, but we don't spend much time at all directly with him, though he's talked about a lot during the book. I have a feeling he gets more attention in the next book, but from the rumors I've heard and the little alluding-tos in this book, it might not be a good kind of attention.<br /><br />Oh, and I am a member of the Punch-Joffery-In-The-Face Club. That boy should be tied to a post and smacked by every other character in the book, from Dany down to Hot Pie. Seriously, I'm not kidding, that would probably be the best scene ever. I wonder if HBO would go for that...<br /><br />This book is super good but I definitely wouldn't recommend it to younger teens or preteens. There are a lot of mature themes in this book that they might not enjoy as much until they are older. However, older teens and young adults who enjoy fantasy and adventure will probably love this book to pieces.t on top.

0062183591|4.0|As a student in Carlow University's Master's of Science in Fraud and Forensics program ([...]), we are required to read Dr. Ariely's book.  While I am usually not a huge fan of assigned texts, I genuinely enjoyed the book!  I found it very interesting and engaging.<br /><br />Dr. Ariely's book begins by explores the premise of why we cheat.  While the notion might seem obvious, his research proves that it's more complicated than we may realize.  Before reading this book, I thought everyone cheated ALOT!  Dr. Ariely's proved me wrong.  Through a number of scientific experiments, Dr. Ariely begins to explore the twisted human psyche.  The book can be a bit repetitive, but I think that each experiment/chapter builds a more solid base for his conclusions.<br /><br />I know that what I learned in this book will definitely help me in my future career as a CFE.  Understanding why people do what they do is part of the job, something I can't wait to delve into more.

B000NQRE9Q|1.0|I agree that the packaging sucks. My first clue that something was wrong was when I pulled out \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" only to find that it was \\"Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\". So I went for the second disc which was supposed to be \\"Temple of Doom\\". Nope. \\"Bonus features\\". Third disc? Nope. \\"Temple of Doom\\". Only two left now. And in the fourth disk which was supposed to be \\"Last Crusade\\" finally there is \\"Raiders\\". Any guess what was in the final case which was labeled \\"Bonus Features\\"? Last Crusade? Nope. A SECOND \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\". It is bad enough to be forced to buy all four movies when only two are worth watching. It makes it down right insulting then to be shorted one of those two movies. What a ripoff!

111846446X|5.0|The stuff in this book assumes that one is a beginner in all sorts of areas of expertise - The Pi, programming, electronic circuit construction (now known as Hardware Hacking apparently) and so forth.<br /><br />It gives excellent starter tips on what's what, from hooking up the Pi and your options in doing so to configuring Debian on the Pi,  shell basics, a light intro to Python, basic soldering techniques, resistor identification (only needed for a hardware hack of course, the Pi comes ready-built), and some details of piggy-back boards that open up the world of the programmable GPIO pins (which is where the Pi becomes more than a tiny desktop computer).<br /><br />It's not a thick volume, but it packs a whole lot of useful stuff for the newbie between the covers. I've fired up more than my share of Linux boxes and I already know how to solder but there was a wealth of stuff in here I can use even so, especially the info in the piggyback boards. I may not know all the options out there as of today, the world of tech development being what it is, but I now know what questions to ask about the stuff I might want to use with my Pi.<br /><br />There is nothing in here that you couldn't find online, but I prefer a book for those times when I want to use my commute for education and give my eyes a rest from the computer screens I look at all day. Also, the book gathers all the topics that are likely to prove useful in one place, and serves as a basis for further on-line research.<br /><br />Recommended.
B000HLDFK4|5.0|For some reason this movie grabs my heart and refuses to let go. Sandra Bullock plays a physician that has little else in life but her work. Her time-travel romance with Keanu Reeves' character is convincing and warm. One really gets the sense of two people discovering that they are soul mates as they exchange letters. It's really about the process of falling in love; how two people separated by time could discover one another and build deep love. The time-portal mailbox is an essential part of the plot but there's no feeling of science fiction. There are some light moments when the mailbox flag is observed moving in response to someone in the past.<br /><br />I really appreciate this movie as a fine love story and proof that movies can still be heart-warming and leave you feeling good.

B0064X7FVE|5.0|I look at the Weather Channel every day on my Kindle Fire. I depend on their advice for our harsh driving in Alaska to know what to expect each day. Up here, not being prepared can be a deadly mistake. Most of the news shows in the lower 48 don't give us much much attention in the way of news or even act like we exist. I like their videos that people send in also.
0312321376|5.0|I really enjoyed the book and I appreciated the skeptical approach towards the cases discussed.  It really gave me a new perspective to the possibilities of what we don't know about our world and our existence.  The scars apparently from past life trauma are most intriguing.  I would love to learn more about similar cases.
1451695195|2.0|I have read almost every book about different people's NDE's and found them fascinating and exciting to read.  Although it is obvious what a profound experience this was for the author of this book, there are only enough actual details of his  journey beyond to fill about 2 pages.  The rest of the book is about his illness. I didn't even finish the book.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|I've seen this movie a dozen times in black & white and have always marveled at the sharpness, depth and contrast of old black and white cinema, however color has brought a new depth that gives this film a greater charm and warmth.  Not a big fan of the color restorations?  Not to worry - having the film on two DVD's (color and black & white) will help satisfy the taste buds of everyone at home this holiday season.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|On my kindle fire I had a list of must haves.  One of those was a basic calculator.  I don't need graphing or anything super fancy, just adding subtracting and sometimes a little multiplication.  This does the trick with big numbers and easy buttons.  Really good must have.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Enjoyed the book a lot. Some of it a bit far fetched but still a good read. Lots of twists and turns.
0937381888|5.0|We recently started brewing our own beer and when I saw this was excited to learn more details of the process. This book is very informative and interesting. My boyfriend has finished most of it and we are on our way to selecting all of the ingredients to our next batch individually vs a kit that already includes the hops, barley, clearafier, etc. together.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app is great! It's definitely convenient and a no brainer. I'd recommend this app to anyone. Love the graphics and its well constructed.
B000031XBQ|5.0|So i got this CD for my father because he's really into Abba loves there music and always talks about how he use to own all the Abba tracks in Spanish and how he wished he had them in Spanish long story short i got this for him as a Christmas gift and he loved it. Shipping was quick wasn't expecting this until Monday and it came on Saturday all in all I am very happy with the product and so is my father.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I'm a Sci-Fi nut and this one got my attention and kept it.  The effects are great.  An all around good movie
B009LXEBD4|4.0|This is the best way to try Kelly Clarkson's music. It is a great sample of her work and in some ways her best album. I find her one of those artists that produces albums with only a few good tracks on them so this one is a good way to have her in your collection without having to hit skip every third song. This one is well worth the buy
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was like a warm cup of coffee on a rainy day. It was easy to love the characters.
B009B4ZEKM|2.0|While I am not a huge fan, I do have several of her albums. I found this one to be somewhat boring. I did not relate to the lyrics and it just doesn't have the punch of earlier works. Certainly not one to listen to in the car, prehaps useful as background music while you play scrabble or something.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I thought the story kept flowing wihtout getting to deep or twisted in detail. Enough to understand what was happening without slogging through pages of minutiae. It's a good read at any age and I enjoy the fact it never gets to gory or entangled in a sexual relationship and more on normal interactions people have with co-workers and family.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|My girlfriend can't get enough of this movie, and quotes it all the time. Definitely a cute holiday movie but great as a Ferrell movie to quote all year long as well.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This is what a collector's edition should be about. From the music box to the postcards, I''ll treasure this set.
B00110K62U|5.0|Great cast. Originally bought this for my father who loved it. He has since passed away and I still enjoy watching this and remembering which were his favorite songs and performances
B00846REIS|3.0|I think this book is trying to hard to be like 50 shades. I know it's supposed to be similar but I just can't get into it but yet can't stop reading it ! I think that 50 Shades is an original among else can compare to it .  This book is a good read though.
B000P0J024|5.0|never has been and never will be another group like this. the music is great and the setting provided on the dvd are outstanding.
B00007KQKM|5.0|For any one living on the moon who has never heard of Lady Chatterley, let me tell you the book was band in the time it was written. A married woman takes a lover at the request of her paraplegic husband to produce an heir. She falls in love and is torn between duty and the love of her life. He is poor, treated less as less than human by society. She is a lady. Her husband a high born snob. An emotional piece. Leave your husband out of this one.
B00004R99F|4.0|the grandson laughed a lot at this movie, but at times would loose intrest due to slow or uninteresting parts.
B004GJXQ20|4.0|Good story. Lots of characters to keep track of Which made it a bit hard going. Still a very good read
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Having the same problem with the news feed not loading on my Kindle. I hope there is an update  coming very soon. Thanks.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|.Amazing tracks.  I particularly like track No. 2 (Peponi), which alone justifies the price of the album.  A Great listen throughout the entire album.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I loved this book from the first chapter. I couldn't put it down and it definitely kept me on my toes. The Kennedy assassination has always been a fascination of mine. GREAT book!
B000MV8AE0|4.0|seeing ed harris portraying - acting in this genre was very interesting and enjoyable.  ed is usually in war - gangster - type roles.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This series has quickly become a very important read for me on an emotional level. I'm 24, and this is no kids book. Very strong ideas about standing up for not only what's right, but standing up against corruption, and saying \\"this will not stand\\".
B000OYC7A8|5.0|I purchased this DVD as a Birthday present for a good friend.  It arrived very quickly and in perfect condition.  We watched it the same night it arrived.  Everybody loved it.  The concert includes special guest performers as well as extended content and music videos!  The gift was very well received and everybody enjoyed watching.  I would recommend this DVD to any Pink Floyd or David Gilmour fan.
B007ZGBZHE|2.0|I have been a great fan of Preston & Child writings especially Aloysius Pendergast.<br />These stories have been excellent reading the type were you just can't put it down<br />and are fearful you will finish to soon.<br />This novel was way below their standards - it just lacked the suspense and was so<br />much dribble.<br />Is so lacks the quality of their past novel and was a real disappointment. I sure<br />hope they take the time for real commitment on their next book or they lost me.
1451695195|1.0|Just read through this book in one sitting at a Barnes & Noble, I had a feeling that I would regret spending $$ on it and I was right.  Full disclosure - I skimmed the parts about the good doctor's family history & prior exploits, but paid attention to the NDE parts ... which makes up maybe 1/4 of the text.<br /><br />There are hints throughout the book that the author had a religious (or at least spiritual) upbringing, which presumably conditioned his brain for ideas about the white light, heaven, angels, etc. all that he recounted of his experiences during his coma.<br /><br />I was genuinely curious about the insights he gained during his NDE, even if they were figments of his imagination.  Sadly, these add up to all of 3 lines, basically:  you are loved, you have nothing to fear, you can do no wrong.  Communicated to the good doctor, telepathically, without words, by an attractive blonde in peasant clothes.  We may never know, but it seems to me to be a regurgitation of reassuring teachings instilled in the author as a child in Sunday school.
B005JE7WKI|5.0|I thought this was gonna be stupid, but it was soo funny! \\"Officer we've had just a doozie of a day!\\"
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Really addictive ... had to re-download when my kindle fire had to be re-done. got the paid version somehow but it is soo worth it... that was six weeks ago and I did not need to start a new game yet and I play every day!!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book really changed my point of view on life. It really tells you that you dont have 2 be cool you just have 2 choose the right path to be sucessful. Best book i ever read hands down!!!!!
B009E3EXMU|5.0|The concert was amazing.  This set covers the concert on DVD as well as CD.  The bonus DVD of the dress rehearsal is incredible.  This is a must for any Led Zeppelin fan.  They still have the magic and rock to the heavens.  I saw it in the movie theater on the big screen and it was like I was there.  I recommend this set highly.  The bargain and service from Amazon was as it always is top notch.
0783240287|5.0|One of the great muscial that you can really enjoy and suitable for kids as well as adults. I have watched this musical a number of time and enjoyed it everytime.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|a great first album from a american idol winner hope to have many more to oputunities for great music from this talented young man
B006XBSAP2|1.0|This album contains pretty much ALL garbage. Horrible lyrics, terrible vocals, mindless beats, immaturely sexually graphic innuendos and some not even innuendos, NOT for children! Do NOT buy this for teens or younger...better yet DON'T buy this, period. It's not worth ANY amount of money whatsoever.<br />It literally lowers your IQ to listen to this garbage.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|For me it was a slow start and I almost lost interest, but at a certain point it started to become more intriguing and I was hooked. Can't wait to start book two!
B005T87QCI|1.0|It keeps saying  feint requires an active network connection I'm on the internet I don't know what to it won't load at all. Any suggestions
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|This was a gift so I have not personally viewed the movie yet, but the DVD arrived in good shape and within the time range.  Overall, it was a good quality purchase with a good price.
B000VYX8PE|4.0|I recommend this to the John Wash 5th grade class of 2013 CA<br />It's a really good book; you'll love it
1477476512|3.0|The book appears to have all of the novel's text, but that's it. There is no publishing information, no information about the author, no introduction. Very minimalist publication.
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|An average game. I played the whole game so I must have enjoyed it. I've seen better and I've seen worse.
B004LWZWGK|2.0|The 2 first Barman movies were good. But this one is just bad. Hollywood Cliche. Example among others, Wayne in the bottom of a well with a vertebre dislocated got fix with a fist hit, then he starts to do some pushes and abdomino to get ready to climb. I forgot, it is easer to climb without rope. Also he goes from a sunny hot country, (middle east maybe) to USA in a few minutes. Just to show you how bad it is. the movie is also to long and keep giving these crap..<br /><br />The director went back to the cliche hollywood type of movie (emotion. compassion BS)
B004P96WJ0|5.0|I bought this set to replace the DVD versions of these same performances when I upgraded my system to HD.  I have so enjoyed the glorious sound and the performances on the DVDs that I didn't feel any qualms about upgrading the visuals, too.<br /><br />The Lucerne Festival Orchestra must be the finest orchestra in the world.  It includes top players from many world famous chamber ensembles and orchestras.  Abbado is a compelling conductor who really does let the music shine through.<br /><br />The only down side to this set is that it does not include all the Mahler symphonies.  I can only hope that they will follow through and complete the cycle.  The 9th symphony is already available.  The 10th (which version?) was scheduled during the 2011 season, I believe, and the 8th was scheduled during 2012 only to be replaced at the last minute &#34;for artistic reasons,&#34; whatever that may mean.<br /><br />I'm keeping my fingers crossed.
0679805273|4.0|Had bought this for a toddler but I read it first to determine if he might like it but decided this is more for older kids than toddlers.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|ARRIVED VERY FAST AND MADE ME HAPPY TO SEE IT IN MY MAIL BOX.  SOME THINGS GET LOST IN THE XMAS RUSH BUT THIS WAS AN EARLY SURPRISE.
B0067QPVJ6|5.0|FAST DELIVERY AND IN GOOD CONDITION.  I WAS HAPPY TO SEE IT IN MY MAIL BOX AND ENJOYED THE MOVIE, ALTHOUGH THE OLD &#34;THING&#34; WITH KURT RUSSEL WAS A BETTER MOVIE.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I can still remember the first time I read this novel. I was in the 8th grade and I had recently gotten really interested in the fantasy genre (Jordan, Brooks, etc.) and I was at the science fiction/fantasy section in the local super bookstore, and Ender's Game was sitting on display at the end of one of the isles. I picked it up and took it home with me and read it in about a week.<br /><br />Since then, I try and make it a point to re-read this novel at lease once a year. As I look back on the novel and how my viewpoint has changed, I find myself changing how I feel about certain characters and plot developments. I still sit back and shake my head at the conclusion every single time, having lost no more awe for Card's deft plot twists than I had eleven years ago.<br /><br />This is one of those novels that changes a genre and, to a certain extent, helps define the genre. I highly recommend for anyone beginning to read science fiction (for if you are a long time sf fan, you most likely have already read it) and for any who can appreciate excellent characters and a mind-bending plot. For those new to sf, don't worry, this novel never becomes bogged down with sf terms.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I could not ever even dream of fantasizing about a better college romance. I loved the writing and plot! The characters definitely overreacted as they always seem to, but all of the reactions and emotions in this story seemed completely justified and understandable. I couldn't put the book down and unlike so many other romances where the characters get together in the first half, the story didn't repeat itself in circles. Each obstacle seemed new and terrifying without getting annoyed with the characters' drama and stupidity. I absolutely loved the characters! I'm unbelievably pumped and devastated for the second one. I felt this was a perfect stand alone and I'm so scared to read about any more complications these characters might face! A great book overall.
0738711500|5.0|This is a very fun gift idea! The cards are easy to use and beautifully decorated. My best friend loves them!
B0081FO2Q4|5.0|i love it! i've listened to it over and over again daily since i got it. ed sheerans voice is wonderful and the lyrics are creative and relatable.
B006R1T40I|5.0|All I can say is Bonnie keeps getting better with age.  There are so many great songs on this CD, buy it, throw it in your car CD and sing your heart out!!!
030758836X|5.0|One of the best novel's I have read in a long time.  This one will keep you guessing the whole time.  Not only did I enjoy it but I've given to at least 4 friends and family and they LOVED it also.
B005G5PPGS|4.0|This book really opened my eyes to Sabermetrics. I never really understood them and now find myself looking to read more or the statistical analysis of the game.
B007SGM084|3.0|The books were definitley over-rated. I was expecting something really taboo & risque but these books were rather tame.  More a love story than BDSM.  Makes me sad to think that so many other people's love lives are that lacking in passion.  :(
0446567337|5.0|In the story Dear John there where conflicts that brought the couple apart. Like the author writes the story in order to tell the audience that love is not easy and how it takes its time. The main character is John, Savannah, and Tim. John and Savannah fell in love with each other though it turns into a problem since he enlists in war and not being able to see Savannah. One of the major conflicts was how John had to go to war and leave Savannah in order to go back to the military basically he had an internal struggle by staying or leaving to war. I like the part when John and Savannah write each other letters to show how much they really care about themselves and wishes the best for him. What I think is most important is how he accepts Savannah marriage with Tim, letting her go when he really loves her, knowing shes her love of her life. I didn't like the part where Savannah stayed with Tim and left John since he went to war. I recommend it to all those people who love Love stories because it gets you into the story.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great time waster.I love this game.I play it all the time and was so excited when I found it on here. I have it for my ds
B002SRQ214|5.0|all i can say it the machine is running like mofo ... the actual purchase was smooth as well ...
B001FVV2X2|3.0|This is not my favorite sci-fi but have enjoyed a few episodes. Effects budget seems low and I sometimes get irritated by the characters. But if you need a sci-fi fix this will sometimes do it when there is nothing else new.
157421327X|5.0|Just what it says... basic info and pattern instructions. McNeill is clear and easy to follow. I am definitely hooked on creating zentangle and have used my first few pieces as Christmas cards. Very satisfying and relaxing art form that anyone can do!
B0067R0APK|1.0|The free app is much better!  Don't waste your money.  The layout and choices are terrible. Again, save your money and use the free app.
B0035JRUZQ|4.0|GREAT MOVIE, I LIKED MY PURCHASE  OF THE MOVIE EL DORADO ITIS ONE OF MY FAVORITES IM GLAD I FOUND IT.
B005XN31LY|5.0|OK, Lost lovers and lovers of the world of fantasy, you have to watch this show!  I started getting into it on a long plane ride, and it took me about 3 episodes to get into it, but it is a mysterious collection of fairy tales with a twist, all centered around a main story line which is a cursed town in this realm....very good series, I am hooked. A friend of mine doesn't like how many characters they bring into the show, and how it is hard to follow if you jump in. I am trying to get him to watch it from the beginning because that is probably the only way it will make full sense. So if you like watching a series from start to finish, this one will prove to be an adventure!
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|Great movie! A little slow at the beginning but the intensity and suspense in the silence was great! Also a bit violent so if you dont like that sort of thing...
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|this game is awesome awesome awesome I love it its fun fun fun u should try it reply u should fun for.girls under.the age of11 I should know.  O
B000002ADT|5.0|If you don't like this album, you will never like jazz.<br />It is the standard.<br />I can't stop listening to it.
B003UMW68Y|5.0|A personal favorite of mine, I've pretty much watched it every year for Christmas (and Halloween) since I was young. Not necessarily for everyone but if you're a fan you'll always love it. This film has become something of a cult movie having people memorizing every line and song. As hard as they will try, they will never be able to make another stop action film like this.
B0039208QM|5.0|As you maybe be able to tell by now I have an affinity for Tim Burton's old pictures, in addition I am a huge Batman fan. So with those things coming together and making the backdrop for this film Gotham City at Christmas time, this is kind of a no brainer for me. Not one to watch every year but it's still a good one to have in the catalog for the holidays.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|Just can't say enough about this film and the impact it has had, not just as a Christmas movie but in general cinema. The blu-ray treatment for this classic offers both original black and white and fully restored high definition color which makes this fantastical piece of film truly a cherished treasure. Having a movie that can make you laugh, cry and all around feel good from over half a century ago? That is magical, It's a Wonderful Life has truly stood the test of time.
B008NB0SQO|4.0|Most kids pre-millenium grew up watching The Muppets in one way or another, be it the show from the 70's or the movies from the 80's and 90's. If you like the Muppets then you'll love this and with it's recent release on blu-ray theres never a better time to watch this one.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|A now seminal Christmas movie, the Griswold's strike again in a Christmas classic about family, yet not necessarily for families, that most anyone can relate to. Chevy Chase at his best, lots of great situation and slapstick comedy to be seen here and a high re-watch factor. Interesting that it's called Christmas Vacation as in this film they actually don't go on a vacation.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I just so happened to find this set for $20 and I couldn't pass it up. These are classic movies (at least the first 2 are) that I needed in my collection.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this is like the best game ever it is so awesome you should get this game it is so cool
0385333846|5.0|One of the best books of all time. Been pillaged for ideas by others (I'm looking at you Time Traveler's Wife) but never nearly as good.<br /><br />Other brilliant Vonnegut books:<br />[[ASIN:0440179483 Sirens of Titan]]<br />[[ASIN:0440131480 Breakfast of Champions]]<br />[[ASIN:B000GTCRWY God Bless you., Mr Rosewater]]<br /><br />Other brilliant, non-Vonnegut books with similar humour:<br />[[ASIN:0345453743 The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]<br />[[ASIN:B00AHQXDNS The Siege of Walter Parks]]
0684824906|5.0|Lincoln really was an amazing political genius, and planned his presidential race very strategically before anyone else was considering him a candidate.
159562015X|5.0|Career change? Just graduated? Picking a major? Writing a resume? Got an interview coming up?  Lost a job and looking for a new one? Or, like me, too many things look interesting? This book, and the on-line test and profile, can help you understand what line of work might be a good fit for you. I was introduced to this during a career seminar and now buy it as a gift or recommend it to anyone that has questions like these.  The simple on-line survey questions are so dopey that you won't believe they can paint a picture of you...but, they do. A great resource for career development.
0393338398|4.0|As I rarely attend movies (Moneyball was made into a popular movie.) I was not familiar with this book until a &#34;bookish&#34; friend of mine suggested it.  I enjoyed both the discribed baseball personalities and the baseball history as Mr. Lewis wove them together into an interesting and true tale of a period in the life of the Oakland Athletics and their manager Billie Bean.  I'm not particularly a baseball fan and I found it to be a good and informative read.
B000W93CHC|4.0|I am not normally a ficton fan, but these two books (also Pillars Of The Earth) captured my attention.  Follett does a great job a making life in the 1300's come alive.  The characters and settings are great.  The only thing I did not thoroughly enjoy was the end (for both books) after a ggreat degree of detailed wrting, Follet wraps up both stories very rapidly - as if he just got tired of writing (or decided these books were too long and just had to end).  But generally well written and excellent story lines
B00999CZKG|5.0|I've been waiting a long time for these shows, and it was worth the wait.  When Shane MacGowan left the Pogues in 1991, I wouldn't have wagered much that he would celebrate a 35th birthday.  Now, as he approaches a 55th birthday on Christmas day, we all get a wonderful present.  Somehow Shane and the Pogues keep going.  Phil Chevron called the band's 2011 Christmas tour of England, Scotland, and Ireland the \\"first farewell tour.\\"  The second farewell tour, dubbed \\"The Parting Glass,\\" was three months later.  In ten shows it covered six American cities.  Spider Stacy told Billboard, \\"I think we are basically pretty certain this is the last tour of this type we'll be doing in the states.\\"  He attributed their packing it in to band fatigue, economics, and MacGowan.  \\"We can't always entirely trust Shane to deliver the goods,\\" he said.  That tour closed in New York, after three shows, on St. Patrick's Day.  I saw all three shows, and the Pogues were brilliant.  So was MacGowan.  He commanded the stage.  His vocals were superb.  He was as unimpaired as I'd ever seen him, until now. These Paris shows are even better.  MacGowan seems as sober as he gets onstage, and the Pogues are in top form.  If MacGowan can maintain this form he's got a few miles left in him.  Every Pogues fan should own these recordings.  They document the band while they are still, unbelievably, on top of their game. [[ASIN:0615445446 Rake at the Gates of Hell: Shane MacGowan in Context]]
B007X4N0DU|4.0|Really solid P.O.D. album.  Not quite Southtown or Satellite but waaaay better than Angels and Serpents. Has a good mix of rap and hard rock that was missing on their last effort.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I just downloaded this yesterday. and it's awesome. I bought it for $3.00 . but I would say its awesome.
B009E3EY38|5.0|I have been a Zeppelin fan since the 60's, but did not expect this DVD to be so incredibly awesome. It is like it was recorded back in 1980, they sound so good it will blow your mind. Seriously, we have been starved for Zeppelin for so long and this DVD is like a gift from above. The set list flows, the performances are dead-nuts solid. If this is all they are going to give us, they sure did it right. Worth every bloody cent, could be the best rock DVD I own. Far exceeded my expectations. If you are a Zeppelin fan this is a MUST HAVE item. The magic is still there.
B009YU62H2|5.0|Fantastic Cd!!! CHRIS and Co. have lost none of their power over the years.  I have put this on heavy rotation in my collection.  Every song is good and their grunge power remains fully intact...
B009JBZH54|1.0|I bought one copy at 29.99 and its great. So great I wanted to buy another set as a Christmas gift. The price had gone up to 37.99, not a bad deal, especially being Prime eligible. But when I went to check out, the price had been jacked up to 52.99 and it wasn't expected to be delivered until after Christmas. What gives, Amazon?!
1439181780|5.0|This is by far my fav book ever. I bought it because I read The Secret, that how I knew this was going to be awesome.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|awesome app. some glitches but very minor things, when I got to level 18 the game froze and I had to restart it which is why I only rated a 4.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|This app works fine for me on the Kindle Fire HD, although it looks like  a blown up version of the phone app, so it could use some improvement.  The main thing I am missing is the ability to &quot;share&quot; posts and photos like you can on the iOS version of the app.  Please add it!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved this book especially the romance and intensity. I recommend that people who love drama, romance, and happy endings to read this book
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Harold made me laugh, cry and think about who I am and how I am living my life.  Highly recommended
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app does just what you need without taking up massive system resources or bombarding you with unnessary &quot;features&quot;. The graphics are nice as well as informative.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|Me ha tocado en suerte recibir una colección en muy buenas condiciones, la presentación y el audio de gran calidad, sólo se aprecian los defectos propios del formato de vinilo, \\"ruido de aguja\\" y \\"clicks\\" en muy baja cantidad.<br />Altamente recomendable.
B00778GL0G|5.0|This show about corrupt politicians and gangsters in Atlantic City during Prohibition has top notch acting, writing, music, costumes etc.  All of the characters (including youthful real life gangsters like Al Capone, Meyer Lansk and &#34;Lucky&#34; Luciano) are three dimensional and their interlocking stories<br />make &#34;B.E.&#34; the best series since &#34;The Sopranos&#34;.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I tend to avoid series with a lot of hype, but a friend convinced me to give these a try, and I ploughed through them; I couldn't put them down. Easy/quick reads, but captivating characters. I just wanted to always know what would happen next.
B007FDE4Y8|3.0|I REALLY AM NOT THAT HAPPY WITH THIS EQUIPMENT. IT'S VERY HARD TO BALANCE. IT DIDN'T EVEN COME WITH INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO SET IT. I HAD TO GO TO YOU TUBE TO FIND SOME KIND OF GUIDANCE, AND THOSE VIDEOS LEFT ALOT TO BE DESIRED. THE QUESTION TO ME IS, IF I WERE TO BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN, KNOWING WHAT I KNOW NOW, THE ANSWER IS NO AND I ALSO WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT TO MY FRIENDS.<br />THE TRANSACTION WAS GREAT, DELIVERY WAS FAST. AND THATS ALL I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THAT.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I love this and so does my son. Great deal for the price, thanks SO SO SO much for the classic.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Best present ever!  Well worth the price.  What a great product for the cost.  I would recommend this product to a friend.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Just not holding my interest compared to the first 2 books, hopefully the movie will save it for me !
B009ANP4F4|5.0|Best present ever!  Well worth the price.  What a great product for the cost.  I would recommend this product to a friend.
B00821OW8K|1.0|If there are trillions of the alien invaders who catch kids and control them, why is this kid able to color it? \\"They say it hurts a lot.\\".............what a loon. He is another terror victim with NO signs of being truly frightened. This is America, totally desensitized and unrealistic. Get the piano out, the gentle voice of an adult. How  rude.
B00867GK26|5.0|Obviously, the film itself is amazing. Great storyline, breathtaking animation, certainly great for all ages. Everyone loves Finding Nemo. I got the Three-Disc Collector's Edition, which is a very nice set. I've been wanting to get this movie on DVD for ages, but never did. So, this is a very nice set to have.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Pretty disappointed in the movie and it wasn't because all the funny parts were in the trailer(which they were).  I think it could have been better than it was, but it fell flat.
075669812X|5.0|My son, who LOVES Ninjago, went bananas over this! It has every charachter/weapon from the whole series and explains the story very well.<br />It also came w/ Lloyd the Green ninja. I love how he'll sit and page through the book!
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I run between home and office for work.  As a student I do pre-class assignments then travel to remote classroom for instruction.  This is ideal for taking along my documents.  I might work on 3 or 4 different devices at a time and I can always access my work.  Also great for sharing docs with associates with online files.  A must have for anyone with multiple devices.
B0009QTS1M|3.0|im so excited about finding a three-disk edition, i bought it used but there  is allot of marks on all the disks. havnt tried it yet but i hope they all work. :/
B008HK3XYK|3.0|I purchased then returned the case due to issues with my Kindle Fire but the case has one Major flaw. Since the HD has the buttons on one side & the charging port on the other, when you put the Kindle in the case one side will be against the bottom while in the standing mode. So if  you're watching a movie & want to charge at the same time it is not possible because the port is against the bottom of the case.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|This is a great case. It can be used as a stand at every angle (with a little adjusting of the strap) and the magnetic cover works great. It puts my kindle to sleep when I close it, and wakes it back up when I open it. Just looks great on the Fire HD.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I bought this for the two songs I knew and liked, but ended up really loving more than half the songs on this CD.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|It was a great book, it made me sad and happy.  I love reading Nicholas sparks book, I never want to put them down.
B000GCFO0S|5.0|What can I say? Excellent price and even better quality. As you can see the price is right. You won't find a better offer.
1584282584|5.0|Great book about all the techniques and ideas about using a flashlight on your camera, but controlling the light by bouncing of surfaces and controlling the timing of light in various different settings of natural light. Well written and even the complex stuff (Flash sync) is well explained.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is very cool.  Works great on Kendle Fire HD.  Setup was easy and without a hitch.  You can set it to the closest weather station to your house, your work, where ever you are more concerned about weather conditions. Love it!
B008ELUEQC|5.0|All Rod Stewart... Great Christmas Music! Great CD. It is an upbeat CD and if you love Rod Stewart music you will love this CD.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Right after using it on my Kindle Fire the app crashed.  So I uninstalled it and will now login by using my browser instead.  Seems to be the best way to do it for now tip the bugs get worked out.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Saw The TV Christmas special and new I had to have the CD. It is wonderful, all christmasy and has all my favorites!
B007MDB6L0|5.0|bought for christmas for my 4 year old granddaughter she has not opened them yet but she will love it
B004LR5K0I|3.0|I would have preferred that this box was handled like the 60s box, featuring EVERY non-movie, non-gospel, non-live master in chronological order. And they would still have had room for outtakes and rarities.  The 5th live disc crowds out many studio masters, (albeit generally the lesser ones) and just how many 70s concerts do we need anyway, they have become overly redundant.  But, for what it is, really an anthology highlights collection, it is just fine.<br /><br />I have been an Elvis fan since in the womb, and I own just about every commercially available recording anyway. I buy these compilations for the unreleased tracks and also I really like the way the 50s and 60s box puts everything in chronological order based on recording sessions. This 70s box broke from that format and disappointed me.  Maybe I will have to buy \\"THE COMPLETE ELVIS PRESLEY MASTERS\\" to finally fulfill my desire for a perfect archive.
0399215921|5.0|I use this book in  my day care. It has very colorful pictures and the children love this book. easy read.
B0000046PE|5.0|I, like many others discovered Ella in the prime of my life, and what a discovery it has been.  Ella's First Lady of Song collection is one of the best compilations I have heard.  I would highly recommend this disc to anyone who loves pure lovely jazz vocals.  It is no wonder Ella is refered to as the First Lady of Song.
0805017445|5.0|I use this book in  my day care. It has very colorful pictures and the children love this book. easy read.
B00006DEFA|5.0|Prestation de très bon niveau. Emballage soigné, envoi rapide. Service très régulier, je le recommande sans hésitation. Les prix sont très compétitifs.
B009O2XY12|4.0|i love the game but hate that you only get 5 energies! i think you should have more ways to earn it instead or be able to use coins you earn to buy more.
B0058SNKNS|1.0|I favor Crocs because they're comfortable if you have heel pain.  So I was delighted to see them in a more sleek model. However, the way the heel of the shoe is constructed at a pitch there is a tendency to turn over on my ankle.  Therefore, I cannot safely wear them.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Great book and a quick read. Very detailed and the writer did a great job of being open about his sources of facts.
B00A17AD36|5.0|I've been listening to the Weeknd for a couple of years now and the man is so talented I quickly purchased this release.  It had many of the songs I already have but since he had already given so much to his fans, I felt it a small thing to give back to him by purchasing the release of his classics and new stuff.  Give it a listen, I'm sure you will find more than a few songs you like.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|really good message and a glimpse into are future if we don't slow down the population and added wants... or so called needs
B009VB97EY|4.0|cute movie! wish it would have had a better story line though. My friend and I enjoyed watching it though!
B008HK3XU4|2.0|its ok but there is no spot cut out to run the charger cable... i need six more words to finish this.
030014332X|5.0|This book explains things in nice, simple terms. Not presumptuous or condescending, like some scholarly books can be. Not only is it a good read for children, it helps remind everyone of how the human world has progressed from its earliest times. Its written in a way that keeps everything in perspective, which can be as important as anything when discussing history. Great read all around.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|But it takes allot of money to get things... digital things.  This is kinda expensive and addicting for children.  i need 1 more word to finish this rant
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This was my favorite book out of the series. Stephanie Meyer did a great job finishing out  they series. It's great!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|but its kinda expensive... takes allot of money to get the cool digital items.  i need six more words to finish this.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|Soo good. It honestly exceeded my expectations, i was torn when i got to the end.... so i brought her second book right away!!
B004H83IG4|3.0|It is a depressing movie, but also a true story. I have read the book so I could follow along.
B005LAIH54|5.0|HOT GUYS SAVING THE DAY WHAT MORE COULD YOU ASK FOR! BROTHERLY LOVE PREVAILS! GOOD! GREAT AWSOM!! LOVED IT! SMILE
141659521X|3.0|It seemed to short.  I read it in one 6 hour flight.  I felt had they taken some more time to flush out some of the other characters, maybe 200 more pages.  Nash's story line was brought up and then never really mentioned. After reading this book, I feel like it was more or less nothing better than a set up- book for  Mitch's next story, with a little bit of a plot line thrown in just to make the book a stand-alone.  There were just way to many story lines left hanging on this one for my liking.  As a standalone novel, I give it around 2-3 star, but if I am right and another novel is fast approaching and this was really leading us to that, this becomes a 4-5 star novel.
B0002TJGQS|3.0|duh its a battery, ok i guess  it worked  cant believe i am reviewing a battery. a battery is a battery
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|I just finished reading this, and right now I am overflowing with emotion. I've always been a Science Fiction fan and I suppose should have read this many years ago. But now, being older, and being a parent, this story has touched me on a far deeper and more primal level. Clarke maintains a growing sense of foreboding mixed with only the slightest wisps of hope throughout the story.<br /><br />My own children have just started to leave home, so Clarke's tale of human evolution and transformation resonates quite strongly with me. They are moving into a future I will be unable to enter. I've seen and read a lot of SF in my time and no one has told this kind of story better than Clarke. I'm sure I would not have appreciated its nuances as a teenager.
6301797906|5.0|This is such a great movie of really poor people and their children who work on migrant farms.  It will make you so thankful for what you have no matter how little it is.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Bought this for my 66 year-old mother. I wanted a handsfree speaker for her car that we could install ourselves and would be easy for her to operate. SuperTooth Buddy fit the bill. It takes no time to set up, has very intutive controls, and allows her to use the voice dial features available on her Droid phone. Sound quality was very good on both ends of calls. Recommended!
B0067TQQI8|3.0|The battery is working good but the cable is broken when I connect the cable to my cellphone isn't charger but when I change the cable is working good.
1594744769|2.0|Saw this on the New York Times Best Seller List so thought it must surely be good.WRONG!  Well, I guess it might be good for what it is which is a fantasy novel for juveniles, or young adults.  As a non-juvenile who does not enjoy fantasy novels, I did not like it. Guess I should have done more research as to what the book was before I bought it.  At least it seemed properly edited and proof-read!
B005G4TJI4|5.0|Beyond the in-depth film analysis that you can find elsewhere, it should be noted to any and all considering adding this 3D bluray to their stereoscopic collection that the 3D is just outstanding. Michael Bay and the Paramount execs decided to film this flick in native 3D and what a great decision that was. The first scene depicting the autobots fleeing Cybertron is an absolute 3D spectacle in its own right (granted entirely CGI). The depth contrast between the highly detailed Cybertron and the ships that surround it was a feast for the eyes. Another scene that comes to mind is the wing-suit team dropping in on Deceptacon occupied Chicago.<br /><br />It also doesn't hurt that UPS did me a solid and delivered my copy a day ahead of the scheduled release so I was able to watch it a day before the rest of the country. What kind of Amazon prime member would I be if I didn't pay it forward with a 5 star review of the product?<br /><br />Avatar, watch out because you finally have competition in the live-action 3D realm!
B009ZE27US|1.0|it sucked balls it said I was 74 Years old?! WTF don't buy this app what ever the cost worst app ever
B001W6S0C6|5.0|This film proved to the world that comic book films could be much more than action-packed carnage festivals. This film (and the first sequel &#34;Batman Returns&#34;) have so much more to it than that. &#34;Batman&#34; is a gripping and very moving exploration of the psyche; it peers into the souls of not only the Dark Knight, but also those of the people whose lives he changes with his presence. The film is brilliantly acted by its perfectly-chosen cast, which includes Jack Nicholson (the Joker), Michael Keaton (the Batman), Kim Basinger (Vicki Vale), Micheal Gough (Alfred Pennyworth), and Robert Wuhl (Alexander Knox). Tim Burton makes perfect use of his wonderful directorial talents, Anton Furst designs a gothic, beautiful Gotham City, and Danny Elfman's classic musical score further help make this a unique, thought-provoking, and very powerful modern classic, a masterpiece of film noir and grand opera. &#34;Batman Returns shares these wonderful qualities, but, sadly, Joel Schumacher's &#34;Batman Forever&#34; and &#34;Batman and Robin&#34; lose all of that depth and meaning, and become little more than standard mindless action. But, we'll always have Burton's dark vision of a haunted and brooding Batman.
B006ZDU7QI|4.0|This album is impressive and a great aside from everything I've been hearing in music lately. Gotye is a hard artist to describe and really needs to be heard, but he does make much of his work available for free previews online. The album ranges in styles and moods. If you are already a fan of his works, you probably shouldn't even question buying this one.
B004LWZW88|5.0|... kids through parents and grandparents - we have probably watched it at least ten times, laughing all the way!  Antonio Banderas is  perfect!
B005LAIHY0|4.0|I won't go into detail about the movie, I'll let review websites take care of that for you. Instead I'll tell you about the delivery system. The movie arrives as a pair of discs in the DVD sleeve, not uncommon at all. It has a blu-ray copy and a DVD copy, along with a slip of paper allowing you to unlock the digital version, though honestly this was of little interest to me. The really impressive thing was being able to watch the movie the moment I payed for it right on Amazon's video service. I am a very impatient person and with the price this system suited all my needs perfectly. This is a great idea that may just help suppress piracy.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I liked this way better than the first two.<br /><br />This book linked the past two books together. The second half of this book was the best<br />of the three.  I think I could reread the end over and over.  That was the reason you<br />read all the trash.  It had such a beautiful end.<br /><br />I hopefully did not ruin it for someone that did not read it but there is a reason to<br />read this one.  I think you have to read the first two to link this one to them.<br /><br />Hopefully this was of some help.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|Mc3 was Modern Combats \\"Call of Duty's Modern Warfare\\"it was a revolutionary game in the franchise.Now this is comparable to Cod 2 or 3.But I hate comparing this franchise to Cod, so lets review the game itself.<br /><br />Mc4 is following the plot of MC3,the USA  is in trouble because its under the threat of Edward Page.A narcisstic, blood loving man who stops at nothing to complete his dirty deeds done dirt cheap.He hates the US and want to blow it up.Its nothing new, we've seen this many times.So I wouldn't recommend you to get the game just because of the campaign.<br /><br />Gameplay:Its smooth!Finally no skips,freezes,or blurred graphics.But...the controls aren't smooth of course, but Gameloft has added the new controls optimizers for the users preference.So it should take you a mission or two to get used to it.I encourage you to get used to them if you want any chance to succeed in multiplayer.Or you will get killed and mauled and thrown off the cliff.<br /><br />Graphics :Simply put:Very Good.Detailed and in-depth.<br />But in my opinion,a step under Mc3.<br /><br />Multiplayer:Smooth,fast and competative.But the hackers are leaking in though.<br /><br />Overall:A very good 4th installment but a little under the par MC3.But still good.<br /><br />Pros:Graphics,smooth gameplay,multiplayer.<br /><br />Cons:Campaign,and weird phrases from Ed Page.<br /><br />I would suggest this game.Its great for 7 dollars.Get this game FPS lovers! .
0812550706|5.0|This was one of my favorite books to reading during my teen years.  If you were a Star Trek fan but always looked for the dark side of the issues this might be what it is you are looking for in a read.
1481207474|5.0|This was an amazing book. I laughed out loud at parts, cried at others n simply melted at the romance n chemistry btwn the h/h. Courtney Milan's characters hv amazing depths n their principles are truly laudable. She creates the most amazingly different n unexpected stories with characters who are so alive u cannot but help love them. Robert is a duke but his ambition is to eradicate the unfairness to the peerage. Minnie has disguised her true self in 1 way or another since a child. Both are emotionally scarred from childhood. The secondary characters add wonderful depth to the story; Robert's cousin, 1/2 brother - their relationship n camaraderie was so real. Their teasing of 1 another made me LOL. but was nvr overdone. I can't wait to read their books.<br /><br />Courtney Milan brings sthg to her bks that i've not experienced with other writers that makes her stories so memorable n wonderful to read.
B0023SDPS6|1.0|The language in this book is awful.  I think you can write without using such language.  I didn't finish the book!.
B005KELQEU|1.0|This case is too short for a regular Kindle.  Otherwise it is fine.  I would not purchase this case again.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great simple calculator! It is prefect for my kindle. The buttons are big enough and the picture is clear crisp and the app does not freeze.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|Enjoyable and we just loved both movies. It is good to have clean entertainment instead of all that violence now days that is promoted.
B00755646W|5.0|This movie even non madonna fans might show an intrest, is a true treasure for the devoted fan. Why no nomination for best documentry at oscar time , this sure fits the category but u know how the academy feels about madonna look at her oscar snub for evita at least a nomination for that one anyone feel the same.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I have been waiting for this movie to come out for purchase.  Now that I have it in my little hands I loved it.  A great movie for kids and adults alike.  Great purchase.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I was interested in reading Life of Pi before seeing the move. The book had a really good story line - it keeps your attention. Well written.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|This is something I have been waiting for for a long time.  Now that I have it I will lock myself to my TV and enjoy.  It arrived within a couple of days, fast delivery and I love it.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|This season is very well done.  It can get a bit gory at times for the faint-hearted, but usually it is very tastefully done.  There is something for everyone, alot of scientific terms, intrigue, romance.... what is not to like?  Snowy or rainy days are perfect for a Bones Marathon at home!
030758836X|4.0|This book keeps the reader guessing throughout, and the ending is somewhat NOT expected.  I think it would be a great read and discussion for a book club because there would be varying opinions about the characters and the ending.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Not for the faint of heart, this HBO series holds to the channel's tradition of lots of sex, profanity, and nudity. That aside, the story is enthralling and the actors are incredibly talented. Personally I could do without the copious amounts of sex and nudity, but the rest of the show is good enough to deal with it. I wish we could have more plot instead of all the sex, but it's kind of an expected side note for almost any HBO show. The series is based on a book series called something like &#34;Songs of Ice and Fire&#34; and I don't want to even read it because I am enjoying the show so much and don't want to learn the plot ahead of time. However, I've heard that the book series is also fantastic. Recommended!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this game is good and I love that u can get a lot of dragons and I'm not sure if there's ever a ending love it:):):):):):):): ) :) :) :)
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Thankfully the second series of the Walking Dead was longer than the 6 episodes that the first series left us all drooling over. The Walking Dead is well-written, well-acted, and just an all-around enjoyable show. Season 2 brings us back to the group of survivors that Season 1 was following around, and somehow there is just not a moment of boredom, even though the overall story is the same in every episode: &#34;Survive or become a walker.&#34; There is gore but not B-movie gore, and there is plenty of drama without going into soap-opera territory.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This chapter also was full of surprises i am looking forward to the new season. I wish they made more stories from this era and love the clothes and this era. what a surprise ending.
B00A757EFW|1.0|When i first saw this app i was like &quot;awesome i am totally getting that!&quot; then when i read a few of the reviews i got even more excited to play so i clicked the download button and after a minute it said there was a disruption in the download. so i tried again. same results. again. same. i am very disappointed and am sure i would have rated ths 5&#9733;s otherwise. plz fix this!! i really want to play!
0525952926|5.0|I love Ken Follett's books. I like generation books. He is really a great author and I'll continue reading all his books.
1423140605|5.0|I adored this book. It was fantastical. The action! The mystery! The cryptic prophecies! Yum! (Is it weird to say yum when describing a book? Maybe. But it is accurate)<br /><br />Finally our heroes are united in their epic quest to stop the word as we know it from ending. They journey to the ancient land of the gods and encounter all sorts of mini quests and challenges along the way. I love that in this book you get to see the sides from each character. It gives the characters much more depth and lets you understand them more. I also felt this helped change my perspective of some of the characters from previous books I've read(and yes. I've read all of them). I'll try not to give any spoilers, but just know this was a pretty amazing addition to the heroes of olympus series. I cant wait for the next book to come out!!!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan's voice is absolutely beautiful and these songs show the talent that was hidden for too long.  Her other albums are equally as great and we can only hope that she continues to share her talent with the world.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|It's fun and very easy. I finished most levels in less than a minute. I play on a kindle fire and you can pinch to zoom if you need to. It only takes away 20 seconds if you tap multiple times.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Disney fairies are fairly new, and I love them as well as my other favorites:  Mickey & Friends, Pooh and Friends, The Lion King series, Mary Poppins.  Pixie Hollow, the home of the fairies, is a huge, beautiful world, always ready for continual exploration.  Tink was the first, in Peter Pan.  Now she has friends and even a sister in Secret of the Wings.  Can't wait to see what the story writers will think to include in future episodes.  Very popular with school age girls, and adults, too!  I love the Disney Fairies and have all the DVDs, CDs, and many toys for my collection, and I'm a grandmother!
B00365EVWE|3.0|Just a warning before purchase.<br />My immediate reaction while listening to these buds are the horrible cords. Every time the cord rubs or taps against anything they make noisy feedback through the buds. From either walking around with it on or rolling around on my bed, you can here the cords rustle around.
B007U4DIM6|5.0|Papi, the main doggie, is going to party to celebrate friends and family. He and his canine friends move into a posh Beverly Hills hotel.  But Rosa, littlest member, feels less special.  Papi helps her find strength, more than she expected.  Funny, loving, exciting for the whole family. Cute movie
B0053O89Z6|5.0|This is one of the best shows ever on TV right now. Very funny and appeals to a variety of people
B007VYQ6DS|5.0|Oscar is a chimp in the African rainforest.  He and his friends love creating mischief.  They are curious, happy, and like mimicking.  The video qualities are awesome high definition of the animals and forest.  The movie is inspiring, adventurous, with courage and charm.  Your heart will be captured!  I like the fact that Disney nature movies have a goal of protecting our wildlife.
B009MO5ES8|4.0|I hadn't been very excited about this movie but figured with JGL's impressive roles in The Dark Knight Rises, Looper, etc. that I would give this movie a chance. While it may not win any awards for the plot, the action is high-quality and the movie provides lots of laughs with the insane acting of Michael Shannon and the bike cop-JGL interactions.<br /><br />I'd compare this movie experience with Crank, such that it's got a decent plot but the cinematography, action, and humor more than make up for it. Definitely worth a rental if not a purchase, and I'd suggest blu-ray to make the most of the action-packed scenes.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Another Disney princess.  Meridian is a warrior as Mulan is.  Disney Princesses are another favorite of mine.  I remember when Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty came out.  I was a preschooler.  Now as a grandmother, every princess DVD is in my home, as well as CDs, books, toys, household items, etc.  The video, audio effects will always improve, as technology advances.  My three granddaughters each have their own favorite princess, which changes as time passes and new princesses debut.  I recommend Brave for all who love this genre of movie.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|While I haven't seen this since it was in the theaters, it holds up well on a repeat viewing.  Still enthralling, and I was able to pick up on moments I only glimpsed during the initial run.  Worth checking out a second or third time.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Despite I am a huge batman fan and despite is a great trilogy (way to go Chris N.), this package comes with everything a fan could want to have in blu-ray. I also know there will be more in 2013 regards the trilogy but right now is simply the best. And the special features will keep you stuck atr the screen. the book is also great.<br />Super purchase... hope Superman will get such level considering the name Nolan is all over it.
B004EPZ08O|5.0|I didn't think anyone could bring this series back after the rather lackluster climax in The Final Destination, but figured I'd give this one a try, as the price was about what I'd pay to rent the film.  Wow, this movie was great fun.  Not a classic, but the deaths are fun and more Rube Goldbergian than ever.  And the tie in to the series was great, even if you saw it coming.  If you enjoyed this franchise, or even if you thought it wore out it's welcome, you'll have fun with this film.
1400069289|5.0|Love this book.  I am currently reading it and have sent a copy to my father for x-mas.  It is easy to read, great descriptions and easy to follow.  Makes you think about your established routines in new light.
B002ZG98UA|5.0|Yea, I know, it's not like the game, the series doesn't make any sense....  Okay, I get it, this franchise is pretty silly, but that doesn't mean it isn't a lot of fun.  Milla Jovovich might seem on autopilot as Alice in the fourth film of the franchise, but she still is great in the role and delivers on the action sequences.  Throw in some zombies following Alice as she jumps off the top of a massive prison, a giant with a massive war hammer and Ali Larter helping her to kick monster butt, and you have a great popcorn movie.  As long as you are able to buy into the world set up by the franchise, you'll have fun with this installment.

B005QUQ99K|5.0|My kids loved this, and got the special for it and I have to admit, my 10 year old loved it.
B000W91RUG|5.0|This made a great gift and arrived in a timely fashion and was as advertised. I'm happy with the purchase.
B000025INU|4.0|I love the early years of Gong much more. But this and some other years are a bit fusion jazz. So the reason for 4 stars is I know what I bought but I have most all earlier years of Gong.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|I haven't even opened it, so I don't know anything about any special features of the disc. I just love the show! It's no secret why it wins awards. Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys a thriller. I just can't wait for season 3 to start on TV!
B00A8V3VVG|5.0|I have just bought the soundtrack and really like it. Can't wait to see \\"Django Unchained\\" (I have been waiting for this movie for years). Recently, I have been listening to a number of Morricone's tunes from his previous works and \\"Ancora Qui\\" (featuring vocals by Italian songwriter Elisa) is my favorite on this album. As I can speak and understand Italian, these lyrics telling about the loss of a loved one leave me breathless. No doubt composer Ennio Morricone is a genius, a living legend. A++++
B0015HOFZI|3.0|Was happy to receive the turn-table quickly.  Once un-boxed, I found the construction to be rather undesirable.  Feels cheap...Plays discs well, but would feel better about my purchase if it were a bit sturdier.  I'm guessing I'll be back in a year or two to order a new record player once this breaks.  Maybe I'll have to go with a dj table next time; atleast they are encased in metal.

B0000DIXDR|5.0|This has been my favorite movie since I was a kid.  You can't go wrong with it if you are giving it as a gift!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This was a great movie.  If anyone had offered me a million dollars I would not have been able to stop crying.  Based on a true story, the loyalty of Hachi amazed me, but it was sad at the same time.  It touched me in so many places and is a movie I'll never forget.
