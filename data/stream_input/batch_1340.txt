B000066CT5|1.0|Four Rooms is Hell. It is vile and offensive. NOT QUIRKY OFFENSIVE. If you think that late night Cinemax adult programming has a gripping story and good acting, by all means, this movie would serve as \\"fair\\" in that company. It looks just like it, set and all, and the acting is miserable, save for Tarantino's high note ending and Antonio Banderas, (for what he could do with the pitiful script at hand). This movie is not charming, and how it has four stars overall makes me question humanity. Tim Roth is dreadful as he struggles to emulate Mr. Bean on crack, the stories do not connect, and the humor is positively tasteless. What's better than one instance of explicit vomit? Obviously two... And what's better than Tim Roth shouting f*** in between every word for an hour and a half? This movie is the visual and auditory equivalent of the sensations of body and mind from stubbing your toe and soiling yourself at the same time.  I urge you all, I don't write reviews unless I feel like something needs to be said. It must be stressed that this movie is a nightmare, and people who find it \\"cool\\" because it is \\"independent\\" or because they want to be die-hard Tarantino/Rodriguez fans are very disillusioned and should think again. It is unoriginal, it is uncomfortable, it is unprofessional, and it is unwatchable.

0307279189|5.0|I would of read this book non stop in I didn't need to go to work. This book was an incredible story of how life should be lived and how running is the most natural way for humans to enjoy life to the fullest. This book gives you the feeling that anything is possible and that we can all run no matter how little ability we think we have. Take your shoes off at the door and read this book. You will not be disappointed.
074322454X|5.0|Read the Book First, and then watch the DVDs. You will appreciate it more.<br /><br />Ambrose is a wonderful writer and brings to life the men and their prospective of war in an Airborne Infantry Company during WWII. It starts with their initial training and follows them through to the end of the war as they occupy Hitler's Eagles nest. Through his writing style you begin to empathize with the men of the company and the trials, tribulations and suffering they go through in \\"modern\\" combat.<br /><br />This book is on the required Army Chief of Staff's reading list for US Army officers & NCOs. And if you enjoy military history, this is one of the best books and should be on your reading list too.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to use &amp; I can take it ANYWHERE, on any device. No more excuses for not doing my daily reading.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have always enjoyed this game. It was great to find it on my apps. Would recommend it to anyone.
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|Many other reviewers have gone into detail extolling this film's virtues, so I'll not repeat those.  I'll just write that outside of this movie not being filmed in Puxsutawny, Pennsylvania, I consider this a perfect film.  Think about it:  How many ways can you film the same events of a day over and over yet this film explores the different emotions it's main character does without feeling repetative.  This is a classic.  I have the Special Edition and am very happy with it.  Just watched it again (an annual event) and it just surprises me how great it is.  Highly recommended.  It also makes one want to head to Woodstock Illinois on Groundhog Day and enjoy a day or two in this lovely town.
0195145925|1.0|I read once that Julaian Barbour decided that he must operate outside the mainstream of physics since his ideas challenged the status quo of thought about space and time.  This always raises a red flag.  His recent Discover Magazine (not peer-reviewed) article \\"Gravity off the Grid\\" has a gripping picture of Barbour \\"arguing\\" with himself.  His state goal is to demolish Einstein's view of space-time.  It is always easy to gain the attention of popular press with challenges to highly held theories.  Of course that is the nature of theories, they are subject to change as new concepts and new observations require tweaking, adaptation, extensive revision, or complete abandonment and adoption of a new theory as the best explanation of \\"reality.\\"  But when you start off, in the beginning, with your stated goal to challenge and upend the operating model or theory of a major aspect of physics, I get very nervous about the motivation for sensationalism and the validity of the resulting work.
B00284BNKC|5.0|We all know how great this movie is, but I didn't know how great it could be until I bought the Blu-ray version. While it is not demo worthy like The Tree of Life or Inception for example, it stays true to the directors intentions, which is a good thing. I did not expect and certainly did not want a super clean picture free of grain when it is not meant to be seen that way. The color palette is muted for the most part, it is a bit grainy, but details are sharp. One must consider the way the movie was intended to be seen. If you take that into consideration, the transfer is excellent. It is a huge improvement over the DVD version and certainly worthy of an upgrade.<br /><br />The music score is absolutely fantastic and haunting at times, making use of every available channel with its dts-HD MA 7.1 audio mix. It really brings this movie to life. It would be a shame to watch it without a proper surround setup capable of delivering HD audio (though that is true for almost any Blu-ray).<br /><br />It is not exactly a movie you pop into your disc player every month, but it does deserve multiple viewings if you can handle it. Aronofsky's films are always top notch, from PI and Requiem to more recent titles like The Wrestler and Black Swan, you know are in for something fresh; something made with the intention to make you think and feel rather than to merely entertain.<br /><br />Requiem's subject matter may turn people away which is certainly understandable. The film is gritty, raw, full of despair and downright depressing, but so is heroin and amphetamine addiction. After watching it you will, at the very least, have a greater understanding of what it is like to be addicted. And hopefully, you will realize just how broken and cruel the U.S. justice system is; focusing on imprisonment rather than rehabilitation. Granted, it is a bit extreme, but it gets it's message across in a very effective way. There will never be a movie quite like Requiem for a Dream.
B0058VA2U4|3.0|Overall the album didn't leave a huge impact on me. The album had some good moments with \\"Fight 'em til you cant\\" and \\"I'm Alive\\" but the rest kind've just left me feeling underwhelmed. The vocals were great in my opinion. I love Joey's voice on here even with his aging voice. the music was OK, but the tone was all wrong for me. It sounds too heavily produced, and lacks that raw talent that they started with.  It's not the early years, it's not the bush years, it's just new Anthrax but it feels like its missing alot of the melody that they used to have. Every band goes through changes though and i can respect that, but i just kind've hoped for something more. The cover of New Noise was a different take on a good song, but it just felt kind've wierd and almost alien to have Joey sing it, but to be fair i think he did an alright job.  In closing, i'd like to say the music itself is OK, the vocals didn't dissapoint, but the overall tone was nowhere where it needed to be in my opinion. It tone felt more akin to Municpal Waste.
B00081U7HC|5.0|I used to not really like this movie. I felt it was overrated. But last night I went ahead and laid down and watched it, and lo and behold my opinion has changed. This is a really good movie. The casting is great, the writing is good, and Marshall's delivery of an actually rather taboo subject (prostitution)is spot on.  What really gets me though is Gere and Roberts' chemistry. It is awesome. The scene where she first kisses him on the mouth is one of the hottest scenes in cinema history. They've since reteamed (Runaway Bride) which is another movie I truely love, but it doesn't catch Julia in the same way as this movie did when she was still green and young. Marshall caught a moment in time with two charismatic people that won't likely be replicated for a long while.  Feed into the hype. This is a great romance. I just would not let young kids watch it, since there is prostitution and drug use. I will actually probably add this to my movie collection next time I buy a few movies.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put this book down once I started it. I had to immediately get the whole trilogy.  I borrowed the first one but paid for the other two and I plan to actually purchase this one so I can own the set.  Fantastic storyteller and story.  Top of my list of recommendations.
0375507256|3.0|I came upon this book through the recommendation of a friend. He warned me that it would be unlike any novel I had read before, so I entered this story with excitement and curiosity. In Cloud Atlas, author David Mitchell has proved that he has the technical capabilities to write anything that his heart desires. A master of construction and dialect, Mitchell combines six separate stories into a fascinating novel that spans from the 19th century to a distant future.<br /><br />The novel begins with the story of Adam Ewing, an American notary who is on a ship, headed home. Presented as Ewing's personal journal, Mitchell wonderfully captures the voice of a homesick man, full of religious zeal. When a black, foreign stowaway is discovered on board, Ewing fights to keep the man away from the harm and racism of the captain and crew. When Adam begins to feel ill, his only friend on the boat, Dr. Henry Goose, begins to treat him for a \\"poisonous worm\\" living inside of him. With the threat of death, Ewing struggles to maintain his morality in the seemingly sinful environment of the ship.<br /><br />Abruptly, the novel jumps to the early 20th century with the letters of a young aspiring English composer, Robert Frobisher. He finds himself in Belgium, short of financial stability and a clear musical direction. He seeks out local composer Vyvyan Ayers, whose music he sees a revolutionary, to become a kind of understudy to the ailing composer. Ayers accepts the offer and begins to have Frobisher assist him in writing new music. Unfortunately, Robert finds himself in the middle of a forbidden affair, and begins to feel that Ayers is taking advantage of his own musical ideas.<br /><br />The story of young American journalist Luisa Rey, reads like a fast paced thriller. The year is 1975 and Luisa, who is struggling to overcome the shadow cast by her famous journalist father, believes she has found the story that will provide her with her big break. As she attempts to uncover the reported corruption of a local nuclear company, she finds herself entangled in a web of conspiracy, love, and murder.<br /><br />Timothy Cavendish is a sixty-something publisher who finds unexpected success after his client, a gangster who recently published his memoirs with Cavendish's company, murders a critic at a local event. The client, of course, is sent to jail, and the novel becomes a bestseller. With his newfound wealth, Timothy seems to be living the high life. When the brothers of his client attempt to violently persuade Cavendish to give them the money from their imprisoned brother's book, he flees the city. Unfortunately, he mistakes a nursing home for a hotel and finds himself unable to escape.<br /><br />Sonmi-451, a genetic fabricant, created to serve food in a fast food restaurant of the dystopian future, is being interviewed about her escape and rebellion of the established society. She tells of how she was able to leave the restaurant, and discover how she, and others like her, have been taken advantage of by the established society. As she amasses knowledge she was never supposed to posses, she begins to feel emotions and make human connections that were never intended to be possible.<br /><br />In the very distant future, we find Zachary, a primitive member of a tribe who is learning to face his fears in this strange world. After the death of his father and the capturing of his sibling, he blames himself for not preventing the attack. When a woman, a visitor from another group of people who seems to have more \\"knowledge\\" than Zachary's tribe, moves in with his family, he must face new threats to his tribe's beliefs and ways of life.<br /><br />The stories, except for the one about Zachary, are all interrupted in the middle, giving the novel a kind of ABCDEFEDCBA arc. Mitchell ties this all together by making each new character the witness, mostly through reading, of the previous character's story. I think that each character could also be interpreted as a reincarnation of the previous because they all seem to share a similar birth mark. With each story, the author adapts to a different style of narrative, making some of the tales read easier than others. Notably, the strong dialect of the middle character makes his story nearly impossible to comprehend. Despite his ingenious presentation and construction, I couldn't help but feeling a bit disappointed at this end of this. The novel can be such a chore to read, that I didn't feel that I got some revolutionary message at the end of this, otherwise, expertly crafted story. Despite being glad that I took the time to read this unique novel, I can't help but wonder if my time would have been better spent reading something with a deeper meaning.similar birth mark.

B0034G4P8A|4.0|I love the story of Thor I have sense I was young but it ended up being more of a love story, which made the story kinda slow.  The first 20 min of the movie was the best then it slowed WAY down for awhile.  I hope the next movie will have more action.
B004LWZW7O|5.0|This movie was very entertaining.  The plot centers around a unique concept of time becoming currency.  After the age of 25, you live only as long as the time you earn/steal/gamble/horde/lose.  It was very well done.  The cast was great.  Very strong acting performances that really sell the premise.  The action was realistic.  There was no gratuitous violence nor swearing.  The only con in my opinion were the cars of the future.  They looked like Dodge chargers with flat black paint jobs, tinted windows and LED Grills.  They made me think about the vehicles of the future from the movie Solent Green.  But, they were good enough.  I will definitely enjoy watching this movie again and again.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|these are super comfortable and the sound is excellent. One con i can say is the chat volume thing. it adjusts with the game sounds. so if you get into heavy combat with a lot of sounds the chat volume raises. during these types of situations players tend to get loud too. kind of hurts my ears at times, but a good balance could be found. takes a few battles to get it right but can't account for an overly excited player :)  if you're in the market for a headset this is worth looking into. plus it works across all platforms, ps3, xbox and PC. i use it for PC and it works great. haven't tried it on my xbox yet as star wars old republic has got all my attention. works great over skype while playing SWTOR.
B0068MNO4S|1.0|THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.  As a firm believer that William Shakespeare of Stratford wrote the plays attributed to him, I thought that \\"Anonymous\\" would make my blood boil with its myriad historical inaccuracies and its nonsensical conspiracy theories. Instead, it nearly put me to sleep. None of the characters aroused any interest or sympathy. None of the characters had any life, so how could they interest me? None of the characters had a character arc, meaning that no one significantly changes or grew during the film. (Well, that's not completely true. The young de Vere played by Jamie Campbell Bower seemed to be an immature horn dog, while the older de Vere played by Rhys Ifans seems to have no interest in sex at all, but that wasn't character growth - that was an unlikeable character mysteriously becoming a very different unlikeable character with no explanation for the change.) As Edward de Vere, Rhys Ifans attempted to show his poetic soul by looking constipated. He didn't show a shred of humor, which is decidedly odd for a man who supposedly (if he was the real author, as the Oxfordians would have it) wrote more comedies than tragedies. His character claims that art must be political or else it is merely decorative, but he never expressed any political beliefs in the film. He had a personal grudge against the Cecil family, but there is a difference between the personal and the political. (By the way, I find the statement that art must be political or else it is merely decorative to be the most offensive thing in the entire film.)  According to the film, Edward's consummate goal was to install Essex on the throne rather than James. But why did he care? Was it some sort of prejudice against the Scottish? Was it out of some sort of affection for Elizabeth? He lusted for her as a youth, but we never see him show any affection for her as a woman, rather than as sex object (when they were young). (And if he had felt any deep affection for Elizabeth, one would have to question why he would care for such an empty-headed libertine.) Did de Vere actually think Essex's political policies were superior to James's political policies? If so, why didn't the film ever differentiate between their policies? Does this mean that Oxford would have thought the screenplay of \\"Anonymous\\" was merely decorative?  As played by Ifans, de Vere didn't seem to have a passion for anything, or any joy in living. He didn't even enjoy writing - he wrote to keep his \\"voices\\" from troubling him. (At the very end of the film, he shows some love for his son, but by that point it was too late for me to care about this cold fish.)  Perhaps I shouldn't have been surprised that I was bored. I have long thought that it would be difficult to make a film with Oxford as the hero of an \\"Oxfordian\\" movie, because you would either have to portray him as a prig who was ashamed of writing \\"Hamlet,\\" or as someone who would like to have taken credit, but was too big a wimp to say anything. This film manages to portray Oxford (at least when he is Ifans) as both a wimp and a prig.  The film did not bother me primarily for the way it treated William Shakespeare. It bothered me primarily because it was so damned boring.  Even if you accept the premises of the film, it doesn't make sense on its own terms. Queen Elizabeth is not presented as a Puritan (quite the opposite) and she clearly enjoys plays. Why, at the very end of the film, does she suddenly insist that de Vere's name never be on the plays? That comes completely out of left field. And Robert Cecil is supposed to be an ultimate political games-player and spy master. Why doesn't he know that the man he installs as King likes plays? Why did de Vere first learn about the power of plays to move people when he was a mature man (played by Ifans) who attended a public performance of a play by Ben Jonson? According to the film, de Vere had already written \\"Romeo & Juliet\\" and the \\"Henry IV\\" plays and had them performed atcourt - wouldn't he have already known about the power of plays to move  people???  The second most offensive thing in the film (i.e., after the statement that art must be political or it is merely decorative) was changing the line \\"that can sing both high and low\\" to \\"that can kiss both high and low\\" - turning it into a cheap oral sex joke.

030788743X|2.0|I read Ready Player One largely due to the spate of 5 star reviews on Amazon. I'm a long way from a video game or 80s pop culture afficianado, but all the good reviews convinced me that this would be a good read anyway. But I was wrong. The story at its core is interesting enough - a massive treasure quest in a virtual world that people escape to to get out of the dreary real world in 2044. But the story drags on.  For one thing, the story is filled with gratitutious 80s pop culture references that get old. Yes, the author knows and has researched all sorts of Japanese cartoon characters from the 80s. Good for him. But sometimes all the references just seems like a lot of name dropping in order to make him look cool and hip. But I think it backfires as it just slows the pace of the story down. Plus I find it interesting that there are really only 80s references. By 2044 there is nothing from the 1990s-2030s that is deemed \\"cool enough\\" for the people of the world - or at least the narrator - to remember fondly? Plus in 2044 people are apprently still uploading videos to YouTube. Really??? The author imagined this alternative virtual reality world, but couldn't think of another way in which 30 years from now people will share videos? I have no idea what will happen, but I seriously doubt that YouTube will be around in 2044. It will be long since replaced by something else.  The story is predictable and drawn out. Mostly a yawner. And I didn't find it all that suspenseful. Pass.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really like this game. its easy to get coins and there's games of all sort. the only thing I dislike is some games are impossible. I did some over thirty times and couldn't pass them. other than that I love this game.

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|By Far... This is one of the best, if not, THE BEST, Office App in the Market right now. Right off the bat, this app is cheaper than the other office app, by $5.00. this app is 9.99. the other one is 14.99. This Office app is strictly made for Office Materials only. Pure Business. The other Office App make your slide shows and documents &quot;look good&quot; compared to this one. This app can also read PDF's which was a major PRO for me. I really like this one better than all the others... Now you decide for yourself... WHO SIDE ARE YOU ON?!?!

B0002NRQTS|4.0|I'm uncertain what some people are talking about, when exclaiming that this remaster is exactly the same sounding disc as the original. Unless they downloaded the MP3 version of Presto and the download site didn't update their catalogue to include the remastered tracks...? The recording of this great Rush release is thin and reserved to begin with; narrow in dynamic range and very crisp with a high treble edge. The bass guitar 'punch' is almost non-existent...a very flat sounding DDD recording. But to say there are no differences at all with the latest remaster is not accurately stated.<br /><br />Now, I've compared both the original CD from 1989 to the remastered 2004 disc using sound editing tools, and there is some definite overall improvements to be found here. Is it such an improvement that it should be praised as the best thing since the miniskirt? Hardly. But it is a better quality disc and is an upgrade in sound clarity. To start, the instruments are separated much better: all three musicians are readily heard and equal in the mix. What really stood out for me was the added instrument layers that seems to surround the players are now much more noticeable on this remaster. The song Scars provides the listening experience I am trying to convey with my last sentence. You can hear 'swirling' keyboard effects, acting as a layer above the beat and rhythm of the musicians. It sounds very clear and is nicely mixed.<br /><br />This remaster won't win any sound engineering awards, as it still lacks the driving bass that so many Rush fans like, but it is worth the cost to replace your '89 CD. Perhaps we'll see another remaster down the road of this classic (Audio Fidelity 24K Gold CD perhaps?). Until then, this will have to suffice. 4 out of 5 stars for a stellar CD and adequate upgrade.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The only complaint is lack of true Vegas play and keeping running dollar totals seems buggy. But it's free, so oh, well.

B001UGB1X8|1.0|This film has all the ingredients -Tommy Lee Jones, the back marshes of the Louisiana bayou, a murdered prostitute, and yet the overall execution falls flat. I can't remember the last time a plot was so dry, slow, and lacking in creativity that I actually didn't make it to the end. Yes, that is correct -I shut this movie off before the predictable conclusion. In the Electric Mist? More like in the BORING mist!

B005FQ2H8W|5.0|Amazon has recommended this movie to me, when I brought the movie up I'm told I have a DEFAULT ADDRESS', I have no idea what the heck this means, in fact there are a number of movies I have tried to order and have read you can't deliver because I have a 'DEFAULT ADDRESS' WHY? I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS. Actually, I have this movie and it is excellent, it's one of my fovorite movies' I often watch it.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|this movie is so bad i don't if words can adequately express it. everything, from the soundtrack, to the animation, to the voice acting, to the script, is downright appalling. a 5 year old could have made a better movie. avoid at all costs!
B000VNMMQG|5.0|A really good flick. How Wilberforce got the British to stop the slave trade. (And after the film, ended slavery in the British empire.) Most enjoyable was that after years of getting nowhere by normal means, he and his allies win by employing a new strategy: \\"We cheat\\". Like hiding anti-slavery laws inside other innocuous laws put forth by droning, boring speakers that Parliament votes for just to stop the blather.

B005DN7W4G|5.0|I just watched this movie. This is my very first review I've ever written. I think it was a very good movie. The cast was surprisingly good. Great performance from Morgan Freeman. Nice to see Blake Underwood as well. There were several well known actors in the movie, including Elisha Wood, from the Lord of the Rings. It was very well done. The effects were first class and the story lines was thoughtful. It really touched me. I even shed a tear or two. Gives you something to think about, that's for sure. Enjoy!
0307477479|5.0|Normally I bristle at books about the problems of rich (or at least comfortable) white people, but I found this book to be stirring, funny, and ultimately beautiful. Months later, I'm still thinking of the indelible moments from this book. The stolen purse. The safari. Jumping in the river. The sunset shining through the window in Italy. The powerpoint presentation. Scotty's concert. Especially recommend this to any music geeks, who will probably share Benny's taste in music.

0316010669|3.0|I enjoyed Blink quite a bit, but it could have been a little shorter. You pretty much get the point by the 150th page or so.  So what is the point of the book? Well, basically it's about what our subconscious is able to process in the blink of an eye. Our subconscious is working constantly to pick up all kinds of signals from the world around us/people around us, and our conscious doesn't know that a lot of this is actually happening. The conscious can also complicate the signals that your subconscious is picking up-maybe that's why people always say go with your first guess on a multiple choice test??  Gladwell uses a lot of social examples and clinical studies to back himself up. For example, there is this psychologist who has been studying marital relationships for years. He can tell in a single session whether or not a couple will stay together by reading their faces, inflections, and body language to see what's going on under the surface of their conversation.  Psychology is so fascinating because it seems like whenever you learn new things about it, you already kind of knew them! I don't know if that makes sense, but psych sort of opens your eyes to things that you would probably otherwise ignore. I'd suggest reading the book if you haven't already.

0316098329|4.0|Room is a  haunting novel told from the perspective of a young boy, Jack, who has been trapped in a small room with his mother his whole life.  Jack is completely unaware of the outside world aside from what he sees on TV, which he thinks is make believe. Room is literally his own little world which he shares with Ma, interrupted only by the ominous, late-night appearances of Old Nick, their captor.  Jack and Ma have a routine they follow religiously, presumably because it helps the mother keep her sanity. The routine is kept on a tight time schedule and includes laundry, bathing, cooking, working out, reading (Jack loves Alice and Wonderland; there were tons of references to it!), and \\"parroting\\" TV-where Ma pauses the TV and Jack has to repeat what was just said.  Despite their routine and activities, Jack observes that Ma is \\"gone\\" sometimes-meaning she lays on the bed all day and doesn't move or speak. Jack is obligated to entertain himself and wait for her to \\"come back.\\" She has been locked in Room for seven years, and Jack doesn't understand her discontent; Room is all he's ever known.  When Jack turns five, Ma begins to \\"unlie\\" or to tell Jack that they are not the only people in the world, and the world is much more than Room.  Jack and Ma concoct a plan to free themselves from Room and, through an extraordinary bit of cunning, manage to escape.  The rest of the story is truly fascinating, more so than the beginning. Jack has to come to terms with the outside world, which-up until a few weeks ago-he thought wasn't real. Think about it. He's never seen sunshine, trees, animals, other people. Donoghue does a brilliant job of placing the reader right in Jack's shoes, seeing everything from his perspective. What is it like for Jack to be \\"born again\\" at five years old? Can he and his mother adapt to Outside?  This is a unique story told with striking attention to language and detail. The voice is endearing, irritating, and haunting-I still haven't decided if Ilike Jack or Ma, but this story of psychological survival is quite enchanting. I have never read anything like it.

0062073494|3.0|In Murder on the Orient Express, Poirot is traveling on an uncommonly full train that stops in the middle of the night due to a snow storm. When a man is found stabbed in his apartment, Poirot has to investigate the crime.  After the murder was discovered, the story started to pick up speed. Christie separates the later chapters into individual interrogations with each suspect, which makes the book seem like less of a novel and more of an evidence log, bringing to mind shows like Law and Order. However, I liked this method; it made me feel like she was presenting me with the facts so that I could deduce what happened.  The dialogue was a bit stiff, but I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that the story is set in the early 1900s, when people were typically more articulate. Anyway, if you like murder mysteries, I'd suggest this book.

0241951453|3.0|In an interview with Playboy, Capote calls Holly Golightly an \\"American geisha.\\"<br /><br />Set in the mid 1940s, Breakfast at Tiffany's takes a striking look at female sexuality.<br /><br />Holly Golightly is one of America's most famous and controversial heroines. The blonde beauty stumbles gracefully-perhaps a little tipsy-into the narrator's life and assumes command of his heart and the story. The narrator is a sad sort of person. He reminds me of Nick from The Great Gatsby. They are both ineffectual men who are in love with a woman, all the while completely disapproving of her.<br /><br />Holly hails from Texas, where at 14 she married and became a step-mother. Soon she abandoned her post as wife and mother for life in the big city. The ex-child-bride makes a living by spending time with wealthy men who shower her with gifts and cash. She is a New York cafe society girl. Holly is not a prostitute really. Nevertheless, Holly is a skill-less girl in an era when women didn't have a lot of options. Independence comes at a price.<br /><br />Near the end of the story, the prospect of marriage opens up an opportunity to leave her life as a geisha behind, and Holly jumps at the idea of domesticity and motherhood. Marriage seems to be her only way out of society girl life. But when she gets in trouble with the law, Holly's marriage plans fall to pieces.<br /><br />Every man in the story is completely taken with Holly. There is something about her beautiful nonchalance and engaging, endless chatter that has men falling over themselves just to be around her. Breakfast at Tiffany's is really quite a pathetic portrayal of men.<br /><br />Yet Holly is not exactly likeable either. Under her elegantly simple exterior, she is a maze of contradictions. She's rather shallow, has no convictions, doesn't seem too bright, and is kind of a floozy. Yet she adores her brother and is sympathetic toward her former husband; these glimpses of her humanity make her a believable-if not likable- character. Her unpredictability is infinitely intriguing!<br /><br />By the way, Breakfast at Tiffany's is actually a novella, meaning an incredibly short novel (or an incredibly long short story). The novella itself is about 90 pages long, but Breakfast at Tiffany's is an umbrella title that shelters three additional stories (I skipped those).

B006JSXYPA|2.0|I went to see this with the hope of getting Revenge of the Fallen's bad taste out of my mouth.<br /><br />Fission Mailed<br /><br />Where to begin? The plot, while being nowhere near as \\"immature\\" as ROTF, still suffered from being clogged with too much filler and not making much sense. It's an overlong mess with the CGI eye candy being the only redeeming factor of this film. It's clear that Bay knows how to make a big budget action film with explosions aplenty, but he cannot write a decent script for these movies to save his life. It's not his fort&eacute; and hasn't been since The Rock. The movie peaks with a huge, final battle in Chicago that is nuts, but you will just be wanting it to be over with by the time it finally takes place. The 3D is well used in spots, but that cannot make up for the fact that almost everything in it is just a letdown. Do not buy unless you really want to complete your collection.
B005LAIGPA|4.0|This film was a surprise for me. Judging from the trailers it really could have gone either way, good or completely terrible. I wasn't sure if I needed to see it but I enjoy the actor Michael B. Jordan from the series Friday Night Lights, I'd seen most of the other films already playing and so I thought I'd give it a try. Overall, I was glad I did. This film takes the superhero genre and the found footage genre (both of which have become more saturated than ever recently) and mixes them together for a fairly unique and definitely interesting experience.  Directing: Surprisingly solid and inventive. If you hate shaky cam or hate how found footage always seems to be shot either from annoyingly too realistic angles or completely unrealistic angles then this film may still appeal to you. The kids powers allow them telekinetic capabilities and as the film progresses they start toying with the camera and using their powers to move it around or have it follow them. Along with that, possibly using that as justification, I found much more stable camera angles here, yet it provides the intimacy that found footage films benefit from when done well. The realism is well created, especially the first half of the film. In the later half when it turns into more of a low budget action movie I still found the directing and cinematopgraphy to be unique and well thought out, though the first half is my preference.  Acting & Writing: Since the story is so simplistic, and it's hard to talk about one withour referencing the other, I'll just lump the two together. The simple idea of three kids getting powers is really the bare bones of the story, the film seems to purposefully stay simple in aims of showcasing good cinematography and well done directing, but there is some emotional meat thrown on for more sustenance. For example the conflicts that arise are well established in the beginning. Also the seeming lead character (his name is Andrew) has realistic and compelling life circumstances, nothing is going well for him, and it gives a reason why he starts videotaping things but also justifies his changes during the film. The three relative newcomers, I think they've all had some smaller roles previous (I already mentioned Jordan and FNL), do an excellent job stepping into the parts they are assigned as Andrew, Matt and Steve. These guys have a good rapport, they feel like friends videotaping themselves and goofing off with powers. It's a positive that it feels as though they were given the chance to ad lib and play things naturally and they do so enjoyably and within the larger overarching story. The first half of the movie is great fun and when things start to escalate and get more serious as the film progresses it feels justified, exciting and the actors do an excellent job of stepping up.  Some things are easy to see coming and have been done before but here the majority of it is done in an understated way. One example, the idea that the boys feel the need to start setting rules regarding their powers, a fairly standard superhero theme, but played out amongst younger kids who are friends it becomes more interesting and genuine (in comparison to say an alien from Krypton deciding to be a symbol for good because he's almost a god).  The unique aspect of the story is seeing three friends discover powers together and then actually act like teenagers while it happens. Spider-man had some scenes with Peter discovering his abilities for example but he does so by himself and then because they want to keep the character's virtues they can't have him do some of the stupid things you know real teenagers with powers would do. Here you see all those things, the goofing around and the trouble, it makes a standard story feel unique and fresh and also keeps things compelling for the majority. It's all very evocative of a more well planned, better produced and more entertaining youtube video in that sense.  CGI: Isn't as overdone as most of the big action films,which is refreshing, it is used here to good effect. In some cases it looks really good and realistic, they definitely used some practical tricks which probably aid in this. It usually works best when done subtly. There are admittedly some spots where I had to suspend being critical of some less convincing CGI but it moves along at an even enough pace that it doesn't detract from the experience. Still the CGI is overall solid and actually impressive for a film that had a much smaller budget than some larger movies that do much worse. (I'll also say the CGI here looks more convincing than the wolves in The Grey, which was a movie I actually enjoyed, but good God those wolves felt like Twilight).  I recommend giving this film a try if you want an interesting movie going experience that isn't quite the norm. If you want some action or a sense of excitement I found it to be more action packed and at least as exciting (probably moreso) than other recent films Man on a Ledge or Contraband. There is also a nice emotional core and all the young actors for my bet give the best performances to be found in this genre of film so far (again especially in the first half). It's a plus that unlike the horror found footage genre you don't have to hear a lot of shrieking going on off camera, here there are some astonished yells but we see what is provoking them and it all feels cohesive. This is one found footage style film that feels more like an experience than some sort of trickery or teasing. I give this 4 stars, I liked it and I would watch it again.  **(I almost ashamedly admit that the well done execution of this film has me excited to see if the found footage genre can go some new places, Project X is coming and may be rediculous but looks like another attempt at something unique, with the amount of stock movies being put into production unique is a good thing).
030758660X|5.0|I bought this book for the Lore Hoodie pattern alone, but it turns out there are more than just a couple patterns in here I could see making. I am about finished with the Lore Hoodie now, which is turning out nicely because the instructions were very clear and easy to follow even for a beginner like me. Each pattern is labeled for different difficulties and there are several in each so this book could be for just about everyone. Also, one doesnt have to like vampires to appreciate this book. There are of course a few items that have quirky vampire quote words on them,(a handbag and pillow pattern) but those could easily be changed. There is nothing too childish or too teen-like about most the items and a lot of them are actually pretty elegant looking. What I found most important, is this book is completely practical. If your at all interested, I would definately recommend this book.

1401207529|3.0|Like a can of Spam; therein lies much ham-fisted dialogue. A re-imagining of the beginnings of Batman with a Lieutenant Gordon and a young and reckless, 18 year old Bruce Wayne. After picking up Watchmen and loving it, I'd figure I would pick up some more adult comic books or \\"graphic novels\\". This one is inferior in dialogue and art work to Watchmen but it's still a lot better than the Archie comics I'd read as a young boy. The most annoying part is the way Frank Miller had all the dialogue displayed in unusually small fragments, even for a comic book. An example is a scene where Lt. Gordon is trying to save some bag lady from being ran over by a runaway van: \\"out of control.-- oh no, not that woman.-- can't let that happen.-- come on you heap move.-- no time.-- can't reach.-- no time.-- it's over.-- i've blown it.--\\" Annoying. The target audience might have been the barely literate.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|This movie is freaking hilarious! It is an over-the-top action movie featuring some creative film making. The whole premise of the movie is that the main character dumps his cute Chinese girlfriend \\"Knives\\" for a more alternative bad girl type. She gives him her number with seven x's below which he believes symbolize kisses. It turns out that they are her \\"seven deadly x's\\" each of whom he must battle in a Tekken-style fight. Whenever he wins the fight, arcade music plays and coins fall out, which he gladly swipes up.<br /><br />WARNING: If you can't handle some cheesy humor, some gayness, alternative music, and video games. This film is not for you.
B0055X6TVQ|5.0|One of the great reads of the past decade. Richly constructive, the narrative moves along at a fast pace and, at the end of the day, you're left fascinated by the skillful weaving of interconnected lives you care about and a sack-full of historical gems before, during and after WW1. JWM
B000VS4K2K|5.0|You are either going to love this or hate it, period.<br />It is essentially, by today's labels, \\"garage psychedelic space metal\\".  In 1970 - 1973, nothing like this had ever been heard of, yet. You had other bands such as Black Sabbath,  introducing the world to \\"metal\\" (No, not Led Zeppelin. They were blues rock, not metal) Pink Floyd never had a real metal edge and was rapidly moving away from any association with it with Meddle and DSOTM. Hawkwind was real \\"head banger heavy metal stuff\\" for this generation.  Add to that the sci-fy and fantasy themes and you had to be considered \\"adventurous\\", even back then, to be a Hawkwind fan.  Heck, you still have to today! Women hate `em.  It is difficult to figure out if they were good, or were so bad that they were good!<br /><br />Why do I give this album, that some people hate, 5 stars? I actually came to it late in life. Not Hawkwind, but this album. I am not reviewing it out of nostalgia, but as essentially a new listener. It is undeniably a classic. It is a record of what unbridled concerts were, and sounded like during that time. There was none of the sophisticated mixing and monitoring that we have to day. Hell, they were making it up as they went along! It was a band on a budget. No stadium tours! The music on it is powerfully raw. It is a snapshot of a time and type of music that would go on to influence to this day. It is a recording of a group that really didn't care what the mass audience thought, but drove themselves into a sweating frenzy as they performed on stage. They were/are a band that considered the spoken word as much a part of a performance as the songs. The audience was more than likely under the same \\"influences\\" (legal and illegal) that the band was, which created a two way flow of energy of which each other fed. (How else can you explain poetry readings that got cheers from the crowd.) Musically, the majority of songs do have catchy riffs and you do have your first exposure to the now infamousLemmy Killmister on base. All songs are extremely high energy and LOUD. They used the poetry readings to break things up rather than slow ballads. The poems are just strange and no sober mind could have come up with \\"Sonic Attack\\".  (but no stranger than Peter Gabriel's stories during early Genesis concerts.) It is a shame that the live recording techniques from the time were so bad because Simon King on drums could put Keith Moon to shame on just how many drums he can hit in any given bar of a song. He is really quite amazing! They often simply get lost even in the remastered mix. Any old concert footage always shows him dripping with sweat. Lemmy Killmister's bass is fairly clear and he seems to punish it on every song. Dave Brock does an admirable job on lead guitar, switching seamlessly between rhythm and lead. It is nearly impossible to figure out what Del Dettmar and Dik Mik were doing on keyboards as most of what you hear are intonations and sounds, but they actually do fit the music. Nick Turners sax and flute are remarkably clear however. The volume in the concert hall had to be deafening and probably distorted as hell. It is all captured here, LOUD and proud!  OK, yea, you may think it is really bad. But...is it so bad it is genius?

B004EPZ0AC|1.0|Why? Cause this movie is utter garbage. The voice acting is shoddy and surprisingly, WORSE than the first movie. Where the first movie was cutesy, this movie is just plain dumb. I honestly could spend an hour describing how crappy this POS is. Please parents, actually EVERYBODY, do not waste your hard-earned dollars on Happy Feet Two. With the way the MPAA is being run now, it's actually not very surprising that the quality of a lot of movies is going down the drain. Quality used to describe feature films not too long ago, but unfortunately, it doesn't anymore. And it CERTAINLY doesn't apply to Happy Feet Two.

0307408833|1.0|As an accomplished baker, I am ready for any challenge when it involves creating something worth sharing! I am so disappointed and frustrated by this book. I like that the ingredients are so elevated and I am ready for the expense, let's be real, when I wasn't vegan a Barefoot Contessa cake cost me $40 to make with all of the ingredients, so this isn't such a stretch. The coconut oil and agave appeal to me because they do not cause a spike and crash issue that can come with other baked goods. But, the recipes in this book don't work. Did they use testers? Was the book put in the hands of various people around the country before publishing so that the recipes could be tested and then corrected? I can't believe it was! All of the negative reviews make me think it is not us, it is the book.  If I were McKenna, I would feel obligated to fix this and get the correct information out there.  I recommend Vegan Cookies Invade Your Cookie Jar and the other books by Isa and Terry. I make those without any issue and am completely comfortable using a new recipe for a big event knowing that it will turn out right and tasty every time. That is what a consumer should be able to expect. I turned to McKenna's books for the ingredients, I am not in love with Earth Balance when we could be using coconut oil, but it makes a super tasty goodie and that is what I want when I am making a gift for a friend.  I need to give away the two books to the library or something- I'll leave a sticky cautioning the future user, because I keep going back to them full of hope, but am each time let down and left with a gloppy mess.
1592537251|5.0|With more than 100 sketchers contributing to this book it is just a treasure trove of sketches from around the world. Some focus on the architecture, some on the people, but all capture real places in real time. Each image has notes on the materials and time used to create it. Sprinkled throughout the book are tips from many of the artists. If you are a sketcher, or just an armchair traveler, this is a unique way to see the world not through someone's camera but through their sketchbook. I'll go back to this book again and again.

I just saw her on the Letterman show and she was fantastic.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|Though the original was a good movie, this movie is an utter failure. The film shouldn't be considered a film, but a cash in. Though the animation was quite good, it cannot save this disaster of a movie. If you want a movie to entertain your kids, try renting a classic, such as a Pee-Wee Herman movie or Looney Tunes. Trust me when I say that this is a horrible film, because it is.
080214473X|5.0|These comments are for the Simon and Schuster Audio book of  \\"Back Hawk Down\\" by Mark Bowden. This audio book consists of 4 audio cassettes with a playtime of 5 hours. Joe Morton reads the book with an introduction by author Bowden. Mr. Morton does an excellent job reading. He has the rare ability to convey terror and danger in a vocal presentation without hamming it up. He adds an almost breathless sense that you are right there in the middle of the action.<br /><br />  The events of Sunday October 3, 1993 in Mogadishu, Somalia involving the U.S Army are tragic and heart breaking. Why we were there, what were the issues, who were the enemy, is nearly lost in the fog of time - and who would want to look in that rear view mirror anyways. Who today remembers or for that matter thinks about the issues that seem so meaningless in retrospect. The cold hard facts that will never fade were that 18 servicemen died and dozens more were badly injured. The story of what happened to those men is dramatically told in this presentation.

0743297334|4.0|Having not read Hemingway since my teens (a few years ago), I decided to revisit him to see how he stood the test of time.  I chose The Sun Also Rises because I had not previously read this one.  I was disappointed. There was no discernable plot other than a group of American, English and Scottish expatriates who go on holiday with a lovely lady who they are all involved with in some way or another.  The plot consists only of an obscene amount of alcohol consumption, jealous intrique and the fiesta and running of the bulls in Pamplona, Spain, and pretty much ends as it began as far as the cast of characters are concerned.  Many authors and novels don't wear well over time so I was not surprised when I wasn't wowed by this book.  Still, Hemingway had a raw talent as a writer.  I think the reason he was so popular in the twenties is that his style was so unlike the classic authors who came before him.  He really introduced a very crisp style of writing, with limited description, and heavy on dialogue which moves his stories along.  Also, part of Hemingway's charm was, and remains, the fabulously flamboyant and handsome man he was in real life.  I would recommend reading Hemingway's A Farewell To Arms, as I recall really liking that book.  Styles, like everything else, change over time.  It's doubtful many hugely famous authors of the nineteenth and early twentieth century would wear well today, but that's not really the point. The point is being immensely relevant in your own time and that, in itself, is a giant accomplishment.  We should all be so fortunate.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|This album is the soundtrack to the movie Bjork made called \\"Dancer in the Dark\\". The movie was styled like a musical and was extremely emotional and sad.<br /><br />The music on this album however is a joy! From the beginning which starts with an instrumental, \\"Overture\\", which is a wonderful combination of stringed instruments, wood winds, and a little brass. There really is not one bad song on this album (the rest all have vocals by the way). Only 2 positive points I'd like to make:<br /><br />- Bjork fuses her own unique style with strings and horns to create this broadway musical feel in the majority of the songs without ever losing the essence of Bjork's signature style.<br /><br />- The duet with Thom Yorke on \\"I've Seen It All\\" is legendary and amazing in that these 2 talented people got the chance to create a beautiful ballad.<br /><br />Any fan of Bjork will like this, it doesn't matter if you're into her earlier or later stuff.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00005JNQS|5.0|This is the second copy of this movie that we have bought... sorry to say our first copy did not make it through our son's terrible twos, but now that he is almost four he has a better respect for \\"mom's\\" things so knowing he loved this movie it was worth buying another time.  Thanks much!

B004DLPXAO|1.0|Feedback for store only,  the reader is fine.  It can display text, congrats Amazon!<br /><br />The store is appalling however, jerry built tat.<br /><br />There is only one way to search for books.  Full text search.  This is it, there is nothing more to the store, a blob search of everything.  There is no profiling, no concept of authors, no concept of books that come in a series.  Just a plain old text search of everything.<br /><br />There is no way to list books by an author.  An author's name should be a link that brings up their books preferably most recent at the top.<br />There is no way to view books in a series, or to see the order in which they were published.  Just the blob search again<br />There is no ability to mark authors as favourite, there is nothing but the text search box.<br /><br />Listings in 'Recommended' don't even show author at all!<br /><br />Recommendations are simply list of books by authors you have bought. Simple as that.<br /><br />Buying books frequently fails for no reason, it simply tells you to go back to the page for instructions in how to purchase.  9 out of 10 attempts fail like this with no explanation.  To test out if it was a location issue, I attempted to buy the books via the website, no trouble.<br /><br />Copy and paste seem broken in all the text boxes on the web interface.  I can paste text anywhere correctly till I use this app and paste fails to work, a pain for passwords.<br /><br />That's it for the store app, back to switching on my desktop in the middle of the night to buy books.<br /><br />The store is a lazy, absolute bare minimum, least effort required piece of rubbish.  Amazon should know better.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|I've been a fan of Nicolas Winding Refn's movies for a long time. When I heard about this movie I was definitely interested and it surpassed all of my expectations. It has such a dreamlike quality to it and the cast is incredible! This is the first movie that I've seen Ryan Gosling in and he really impressed me so now I'm going to check out his other movies. I had to see it twice in the theater because I couldn't stop thinking about it after seeing it and I bought the Blu-ray the day it came out.  It's definitely not an action movie in any kind of a Hollywood sense, but since I've seen all of Refn's other movies I knew it would be different. He describes it as a fairy tale and if you look at it that way it does make sense or you can watch it pretending it's Pusher 4. I found it incredibly romantic, brutal, and beautiful.  So many quiet moments that are mesmerizing and the soundtrack is wonderful.

B004EPZ0AC|2.0|The title to this review basically just says it all.  The story of a penguin, dropped at birth, miraculously survives but becomes a dancer instead of a singer, hereby betraying his heritage.  Yet after a lengthy journey, he helps unite everybody by song and dance and everyone lives happily ever after.  This is Happy Feet 1.  Happy Feet 2 stars Mumble & his son, with his two friends, going on a trip to another land, and finding a PELICAN that other penguins worship.  He tells his story in the end without any lies, and helps save the colony from being crushed to death by the glaciers, without knowing that the undersea creatures are helping out as well.  This was NOT a proper sequel.  It had little to no dancing in it, and it was more singing and problem solving than anything else.  Sure, the youth of today have a bad education, but WHY ON GOD'S GREEN EARTH would you spend $15-20 on a single ticket for a movie that you can only see once, for help with problem solving and vocalization?  Why can't they teach that in schools?!  But the only good thing about this movie is the animation for all the penguins and other creatures to move naturally, like they would in real life.  Two stars for that alone.  Not worth buying, not worth seeing.

B0067LY4WG|5.0|Imagine immersing your mind in emotions from a haunting darkness but with a dash of light about the human condition ..and then mixing your mood with heaping dose of relaxing musical poetry that intimately enlists your mind with lasting thoughts and life recollections.  Leonard Cohen's \\"Old Ideas\\" captures your attention about facing mortality, fears, suffering, desires, watching life's moments, love, age, picking sides, erotic thoughts, guilt and the creative spirit of the human condition...  Uplifting yet dark mood shifting music and poetic lyrics probe to the depths of our earthly difficulties as people yet enable us spiritually with thoughts about the pleasures and optimism of our existence ...the mood is embellished with an angelic choir singing about the Healing of the Body and the Spirit and the Mind and Kissing and Making Love and our Relationships... the words are striking, thoughtful and the lyrical metaphors are crisp, visual and deep.  The recording is clean and well balanced with interesting sounds that caress the music and words  ...the song arrangements are simple yet eloquent and polished but tempered with edges as defined in some songs with Banjo and bluesy/country/folksy instruments and other interesting sounds in the right places.  That classical guitar sound Leonard uses as always is balanced and a link to Leonard's unique personal style.  Great percussion that is simple and unforced underscores the songs while driving them forwawrd.  ...love the horns, harmonica and clarinet punches that are sparsely unveiled muse at the right places in the songs.  Clean acoustic and electric piano, smooth organ chords and even some synth sounds that are appropriately mixed with clarity and as counterpoint that lift the singing voices.  I am amazed at the diversity of the different song arrangements and instrumentation while the whole album is completely cohesive and the song sequence feels like a logical flow where no one song is out of place.  The lead vocals are gravelly, yet steady and even electric in a laid back way -- it is amazing to me that Leonard's voice can sound so smooth and deep but rough and pointed even in the whispered tone he uses for contrast in his singing style that accents his voice while engaging our ears in a soothing manner...  Truly a memorable listening experience... I have played \\"Old Ideas\\" now 4 times and am going back again  to listen to it after I listen to some of Leonard's older music that I need to hear as a reminder of this man's reach across my life's perspectives... thank you, Leonard, Zen Buddhist Priest Master Poet--- I bow to your life and efforts!

B006UAWH2S|5.0|Confession: I will view nearly any film, no matter how badly done, with apocalyptic themes. Most are way over the top, even for an admittedly over the top, end of world genre.<br /><br />But Perfect Sense transcends the form and surprised me. It WON'T be for you if non-stop gore, suspense, and action are what you crave.<br /><br />This lovely film is as much a meditation about being human as it is a call to wake up and appreciate what we have. These messages arrive in a story about a strange illness. Symptoms include waves of sadness, followed by the loss of smell..and then other symptoms.<br /><br /> Perhaps \\"perfect sense\\" consists of coming to our senses before we truly lose them - or, at least, that is a major point I took away from this movie.<br /><br />Besides the epidemic, there is also a love story, a tumultuous attraction between a chef, Michael, and Susan, an epidemiologist. Their chemistry didn't quite click for me but this didn't take much away from the rest of the film. There is just so much worth pondering.<br /><br />I am grateful that so many of the usual and easy themes were omitted: no religious cause for the virus, no clear medical analysis. Viewers have to take events as they come and draw their own conclusions rather than being beaten over the head with a MAJOR POINT or PROFOUND MESSAGE.
B0050SYS5A|2.0|Product was set up exactly as the directions stated. For some games (Kinect Adventures and Sonic Racing) it worked pretty well but for other games (Kinect Sports 1 & 2) it was unusable. The screen was very jump and delayed. Overall I would not purchase this product again.
B0000524CY|3.0|The Exorcist is one of the most infamous and well known horror films ever made. It tells the story of Regan, a girl who suddenly exhibits strange and violent behavior. Medicine and psychiatry fail to cure her of her odd behavior after she endures test after test. Then supernatural occurrences surround Regan, including objects moving by themselves. Her mother, in desperation, asks Catholic priests for help. They believe she is possessed by the devil and decide to perform an exorcism to free her. The question is if it will actually get exorcise the demon and if so, how many of them will be alive by the end.  Regan is a 12 year old girl, on the cusp of womanhood. She's portrayed at first as a normal, innocent girl. After she is possessed, obscenities spew from her mouth as freely as her infamous green vomit and she is shown is obscenely sexual. If she had been much younger, I would have figured it was simply meant to disturb the audience by oversexualizing her in a disturbing manner and thought nothing more of it. Her age leads me to believe that Regan's budding sexuality is being repressed through this story of possession. Even her mother suspected her new behavior had something to do with puberty. When possessed, the language she uses and her attitude towards religion and society is subversive and rebellious. Regan's behavior is extreme, but teenagers are typically rebellious and push boundaries. Her sexuality is also grotesquely portrayed, directed at taboo targets, such as her own mother and the adult men who try to save her (namely doctors and priests). She maims her own body in a horrible parody of masturbation and continually hurts herself physically in other ways. This shows that her natural sexuality is something horrific and harmful for herself and everyone around her. The goal of the film is to transform Regan back into her pure, virginal state to reinstate the status quo. The patriarchal society sees female sexuality as threatening and dangerous, somethingto be suppressed.  Even Regan's mother, who seems strong and successful, is undermined through the course of the film. At the beginning of the film, she is a world famous actress who successful raised her child on her own. However, she falls to pieces in the end, powerless to save her daughter. She turns to the Catholic Church, an institution that only imbues men with power, despite being an atheist. Despite her role as a powerful woman, she can do absolutely nothing to help her daughter.  Despite my misogynistic interpretation of the film, I did enjoy the film. The acting is impeccable from the entire cast, but especially in Linda Blair as Regan. I don't think anyone who watches the film can sit undisturbed as her condition worsens and she appears as evil as the demon inside her. The effects are amazing and don't lose much of their effect even today. The makeup on Regan is incredibly creepy even though relatively small changes are made to her face. The director and actors went to great lengths and were even injured on the set in order to create real emotional responses and realistic supernatural effects. The musical score is made up of eerie modern classical music by Penderecki and portions of George Crumb's string quartet Black Angels. This music has a way of getting under your skin and enhancing the unease the film already elicits.  The Exorcist could be seen just as a good vs. evil, demonic possession film or one about forcing women to suppress their sexuality in favor of a domineering religious patriarchy. Either way, it's a very well-known and often times feared film that will live on in infamy.

1451627289|5.0|This is my old buddy Steve at his finest. I've read nearly everything he's written (I'd say 'everything' but I haven't read Danse Macabre and I may have missed another book I've forgotten about), and I've always felt he was even better when writing about people and their relationships than he was when he was writing the more horrific portions of his novels, great though they are. He has a sick mind in many ways, and I love him for that, but he also has a very compassionate and insightful mind. When the latter is at the fore, he's capable of recreating places so vividly that we, his constant readers, feel like we've lived there, peopling them with characters we care about, and putting those characters into relationships and situations that both fill and wrench our hearts.<br /><br />I don't want to give away any plotlines but suffice to say that, while this book is a thought-provoking and riveting time travel story and a very well-written piece of historical fiction, it's the romance side of the story that gives it its heart (it takes a while to kick in but be patient; it's worth it). You'll care about the characters, root for them to find happiness, clap with joy at their triumphs, and feel empty inside when tragedy strikes them. I'm not ashamed to admit I cried at the end of this book. I really wish I could share more, but I don't want to rob you of the experience. If you have a special someone, it might make you appreciate them just a little bit more. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go let my wife know how lucky I am that she's in my life.

B0034G4P94|5.0|\\"For no man ever proves himself a good man in war unless he can endure to face the blood and the slaughter, go close against the enemy and fight with his hands. Here is courage, mankind's finest possession, here is the noblest prize that a young man can endeavour to win.\\" - Spartan poem.<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />Powerful, powerful, powerful film.<br /><br />Tells the story of three members of a completely dysfunctional family. A reformed drunk and his two sons; both of whom detest their old man.<br /><br />The younger brother is Tommy, brilliantly played by Tom Hardy, a former all-state wrestling champion who fled with his mother just as he was being prepped for the Olympic Games. His older brother is Brendan, played by Joel Edgerton in a breakout performance.<br /><br />Brendan, like his younger brother, had dreams of becoming a champion but couldn't get his father to take more than a passing interest in him, even when his 'favorite' son disappeared with his mother - there was nothing left for him. With his brother and his mother gone, the old man just sank into a dark abyss filled with booze.<br /><br />Gratefully, the film doesn't get drawn into a pedestrian tale about physical abuse and alcoholism, but frames it without distortion so one can understand the pure anger the two feel toward their father. And because of one fateful decision that split the brothers apart, deep anger and boiling resentment against each other as well.<br /><br />Tommy was left in a vacuum where he learned to hate. Brendan stayed, went to college and found a new life as a school teacher.<br /><br />Fate intervenes and brings all three back together, but not in a happy kumbayah sugar circle. No, they collide at a fictional MMA tournament called 'Sparta', named after the ancient city-state which produced, what is considered by many, some of the finest warriors to have ever walked the planet, past or present. The reward for winning: $5 million dollars. For those that fall to the wayside - nothing.<br /><br />Each brother driven by completely differing purposes; each one determined to win at all cost. It's a stunningly savage and brutal confluence - a true civil war fought on multiple fronts.<br /><br />The acting was superb. The characters fully and completely developed. No weakness in either the script, cinematography, pacing, or directorship. A genuinely amazing, incredible and awe-inspriring film.<br /><br />Man, this was one bleeping powerful bleeping movie. I thought '[[ASIN:B001C5LLMI Redbelt]]' was fantastic. I see now, in comparison, it's merely very good.

B004RKXN44|5.0|Review Courtesy of Dark Faerie Tales<br /><br />Quick & Dirty: Truly animalistic. A wild and sexy read.<br /><br />Opening Sentence: 1979. The year the Psy race became Silent.<br /><br />The Review:<br /><br />Kiss of Snow is the 10th installment in Nalini Singh's Psy-Changeling paranormal romance series featuring changelings, a race of shape shifters and the Psy, a race of humanoids with the powers of the mind, telekinesis, telepathy, etc.<br /><br />I sometimes find it hard to write a review for a book so far along in a series such as this.  You see, it's kind of like soap operas.  These books feature a whole cast of characters that you have been reading about for months, all their stories are intertwined with each other.  It's difficult at times to review when so much of today's stories depend on the knowledge of yesterday's news. So for this review, I will just concentrate on the romance between Hawke and Sienna, and a bit of the general world building.<br /><br />Sienna is a Psy with a power only rumored to exist, at a level that is completely off the charts. For a woman so young, 19, she has been through a tremendous amount of tragedy in her life.  Because of her extraordinary gift, she was subject to intense experimentation from a young age, often being forced to do inexplicable, soul altering things. When the lives of her newly found pack family are on the line, she is willing to pay the ultimate sacrifice to keep them safe.<br /><br />Personally, I had to ignore the references to her age. It is hard when the heroine is the age of your niece and you really do not want to think of your niece doing things of that nature...lol. Otherwise, Sienna is a well written character, as are they all.  You really connect with her throughout the story. I admit to wanting to rail a couple of characters upside the head for her, I wanted to cry for her, pray for her.<br /><br />As for Hawke, well he can be my alpha any day. As a virile changeling male and leader of the SnowDancer pack, he is the stuff of legends, some nightmares and even the occasional daydream. Hawke has always been portrayed as tough as nails, and take no prisoners with the capacity to be sensitive and caring.  It's nice that we get to see his light and playful side as well as the side that makes you fan yourself and whisper \\"oh my.\\"<br /><br />Aside from Hawke's being such a man (please insert the requisite sarcasm and head shaking), he has always been my favorite wolf. The way he cares for the others, and even those not born wolf just gives you hope for the human race. Though, I guess he really isn't one of us, but the idea is the same. His love for Sienna also makes him willing to make the ultimate sacrifice towards the end of the book, and that dear readers, is positively unimaginable.<br /><br />Oh and on a side note, I'm so sad to find that Walker's past was such as it was, and love has given him a new lease on life.<br /><br />These stories take place in the California wilderness and the nearby city of San Francisco, with an occasional trip to South America and elsewhere. With the Psy and the changelings \\"out of the closet\\" in this case unlike in other paranormals, there is no need to hide and be secret, so we can imagine the events as if they are happening today, right in our own back yard.  It's incredibly realistic.<br /><br />Overall, this latest piece of the future Ms. Singh sees for the world she has created is as riveting as those that came before it.  She is a master at crafting scenes that get you hot and bothered. She is also great at scenes that make you tear up and the ones that have you pumping your fist in the air saying \\"take that, bad guy!\\" I read this book through twice, and could not put it down either time. Seriously, I cannot wait to see what happens next.<br /><br />The Psy-Changeling Series:<br /><br />1. Slave To Sensation<br /><br />2. Visions of Heat<br /><br />3. Caressed By Ice<br /><br />4.

B0070Z97LG|5.0|I really spent some time looking over the reviews of this one, every single one after it was just released here on Amazon.  This was to see if it was one for me to even view, as I am not usually one to enjoy this genre in general. I am so glad that I did as they are all valid for their given reasons.  First off, I'll pass on the best piece of information I acquired; Please do not look at the trailer for this.  It appears evident to me that this is marketed as an altogether horror picture with a PG-13 rating (I didn't view it thus), I just don't see it this way nor is it when you view it in its entirety. I found it smartly intriguing, especially after viewing it a couple of times.<br /><br />This movie appears to me as more a relationship story, suspenseful, a psychological thriller, and yes, horror-ish in parts.  There are quite a few added in classic horror tidbits, nothing off-putting for someone like myself who doesn't care for them necessarily.  It does carry along an undercurrent of the supernatural and you do start to question what is real and what is not.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this film and owe a lot to the reviewers for their time in writing.  If I wouldn't have read up on this film from their points of view (all of their points at the release time), I would have never watched this.  It is marketed wrongly so it could go totally unnoticed while it is a valid piece of entertainment.  A chilling account that I was enthralled with.<br /><br />Starting off with novel writer Will (Daniel Craig) leaving work and then returning home to his close-knit family.  Will's adoring wife Libby (Rachel Weisz) greets him along with their two daughters. The house is continually in a state of repair always by Libby and is something for you to be watching.<br /><br />During one night Will discovers, unbeknownst to him, that teenagers have broken into his basement so he chases them off of his property, bewildered of their motives.  Things are getting more and more confusing, they are very dangerous for his once comfortable family.  It is around this time that he meets his neighbor across the street, Ann (Naomi Watts). He seems to feel as if he may just know her more than what's apparently seen.  There is also an interesting little cameo by Jane Alexander, that first comes into view at the genesis of the story.<br /><br />I wouldn't want you to read any more than the character set-up if you already haven't had this movie tainted with spoilers or watching the trailer (Again, please abstain if possible).  One must really view this for themselves. I immediately watched it again and found that I had missed so many *tip-offs right in front of me to my surprise.  I will have to see this another time soon because I am still curious to find all of what I've overlooked.<br /><br />&quot;Dream House&quot; does boast an interesting and haunting cast that is not shy on chemistry in the two leads.  Craig and Weisz have a distinct and completely believable attraction which is now quite understandable. Along with the great acting, add Naomi Watts to this duo for one more.  There is just as much warmth, at times, to this as there are suspenseful moments and a lot of it if you have your eyes peeled all around and all of the time. These actors keep you present in the movie.  By the way, I loved the ending of which I certainly was not expecting.  It gave me a cynical smile in this taut and tightly stretched movie.sing, they are very dangerous for his once comfortable family.

B0073PPNE8|5.0|This movie is another sweeping saga of love, loss, and light in the hemorrhage of the Civil War era.  If you are a fan of this type of movies, then this is definitely for you.  The cast is particularly well thought out while it continually adds more actors as the movie plays through.  Including the appearances of; Renee Zellweger (Oscar winner), Philip Seymour Hoffman, Donald Sutherland, Kathy Baker, Natalie Portman, Jena Malone, Giovanni Ribisi, Jack White (in a particularly great acting and musical performance), and so many others that I couldn't even make room to mention them all.<br /><br />This picture brings us to Cold Mountain, North Carolina, named after the Indians who lived there first.  It is a community in itself full of friendly southern people with a colloquialism all their own.  Heavy on regional folklore and music, the town is in need of a Pastor. Enter Donald Sutherland and his devoted daughter Ada (Nicole Kidman) who quickly meet the town's people through Sally (Kathy Baker).  This meeting is on the roadside while coming into town from Charleston. Ada has the opportunity to meet Inman (Jude Law) who is helping to build the new church for the town.  All eyes are riveted on shy and demure Ada, as she appears as a porcelain doll to them.<br /><br />Inman, a man of 'few words' although with an abounding heart, is captivated by Ada as she is with him.  They meet and start a relationship that really only consists of a few meetings.  They don't share much in communication through spoken words but are able to become deeply and strongly in love with each other. As the rumors of civil war are spreading through Cold Mountain, the men and boys are readying themselves to &#34;go shoot themselves some Yankees&#34;. This is very distressing to the Pastor and especially to Ada as she knows that her beloved will leave her for war...But what of his return?<br /><br />The call is brought out while in church one Sunday morning and all men are excited as they run out, except for Inman who is trepidatious about Ada's feelings.  He reassures her and goes to his rooming house to put on his uniform while Ada brings him a book to take along. The two have exchanged their tintypes and share their first kiss while all of his fellow soldiers are shouting all around him to hurry up and &#34;kiss her for me&#34;.  With all the romance of the time, Inman goes off to war with a longing look on Ada's face which beckons him to 'Come Back To Me'...<br /><br />There is much content involved in this movie and so many things that happen in the duration of the war years.  The health of Ada's adoring father is threatening and they have just had their &#34;last cut of meat&#34;.  Ada has been raised by him to support church life and within the finery of the day.  Being a typical southern belle, she becomes isolated after letting the &#34;slaves&#34; have their freedom and refuses to hold them there. Ada is starving and in dire need of help to run the farm on her own.  She has left longing for Inman through the upcoming years never knowing if he will return, managing a farm and newly obtained life that she is ill-prepared for.  Ada is alone as the beckoning begins ...<br />&#34;Come back to me&#34; ...<br />&#34;Come back to me&#34; ...except for Inman who is trepidatious about Ada's feelings.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I thought it was fun and interesting. I liked the variety. of games and how unique they were. so over all it was a great game.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  It is filled with lots of interesting short stories from Iraq.  The author seems to be an honest person and even goes into the hardships on his family of being of SEAL.  The book has commentary from his wife and how she felt throughout his deployments.  Some of the stories are funny, some are sad but there is plenty of action.  Despite the chaos of war, his honesty, humor and personal struggle adds a human side to the story, especially the parts from his wife.  Glad to see the author made it out alive and is living life with his family.
B006BQI1V2|5.0|This movie was a successful effort to connect the pain and suffering of the Holocaust to a non-Jewish contemporary person.  In Sarah's Key, a successful journalist becomes entwined in the story and suffering of the holocaust by virtue of her family moving into an apartment that was formerly the home of Jewish tenants in 1942.  These tenants were taken by force and moved first to a stadium for staging, then to a holding camp and finally to a death camp.  The journalist's father-in-law grew up in the apartment and a secret has been kept about what exactly happened when the Jewish family was taken from their home.  The journalist, originally working on the story about French police assisting Nazi occupiers, becomes personally involved when she discovers that a young girl living in the apartment may still be alive.  It becomes her mission to find her and talk to her.  The journalist seems to be looking for some redemption or reconciliation for her family for any abetting that her extended family may have been involved in.  The director deftly flashes back to the historical incidents, from the ouster of the family to their terrible journey to the various camps.  While pursing this project, the journalist discovers she is pregnant.  Her husband, who is middle aged and at a key point in his career, finds the pregnancy terribly inconvenient and wants the wife to abort.  This conflict over life vs. abortion is thus juxtaposed and serves as a background tension to the issues of life and death attached to the story of the Jewish family and the little girl in that family, Sarah.  The film is enveloped in drama that deals with issues of life and death, reconciliation and redemption as well as sacrifice and risk.  It is well worth watching to experience how these issues can come to the fore in various events, both personal and historical.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|I took my small child to see this film and it entertained neither of us. Complete rubbish DO NOT BUY AT ALL COSTS
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|I wouldn't spend single dime on this movie, i found it terrible and very bland. If you are looking for a better movie you are better off with something not....lame.
0385342063|4.0|First Impression:<br /><br />I don't usually read chick lit... but when I do... it has to be Sophie Kinsella.<br /><br />While Reading:<br /><br />Sadly, in the case of my first Sophie Kinsella experience, I cannot remember what came first: the book or the movie. Either way, once I was exposed to Sophie Kinsella and her wonderful writing, I was hooked. I've Got Your Number was no exception.<br /><br />Our story starts off with the naive, but lovable Poppy. Having lost her engagement ring and shortly there after having her cell phone stolen, she thinks that her life cannot get much worse. When she strangely enough finds another cell in a trash bin, she thinks all her prayers have been answered. But life is never that simple.<br /><br />I've Got Your Number is filled with cute moments that made me smile and laugh along the way. While the book is filled with predictability, it never once hindered my reading experience. Poppy is a likable character that you cannot help but like. I admired her strange determination to help a stranger, although she did get something out of the agreement, the cell phone. Sam, the aloof business man, was a nice contrast to Poppy. A little overly serious, but deep down a good man. Was not too fond of Magnus, Poppy's fiancee, but I think that was kind of the point.<br /><br />Verdict:<br /><br />While Sophie Kinsella's books all seem to have a lot in common (same types of heroines, adventures leading up to a happily-ever-after ending, etc.), they are like candy. I can never seem to stay away. I've Got Your Number is a cutesy, romantic novel that is like a special escape. I've Got Your Number definitely lived up to the expectations that I have for a Sophie Kinsella book. It left a smile on my face and me with a warm fuzzy feeling.
B006ZS81GG|5.0|This is a simply stunning new album from Lana Del Rey with so much passion and pure emotion. This is my new favorite album for sure and will be in the mix for a very long tine. I love her old school classic look that is just so beautiful and sexy. This is a nice mix of Portishead meets Nancy Sinatra.  Trust me and get this album now!
B003TJR2HS|5.0|Works like a charm!  So the product is great, no REAL issues with the device or the design, just a couple of thoughts really...I wish it weren't so tall.  Also, I wish the bottom of the adapter (which plugs into the iPod dock) would actually mechanically connect to the dock, so that when you pull the iPod or iPhone from the adapter, the adapter would stay connected to the dock (by having some sort of mechanism that you could squeeze on the sides of the adapter, when you wanted to remove the actual adapter itself from the dock, which is RARELY in my experience).  I come home at night, and before bed, I connect my phone to the adapter, which is already connected to the dock.  I get up in the morning, and I pull my phone off, and when I do, sometimes the adapter will come with it...<br /><br />Thank you!!<br /><br />Justin
B000PC0U1W|4.0|i just bought this movie, it's one of the greatest movies of all time.  to everyone who's disregarding this movie as pure fiction, you guys really need to wake up.  our country is turning into what this movie projects, if we don't wake up we'll be living in nazi germany.  SPOILER ALERTTT!!! DON'T READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT THE ENDING RUINED!!!!!!!!!!!.  the only part that's fiction in this movie is the ending, the fact is one person will not be able to take down an entire government.  STOP believing everything the mainstream media shoves down our throats. WAKE UP! if the masses don't wake up this movie WILL become a reality.
B006T5FDLG|5.0|Great EP!  Too bad the four songs were not included on the original 2008 release.  It would have made an already kick a$$ album even better.  Looking forward to the next album.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is one of the best apps for keeping my life together. I use it for taking notes at work, travel checklists, gift ideas, etc. the uses are endless.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|I absolutely Love this. It works exactly like they said it would. It is just what I was looking for. It was not complicated at all. In fact everything about it is very easy to use and understand. I wish I would have bought one a long time ago.
B00127RAJY|3.0|Update: Not good for bad knees, ankles and wrists. I thought I could build up to these exercises, but I'm sticking to low impact mat workouts. Giving it 3 stars because I have friends who use this DVD who think it's awesome, but they have normal joints, apparently...<br /><br />I'm a Tracy Anderson fan but I don't always have a full hour to devote to a mat workout! So this week I'm seeing how only working out for half the time works out for me...<br /><br />I bought this because the workouts are 20 minutes or so long--I love getting in cardio and toning done in half an hour, and I do feel like it's been working (ie, I'm sort of in pain--in a good way--on day 6!). Aesthetically the video looks sort of old school, and Jillian says silly things, but I think she's really motivational, has great cuing, and it's awesome for getting in a quick workout.<br /><br />PS: A lot of lunges and jumping, so if you have bad knees and/or a bad back you may want to take it easy in the beginning.
B005BHNCO8|5.0|Great quality product. I tried my new YN560 on this equipment right out of the box. Fits like glove. Nice carrying case. The umbrellas feel sturdy and appear to be well made; nice material & weight. Your flash will be mounted properly and the aim is toward the center of the umbrella. The stands are air-cushioned as described, but not so much that you cannot speed up the dismount. Completely impressed with the quality of this buy!
B004EPZ0AM|1.0|Saw this movie with my mom. Hated it! NEVER SEE IT! ITS AWFUL! WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY! It was like the first one but with newer characters!

B004EPZ0AC|1.0|The first one was, unfortunately #2 just couldn't live up to it's predecessor.  I don't recommend anyone buying this movie.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Love this product as it looks like a classic book. It feels like an old friend instead of a cold hard reader. It has been extremely hard for me to give up my books and although I am still grieving this cover is helping me with transition and like I said it makes me look smart.
1439192812|5.0|Well I was pleased with the book.  Very well written though a little condescending.  Probably aimed at Children over age 8 is my guess.  But still well written.  Anyway what I did not like was that it was just stuck in a cardboard mailer and arrived damp on my doorstep.  It had snowed the day before and so some dampness seeped in.  Not badly.  So I suggest to the mailer to insert future books into a zip-lock plastic bag of some sort.  Most of the other books I've gotten through Amazon had ben wrapped in some kind of plastic.    Sincerely,  Jim Zivic

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I LOVE THESE BOOKS. After reading the first I was thrilled to find there was a sequel, and then another, leading to a whole series! Reading these took me on an emotional ride, rooting for Juliette, Lucas and all of Mechanical! Definitely one of my new favorite series, and I'm going to recommend them to everyone!! I'M IN LOVE WITH the story, and can't wait for more to come! :)

B000BVMAJ2|4.0|The animals in this duplo set are fun to play with.  Your child can create a grassland for the giraffe, an icy river for the polar bear, a plant/refuge for the tiger, and the zoo keeper (female) can ride the elephant. This is the perfect addition to [[ASIN:B000SI9Y6A LEGO Duplo My First Set (5416)]], as the animals and extra blocks fit well in the tub. This set has 18 pieces in it.  Two flowers, the four animals pictured, one female figurine, one tall grass, and the other 10 pieces are 5-2x2 blocks and 5-4x2 blocks.<br /><br />If the current seller is asking for more than $10.00, it may be worth purchasing right from Lego.com (exception for shipping).<br /><br />My little boy and I are both pleased with the Ville Baby Zoo Duplo set.  The only reason I mark it at four stars instead of five is that the animals don't seem as durable as standard lego blocks (still high quality tho) and my son doesn't seem to enjoy it anymore than the standard lego blocks (and it seems like specialty sets should be more fun). Still, plenty glad we have it.
B004UXUX4Q|3.0|Matt King's (George Clooney) wife Elizabeth has been in a coma in the hospital for almost four weeks. She was involved in a boating accident. Also, Matt, one of several descendants of a Hawaiian princess, is the sole trustee of a family trust that controls over 25,000 acres of untouched land on the island of Kaua'i. Matt must decide for his family what is to be done with the land. At the same time, he's given the news that his wife will never recover and she has a living will, so all the machines will soon be unplugged and she will slowly die. So, Matt has to contact his in-laws and all of his wife's friends and notify them of his wife's impending death so that they can say farewell. In addition, Matt is getting used to raising his daughters, 10-year-old Scottie (Amara Miller) and 17-year-old Alex (Shailene Woodley) by himself. In the midst of all of this, Matt learns that his wife was having an affair for the past two years and decides to find Elizabeth's lover and inform him that she's dying so he can say farewell. Thus begins a mini-journey with his children (and a tag-a-long friend of his daughter, Alex) that brings his family closer together.<br /><br />The film has some really beautiful scenic shots, but when you're filming in Hawaii, that's not too difficult. The movie also features the finest performance of George Clooney's career. Even though Clooney has starred in lots of tv and film, he's best known for his good looks and comic ability (see O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU) and hasn't had many opportunities to display his range as an actor. THE DESCENDANTS gives him plenty of opportunities. It's his best role to date.<br /><br />THE DESCENDANTS also features the breakout performance of Shailene Woodley. Woodley is a young actress who hasn't had much exposure but THE DESCENDANTS will be her springboard to stardom. She displays the depth of emotion of a person who has lived several lifetimes.<br /><br />Beyond the fine acting, THE DESCENDANTS really doesn't offer much. Directed and co-written by Alexander Payne, the film has been nominated for and won all kinds of awards and has been listed on numerous critic's \\"Best Of 2011\\" lists. I think the main reason for this is because this is an Alexander Payne movie. Make no mistake, Payne is a talented director. I loved ELECTION and SIDEWAYS and even though I find ABOUT SCHMIDT incredibly depressing, it's also fascinating. However, THE DESCENDANTS lacks the life and personality that make those movies so interesting. There are a few really funny scenes in the movie (I don't know why, but watching Clooney run is hilarious), but there's nothing outstanding hilarious. Close to a third of the movie is told in voice-over from King. I don't have an issue with voice-over, but you can't overuse it and it has to be done correctly. THE DESCENDANTS abuses the voice-over. Also, the movie has way too many close-up shots. I realize that it's done for affect, but like the voice-over abuse, the close-up is used way too much in the movie. However, even putting these technical abuses aside, THE DESCENDANTS isn't good movie because it's really not that interesting of a story. The audience is glad to see how things turn out in the end, but it's almost an afterthought. I was looking forward to seeing THE DESCENDANTS, but much like the way I felt after seeing THE SOCIAL NETWORK in 2010 my reaction at the end of the movie was, \\"That's it?\\"<br /><br />There's some great acting in THE DESCENDANTS, but overall the movie is a tale, \\"full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.\\"uch.

1592537251|5.0|I got this book a few days ago and have been reading and re-reading, looking and re-looking, each page. I find the information shared about each drawing- the methods, materials, and time to complete- valuable as a reference and as an indication of how much variation there is between each artist.  In the copy I got, the bold title for the section with drawings about New York City is missing. Just a note for future editions. Does not detract from the book at all.

B00000IMTF|5.0|After the debut of Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow had been issued, the time began for Ritchie to truly express himself the way he saw fit, having freedom as a solo artist per se, and Rising is truly a definitive statement and my favorite Rainbow disc overall. Even though the tracklisting is short and clocks in a little over a half-hour's worth of recording tape, the songcrafts and performances are nothing short of extraordinary and compelling. After sacking what was left of Ronnie James Dio's former group Elf, once the debut album had been finished and released, Blackmore set about recruiting some major players and his choices of Cozy Powell(drums), Tony Carey(keys) and Jimmy Bain(bass) are inspired and most wise as everyone involved in this recording is their own virtuoso within their respective instrument roles, but also blend very well as a recording unit in the process.<br /><br />Stargazer is one of the best tracks Blackmore and co. have ever done, in my opinion and it also provided a space for the musicians to translate this number live with long improvisations within the shows that were done during this time period. Tarot Woman opens the disc on a powerful note and it sets the tone correctly for the record with Dio's ethereal-like lyrics of mystery and magic. Run with the Wolf follows and is a mid-paced rocker which is propelled by the powerful kit playing of Powell and the cutting rhythms of Blackmore's melody along with the solid backing of Bain's bass lines; Dio's voice is such a presence to behold within this record and its no wonder he would soon rise to prominence as a solo artist with great success in the mid-80's. Starstruck recalls a bit of the groovin rockier sides of Blackmore's former group, Deep Purple, and is an entertaining number which fills out the record and gives a lighter balance musically, although the lyrics decribe the obsessions of a groupie, its quite a groover, nonetheless.<br /><br />Do You Close Your Eyes is also another chugging rip-roaring rocker that would also be stretched out for Blackmore to show off his prodigious guitar skills in the live performances and along with Starstruck, it provides a little more upbeat feel within the confines of the album. A Light in the Black, which follows Stargazer and is the record's closing number, is another longer track that further displays the power of the ensemble and shows off band dynamics and interaction to a most great and successful advantage. With each successive release, band members would come and go, frequently, and it would alter sometimes the sounds of the records that were released, but for a musician like Blackmore, variety is the spice of life; and that statement alone describes the genius and talent of the man as he could hire players of enormous talents with famed pedigrees like Cozy Powell, or take on virtual unknowns such as Joe Lynn Turner and later, they would rise to success of their own accord because of the Blackmore association. That, in itself, is also another point in fact. 5 starswould also be stretched out for Blackmore to show off his prodigious guitar skills in the live performances and along with Starstruck, it provides a little more upbeat feel within the confines of the album.

B001LRJH0U|4.0|First of all, let me declare that this is a GREAT movie. It is a classic Western buddy film that harkens back to the gritty Westerns of the 70's where films were shot on location, actors were not afraid to look unflattering on camera, and authenticity ruled. Which is why I have one big problem with this movie. Why does every time a gun is fired in this film it sounds like when I used to play with cap guns as a kid? For a film made with such attention to period detail, this is the most unrealistic sounding gunplay I have ever seen on screen. No matter what the characters are shooting- whether it is Virgil's Colt revolver or Everett's 8 gauge shotgun- they all sound the exact same- like toy guns. How can this be overlooked in a Western, for pete's sake? Which brings me to the other point. Different guns have a very unique sound to them, and the difference between a shotgun blast and a revolver is tremendous. But not here. Which makes it confusing in a gunfight, too, because you cannot tell who is firing based on the sound of the gunshot. All the shots sound the same. This is so annoying in a movie that is so excellent. MY hope is that some day someone will take the time to go back and remaster the souund of this film and make the shooting sound as authentic and real as the movie itself.

0061777269|4.0|This book is the result of a scientist, a medical doctor in the field of cardiology.  Naturally, writing for his peers he does not speak of philosophy or metaphysics, or those things which address \\"why are we here\\" and \\"what is the origin of our lives\\".  Rather, he presents a rational and realistic look at the NDE, at non-local consciousness (and yes it DOES EXIST) and even quotes the brilliant Rupert Sheldrake by discussing Sheldrake's concept of \\"morphic resonance\\" (DNA, heredity and consciousness). Sheldrake is a ground breaker in this area and for any studying non-local consciousness and the entanglement scenario MUST read Sheldrake.  And I quote (p. 297):<br /><br />\\"Consciousness is the nonlocal repository of all past experience.  The reception of information from nonlocal space rests on our free will (intention), attention, and the state of our (waking) consciousness.  In all probability,our person-specific DNA has given the different manifestations of our consciousnesses, such as waking consciousness and the individual subconscious, their different places of resonance, both in the brain and in other cell systems, each with an individual access code comparable to a private phone number.  There is also a universal or collective human consciousness that links each individual human being with everything in existence or everything that ever was or will be, and this happens vie the universal-human DNA shared access code.  This is comparable to an international access code.  This universal-human access code (DNA) differs from that of animals and plants......Each part is linked nonlocally with the whole.\\"  Indeed.<br /><br />THIS from a SCIENTIST, no less.  Quantum Physics is forcing the materialist mind of science to change direction.  The fact that consciousness is ubiquitous CAN NO LONGER BE DENIED any more than we can deny the fact that the earth revolves around the sun (which was once considered a heretical concept!)  I find in these pages things I've known since very early childhood: everything is conscious.  Everything is connected.  Everything is retained in the \\"universe\\" - all memory, every second, every thought - and consciousness after physical death is PROVABLE (he cites the case of Pam Reynolds which, as far as I'm concerned, absolutely proves consciousness survives death.)<br /><br />There are two words missing from this treatise and of course I'm not at all surprised by this.  After all, a scientist wrote it.  One of those words is AWE.  The universe is an extremely complex organism where the macrocosm reflects the microcosm, where chaos results in in order and vice versa, where every vacuum is FULL of potential, where there is NO darkness (photons are found in the blackest of black places in space).  Dr. van Lommel makes a very important point when he discusses \\"harvesting\\" organs from patients who are \\"brain dead\\".  THEY REQUIRE GENERAL ANESTHESIA FOR THIS PROCEDURE and there ARE cases of \\"brain dead\\" patients reviving.  So, then, WHAT IS DEATH and what is the morality of such \\"harvesting\\"?  If a man is dead, why would he require general anesthesia to remove his heart and why would his body register elevation in blood pressure, heart rate, etc. during the procedure?  Why, indeed.  Our understanding of death, and our understanding of life, must be of great sorrow to the next three letter word that does not appear in this treatise:  GOD.<br /><br />Dr. von Lommel, discussing consciousness and nonlocal space, says, \\".....consciousness has a primary presence in the universe, and all matter possesses subjective properties or consciousness.  In this view, consciousness is nonlocal and the origin or foundation of everything: all matter, or physical reality is sahped by nonlocal consciousness.  There is no longer any distinction between nonlocal space and consciousness.  This is not a new insight.  As far back as the seventeenth century, Newton held that the omnipresent space might be filled with a 'spiritual substance'; he called space the 'divine observatory.'\\"<br /><br />Divine, indeed.

B004EPZ0AC|1.0|I was amazed by how bad this movie was. I watched it with my little cousin who will normally watch anything. She practically started to cry. I would not reccomment.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|it's a cool app when I get bored, like someone else it would make a great screensaver. I like these free apps.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|There are a lot of games to choose from and it is pretty easy to unlock the games. It is a good way to waste time when you are bored.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun games to pass time!  Kids enjoy playing this just as much as the parents do. Different than other apps being you have various options.
B004EPZ07K|5.0|I think this movie's not been given a fair shake. I totally loved this movie. In fact, it's my favorite super-hero movie.<br /><br />I'm a huge Green Lantern fan. I've been on board since Geoff Johns brought back Hal Jordan. This movie fits in perfectly with the Johns revival.<br /><br />Give this movie a chance and I bet you'll have a lot of fun watching it.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|I absolutely love this app! If I had known about it I would have gladly paid for it. As an aspiring physicist I find it very entertaining and quite fun to try to make all kinds of shapes and designs with the &quot;galaxies&quot;. Great work!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is a great app for anyone who needs to take notes and have them available on a multitude of devices.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|This is an awesome app, the only thing i hope to see is an update to make it a live wallpaper, please take the time to make this a live wallpaper.
0062082353|1.0|This book is a big disappointment. Poorly written, but no disguising the fact that this guy is a real psychopath.  Don't buy it.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|Fun time killer.  Very soothing to play with.  Also good for distracting children.  Worth the 1.99 normal price.  Would be great of it had a randomized wallpaper.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I was pleasently surprised at how well the &quot;AI&quot; functioned. I'm a pretty good player and iv only bested it once or twice. great app! but not quite perfect. my only problem is it always seems to be on the same difficulty setting. its always really smart. which is a good thing I suppose.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|Save your money for something else.  Playing a game with my kids would have been a better use of time.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|VERY SOOTHING. You will enjoy relaxing with this game. This is a great game to play in the evening before bed time.
B004EPZ0AM|1.0|The fist one was good, but this one is just an excuse to make money. Is basically the same movie. Just check the reviews.
B0068TL23G|5.0|This game is smart and fun. I love that you really have to put some thought into it at times. It was easy to understand, lots and lots of levels and mazes. I really enjoyed this game have been playing it over and over. Addictive, clever and fun.
B006NFKUF6|5.0|Fun awesome game that is so freaking addicting need to act fast or u will get hit love it so much
630463949X|2.0|The concert was good. The VIDEO RECEPTION AND AUDIO IS VERY POOR!  I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED!  I think I was given a FAKE/KNOCKED-OUT DVD from China!
B006E4QCXU|1.0|maybe I missed something, but I really didn't see the point of this.  The only thing this app does is allow you go manipulate a bunch of white dots (stars).  I guess that is fun for some, just not for me.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is one of the best book series I've ever read. Completely engrossing, unable to put it down, a page-turner, really, really brilliant.  The first ten pages or so I was wondering what the fuss was. By page 20 or so I was completely engrossed, and after that I was a goner.  I'm recommending this to all my friends and giving my wife the weekend \\"off\\" to read it while I take care of the kids and the house.  I can't say enough good things about it. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|This was an incredible movie!  Directed by Nicholas Winding Refn and starring Ryan Gosling, Carey Mulligan, Albert Brooks, Christina Hendrick's, Ron Perlman, Bryan Cranston and Oscar Isaac.  This movie takes place in the seedy underbelly of LA. and stars Ryan Gosling as Driver, a professional stunt car driver by day and getaway driver by  night.  When he meets his next door neighbor a lonely single mother named Irene, Carey Mulligan, he discovers a bit of humanity in himself in a town void of it.  When Irene's husband returns home from prison Driver gets embroiled in a tangled web of mob money and gangland brutality to help protect the women he now discovers he's in love with. Not only was the movie stylistically shot, the soundtrack was beautiful bringing back a hint of retro 80s sounds.  LOVED this movie!!! Gosling should have been up for an oscar for this!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game keeps me and my friends occupied for hours!it has a great variety of games.just so fun to play!
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|This movie is terrible. Please make yourself a favor and look somewhere else for entertainment. I'll never buy a movie again without checking out the reviews before.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|i don't know why but i like this very much. Ot really is relaxing and fun. Takes up only a small space on my Fire.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|yeah thats about it. would be a lot better as a live wallpaper given its simplicity. You can change the color, but multi color only applies if you are manipulating the stars and fades to white otherwise.<br />not much of a point to it otherwise. amusing for the first like two minutes when i first installed.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|This movie really sucked and was a big big waste of my time. Just don't watch it and you'll do yourself a favour.
B0045I6X90|5.0|This CD is one of the best I've ever owned!!!  Of course it doesn't hurt that Burlesque is my favorite movie & Christina is now my favorite singer.  Shes has such a wonderful voice & it comes through great on this CD.  I would reccommend this to anyone who likes music.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|Both the American film \\"let me in\\" , (Blu-ray : 2010)), and the Swedish film it was a remake of, \\"let the right one in\\", (DVD: March 10, 2009),  are best understood as diverging branches of the book \\"Låt den r&auml;tte komma in\\" by John Ajvide Lindqvist and translated into English by Ebba Segerberg as \\"let the right one in\\".<br /><br />On a superficial level the American film is a sequel of the Swedish film streamlined and made more pretty and simple of point for American audiences. On that level the American film with Chloe Moretz as \\"Ally\\" and Kody Smit-McPhee as Owen is a motivationally reprehensible but nevertheless surprisingly successful sequel.<br /><br />But if you understand the basic reality behind the book you can look at both pictures as taking it in different directions in a way that makes them both meaningful in entirely different ways.<br /><br />To understand what you're watching you have to think about 3 metaphors.<br /><br />1st, think of the universe is an avalanche of overwhelming situations in which little tiny creatures like human beings are but pebbles in the machinery of inevitable cause and effect.<br /><br />2nd, think of heartless mother nature in which every creature is justified by the way mother nature is designed that creature to survive. There is no such thing as nice or wrong and simply following your biological imperative.<br /><br />And the 3rd thing is to understand that if we are lucky and have a little space in our life where we have enough to eat and we are in a place where we have the leisure to develop friendships based on tender emotions and altruism then we live in it like gold fish in a bowl. Such kindness is an accident in the universe and in his brief and so you must enjoy it for what it is, a meaningless glitch of light in darkness.<br /><br />The reality of Eli (Lina Leandersson) in the book in Swedish movie, and alley as she is called the American film, is that she was a little child murdered by a vampire when she was 12 years old some 200 years previously. She has no sex drive, none of her body organs or brain or any social processes will ever come to her that she didn't already have a 12. She has lived by feeding on people and it must've destroyed several thousand innocent lives over the years.<br /><br />In all 3 portrayals of that girl is understood that she is grooming the new boy to replace the old man in her life. The likelihood that after 200 years of killing the special charm of meeting a new young boy is not likely to have awakened her little heart so long conditioned by killing. A sweetness on her part can only be a cold-blooded manipulation.<br /><br />This is where I think the American movie is more truthful even if it trims more of the story and the context away. The Chloe Moretz version of \\"Alley\\" is a girl who was always watching your eyes to see if you are buying the lie.<br /><br />On the other hand, Lina Leandersson version of \\"Eli\\" is given the many scenes in which she is shown as being genuinely sweet and responsive. I believe this is an intentional misdirection by the director in Sweden. He said in the extras on the DVD that he had no political ideas when making the film. That means that he jettisoned most of the writer's own context for the story. In short, Tomas Alfredson wanted to make a cautionary tale about violence and parental apathy but mostly a timeless Romeo and Juliet story of preteen love. He succeeded. The music and the romance works even though it is an intentional lie. The better film is actually an intentional misdirection.<br /><br />Perhaps because an American film remake has such low expectations the American director Matt Reeves felt he could tell the harsher story. But it's ironic that the nature of the boy actor as a film presence made the love story even though was a lie a tragedy. The boys knew he was going to grow up to be that other guy. Oscar in the Swedish film really was serial killer in utero. That tragic aspect of the sweetness without illusion presented by Kody Smit-McPhee I think made the relationship deeper because it was so self-consciously a human being going all the way with lying to themselves without being fooled for a moment.<br /><br />It is maybe a rush to judgment to say that the Swedish film was better, when in one important core way it said what the book said about life.<br /><br />That little girl is mother nature.

B0067LY4WG|4.0|Leonard Cohen emerges like a specter from the shadows to deliver one of this young year's finest new albums.  There really are few artists in Cohen's league and the haunting and mesmerizing hymns on this masterful work serve as a reminder of that very fact.  There is not a wasted moment on Old Ideas and each listen merely compels one to go back and listen to the whole thing again in order to absorb all of the poetic lyrics, subtle melodies and distinctive imagery that Cohen has weaved together so beautifully.<br /><br />Surrounded by simple yet rich arrangements, Cohen uses his distinct and weathered voice to deliver songs dealing with love, loss, longing, regret sorrow and salvation.  He moves through these various themes with a grace and ease that belies his 77 years.  Relligious imagery is abundant as well but Cohen is more concerned with spirituality and the healing of hearts and minds than he is with organized relligion.<br /><br />Who knows how long it will be before Leonard Cohen turns up again but until that time, he has provided a wonderful album full of passion and fervor that a lot of artists half his age would have trouble equalling.  This is truly an album to be savored.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love the Bible app. I have it on my kindle fire and its better than buying a Bible from the books because this is FREE!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a wonderful app for those beginning to read the Bible and don't know where to begin or for a more practiced Bible reader that is looking for specific topics covered in the Bible.  All the different versions of the Bible are great too!!
B006E4QCXU|5.0|I love this app! it is one of my favorite apps on my kindle fire. it works really good. you will not be disappointed with this app!!!!
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is Amazing. I have it on my kindle fire and it works great...... a great time waster. would recommend to any one!!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Loved the movie, the characters and storyline were very true to the book, not as much detail naturally. I'm glad I read the book first.
B00425S1H8|5.0|Right out of the box, with no CD/DVD install, I was able to see my network appliance via COM5. In this instance, the Cisco ASA5505, I was able to serial right in. If you're familiar with the ASA, I have this connected to another cable. I'm using a Samsung RF510 laptop on Windows 7. For the price and dependability, this item is great.
B004LWZW8S|1.0|This movie was worse than Clash of the Titans and it looked like the director tried to imitate some cut scenes from the God Of War video game series. Mickey Rourke was more of a pain in the rear than a show stealer. I was expecting more from the producers of 300. It looks like they just got lazy. I say rent this before you buy.
B0040UAYI4|5.0|This item does work well but I did notice that if it isn't switched to \\"Setting 1\\" when the PS3 is turned on then it won't detect it. (Remember what keyboard button you set as the Playstation sync button! You have to sync it just like any other PS3 controller.) Sometimes it does simply mess up and disconnect, but maybe only once every 40 hours of game play. This is most likely a PS3/Game issue, not due to the Eagle Eye though.<br /><br />I'm using it for COD (I have every version) with the Logitech G500 mouse (on the highest dpi setting all the biggest weights installed). You will have to adjust your customized settings in the game, the Eagle Eye, and mouse for days to get it where it fits you best. The uploaded settings on their website by other users are ridiculous, placing keyboard buttons way too far apart to play any game. I will be uploading my custom settings to their website soon once they are refined to perfection. The cable is a good length, I've got a 50 inch screen with the Tritton AX. These ($160) earphones have a shorter cable by a couple feet, but the Eagle eye is super long... I don't know what customers were complaining about... Add the keyboard and mouse cables and now it ends up being 9 feet long, at least 3 feet more than you should ever need?! 4 feet is enough.<br /><br />With the DPI on 5700 for the mouse and the Max speed setting maxed out on the Eagle Eye settings the movements are exactly like those of a computer, but using a 300-600dpi wireless mouse ($5) and/or with the max speed restricted, the movements are jumpy, 'knocking' into positions about 6 times per second. YOU HAVE TO FIND A GOOD COMPATIBLE MOUSE AND SET THE EAGLE TO MAX SPEED! You can always where the sensitivity in the game down to a 3 to slow it down after that.<br /><br />All 10 keyboards I have work but of the 5 mice I had only 1 worked, my cheapest wireless one imported from China... so I had to go out and buy the G500 to make the games playable.<br /><br />Clearly the price makes this a steal, other similar products are over $100. Other integrated mouse-like PS3 controllers aren't adjustable enough to recreate PC like mouse movements. The only major flaw I saw is that after saving the sensitivity settings (in game using the F1 F2 F3 etc. keys), when connecting it to the PC I could not pull the settings off of the Eagle Eye back into Windows 7 64, it locked up my PC for all but 1 of the some odd 10 or more times I tried. (Had to CTRL-ALT_DEL to close the program.) Fortunately 1 pull was enough, and they matched the website sensibility settings uploaded for BLOPS exactly, so there is really no need to keep testing them again since if you don't change your mouse, these will stay the same.<br /><br />I am using the same setup for both Uncharted (all versions) and Call of Duty (all versions). So far they work great, have completed from start to finish all versions (and prestige'd in all) fairly easy in just 1 month of gaming. If you are taking advantage of the cheap new/used/old games for the PS3 as an alternative to the long list of expensive/incompatible PC games out there (PC games that are also easily hacked) then THE EAGLE EYE IS NOT OPTIONAL! YOU MUST HAVE THIS IF YOU HATE GAME CONTROLLERS LACK OF SENSITIVITY SETTINGS AS MUCH AS I DO!!! Once you've learned to adjust the settings properly you'll same a ton of money by getting used/older games for the PS3 instead of going the pricey PC route, so the cost for this item, no matter how cheap/expensive really becomes irrelevant.<br /><br />This is an excelling gaming investment for a PC-Mouse gamer going to the PS3!<br />(if you have enough PC knowledge to navigate the fairly simple software instructions properly)ducts are over $100.

B005JLN9Z8|5.0|\\"Balls Out\\" by Steel Panther could be called the greatest rock album of all time. These guys are keeping hair metal alive and kicking. Although their 2 albums are categorized as \\"comedy\\", \\"Balls Out\\" is as serious as rock n roll can get. With crunching riffs, heavy rhythm, and screaming vocals, \\"Balls Out\\" makes you want to put on your leather, tease up the hair, throw on the make up and crank it up to eleven!!!
B006E4QCXU|4.0|Its fun and great on the kindle fire but I just cant see myself playing with it for two minutes. Still worth getting though.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|Saw this movie and my feet were not happy. What a waste of time and money. Do not but this or rent it, you will want your time back.
B000SEIDR0|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, both as entertainment and brain food.  MP is a terrific writer with a very natural, conversational style.  He seems to approach the complex topic of where our food comes from in an honest, direct way without lecturing or idealizing. I've been questioning every food decision I've made since reading it.
B006E4QCXU|1.0|does not load waste of money do not buy for 2dollers cheesy stupid dumb hate it to stupid I have been trying for one day to install
B006E4QCXU|5.0|this is a awesome app. I love all of the options you can do, and the color change. its relaxing. I found myself playing with this app for a while. :))
0312641893|5.0|I don't read a lot of young adult books, I guess I just prefer middle grade and younger.  However, when I heard about this book, I knew I had to read it.  The premise was so unique that I was intrigued. I was delighted to discover that the book lived up to its hype.  Not only  is the story well told, but the characters are interesting and easy to relate to, despite the fact that Cinder is part machine, I found it easy to care about her and her struggles.  I liked how Meyer made Prince Kai very human with flaws and emotions and struggles.  I appreciated how Meyer made it clear that being a ruler is not fun and games and carries very real burdens with it.  He seemed very much like a normal young man placed in very extraordinary circumstances.  There were a couple of things that weren't as well done as they could have been. For example, Meyer foreshadows a major plot point fairly early in the book, but I enjoyed reading about Cinder and her struggles with her identity so much that it didn't bother me very much.  Also, Queen Levana and her entourage (all evil, all the time) as well as Kai's advisor seemed a bit one dimensional, I didn't have a problem with Levana's desire to conquer Earth.  Our real world has after all seen many with the same desire.  It would have been nice to get more detailed glimpses of the culture that Cinder lives in and just why cyborgs are so despised.  The story is supposed to take place in a future Asia, but there isn't really a strong Asian flavor to the book.  However, despite the few flaws, I did really enjoy reading this and highly recommend it to those who enjoy a little science fiction with their retold fairy tales.
B0061JPYX2|5.0|This album is so precious to me because they're songs we probably wouldn't normally get to hear. Rarely would you get songs so raw from an album, it's sort of like behind the scenes. As an artist I can honestly say that an artist's studio space, sketchbook, and \\"mistakes\\" are just as valuable as anything they will ever create. That's why I love the little commentaries after tracks, so personal. Whether you thought she was off key, songs were the same, or even sounded terrible it shouldn't really affect what you feel about this lovely lady's music. \\"Lioness: Hidden Treasures\\" is just another piece of work of Amy's that we're so special to receive and whether you think it was good or bad, just remember she was only human.
B005KTZ05G|5.0|Beautifully detailed! Ordered one as a gift for a friend, who was pleasantly surprised and excited to add it to her collection of other Assassin's Creed figures. I would definitely order one again. The figure is sturdy and the joints are not loose, so it's perfect to pose (within reason, though). As I mentioned before, the detail on the face is fantastic and does not look 'derp' as my friend put it. Overall, it is a quality figure.
B005HV6YO8|5.0|Great group of Sting from various times in his career.  Lots of old favorites which makes the CD fun to listen to because you have most likely heard the songs before and it reminds you how much you liked them then and can still enjoy them now.
1451648537|5.0|Absolutely worth the read. Insights into Steve Jobs, Apple, Greatness, Simplicity, Focus and Life. Likely one of the most accurate biographies written about someone who will be remembered with the likes of Edison.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|Very neat and a definite time waster. Would be great if there was an option to take a snapshot, maybe set it as device background too.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Works great on my Kindle Fire.  It is much longer and more challenging than Grisly Manor.  If you like puzzle,hidden object type games - this is a good one.
0451169514|5.0|This book is as close to flawless as a piece of horror-fiction can possibly get. I admit, I was slightly disappointed with the ending / final confrontation with IT. Knowing IT had to take some sort of physical form, I can't honestly tell what I was expecting. I believe that if this film were made today by a director who cared enough about the true heart of the story and its characters, it could be done VERY well, even having to use some CGI for the finale. I believe the 1990 TV film was as good as it could be for a TV movie, but I think an R version for the screen or possibly an NC-17 version would really flesh-out the characters' experiences and be able to visually manifest Pennywise for what IT really is: evil.  BACK TO THE NOVEL!!! It is truly one of the best stories you'll ever read. The characters, both their child and adult forms, are fully rounded and realized. I think King pulled on a lot of his own youth and friends / school chums to flesh-out the characters as clearly as he did.  I also thought he allowed himself to go to some amazing and disturbing places when telling sequences with Pennywise. What a clever idea to bring a clown in as the antagonist of these innocent young lives. I think if as a reader you simply accept Pennywise as the personification of evil, you'll have no trouble accepting some of the things IT does to IT's victims in this story.  Bottim line, the story is about a return to childhood trauma, and how IT can be anything to any adult. Childhood and out parents leave scars on us that we may not even be aware of. But some day, at some point, we are all called back to face our traumas, to battle out own 'IT' as the characters in this story do. It's complelling, smart, hard to read at some points. A masterstroke from King. Read it. I make a point to read it every year. I saved myself some trips to the libray and bought the audiobook from ITunes w/ Stephen Webber (TV's WINGS) narrating. It's over 2 days long, and almost even better than reading the book. You can just close your eyes and envision what Webber describes, and you can really tell that he's having a lot of fun telling the story, having starred in some of King's films before.  Do yourself a favor and pick this one up. You will not be disappointed.
0307593312|5.0|A different book! 925 pages of artfully crafted fiction. You won't be able to put it away until you know how they get out of the maze.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|some games are better than others. great for younger people, some are harder to figure out than others. all in all not bad. stopples working on opening up new games.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|Don't watch it! The plot is unappealing and dull.  Just save your money and go buy something else or just watch it online for free.  DON'T BUY IT.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|not worth the money at all movies are getting worse for the money they want us to pay i would not say for the money we are making and the money we have to pay for entertainment would be fair to say yeah just go see it but in fact the movie stinks and wish there was a refund for it
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|Totally disappointing! I really expected more of this movie. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone! Really! Don't buy it. The movie is not good!
B006E4QCXU|5.0|It is amazing what math can accomplish.  I am not a mathematician but this cool app is free for today for my kindle.  So always like to check the download of day for Amazon.  Much more interesting than the usual uninspiring 2 star game.  To visualize the beauty of a math algorithm is quite cool.  Especially in color.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|keeps me entertained after even a few minutes and you can keep earning points so you're not playing the same game over and over and it gives you something to look toward to. great app.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so cooool amazing!!!! I mean it has to be the best game around right one game with 100 games that is amazing
B0058VW36U|5.0|if people who are thinking about buying and you check the reviews say no update well they have tool box and buzzle box so we can rejoice
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|being a college student, the ability to read a book and instantly make notes has made life so much easier. I like that it syncs right to my computer to be copied and pasted.
B000031XCR|5.0|This is a terrific album. Celine Dion's voice is instantly recognizable and unforgettable. These are some of her biggest hits, songs we all know and love. This is well worth whatever price you pay for it. The duets are great.
1439130833|5.0|These daily teachings provides life lessons,inspirational and thought provoking. I would recommend the entire Secret series to family, friends and coworkers.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great for a daily Bible reading plan.  Love it.  Can't recommend it strongly enough.  Get this app and get back in the Word.
B004EPZ0AM|1.0|Happy feet 2 is terrible and is not as charming and hilarious as the first one, please reconsider if planning to but to your kids; or maybe you are just an adult with weird likes and you seriously want to see it, avoid it!!!! Films are going down, not good stuff anymore. better if I read a book.
B006E4QCXU|2.0|This app works fine, but I suspect all these 5 star reviewers won't be using it a few days from now. It's a fun little download and delete app, but isn't worth anything more than free.  it has no functionality beyond EXTREMELY temporary amusement. If you download this, you'll.probably delete it within 24 hours.  Claims of it being &quot;beautiful&quot; or &quot;mesmorizing&quot; are way overstated. It is simply manipulation of dots (colored or black and white). That manipulation is quite limited.
B005K17RU0|4.0|this app is more accurate than my local news weather...highly recommended. I also used the information to plan and check travel plans.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|Nice app. Definitely worth the two dollars, if you bought it. Strangely addicting, you really should get this app for free while you can
1567184855|1.0|After reading all the reviews, I thought that is sounded like a great book.Boy was I disapointed, I am pretty open minded, and the book started off well, But after getting part-way through it, started sounding far fetched. I think he just made stuff up, as to publish a book.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|How does he do it?  This story is captivating from the start.  I loved the 50s and 60s environment he described.  I remember it well.  Well worth the read.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|Lame jokes, bad story.  Its like the movie was just for little kids, and even that failed since my nieces hated it.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I am about to download this on my fire, I have been playing on my phone a lot. Its worth the money they charge. Its not to easy nor too hard. Nice job guys at fire maple!
B0063IH60K|5.0|An entertaining game with great graphics. Hours of fun  for you when you are ready for a game of solitaire.
B006E4QCXU|2.0|It certainly works as advertised, however the long term playability of a simple particle physics machine null of varierty is basically nil. I also find it somewhat offensive to deploy a paid version of what can be found dozens of places as sample particle physics API for free. Not worth the price of admission, even at $0
B00006I53S|3.0|I used this lens on the 40D. First of all, on a crop camera, the widest the lens goes, 28mm, is not wide at all. Usually for a general purpose lens you want the lens have a wide side but this lens doesn't. If you have a full frame camera, I would not recommend this camera at all. Although the focal range is very convenient, it is not very sharp and the 3.5-5.6 varying aperture just wont cut it. If you spend all that money on a full frame camera you need to get nice glass. For anyone using film this would be a great lens. If you need a cheap general purpose lens for a film camera this is your lens. One of the things I liked about this lens was the build quality. The build quality is pretty good. It is made of a strong feeling plastic. I liked how the zoom and focus ring felt. I did get some lens creep and when the lens was fully extended it felt a little loose. If you have a crop camera and are looking for an upgrade from the kit lens, you won't be happy with this. It's built like a nicer lens but your images won't be nicer. I recommend the Tamron 17-50mm 2.8. It has a 2.8 aperture, is tack sharp wide open, has a lens hood included, and is much wider. You really don't need the extra reach to 135mm. The lack of good image quality makes this lens no good for all cameras, especially full frame, and the lack of a wide focal length makes it no good for a crop camera. However if you are using a film camera, you might want to consider this lens. I sold this lens for the Tamron 17-50mm 2.8 and could not be happier! Also with the 2.8 lens, image stabilization will not be required and you will have beautiful out of focus backgrounds!
1451627289|3.0|I am about 3/4 of the way, and I'm forcing myself to continue reading it! So much detail and every time you turn around he and Sadie are \\"doing it\\". Nothing wrong with that, but come on. I really like Stephen King but am waiting for something interesting to come into play.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|easy to use. keeps me in touch with God.  first time in my life that I've understood things in the Bible thanks to the devotionals
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|Don't waste your money on this DVD, DVD's aren't the way of the future,download only is,support independent groups of movies and let's get some quality out there not so say that this movie is bad or anything just maybe the MPAA.
B004LROUW2|3.0|I enjoyed 1Q84 a lot. That being said, it is rather long and if you do not get to read that often, I would spend all your time reading this. The plot is very interesting, full of twists, turns, and magical realism. This was my first encounter with Murakami and it has inspired me to read two of his other works since. I would offer this advice when reading Murakami: treat it as you would Kafka. In Kafka's bizarre worlds, things are odd but it is just that way. If the characters act in an odd manner, or there is an unexplained (or inexplicable) piece of the plot, that is just part of the Murakami adventure. The fun is in the magical realism.  The characters are so well developed in 1Q84 that you feel as though you know them. You understand their motivations, and hear their innermost thoughts. If you read this for no other reason, read it to see how well an author can capture characters in the pages of a book.  My one complaint is that after the major event (about 2/3 through the book) it slows waaaaayyyyy down. I think that Murakami is intrigued by the idea of isolation, what it does to people, and what people do when faced with it. While it is an interesting concept, I felt like he plumbed the idea for far too long. Both Tengo and Aomame experience isolation in various ways throughout the book, but the way Aomame experiences it in the latter third of the novel was too extended for my tastes.  At just under 1000 pages, it is quite the tome. However, it is worth the effort because the story is good, the characters are great, and the ideas brought forth are intriguing.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|When I finally reviewed this it just made me madder they I was before I saw this. It shows in great detail the steps the Feds and Wall Street have taken to destroy this great county. If you want to watch (in my option) the best documentary on how this country has been pushed over the edge by rich and powerful people then you have to see this. It is one of the best movies of this type I have ever seen!!
B000QCQ9O8|4.0|One thing is very clear after reading Atonement, and that is Ian McEwan is a certainly a very good writer. Aside from the dramatic plot and well developed characters, McEwan's prose is simply enjoyable to read. The plot is separated into two main parts that are before the war, and during the war. McEwan develops his characters extremely well, especially the protagonist Briony. Briony reminds me a lot of the young girl Paloma from The Elegance of the Hedgehog. She is a precocious young girl that is constantly seeking approval. However, where I could not stand Paloma, I liked (or I guess tolerated is better) Briony better because she was more real. The plot weaves from England to Dunkirk, France and does a great job setting you in the time period. I will not give away any of the end, but you will be thinking about it for days after you finish it. I caught myself driving to work the day after I finished it when I was struck by another realization, and another implication.  While this is a review of the book, I did watch the movie after and really enjoyed it. I thought they stated very true to the book. It was the second time I had watched it. The previous time I had not read the book yet and did not enjoy it at all. I remember being very bored. I suspect that this is common. My suggestion is to watch the movie after reading the novel if you enjoy movies, but definitely not before.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The games are good when for filling time.  some of the games are better than others but again they are good for wasting time.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game. It will keep you intrigued for many hours. A must have game if your into problem solving games.
0307352145|3.0|Background: I'm an INFP (very strong on I and N, weak F, middling P) on the Myers-Briggs typology; I first took the test almost 25 years ago, and have done much further reading on personality, motivation and behavior since. The last two books I read before this one were [[ASIN:1572304510 Without Conscience: The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among Us]] and [[ASIN:0767915828 The Sociopath Next Door]] (I mention this because this book touches on psychopathy).  This book has the most to offer if you're new to the research into personality types and its many sub-genres (evolutionary biology, psychology etc). The author is NOT a scientist; she is a lawyer by training, a self-confessed introvert (though I would judge a weak one), and, I have to say, a pretty good journalist. The book's various chapters are lay-person overviews of various types of personality research, and therefore a good resource for finding further reading; for example, the author briefly discusses Myers-Briggs typing, the book [[ASIN:B002XULWLQ Rapt: Attention and the Focused Life]] (itself a summary of other research) and popular books on the nature of psychopathy. She also attends a Tony Robbins seminar (my own personal vision of Hell), speaks to an introverted leader of a popular evangelical church who struggles with the conflict between his introversion and the extroversion demanded by his church, discusses the extroverted ideal of American culture and business (including something that helped drive me into self-employment as a creative professional, the dreaded &#34;open plan&#34; workspace model), and speaks to a variety of other researchers to get primary-source material.  My main problem with the book is that it tries to divide introverts and extroverts a little too cleanly, imputing personality traits into one side or the other that are commonly found in both types or explained by aspects of personality other than the introversion/ extroversion scale. For example, introverts are presentedas more empathetic than extroverts, when this is simply untrue; I know many introverts who are highly sensitive emotionally, but this sensitivity is entirely inwardly-focused and does not extend to strong empathy for the well-being of others (in other words, they are self-absorbed though highly emotional), and I know many extroverts who would make great personal sacrifices to help someone in need because they have a high degree of empathy for their fellow man, and do not engage in constant navel-gazing. And vice-versa. There is much more to empathy than the introversion / extroversion divide, and if you just read this book, pat yourself on the back for being such a good introvert and then never do further reading, you're going to walk away with a much simplified (and frequently incorrect) view of the nature of introversion.  Summary: worth a read, but be sure to do follow-up reading using the primary sources.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is the Spider Solitaire I remember from years ago. Easy to play. Easy to make harder by adding suits. I highly recommend this solitaire.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|It works perfectly! I loved the size of it and works perfectly with my ipod nano. It does drain the battery a little bit faster, but it does the job.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|Wasn't sure what to expect but figured I'd give it a try, free app of the day.  Wow I would easily pay for this app. Just so very relaxing and mesmerizing its well worth $1.99.  So many stresses in life, always bombarding our minds with one thing and another its refreshing to have this beautiful app available to unwind with and escape.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this because you can get as many games as you want without paying for it and you don't have to buy the game.
B006RXPTNM|5.0|All the performances alone are worth renting this movie...Meryl Streep, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Viola Davis, and Amy Adams...a tour de force!  The subject line of this movie is timeless...while set in the early '60s, it shows the hypocrisy of the Catholic church as it remains today.
0439023491|4.0|Just as good as the first book. I have to admit that while there are a few redundancies and Katnis is still naive, I enjoyed the story. I would like to see some emotional growth from Katnis, but doubting that will happen. I suppose that is part of the point. That young people fighting a war, is like doing drugs and that it stunts your maturity.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is very exciting and fun. :) Over all very easy and free! Love free games. Must have app!
B003O86FMW|5.0|It always seems to happen in trilogies, the second book sucks. Not here though! My poor family had to fnd their own dinners for another night while I finished this. Thank goodness I can go right into the third book now.
B0052VUNHC|2.0|I stopped reading halfway through because once they got together I didnt see the point. Its like reading an updated version of 'Grease'.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|I love this app! When I got it I couldn't put it down! It is awesome on my Kindle Fire...It rocks!!!!!!!!!!
B000FC11A6|5.0|I was looking forward to great cyberpunk sci-fi and instead had to learn cryptography jargon. I had to be reminded of the realities of WWII.  I had to be drawn into the life of a jarhead (or \\"jug head\\") who lived his own life while meeting the demands of his superiors.  I EVEN had to put up with a geek getting sentimental.  Fortunately I am only half-way through. If it ends disappointingly...... I'm going to remember this ride.  It was very much like the ride of \\"Snowcrash.\\"
B005G0ETV0|5.0|First of all, be sure that you have room for this box set of cds...  The box measures 31 x 24 x 16 cm in length, width and height ( about 12x 9 1/2 x 6 inches ) . The box weighs 5.3 kg ( 11.7 lb )  The book that comes with the box is written in English, German and French. It has a few essays by different authors and lots of very interesting photographs.  There is oneof Rubinstein with Picasso, for example, where they look like brothers, if you ignore their chins.  It seems, by what I read in different places, that the collection is not really complete but very few recordings are missing. The quality of the sound is very good  and I was impressed by the quality of recordings dating back to the 1920s. Sony did a really good job there.  Most of cds' covers are reproductions of the original vinyl lps sleeves. The book, besides essays and photos, also has a list of all the tracks in an excellent presentation.  Two dvds are included in this collection: A 1975 concert in Israel and a PBS documentary made to celebrate Rubinstein's 100th anniversary in 1987.  I bought this box set for two reasons:  1. Piano is my second favourite instrument ( after cello ), especially when played by someone like Rubinstein.  2. I am just a layman who likes classical music. I see this collection as an opportunity to go through the history of piano music and classical music in general,  as Rubinstein played compositions from so many different great artists.  The box itself is strong and does the job of storing and protecting over 140 cds. Unfortunately, the design of the box lacks imagination and it is difficult to ignore the flashy pinky colour of the box.  Now, I have to see this flashy, strident box every single day.  It might seem an irrelevant matter if you just look at the picture of the box on Amazon's site but things change if you do have the real box in front of you. The \\"missus\\", for example, won't have it in her living room...  I've just seen the box set of Toscanini that Sony willlaunch in march.  It looks really good: Black and White with photos of Toscanini. Why Sony didn't do something like that for Rubinstein?  Who designed this strident box for Rubinstein collection, confusing classical music with fashion show?  Why on earth did Sony choose to put the collection of cds of a classical music pianist in a flashy pinky box?  I mean, has anyone ever been to a classical music concert where the piano was white and the hall painted in a flashy pinky colour?  There are many good things about this box set but I do take exception to its poor design, especially considering the size of the box and comparing it with many other boxes of cds from Decca, DG, HM, for example, which are making really beautiful boxes of cds.  Sony is a giant company, far bigger than any other record label producing classical music cds and I see no reason why they should do less than much smaller companies. Sony can afford good designers and should have done a better job on this box.  All that said, I am pasting here a complete list of cds in the \\"largest cd box set for a classical instrumentalist\\" ever published, beating the former  \\"champion\\" of Guiness World Records: Jascha Heifetz - The complete album collection.

159102594X|4.0|What a great character story. The best parts are seeing Glokta interacting with others and seeing into his thoughts as he does. The twist at the end involving Logen was equally amazing. My only complaint: it is unable to stand alone as a story without reading the next two books in the series (which I plan to do). I highly recommend it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it works amazing on my fire! the one thing that i don't like is how when u try to get the free points it sometimes does not work. all in all though its a good game
B003ZHQVJO|5.0|This was one of the best cd's that Kid Rock has ever made...I listen to it all the time...Great price..I hope he comes up with another cd just as good as this one.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|I love playing it on my kindle fire, my husband enjoys the game too. Fun puzzle game that makes you think.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is fun when your bored and have nothin to do. so you can give it a try If you want.
B005K17RU0|4.0|accuweather is a easy to use reliable weather app. it has helped my boyfriend and I many times determine our route to work.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|bad graphics, lots of cool games but bad ones to. keeps me occupied for HOURS so it was good but not the best. do reccommend
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This game is filled with artfully designed imagery of lush jungles and mysterious ruins where clues are hidden and puzzles await you. Like others have said, the game is like Myst from the pc, and it is fun and captivating right from the beginning. You wont be disappointed if you enjoy wandering thru island trails and finding strange items and solving odd puzzles amidst ancient ruins surrounded by beautiful scenery. Who wouldnt enjoy that? I sometimes enjoy the unhurried adventure of a hike thru mysterious jungle ruins that this game offers as opposed to a fast run thru a shooting game and i think its a bargain for the price.
B005804MHE|2.0|I bought the box-set(Perception)and after listening to all 5.1 dvd-a disc I was so Mad!!! These are the worst 5.1 mixed i have ever heard! The first album is the worst of them all. there is NO surround. The back spkrs. are allmost silent.The other disc are not much better. Listen to them before you buy....would like to here if other's have had the same problem!!!!
030788743X|4.0|Reading this was like reading a much lesser version of [[ASIN:0143039946 Gravity's Rainbow (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)]] or, perhaps a closer parallel, [[ASIN:0141180633 Vineland (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)]]. I thoroughly enjoyed it, geeked the hell out of the references (knowing that there were some I got, some I got that other people didn't get, and some that I never got), but... was it a great book? Not really. Plot was clichéd, characters were underdeveloped, and the ending was wrapped up all too neatly. Yet, screw all those negative thoughts... it was a fun read.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I like to play spider on my computer, and when I found the app I got hooked even more. its nicely programmed. the only thing I don't like about the tap option is that sometimes it doesn't move the card to your preffered space. ads are a bit annoying, but since its free its fine.
B0064NTZJO|3.0|This movie is a little strange.  It is set in modern era with total 1980's feel and music.  Acting only so-so at best.  Weak plot and easy to see what is coming.  Some okay action and a little violent at times.  Don't want to spoil it for you, but I would rent vs. buy this thing.  Or better, yet, just watch a better movie.
B002QW7ALM|5.0|This is a really great sci-fi movie. Action, a great story, interesting characters, scary monsters, and at the end of it all makes a great introduction for a movie series. Worth watching.
0393327655|1.0|A lot, maybe even too much, has been said about this book. The book's anti-Christian ideas have long-ago refuted in [[ASIN:1414326270 More Than a Carpenter]]. More recent book include [[ASIN:B003VYBDKI The Case for Faith: A Journalist Investigates the Toughest Objections to Christianity]], [[ASIN:0849945283 Can Man Live Without God]], and [[ASIN:1433501155 Reasonable Faith (3rd Edition): Christian Truth and Apologetics]]. 'Nuff said.<br /><br />But what gets me are this book's curiosities. Or oddities. Harris spends a lot of time discussing  evil. Indeed, he has a particular delight in discussing the suffering of young girls (but not boys)--an obvious and cheap ad misericordiam (46, 143, 189, 190, 287). Despite this, he mentions the Old Testament prophet only Job once, and that in passing. Moreover, it was squirreled away in a footnote on page 272. (See [[ASIN:1555177522 Consider My Servant Job]]).<br /><br />Another curiosity is his complaint that Justice Moore's acts viz-z-viz the 10 Commandments violated the \\"spirit (if not the letter) of the 'establishment clause'\\" (145). But Harris's whole atheism is a violation of both the spirit and letter of the Declaration of Independence:  \\"Nature and Nature's God,\\" \\"endowed by their Creator,\\" \\"Supreme Judge of the World,\\" \\"Divine Providence.\\"<br /><br />(BTW, the concept of the spirit and the letter of the law is Biblical: 2 Corinthians 3:6, an instance of the fallacy of \\"stolen concept.\\")<br /><br />Another curiosity is the omnipresent sarcasm. This debating technique was overused by Nietzsche and Thomas Paine ([[ASIN:1603863419 The Age of Reason - Thomas Paine]]), and Harris makes it a grating mannerism, and also a decoy to the bizarreness of his assertions.<br /><br />Penultimately, there is his curious solution. After making the case for reason and logic, his solution is mysticism and illogic.<br /><br />Keep in mind the Three Laws of Logic: identity, excluded middle, and non-contradiction. There is a hard line between \\"me\\" and \\"thee.\\" Yet Harris calls for a demolition of this rock-solid wall of separation between quids:<br /><br />\\"Break the spell of thought, and ***the duality of subject and object will vanish***--as will the fundamental difference between conventional states of happiness and suffering. This is a fact about the mind that few Western scholars have ever made it their business to understand\\" (218). The reason why they haven't is because it undermines reason itself.<br /><br />Is this a joke, or did he really say that \\"Mysterious is a rational enterprise\\"? And quickly adds that \\"Religions is not\\" (221)? Clearly, this is more than a distinction without a difference. It is gross misconception of both religion and mysticism, as if mysticism was not a branch of religion ([[ASIN:0812974212 The Essential Writings of Christian Mysticism (Modern Library Classics)]]).<br /><br />So mysticism is the logical (pun intended) replacement for religion, which lead to the last curiosity--Harris's unabashed envy of religion.<br /><br />He says that this book \\"is written very much the spirit of a prayer\\" (48-49). (But to whom is he praying?) And he bluntly assets that \\"Nothing is more sacred than facts\\" (225).<br /><br />But if religion is bad, why does he keep co-opting religious terms and phraseology?<br /><br />These last two curiosities--his illogic and his envy--coalesce into this rather ridiculous statement about his social and cultural objective in writing the book:<br /><br />\\" ...  it is a matter of finding approaches to ethics and to spiritual experience that make no appeal to faith, and broadcasting this knowledge to everyone.\\"  (224).<br /><br />Notice his errors. He reduces religion to mere ethics, which is, well, reductionism. Also, remember G. K. Chester's observation that \\"Morality did not begin by one man saying to another, 'I will not hit you if you do not hit me'; there is no trace of such a transaction. There IS a trace of both men having said, 'We must not hit each other in the holy place.'\\" ([[ASIN:080245657X Orthodoxy (Moody Classics)]]).<br /><br />And then in that one sentence he asks for what is sometimes called a \\"barking cat,\\" a mutually contradictory want ...<br /><br />(This is ridiculed in the Bear Patrol  segment of the [[ASIN:B000BQPC42 The Simpsons - The Complete Seventh Season]] episode \\"Much Apu About Nothing\\".)<br /><br /> ... he wants \\"a spiritual experience that makes no appeal to faith.\\"  Again, a contradiction in terms, a series of \\"weasel words.\\"<br /><br />It reminds us of this poem:<br /><br />  Our New Religion<br />  From \\"Gaily the Troubadour\\"<br />  by  Arthur Guiterman  (1871-1943)<br /><br />  First dentistry was painless.<br />  Then bicycles were chainless,<br />  Carriages were horseless,<br />  And many laws enforceless.<br /><br />  Next cookery was fireless,<br />  Telegraphy was wireless,<br />  Cigars were nicotineless,<br />  And coffee caffeineless.<br /><br />  Soon oranges were seedless,<br />  The putting green was weedless,<br />  The college boy was hatless,<br />  The proper diet fatless.<br /><br />  New motor roads are dustless,<br />  The latest steel is rustless,<br />  Our tennis courts are sodless,<br />  Our new religion -- godless.<br /><br />Again, 'Nuff said. Except for this one caution to people of faith who are also people with questions: if you strip away this book's sarcasm and cheap shots, you are left with a tangled pile of bare bones. He undermines his own arguments.<br /><br />Chesterton noticed this long ago, when he took up reading anti-Christian literature. As he read, he noticed \\"odd effect of the great agnostics in arousing [in him] doubts deeper than their own.\\"<br /><br />He summed up his experience by saying:<br /><br />\\"It was Huxley and Herbert Spencer and Bradlaugh who brought me back to orthodox theology. They sowed in my mind my first wild doubts of doubt. Our grandmothers were quite right when they said that Tom Paine and the free-thinkers unsettled the mind. They do. They unsettled mine horribly. ***The rationalist made me question whether reason was of any use whatever***; and when I had finished Herbert Spencer I had got as far as doubting (for the first time) whether evolution had occurred at all. As I laid down the last of Colonel Ingersoll's atheistic lectures the dreadful thought broke across my mind, 'Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.' I was in a desperate way.\\" (Orthodoxy)<br /><br />And, like G. K.

B006GH6IWU|5.0|Queen: Days of Our Lives is the DVD to own if you want a documentary that, without any doubt, is the definitive documentary of one of the most flamboyant rock acts in history: Queen.<br /><br />The documentary is a raw, gritty, informative, warts-and-all portrait of the band. It tells the story of four college students met up in 1971and started one of the world's greatest rock and roll bands. Since their forming, the band recorded an astonishing 26 albums with estimates of sales of between 150 and 300 million units.  With numbers like that, it's no mystery how and why the band's music is embedded both in the soundtrack of our youth and in our musical and societal DNA.<br /><br />Directed by Matt Casey and produced by long-time Queen collaborators Simon Lupton and Rhys Thomas, it is in this DVD that, for the first time, the band shares their incredible story. The two-disc set is a treasure trove of interviews - including new interviews with Brian May and Roger Taylor - as well as recently discovered video of the band's first ever television performance and other never-before-seen archival footage.<br /><br />In telling what drove this must-have documentary, Rhys Thomas said, \\"We set out to make the definitive Queen documentary. It's a funny, honest, inspiring and ultimately tragic account of `a certain band called Queen, as told by the band themselves.  We tell the story of four students who met in West London, slogged hard and conquered the world, ultimately changing the world forever.\\"<br /><br />In the UK in May, 2011, BBC broadcast Queen: Days of Our Lives over two nights to a reported 3 million viewers, resulting in it being the highest rated TV show in its time slot.<br /><br />I enjoyed watching every second of each disc.  It's that good.  There are two segments that are particular Boomerocity favorites:<br /><br />* Guitarist Brian May tells of bringing his parents over from the UK to see Queen perform at New York's Madison Square Garden.  It is a very, very touching vignette.<br /><br />*The segments of the last recording session and color video outtakes of the music video show on this review show and tell a Freddie Mercury as his body was losing its battle against AIDS.<br /><br />* The segments of the last recording session and color video outtakes of the music video show on this review show and tell a Freddie Mercury as his body was losing its battle against AIDS.<br /><br />Boomerocity.comion and color video outtakes of the music video show on this review show and tell a Freddie Mercury as his body was losing its battle against AIDS.  * The segments of the last recording session and color video outtakes of the music video show on this review show and tell a Freddie Mercury as his body was losing its battle against AIDS.

0330423622|5.0|I still have a hundred or so pages to read and have bad arthritis in my hands and so battle to hold the book to read it in bed. It would have been wonderful if it had been available on my kindle - but since I don't read German that was not going to happen. I work in the medical field and so some of the medical issues I found stretched my imagination - but I am so loving the book,the smells and sights and of course the fascination of his characters. I feel so different about the whole Indian culture.It has made me so want to go to Bombay and try to see the slums and the people through different eyes. This has been absolute escapism for me.Loved it!
B0006GAO5Y|5.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW  I'll preface the body of this review by admitting that I am an extreme latecomer to \\"Rocky\\" fandom.  I was born two years after this movie came out, and the theme music and a few well-marketed scenes from the movie were virtually all I knew of it.  I was not prepared for the depth of storyline and character in this film, and remain largely enthralled with the movie.  Written by and starring Sylvester Stallone, \\"Rocky\\" gives the viewer an intimate look at the life of the title character.  Rocky Balboa is a hardscrabble philosopher, an essentially gentle soul who boxes because that is the rugged gift fate gives him.  I absolutely love the detail the film delves into in giving an account of Rocky's life outside of the ring.  The film spends so much time on Rocky and the people in his life, including his girlfriend Adrian(Talia Shire), her brother Paulie(Burt Young), and Mickey(Burgess Meredith), the salty boxing trainer, that the inevitable final fight with Apollo Creed(Carl Weathers) feels somewhat cliched and anticlimactic.  Admittedly, my sense of appreciation for the fight had been severely dulled by decades of spoilery film clips but even aside from that the movie feels more about Rocky's life story and drive than what still feels like an obligatory, tacked-on finale.  Despite my last criticism, I love this movie.  I have a better appreciation for Sylvester Stallone's overall talent, and \\"Rocky\\" is a true classic film.
0385342063|4.0|I found this book similar to Kinsella's other books.  Story of a quirky woman named Poppy, who is insecure and finds herself in the end.

014241543X|5.0|If I Stay is one of my favorite books ever! For one, I find connections with the location since I have spent most of my youth in Oregon, the main character/narrator comes to life right on the page and you feel like you have known her forever. She has such real emotions conveyed through the plot line that I found myself both at points laughing, crying, and nodding along with her life experiences. I recommend this book for everyone over the age of 13 years old, just because some of the cuss words (though even more so in the 2nd book) and the implication of sex and the graphic descriptions of the accident, definitely not for the weak of heart or those light on the stomach! All around a really good book :)
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I use this app when I have to go out for dinner, movies or on a weekend trip and don't want to carry my wiaptop with me to get some work done. App is great on Kindle Fire.....setup is easy and connecting to your Pc/Mac is very smooth. Highly recommend it for any one who wants to avoid carrying laptops with them adage or family outing. I would give it 5 stars if it adjusted the resolution to fit the device supported screen resolutions.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|Terribly disappointing film I wouldn't recommend it at all save your money. Really the movie industry needs to re invest some of its billions of dollars profits into making some decent movies
B006E4QCXU|5.0|This app is fantastic and worked wonderfully on the Kindle Fire. I loved hypnotically interacting with the swirling dots. I felt like the end of my finger was electrically charged with the power to control the orbiting particles and make them beautifully dance and spiral on the screen. I especially like the options to change the colors as well as the # of dots, their weight, and thickness. I also ran this just fine on my old Motorola Cliq. I just had to reduce the # of dots on the screen/in the grid. After that it worked almost as quickly as on my K Fire. Also really liked the effects I could get on the screen using 2 touch points with the Fire's multitouch capabilities.<br /><br />Never write reviews, but I just had to for this particular app. I love it, and mess with it over and over again when I only have a minute or two of free time. I got it as the faotd, but would gladly have paid for it. its certainly worth the download.

Prince provides an IN DEPTH understanding on the specific TEACHINGS of Islam in his book [[ASIN:0982413726 The Deception of Allah Volume 1 (study in depth of Islam, investigating Muhammad and Islam, volume 1)]]. Buy these books TOGETHER so that you can get both perspectives. You can get historical evidence from Robert Spencer as well as a \\"fly-on-the-wall\\" conceptualization of Islam from an Arabic-speaker (and scholar) who understands the teachings of Islam better than anyone else on the planet! C. Prince will provide you with information about Islam that a Western English-Speaker will NEVER get ANYWHERE ELSE. You will learn how the Qur'an and Hadiths actually PROMOTE deception, war, rape, and ever other morally depraved act known to humanity! Believe me, I know because I'm reading the Qur'an and Hadith's myself! As a matter of fact, if you want a trustworthy translation of the Qur'an (that doesn't contain apologetically-motivated additions, omissions, and distortions, please purchase [[ASIN:098241370X The Generous Qur'an, An Accurate, Modern English Translation of the Qur'an, Islam's Holiest Book]] by Usama Dakdok. Anyway, Robert Spencer is telling the TRUTH about Islam, but even he doesn't know the HALF of it! Buy ALL these books and get educated on the biggest threat to the civilized world (I know this may sound extremist, but I PROMISEyou won't think so by the time you're finished reading and educating yourself about the facts).
B000AMJC2K|5.0|We've had this just over 24 hours, and already are ordering a second one, and probably a third.<br /><br />I spend most of my day in my living room - stairs pose a danger to me, so I tend to only go up or down them if my husband is home \\"in case of emergency.\\"  As such, we had to essentially relocate my office space downstairs so that I have easy access to the kitchen, laundry, etc. throughout the day.  My laptop monitor just isn't big enough to let me do my work properly, so having a large HD monitor is important to me... but then aesthetics come into play because this is, after all, my living room.  I want things to look as nice as possible.<br /><br />Along comes this monitor mount - and I don't think I could be more pleased.<br /><br />I have my 23\\" monitor mounted on this - it's a slim monitor, so it weighs much less than the max rating for this mount.  I've encountered no trouble in terms of getting the positioning I want with a monitor that is larger (size, not weight) than the specs mention.  This mount is rock solid.  I have my monitor mounted in a fully-extended position, and it is tight and secure and not bouncing all over the place.<br /><br />The finish on the mount is very pleasing to the eye.  I don't feel like I have this huge ugly mechanical monster in the midst of my living room.  It has a very organic visual feel.<br /><br />And I think anyone with an engineering bent will be pleased with how well-thought-out each swivel point is... we very much appreciated the thought that went into the mounting of the optional arm.  Stick your hex key in and let the mount itself hold the key still while you rotate the arm to unscrew it.  Talk about saving strain on your fingers & wrists!  Lovely - especially for someone with carpal tunnel!<br /><br />Truly, the only improvement I could possibly make on this design would be to have a little space tucked away in the base where one could store the hex keys that come with it.  That has more to do with my own OCD leanings than any failure in design of this mount. LOL<br /><br />We're buying a second one today for my husband's monitor... and are debating a third for the monitor we use with our Roku & HD-DVD player in our bedroom.  We also have a number of friends & family who are going to be finding this under the Christmas tree later this year.  This mount would be worth much more than the $60-70 price range Amazon is selling it for... and I would suggest to buyers that IF you have reason to find fault with the quality of this mount, you may want to consider an exchange rather than a return.  Manufacturing defects are a fact of life, and my guess is that any problems might relate more to an issue with the specific mount you received being badly manufactured than with the style & design itself being flawed.  It would be worth giving a replacement a chance.<br /><br />Just editing this to add:  It's 2/23/12 and I've just placed an order for two more of these.  We count this as one of our best Amazon purchases of all time.nings than any failure in design of this mount.

B006OB3K56|5.0|Shame is an unrelenting film about addiction.  If you are faint of heart, don't see this movie.  Fassbender stars as Brandon, a thirty-something sales associate who's addiction for sex overshadows his life.  Brandon seeks sex in ANYWAY he can. His life begins to slowly unravel when younger sister, Sissy, played by Mulligan, shows up for an impromptu visit.  Director, McQueen, never explains the hidden dynamic between the two, that is left up to the audience to figure out. One scene, upon first knowing that he has a visitor, sets the mood for the rest of the film.  Brandon tries to desperately have a \\"normal\\" relationship with Marianne, a co-worker but he cannot bear intimacy.  Shame is a difficult, defiant, non-erotic drama intended to make you squirm. McQueen sets the tone and close-ups beautifully as the two talk and tear each other up. Using the streets of New York as a backdrop, the mood feels gritty, dirty and in need of a hot shower.  This film got buzz due to the explicit content but make no mistake about it, this film was anything but sexual.  I don't think, emotionally, I could see it twice.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire is a fun game to play with one touch movement of the cards. The cards are easy to see and the ad's are not annoying
1612130283|1.0|1.5 stars<br /><br />I don't enjoy writing bad reviews, honestly it puts a sick feeling in my stomach, but at the moment I am feeling too annoyed not to write one. So please don't get snarky - I do realise I am in the minority with my opinions.<br /><br />OK, I couldn't finish this book. I tried, holy hell did I try - but by 88% I was so annoyed I had to put it down.<br /><br />And after a lot of contemplation I have decided not to rant and rave, but simply state in point form what I didn't like.<br /><br />~ The writing was too sterile. There was no depth and I found it hard connecting to any of it. There was a whole heap of - I touched him, he touched me, I did this, he did that. And it wasn't engaging at all.<br />When I read I want to be able to feel the emotion, not be told how a scene is playing out as if the heroine is actually an observer.<br /><br />~ The sex - it wasn't hot at all. I wouldn't even classify it as erotic. For some strange reason I have the opinion that you need to be able to refer to your vagina as something more erotic than 'down there' before you can pull off a significant hotness rating.<br /><br />~ Christian - ok, he was relatively hot but not enough to get my blood pumping. He wasn't alpha enough for me. One moment he is trying to be hard core the next he is gasping because she is wearing his underwear.<br />Now if that was my dominant alpha, he would have given me a cocky smile, licked his lips and gave that 'how you doin' look, But no, he gasped like a little girl.<br /><br />~ The price....I don't get it. How can a publisher charge this much for a book written so badly?? **This refers to the price it was set when first release**<br /><br />.....ok, I could go on, I could practically write a novel, but I won't.<br /><br />I will take my Inner Goddess (seriously if I had to read that line one more time I would have caused self harm) and find something else to read.
B000QUUD60|5.0|I saw this film when it was in the theaters. I bought the tape when it came out and almost wore it out watching it. This re-done DVD blows away the movie and tape. This is now a movie about Elvis. No people talking, no interruptions, no distractions. Even the practice sessions in the beginning have been re-done and are more interesting. The big difference is when you get to the International Hotel and Elvis' show. It's as close to seeing him in person as one will get. His entertainment abilities are truly on display. The original version is on DVD 2 and the extras included in this set are interesting. The main interest though remains in the show(s) at the International. That's The Way It Was.
B006E4QCXU|3.0|this was fun the first few minutes then it just got boring I really do not suggest this app it was a waste of space and my time
B005XY67WI|5.0|This is an outstanding concert! Shakira's performance is tantamount to greatness!! Her stage presence is magnetic and she is seemingly in perpetual motion.What a show!!!  Amazon Verified Purchase.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app it is awesome make more apps like it it is very fun to play on yeah
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|This movie was a total waste of time.  The plot line and story are boring and predictable.  Typical Hollywood cheese of a movie.  Can we please get some create people making movies?
B005VPRG10|2.0|We purchased this for my 6-year-old Star Wars Lego-obsessed son, after months of anticipation for its release. We returned it the next day. The build was fine - neither interesting nor too complicated, although too particular for him to do on his own correctly. But the problem is the playability - it has fallen apart 5 times in one day of play. The wings regularly come off, which messes up the core ship & needing a rebuild from scratch. If you put the wings back on and press too hard, the entire core collapses.  This is the only Lego item we've ever gotten that falls apart so easily. Buyer beware if you're getting for a young kid to play with.
B0063GORYU|5.0|this game is a very good time waster!! whenever I have some extra time I find myself in my apps area clicking on this game!!! I rate this a 10 but there's not a 10 so I gave it the highest possible score :D:D:D
B0064NTZJO|4.0|First off don't let the trailors fool you, this is not a fast paced action flick. I had to stop it because my wife was bored to tears, and retstart it once she was asleep. If you don't mind movies that make you ponder emotions with drawn out scenes of music and facial expressions this movie is for you. I'm not saying this is a bad thing, the soundtrack is mezmerising and the cinematography is fantastic. Think back to the scenes in Risky Business when there was no dialogue just music, now think back to Goodfella's with the closing montage of bodies. This is no romantic comedy, it is not for the weak at heart.    Casting for this film was fantastic, loved seeing some familiar faces play new roles. As for the the characters I really enjoyed the lead role. Gosling plays a tough non-emotional guy. He gets business done and puts emotions to the side. This helps you feel just how intense the situation becomes towards the end because he actually shows a softer side. Despite his feelings though he never wavers from what must be done, Love that about this character.    I watch a lot of movies, and it sometimes suprises me what I like. This movie keeps you guessing at first but delivers with a stream lined plot, that in turn gives you a satisfying lingering finish.
B0061S073A|5.0|love this app. perfect for keeping my little one in the apps I want him to use and out of the ones I don't.
B005HSL626|5.0|I think everyone is exaggerating the ad issue. I think that the ads are fine. They don't appear that often, just at the end of every game you play. Also, just a few ads aren't that big of a deal.I mean, I'd rather play for free than spend money to play the same game to bust take away a few ads. I.think this is a great game, especially for free. To those people who don't like it, consider this. What if there were no.games with ads. We would have to pay for everything we got. We have already paid for the device itself, we don't need to spend more. That's just.my opinion.
B0015I2UIG|5.0|Nine Lives is the 2008 evolution of Steve Winwood's long career. Since the days of Blind Faith, Traffic and through his solo career Steve Winwood has stood test of time. His band and solo recordings stand the test of time for me. My favorite work is with those two classic bands. His solo work is quite excellent too and he continues to grow as an artist.<br /><br />Nine Lives shows his continuing relevance as a performer and draws on the rhythms and tensions of his blues and rock roots. The album focus on drums and rhythms though out has been consistently Winwood since the beginning and serves well in this well crafted album.<br /><br />Here is a very brief (maybe too brief) reaction to each track.<br />1. I'm Not Drowning - Bluesy feel with an almost blind-faith like rhythm<br />2. Fly - Move into more jazzy guitar sound and flute sound<br />3. Raging Sea - If Blind Faith had made it to a 3rd album I imagine this might have been there<br />4. Dirty City - Back to rock/blues feel more touches of traffic like sound/rhythms<br />5. We're All Looking - Jazzy organ/vocal centric with traffic like rhythms<br />6. Hungry Man - Almost Jamacian/Jazz fusion sounding<br />7. Secrets - A samba like beat and silky guitar chords<br />8. At Times We Do Forget - Staccato guitar riff carries the backbone of this selection<br />9. Other Shore - &#34;There will be times at Sunrise when my heart speaks your name&#34; about says it all of this lover's lament<br /><br />After living with Nine Lives for 4+ years I think the title is apt. Steve Winwood's career has legs and I still listen to this album as one of his important works.<br /><br />Before closing I was pleased when he and Eric Clapton got back together at [[ASIN:B001V7YWTQ Madison Square Garden]] in their 2009 album/DVD recordings. If you want to see how they are in 2009 vs 1969 this can be a very interesting reunion.<br /><br />Because I am enjoying this album years on I think it deserves 5 stars
0375850864|3.0|I'm often wary of books that have won awards.  They are so filled with tropes and, in my opinion, undeserving of the prestigious awards and attention they receive.  This book honestly wasn't terribly different, other than one major plot twist near the end.  Same old flowery descriptions, story that drags on,  \\"ordinary\\" young female narrator with missing daddy issues narrating her way through her \\"ordinary\\" life.  The twist at the end literally had me jumping out of my chair, screaming \\"WHAT??\\" in public repeatedly, but besides that, an ordinary, boring read.  I recommend you read A Wrinkle in Time instead.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|First off, this was a very well directed film and the soundtrack was perfect also.  I couldn't help but make comparisons to Grand Theft Auto: Vice City from the opening credits.  The hot pink cursive font of the title, the retro 80's tracks and most, if not all, of the scenes in the movie remind me of something going on in GTA.  This wasn't a bad thing at all.  I'm still wondering if there was any connection between the two.
0061537969|5.0|This book had my heart in the first 3 pages!  It is one of the most truthful and beautiful books I have ever read.  I was immersed throughout the entire story.  I am a dog lover and owner and I am bound to Enzo even 4 months after reading this book.  I have never had a book bring out so many raw emotions! I recommend this book to everyone!
0975991477|5.0|I needed the book for graduate school and one without marks is the best.  The book in great shape and was as it was described.
0307957934|3.0|Could have been better.<br />This novel, while showing some promise, fell rather flat as it neared its conclusion.<br />The basic premise is rather sound, especially in today's society driven by perpetual fear & lust for money. However, that is where the fun stopped for me.<br />Many of the characters seemed to lack depth & are a touch too stereotypical. Some of the ancillary characters are even superfluous, as they do nothing to really drive the story forward.<br />There are even a few passages that could've, & maybe even should've, been omitted entirely.<br />Since I'm not familiar with much of the financial world's jargon, I spent a fair amount of time on google trying to decipher exactly what was taking place at times.<br />There are a few instances where Harris tries to explain some of the backstory, but at times, the explanations are cut short for whatever reason.<br />As a whole, & aside from the hedge fund jargon, the story does move forward at a decent pace. Harris does a nice job of painting a vivid picture of what is taking place throughout the story without too much traipsing about.<br />It's not a terrible read, by any stretch, but it fails to deliver any real punch & seems disjointed at times.<br />Again, there's promise here, but the story felt rushed to be completed.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|This is the best compilation of music from the greatest band ever! Classic!! An absolute must-have for all ages!!!  John, Paul, George, and Ringo will always be THE FAB 4!
B006W0QOF2|1.0|I want my four dollars back.  Ryan Gosling's character is boring and uninspiring.  One would think with a title like \\"Drive\\" this film would have a good bit of car chase scenes.  This movie is SLOW and the predictable plot seems to drag by.  It had an abrupt and underdeveloped ending,  the music was terrible, and worse of all now I have to let my wife pick a chick flick next time.  What a waste of my turn to pick the movie.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|If you're wondering what it means to be a father then this is the movie for you. A beautiful story to be seen by every family that reminds us of the importance of fatherhood and the role of Fathers in childrens lifes. This generation definately needs to see this, I believe we would have less problems dealing with our adolescents if we would just follow the principles taught in this movie...let's keep our children out of the streets!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I honestly love this game it is one of my favorite games!If I had to rate it from 1-10 it would be a 10
B0068TL23G|5.0|I see the connections differently now that I've been playing it for a while. It's hard to know if that game you just got on the first try was your brain seeing it and making the connection or you just got an easy one. I love it. It's probably the first free app I've gotten that I would actually pay for.
1410445224|5.0|A very complete and accurate story of the life of Steven Jobs.  I came in larger print which made it easy to read for this senior citizen.  This man has left a mark on society that will be used and remembered for 100 years.
B005HSL626|5.0|this app is really fun! once u get it u just want to keep playing. I love all of the blades and backgrounds  get this app!
B0063GORYU|5.0|loving this game and the convince of having it where ever I get stuck at. I give it a five across any board.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is so addictive I play it every day its so cool I cant think what I would do without it this is a 5 star app
B00127RAJY|5.0|the product itself was awesome!! i had to stop workouts tho bc i had toe surgery but i cant wait to get started again! :)
1563894696|5.0|This story is something I would not only recommend to the fans of the Batman or DC, but to anyone interested in a great murder-mystery.  I would say this is the very best of the Batman series, I recommend this to anyone starting in the Batman-world, as to it being the first I read in the series.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This app is awesome for when you need to kill sometime. the games are simple, a little.repetitive, and some are almost stupid impossible.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Beautiful images in this game. Same basic game mechanics as &quot;Grisly Manor&quot; but puzzles are a little tougher and transitions seem more natural.  The journal means you don't have to write notes re:clues you find -which is an improvement.  Totally worth the price.  Works without any problems so far on my Kindle Fire.  Thanks Fire Maple!
B0001I561E|5.0|Fast shipping product as described, very happy.<br />I love Aladdin! One of the greatest disney films of all time, I am so glad that amazon had it.
B0069UP2PI|4.0|A deadly virus, the world facing doom and the end, you know what to expect, but still you go along for the ride and enjoy it. Sure its been done before, but sucker up, get it, watch it and enjoy.
B0073LWEXK|3.0|where is the walkthrough mentioned by some reviewers?  I need some instructions to get through the first door!!!  some help please?  Okay!  I made it through the door, but am finding it incredibly difficult to get where I am supposed to be going or know what I am supposed to be doing where.  The hints are helpful, but not sufficient to explain how to navigate through this game.  The graphics and sound effects are wonderful, and almost make up for the confusing aspects of the game.  Some kind of instructions at the beginning would have made the game a lot more enjoyable.  Right now I am sorry I spent $2 on it!  I hope it gets easier, because it really is beautiful.  BTW, I have it on Kindle Fire.
0743454537|1.0|I almost quit reading-- I wish I had--when Dr Chance is on the stand and testifies that no hospital would force a child to donate an organ against her will, no matter what her parents want. Well then...what was the point of this book again?
B004T4LUPW|4.0|Syncs beautifully with Google calendar, as expected.  Easy to use.  The one big problem was the show on map function.  It took me to MapQuest, but then I was stuck there.  Restart from home, still in maps.  Force stop - same.  Delete all data - same.  I had no access to the calendar until doing a full uninstall/reinstall of calengoo. If this function had not existed, that would have been okay.  As is, that button is a disaster waiting to happen.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|although graphics are a little cheesy this game will keep you busy. its fun and challenging! I would recommend this app!
B000OXHRRC|5.0|This is a highly underrated film. Crowe is his classic self and the romantic setting of the south of France real makes this an excellent film. Quality acting. A good story and two diametric cultures clashing - one of city, high finance, the other of a pristine winery - expose a yearning for a more simplistic meaningful life of relationships and simplicity within all of us.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|We almost didn't read this because one of the reviews we read said that it was like \\"50 first Dates\\".  I'm not sure that the person who wrote that review even read it!  All of us were drawn into the suspense of the book, and only one of us knew what was going to happen by the end of the book.  This was a great suspenseful story and I recommend reading it.
B001HN690O|3.0|While the sequal is good it is not close to being as good as the original. Furthermore it seems in the end that this is the second installment of a trilogoy. Overall quality of the film is excellent, the scenary is lush and colorful, but the story line is lacking. The other master ku characters, a croc and ox, seem out of place and an afterthought to the story. Much of the humor and playfulness of the original film is missing.  I hope that the third installment (if there is one) will get back to the roots of the original.
B0000025DD|5.0|This album is proof that Pink Floyd was a lot more than just Roger Waters.  It's fantastic and if you listen to it you will know exactly what I mean.
0312641893|2.0|This book is promoted to be a Cinderella retelling, and descriptions give a 'steam-punk' vibe, what with 'royal' balls, and Cinder being a cyborg and a mechanic. However, be forewarned that unless you are really into science fiction, you won't find much to like about this book. Basically picture Cinderella with an alien invasion. Yeah. So, if you are into sci-fi, then check it out, but otherwise, there are better retellings out there.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love to spend hours playing these games. keeps your attention, and isn't too easy too beat. earning points is a fun insentive too.
0312641893|5.0|Melissa Meyer's debut Cinder is magical and it feels original even though it's a retelling of the classic Cinderella. Okay I expected this book to be a simple unoriginal and uninventive retelling of Cinderella but boy was I wrong. I thought it would be as disappointing as Beastly was. Cinder is the story of a mechanic who lives in a world plagued by disease and cruelty because she is a cyborg. This book is a great beginning to The Lunar Chronicles and i cant want to read the next one. You won't be disappointed and I hope you guys enjoy it.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|I like the game. It has various games, ie: chess, checkers, etc. I think that it would be a 5 star app if the advertisement/phishing item at the bottom of the screen was not there.
B003L77TZI|4.0|I went bowling last night.  What did I hear?  Katy Perry.  I went to the mall today.  What did I hear?  Katy Perry.  The Katy Perry frenzy is in full force, so I thought, \\"Why not write a review?\\"<br /><br />Harsh critics say she's talentless.  They say her lyrics are geared toward teenage girls, all while Perry herself is 27 years old and singing about this teenage stuff.  One thing is for sure - Katy Perry is smart.  She knows what works and what doesn't work.  She knows how to reach a target audience (teenage girls).  She knows what people want.  She's a smart businesswoman, no doubt.  Nowadays, in the digital age of individual MP3 tracks being downloaded and favored over buying full-length CDs, she's doing something that fewer and fewer artists are able to do - survive in the music industry.  As Richard Dawson said in The Running Man (1987), \\"So what do we do?  We give 'em what they want!  We're number one, Ben.  That's all that counts.  Believe me, I've been in the business 30 years.\\"  Katy Perry is making it.  She has the whole package - looks, brains, and talent.  Sure, her lyrics are simple and quite juvenile.  She has a good voice, but it's far from the best out there.  But she's smart.  That's what makes the difference.  She's laughing all the way to the bank.  I predict she'll perform at the Super Bowl within a couple of years.<br /><br />I listen to hard rock and heavy metal most of the time.  Occasionally I'll listen to pop and classic rock.  I've heard enough of this Teenage Dream album to make a judgement about it.  I give it 4 stars.  The best song is \\"Firework\\", in my opinion.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|a Bible is a book that should be a part of our everyday life this app can help with that
B0070Z4M4I|1.0|I honestly love the original Thing movie.  I have seen it countless times, and it never gets old, a genuine classic.  This overly produced, bang-for-your-buck scare tactic movie should not have \\"The Thing\\" name associated with it in anyway, shape, or form (no pun intended).  It's mind numbingly predictable, and retarded.  The only reason I got lured into watching this finally was because of the name association.  I am going to act like I didn't ever see this, and keep the Norwegian story up to your own imagination, like Carpenter intended.  There was no heart in this remake prequel, whatever.  The only thing that they had going for them was the fact that they were able to show the minimal events that were showed in the original, about what happened at the Norwegian camp site.  That's it.  All the rest is predictable, mind numbing filler until we see:  The thing break out of the block of ice.. The \\"split-face\\" thing take shape, and be burned, and the ending sequence where the dog escapes from camp.  That's it.  God.  Have mercy on these so called film-makers.
B0068RHSCW|5.0|Loved this movie made you think. The begginging is quite slow ,but by the time you get to the middle it picks up pace . I highly recomenon watching this movie it  really has a twist .
B004UID2LC|5.0|I like this because it downloaded all my favorite vocaloid songs and hetalia videos so &quot;GET IT NOW OR YOU'LL DIE&quot;
B0054JZC6E|1.0|the game is so dumb. the games inside are like 1993 handheld games that were boring even then, and you cant access any other games in it unless you score enough. its pathetic. trust me. sounds enticing, I agree, but its garbage.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|I dont know why exactly but this film just makes me cringe inside. Its almost like despite the best efforts spending zillons of bucks on an all A-List cast and on marketing there is something very very very wrong about this. I feel as though by watching this, I will be dragged off to some far away land to face some existential nightmare not of my own creation.  I feel so sorry for the penguins they seem to be a victim of their own blissful ignorance. They seem oblivious to the onslaught of polar warming, bears , Orcas the list goes on (life must really suck to be a penguin right now) Maybe thats the whole point , this film is to make kids ignorance of the world around them like the little penguins! Maybe they'll learn to accept what the world around them is doing and ignore certain MPAA attempts to control the internet and the world for their own benefit!!! Seriously this SUCKS!! Send your kinds to see Pokemon, Cool Japanese Manga something that is different; independent. You never know they may thank you for it one day
B003BWERF8|3.0|I use my bluetooth chip for my ipod.  I works well when there is a clear path of connection.  For example, if I put my ipod on a shelf and play it on my receiver it plays great.  but when I put it on my arm and use wireless headphones if I lift my arm up and turn my head away it cuts out.  I tried to clip my ipod on my shorts and there was so  much interference I took it off, I need to keep it on my arm, close to the headphones.  I don't know if every blue tooth chip does this, but my iphone works great and doesn't skip.  Hope this helps for people who want to use it to work out.
B00005UKKF|4.0|This DVD features Britney Spears at an appearance at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas in 2001, during her Dream Within A Dream Tour.  Although Ms. Spears appears to be lip synching throughout much of the show, she and her crew of dancers deliver an energetic and exciting performance featuring most of her well known hits at the time.  Originally broadcast live on HBO, Britney wows the crowd in this 90 minute Emmy winning production.<br /><br />A pop sensation since her debut in 1999, Britney Spears' meteoric rise in popularity has been built on more than just her talents as a singer, as her looks, dancing ability, and her evolving persona, have been incorporated into her music.  Spears is a talented dancer, and a fine stage performer in general, who seems to have grown up really fast from schoolgirl to sex symbol.  Befitting the huge venue at the MGM Grand, this show is about going big and making a huge splash, with a group of dancers supporting Spears in what are mostly energetic production numbers with impressive lighting and stage accoutrements.  A live broadcast with much at stake, made actually singing during these physically demanding dance routines impractical, so Spears lip synchs through almost the entire performance.  Even so she's hardly slacking off, \\"singing\\" and dancing through some complicated production numbers.  Judged by the audience's reaction, the popularity of the HBO broadcast, and DVD sales, her fans apparently have no major problems with Britney's performance.<br /><br />This well staged production allows the energy level to rise and fall, and the mood to shift.  The stage at the MGM's Grand Garden Court is unique, and the performance makes good use of the unusually shaped stage, which has a long runway, and also features various trapdoors.  This is Vegas after all, and the show has all the glitz, glamour, and sex appeal, you might expect.<br /><br />By the third song \\"Overprotected\\" Britney has hit her stride, performing in a circle of green lasers.  While Jon Voight provides an introduction, Britney makes her first costume change for \\"Born To Make You Happy\\" and \\"Sometimes\\", two of her less frenetic numbers.<br /><br />It's time to get nasty, as the ensemble rocks through \\"Boys\\" and the fireworks explode on \\"Stronger\\" as Britney takes command of the stage by herself, before being joined by her troupe of Cirqueish male dancers.  The native of Louisiana engages with the audience, and pays her respects to the US military, before proceeding to \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\", one of the few soft moments in the show.<br /><br />Britney and her female dancers perform a rousing version of \\"I Love Rock `N' Roll\\" on a suspended platform.  The stage band gets to play for a while, as Britney and the dancers prep for the show's final numbers.  Britney emerges dressed in a white gown to perform \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\" on a raised circular stand, with smoke billowing from the bottom.  Performed to a dollhouse theme, the bouncy \\"Anticipating\\" is a little girl's fantasy gone wild, as Britney continues to keep the audience involved and engaged.  But Britney being Britney, she can't stay a good little girl for very long, and she proceeds into an extremely provocative rendition of \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\".<br /><br />The show closes with an encore, a spectacular and wet version of \\"Baby One More Time\\" which opens with water sprinkling down on the stage, as a hologram of Spears appears in the falling water.  Rocking again on that suspended platform, Britney and her dancers are soaked to the skin.  Closing the show in a boldly unique, and sexy fashion.<br /><br />If you want to see Britney Spears in a glitzy musical extravaganza with lots of energetic dancing and edgy choreography, to the tune of prerecorded music, this is definitely the show for you.  While not a vocal performance in a true concert setting, Britney Spears works her butt off to entertain.  While perhaps intended equally for the eyes as well as the ears, ifyou are a Spears fan, that may not matter very much to you.  Unfortunately the DVD contains little in the way of extras, and it's disappointing that Britney never appears in the white glittered Elvis inspired jumpsuit, that is featured on the façade of the MGM Grand, and the DVD cover.ately the DVD contains little in the way of extras, and it's disappointing that Britney never appears in the white glittered Elvis inspired jumpsuit, that is featured on the façade of the MGM Grand, and the DVD cover.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|The entire order was perfect from clicking to shipping.  The movie is amazingly filmed and wonderfully scripted.  Most people have the common misconception that Requiem for a Dream is just a drug movie.  However, though drug use is extensive and used throughout the movie, it is just a story element being used to further the main story arch.  The movie is technically about four people trying to make it for themselves (live the American Dream).  Every character is shown falling apart because they are so determined to reach this fantasy life they crave.  The mother becomes obsessed with the chance to be on tv, and we a supposed opportunity came, she jumped at the chance.  They developed her character very well showing the loneliness, emptiness, etc that she feels.  All of a sudden, her dream come true actually seems attainable to her.  Naively, she turns to a quack doctor and puts her trust into him.  Eventually, instead of her dreams, her delusions become her reality as she succumbs to Amphetamine Psychosis.  Each character was developed in a similar manner.  They all wanted a piece of the dream and in the end, it was their determination and stubborn attitudes that gave away as they were crushed (metaphorically). It just so happens that they all chose a bad path to success.

B0012QE4Q2|4.0|This is an interesting \\"take\\" on the famous / infamous love affair between Henry VIII and his mistress & future queen, Anne Boleyn.  The central figure in the story is her sister, Mary (portrayed by Scarlett Johansson).  While everyone is @ least vaguely aware of Henry & Anne, the same cannot be said of Henry & Mary.  And yes, Mary and the English King has their own sexual liasons.<br /><br />Anne (Natalie Portman) is depicted as a very deceitful & conniving femme fatale in the present movie.  Her's is quite a controversial persona as the opinions of her have gone the full spectrum in the minds of various historians.  Or, to put it another way, there are probably as many differing views of Anne Boleyn as there are Medieval historians!<br /><br />Eric Bana is a solid choice to play King Henry.  Some may say he's too debonair & buffed to play Henry VIII, but this is simply not true.  Most people know Henry as the fatso he became in his latter years, but in the early yrs of his reign he was known as being a very dashing and athletic fellow.  Bana even looks a bit like him in a few of the sequences.<br /><br />***WARNING:  THIS MOVIE MAY LEAD TO SENSORY OVERLOAD IN THE SCENES IN WHICH NATALIE PORTMAN & SCARLETT JOHANSSON ARE BOTH ON THE SCREEN TOGETHER.  I had to keep a defibrillator by my couch while viewing the DVD ~ just in case.  Guess I'm getting old.<br /><br />The main \\"problem\\" with the present film is not with the acting, directing or the point-of-view of the story that it takes.  Rather, the difficulty lies with just how big a historical chunk that it's trying to bite-off in a very limited amount of time.  As such, it glosses over an awful lot & omits even more.  What the film-makers tried to do was the theatrical equivalent of fitting a cruise ship into a 2 stall garage.<br /><br />With that in mind, if you want a more ambitious & thorough rendition of what is really going on, I would HIGHLY recommend [[ASIN:B0042RJWTC The Tudors: The Complete Series]].  Michael Hirst's masterpiece is sure to fill in all of the blanks on what happened back in 16th century England.the blanks on what happened back in 16th century England.

B006OOHYIC|5.0|Quell beautifully combines artistic backgrounds,forefronts, and levels with zen like music, and the gameplay is simple yet intricate. The puzzles are challenging yet fun,and the perfect moves award adds good replay value. What's not to love about this amazing game?
B00004U45G|5.0|A very good piece of music. Even the song is ok.  It is only in my time of dying that you actually  miss Mr Plant.  This is close to the original.  With more people on guitar and keyboards this is a good recording.  The original recordings are better but this is close to it and with  much better soud than the seventies studio work gives you.
B005HSG3U6|4.0|I like this and is totally worth the price. Super easy to get on and the stand makes reading in bed a breeze.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The ability to have God's Word with you at all times is invaluable. I can't believe this app is free.

1583334386|5.0|In the middle of a successful diet plan, the book I eat and sleep with and owe my success to is The Willpower Instinct. I'm following it as author Kelly McGonigal's students would - reading one chapter a week, taking notes, thinking, journaling, and applying to my life. Once I became convinced that self-control was not really so much about charcter, moral principles, and laymen's psychology, but powerfully as much about physiology, then it became clear that some real self-control tools were available for all of us. The sum of the thinking and the tools are indeed accessible, useful, and undeniably potent. What I am moved to do is to ask my friends to join me in a 10-week Willpower Instinct discussion club to share journals and ideas together -- to get as real and practical as possible, brainstorming together to promote everyone's success at dieting, or whatever else folks want to have self-control over. If a book ever screamed for a workbook it's this one. Kelly, have you got one?<br /><br />Wonderful. This book is a masterpiece. Just right for the times.
B001CDLATE|5.0|The film, the transfer, the experience is nothing short of pure magic. Without a standard conventional plotline, baraka weaves us through the fabric of human existence and silently comments on our mark upon the earth and ourselves. They say a picture is worth a thousand words and every single frame of baraka states that which must be known and intellectually warps us into reassesing ourselves as human beings. The quality of the blu-ray is absolutely mind blowing and completely lives up to the review of \\"high quality transfer to date\\". This purchase is absolutely worth every penny.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|i am very happy thay i gave this app a chance.  so many games that you are bound to find your addiction!
B0074FV6XO|4.0|This was the first time I had gotten an episode from Amazon. It worked great for me! I missed it, and I just couldn't wait for it, so I stumbled upon this and had to buy it! I didn't have any problems at all with viewing it and such.  Now for the episode.. it was very good! There were some parts that seemed kinda slow to me, but over all a moving and sometimes funny episode lol.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this Bible app is amazing its like the best Bible ever I would recommend it to every one that's why its 5 star
B006W0QOF2|1.0|This is awful.  Complete lack of dialogue, little action, weak plot. This movie is just awful. Save your money and your time.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I love this case, it's just what I wanted. The elastic holds it firmly, without any wiggling, and it is firm enough to protect the screen. I noticed that some people had issues with it not closing flat. Before inserting the kindle, I took a moment to bend the case back and for a few times at each crease in the spine. It lays perfectly flat when closed, and seems to be a great fit.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|I bought this app for 2 dollars and it didn't even explain what to do when you get to the door. it just makes you press buttons on a door. I mean seriously at least tell me what to do
B004XE0P5E|1.0|Yech! Are you kiddin me? (coldplay ripoffs) Seriously, I really cannot see what all the hype is about? And now they get some press on yahoo for not playing the grammys? Yeah \\"bon iver\\" go on with your bad self (Ha!) Maybe with the little bit of extra money your gonna get from that you can hire a better artist for your next album!...
B005K17RU0|5.0|Works very well on the Kindle Fire. I love this app. Keeps me informed of weather in all locations I like to know.
0385528752|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this boo.  I think it helps you to understand better why most people are resistant to change and how to deal with it.  It is worth reading whether you want to change something in your personal life, family or your work place.  It uses lots of good documented examples that makes it even easier to relate to.  The authors are witty and entertaining.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I really like this app, but when the update came out it erased my progress. I was kinda mad, but I guess it gives me the chance to play longer and have more fun.
0307472590|5.0|Este libro se lo recomiendo a todos mis amigos.  No solo es de una calidad literia superior, pero es entretenido mientras nos transporta a Espana de la post-guerra.  Verdaderamente un clasico. Muy conmovedor
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|This movie is really no fun. What is the intended purpose? Do they consider kids are stupid and ignorant and only worth assisting dumb productions?
B0024RIMBG|3.0|The setting was fantastic and most of the music was equally wonderful. The ladies just have such beautiful voices. As with all of the Celtic Woman DVDs, there is no option for closed caption.  Most of the music does not need it. However, again as with all of their DVD releases, there are some songs that do - at least for those of us with hearing impairments.  While I love the music, this will probably be the last one I purchase, and it is simply because they use a recording company that refuses to try and meet the needs of many people that could use the closed caption option. Sad.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its really entertaining. expecally for getting my lil brother off my back for a couple of hours. really fun games for him to play
B0055SWM08|5.0|Super fun game very relaxing and good ambiant music.  A a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a .a!
B0063IH60K|5.0|fun is the only word I can use to describe this game.....you can customize your background..its just a lot of fun..I recommend it!!!!!!
B0070Z4M4I|5.0|I had no background on this movie, so I suspected it was just an updated remake of Carpenter's 1982 masterpiece of human will, cool gore, and pervasive paranoia.  Throw in a female as an updated protagonist, add some CGI, and you have a new remake.  It was produced by Norwegians, so I figured that accounted for the Norwegian -heavy cast.I had no idea until the credits started running, , and they started chasing the dog, that this was a PREQUEL to the 1982 film!  It sent chills down my spine when the realization hit me!  Awesome awesome awesome! Loved it!
B004XZR63M|4.0|The techniques conveyed in this book seem idea for obtaining substantial results through the minding my own business philosophy. The author's recollection of lessons learned in the past appear repeatedly throughout this book although, limiting this repetition would've reduced my thought of here we go again in other sections. I can only guess the author was attempting to drive the message into the reader's psyche on techniques that are proven to be successful. All and all I think it is a really good read.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I has a lot of Bible choices. On some of the Bibles there is audio. Great when encouraging youth who don't like to read. It also good when setting up reading plans and taking notes. A must have for any device or computer.
B006G2NVCA|5.0|The soundtrack is both completely appropriate in enhancing the excellent movie, and a decent atmospheric standalone piece of music. 3 discs full of brilliant work. Highly recommended if you like instrumental (mostly dark) music.
B005HSL626|5.0|I so love this game. My 11 year old daughter was playin it on her tablet and told me to try it. I've been hooked since! Very addictive game!!!
B005COO1X6|3.0|I usually like Stephen King's stuff, this one, not so much. The beginning of the book is great. He builds up the suspense and gets us into the story and then, all of a sudden, the end of the book is here. Of course there is a \\"sneak peak\\" of his new book 11/22/63, which is a really good book. I guess Mile 81 is an advertisement for 11/22/63?
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Thai is a decent app. Some of the games are a bit cheesy, but most of them are pretty addictive. Definitely a great way to pass the time. I recommend it!
B005LAIGPA|5.0|Perhaps no other phrase in the comic book genre applies to daily life as much as Spider-Man's famous, \\"With great power comes great responsibility.\\"  Such a phrase has guided Spider-Man throughout his career, but occasionally the thought comes up: what if he didn't follow this famous mantra, and instead used his powers for selfish reasons?  While \\"Chronicle\\" may not be related to Spider-man, it perfectly explores what would happen if the famous saying was ignored.  \\"Chronicle\\" follows three high school kids who have pretty ordinary lives: one is running for class president, one is the shy type whom nobody likes, and the last is the outgoing, energetic type.  One night, while at a rave, the three come across something mysterious, and find themselves in possession of powers that allow them to manipulate things with their minds.  As expected, they start off doing pranks (like using a leaf blower on skirts, for example), but as time goes on, being in possession of so much power can be dangerous...and even deadly.  Even among the glut of superhero and found-footage films, \\"Chronicle\\" manages to stand out, in most-part, due to that it's not really a superhero film: rather, it's really a story about how absolute power corrupts absolutely.  While I was watching the movie, I was really surprised to find myself being more interested in the teens, rather then the powers they wield.  All three are best friends, and they're good at heart, but are not above using their powers to mess with people's heads.  Andrew, in particular, is one of the most interesting film teenagers I've seen in recent memory, due to his miserable home life, and how he reacts with his new-found abilities.  Yet, from the beginning, it's clear that the power is inevitably going to corrupt the teens, which leads to a extraordinarily powerful third act that that genuinely had me more interested in what Andrew and the others were going to do, and not in the action that was taking place around them.  Even thoughthere have arguably been too many superhero and found footage films over the past few years, \\"Chronicle\\" manages to feel fresh and exciting.  While it's faults are few (the CGI is at times a bit obvious), the strength of it's storytelling more then makes up for any flaws.  It's an unexpectedly gripping and thrilling film that focuses on the emotional consequences of how extraordinary powers corrupt ordinary people, rather then on spectacle and action, as other films would have done, and for that, I highly recommend it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is beyond amazing! I have it installed on my Android phone and my Kindle Fire. I love the user friendliness and the many translations offered. Not to mention, the audio. It's not slow and lifeless like many others. It's actually soothing and easy to follow. This helps me stay in tune with God and keeps me on my daily readings. The reminder setting is phenomenal. The reading plans are a great feature too! It takes you through various sequences in the Bible in the order events happened. This app has been a true blessing to me.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is awesome when you are board and when you want to do something with your friends trust me it is awesome plz you have.to buy this
B0002V4SXC|5.0|I love Mark Knoffler!  I loved this in a regular CD, glad I invested to get it in 5.1.  Very impressive use of the 6 speakers!  Some people do not like the gimmicks with 5.1, I do, it has none of that and yet it is full immersion in the sound field.  Well worth it.  I love Brother's in Arms in 5.1 also!
B001E1B6NE|5.0|Great holiday movie for the family.  I would dare say its a new classic and if you order it through amazon you know it will be quick, easy, and affordable to get your hands on.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I don't know whether to give this game a good review or not. (Puzzles confusing but fun) It is extremely long and difficult. (Great time waster) Also the high resolution scenes hurts my eye. (Gorgeous graphics) It's too boring and looks very similar to Grisly Manor. Copycat! (Stays true to the original) The only con about this game would be: About time!
B0064NTZJO|5.0|Unless the viewer was looking for a comedy, there should be nothing close to a 1 star rating!  This movie was ridiculously siiiiick.  Ending could've been a little tighter, but the entire movie was nail biting.  Never knew Gosling had it in him.  Had a Scarface feel without the drug kingpin!  Highly recommended for anyone over the age of 18, looking to be entertained by a non-comedy!
B000002UB2|5.0|Fantastic analog LP. I consider it one of the best engineered albums ever made. A must have for all beatle fanatics. Many great songs on side A and B. Come Together, Maxwell's Silver Hammer, Something, Here Comes the Sun, and more.  Side 2 is classic. If you have never heard it, you should. It shows the talent and range of the beatles, and the  producing abilities of George Martin. My first order of an LP was defective. Shipped it back and got a new one with no issues. I am happy with the ease of dealing with a defective product with Amazon. Avoid the new remastered vinyl. They have digitalized the original analog master tapes and then converted it back to analog(the LP). The vinyl sounds like a CD. For original pure analog sound, look for good used albums from the 60's,70's, and 80's. You can even find new ones from that era if you want to pay a premium. I have found mint used ones for $15.00
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was recommended to my by a friend and is not a book I would normally select for myself.  This book was absolutely wonderful, in fact, I went on to read the rest of the series.  Excellent read.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The games are fun and run smooth on kindle fire. You should give it a try, I don't think you will be disappointed.
0307959856|2.0|I could, in good conscience, recommend this book to people who enjoy murder mystery novels, and who consider themselves knowledgeable fans of Jane Austen from having seen the BBC Pride and Prejudice, and enjoyed the screen adaptations of her novels.  For those true lovers of the Author, however, who have read all of her books, perhaps more than once, this is a sad and pointless excursion.  It is like drinking day-old, flat champagne left out all night straight from the bottle, instead drinking it perfectly crisp, bubbly, poured straight from the freshly opened bottle into an elegant crystal flute.  Quite simply, it lacks sparkle: the sparkle of romantic love, and the sparkle of the wit and satire which all true lovers of Austen love and admire.  P.D. James, in this novel, falls into what I think of as \\"ModernBritishAuthor-itis,:\\" the propensity to render contemptible all the characters in the novel.  In Death Comes to Pemberley, Darcy becomes a gloomy mass of insecurities, Elizabeth, the gauche, unpolished upstart that Lady Catherine always believed her to be, and even friendly, benign Colonel Fitzwilliam becomes grumpy and fatuous.  The genius of Jane Austen is that her characters, while all possessed of evident foibles, are compelling and lovable.  Even those characters that are broad caricatures, such as Mr. Collins and Mrs. Bennet, we dearly love to watch Austen mock; even those we despise, such as Wickham and Miss Bingley, we love to hate.  How do you write a sequel to Pride and Prejudice in which you leave Mrs. Bennet off-stage?  The best thing I can say about this novel is that P.D. James writes in a way that does convey her love and respect of Jane Austen, and demonstrates her obvious skill in crafting a mystery.  (Though I still think she should have killed Wickham off, in circumstances that made Mr. Darcy a possible suspect.  Then the reader might have actually have felt some concern about the outcome.)  The worst is, that it never once made me laugh.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game works well. Easy to get out of,when you get bored with it.  I like it.  I would recommend it, for a quick, fun game.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app works great on the Kindle Fire. You get pop up adds every now and then but not a big deal. It would be nice if they would stay the same position that you are holding the device.
1451648537|5.0|I was compelled by this read from the minute I picked it up until I turned the last page. Hitting high school in the mid 1980s, I was first introduced to home computers when my father brought home our first Apple iie. Friends from my high school would come over and do their computer projects on it because most homes did not have a computer at that time. To see the history prior to this and to be typing on such an advanced (and inexpensive) computer today (one that has such huge technological advances in such a short relative time), it is just amazing to me to see the progress made in the past 30+ years - much of which was made possible by Steve Jobs (among others)and his passion and overzealous drive for perfection and techno advances.<br /><br />I have to admit, I wanted to ring his little neck many times throughout the book. If he had been my son, I probably would have sent him to his room and put him on restriction to teach him to respect others, not be such a spoiled brat and to follow rules. That said, if his parents had restricted him, he wouldn't have had the drive and passion to \\"get what he wanted\\" and further the computer world to what it is today.<br /><br />The author did an amazing job and assuredly spent countless hours researching this biography as can be seen in the detailed situations and conversations throughout the book. I learned SO MUCH reading this book and have such a respect for Steve Jobs and others who paralleled his journey (in their own way). It is amazing to see all the new products he helped develop and to see them all over on the street. Whatever my personal opinion is of him, he had a passion, the focus and the drive to get things done.<br /><br />If you haven't read this book, DO!
B000F6IOC0|5.0|The video arrived as promised on time and in good condition.I was not able to download the digital copy, but that was probably because the movis is so old. But no problems with the DVD movie itself.
B00656C6KK|5.0|Totally awesome CD from Legendary Grammy winning singer Doris Day.  From Disney Girls, to You Are So Beautiful to the heart wrenching intro by Doris for her son singing Happy Endings. This music delights as she did when she sang her way into our hearts in the forties as a top notch band singer up there with the best. With My Heart Doris is back on the music charts. Que Sera, Sera for sure.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|I really enjoyed the first movie like so many others. However.. this is just something that is being shoved down our throats to milk us of another dollar.  This movie was just plain bad. If you didn't see it in the theater.. consider yourself lucky, and don't buy the DvD
B000ZN802W|5.0|I have watched this movie at least 15 times and I will certainly watch it another 15 times.  The main character leaves a prominent and affluent family on the east coast to live as a \\"leather tramp\\" out west.  He deliberately leaves his identification and money behind in order to live a kind of existence that is less about material things and more about the search of the soul and how the soul needs other souls to fully live.  I love it again and again and again.
B005MW8CLK|5.0|On one side you had Nirvana's Nevermind, while the other side was Pearl Jam's Ten. I was the one who sat on the fence listening to Gish, and I am still on  that fence.  As box sets go, in terms of respect to the Artist and quality ,  the box set equals Sub Pop's 20th A.... of Bleach by Nirvana (A document more than a box set)  and the The Smiths The Complete CD Box Set. And Jethro Tull's Aqualung 40th Ann.... ,Bob Dylan's Original Mono Recordings.  I do not mind the money side of life, when done with respect..
B000P3G8XK|5.0|This is the ultimate muscle movie.  The star of it all is of course Arnold and his interactions with other body builders and those in and around the sport during his last Mr. Olympia bid, until he came out of retirement after training for the movie \\"Conan the Barbarian.\\" You get to see these guys in their prime; Lou, Sergio, Mike Katz, Frank Zane, and so many other greats of the sport.  I will watch again and again.
B000EHSVS2|5.0|General George Patton was a high ranking officer of World War II. He placed himself within the historical significance of the war, and did this based on prior historical military engagements that had been fought on the same fields of battle.<br /><br />The film is a wartime biography of the General; the ups and downs that tell us so much about him. As a General he must have had political savvy to have risen to that rank. Nevertheless, he was always stepping on the toes of higher-ups and chastised for it.<br /><br />There is no doubt as to General Patton's contribution to the war, or his love and duty to country. Yet, he was a bit of a rebel.<br /><br />The first disc is the story PATTON.<br /><br />The second disc is filled with extra features on everything from the making of \\"Patton\\" to the staging of tank battles.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I knew that The Hunger Games was a popular book (and soon to be a movie) before I read it, but I didn't know much about it beyond that. I knew that it was something similar to Lord of the Flies or Battle Royale. But in reality, it is so much more. The storyline is extremely engaging, the characters are moving, the writing is excellent. I read it straight through in one sitting, which I definitely did not plan to do.  But it is not just a good book, a fun read. This is a book that, unlike the Harry Potter series, will get kids off the couch and adventuring in the big outdoors. There's no magic here, just ordinary people becoming tough and smart through fighting, and fighting back. It's a dangerous book, full of dangerous ideas; one that an oppressive government is bound to find unsuitable for its populace. I suspect that the true measure of its success won't be found in number of copies sold, but rather in number of copies banned and burned. It's that kind of book.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Many good points: easy verse search, many translations, easy to view, and best of all, it reads to you in a very professional manner.  I use it all the time to get insights for my Bible study.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was worried that Catching Fire would suffer in comparison to The Hunger Games. That it would be a weaker story with sloppier writing, that it would sag. I'm happy to say that it is much more of a smooth continuation of The Hunger Games, more like a second chapter in a long and carefully constructed story arc than a sequel. Once again, the writing is top-notch, the plot is very engaging, and the characters and dialogue are moving and believable. I very much like that the protagonist is, to her frustration, entirely out of her depth, not knowing what is going on around her or why, as wheels turn within wheels and events unfold with her as the unwitting centerpiece.<br /><br />This book makes Suzanne Collins' underlying motives much more clear. This isn't simply an adventure series. There's a strong political sentiment to these books, and it is quite infectious.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I think this game is fun and I think it is cool you can get new games.  The thing I do not like is that it takes a very long time to earn new games and it gets boring playing the same games to get new games.

B004EBUXSA|5.0|Well My computer hasn't hacked the internet and launched a nuclear holocaust yet. I love this processor! It converts full length movies in 10 min. Works well with my CoolerMaster Hyper 212 plus. My only complaint is the stock heat sink...if you want to do cpu intensive programs.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The game is really fun and addicting. I just wish that you didn't have to pay with free &quot;coins&quot; for every game you play. Over all, I reccomend it. (:

0545259088|3.0|I'm giving this three stars, because I mostly liked the storyline it kept me engaged and I wanted to read to the end of the book. But I had major issues with a lot of elements of this book, mainly the writing style.  Here are my issues with the writing style:  1. Wayyyy overuse of metaphors. When you have a metaphor in just about every sentence, there are too many metaphors! I was often tripped up by the vague metaphors, (which often didn't even make sense) and frequently had to pause to figure out what the heck the writer was talking about.  2. Too frequent change of narrator. I've never read a book before that changed narrators frequently in the same scene. It was really confusing -- but worse, the voices all started to sound the same. Which leads me to my next point.  3. The characters didn't always seem authentic -- Sam in particular. When I read Sam's chapters, I could clearly hear a woman's voice trying to speak/think like a teenage boy, which of course it was, in term's of a woman writing the book. Sam didn't feel authentic to me (not to mention his annoying broodyness).  My issues with the storyline mostly stem from a lack of payoff. **Spoilers follow**  One of the reasons I read the series to the end was because I was waiting for Cole's extensive \\"scientific\\" study to lead to a new revelation, and possibly a cure for all the werewolves, but we never got one! We only found out (through minimal trial and error) that adrenaline can provoke someone to shift, but there was no resolution in terms of finding a cure, except for the meningitis cure which we already knew about. I was really, really disappointed that this was never resolved, and even more bummed that we never even got to see Grace test the meningitis cure on herself, so we never know what happened to her. Also -- if the meningitis cure worked, why didn't they inject all the wolves with it? And why didn't that ever even come up?  My favorite part of this book was the minimal interaction between Cole and Isabel, which I thought had way more fireworks than Grace and Sam's boring relationship, and that was never resolved either. I guess Isabel is off in California? And she never even saw Cole again? But we don't know, because it was never resolved. When I got to the end of the book, I honestly felt cheated, since in my mind a lot was left hanging.  I guess I would recommend this series if you have nothing else to do/read. It's better than a lot of the other young adult fiction out there, but that's not saying much, unfortunately! Like I said, I liked the storyline, but the writing style drove me bonkers. If Maggie Stiefvater could stick with one narrator for at least an entire scene, and watered down her heavy handed use of metaphor, I think her other books would be a lot better.
B0063IH60K|4.0|my only wish is that the game would let u know when no more moves available.  love the card choices and the background.  not a fan ot green so changed to blue.
B0062HS03O|2.0|some parts, of this gig, are very nice, many others very boring and ... she talks too much, often get bored with repetitive phrases.  The show is overwhelming but it is not anything new, everything already seen!
0312641893|4.0|I absolutely loved that this was set in futuristic China rather than the US like so many other novels are. The author's descriptions of New Bejing are wonderful. We get plenty of little details that made it easy to imagine. There's androids, hover vehicles, littered streets, netscreens, and holographic fires. The Emperor's palace is an amazing mash-up of sleek futuristic technology and ancient Chinese design. Everything is just super imaginative, but not too out there.<br /><br />The characters also had a lot more depth than the fairytale. Cinder is not only mistreated by her stepmother, but she's also looked down upon by those in society who know she is a cyborg. Cinder tries to blend in as much as possible and earns her keep as a mechanic. Her stepsister, Pearl, is cruel towards Cinder, but her younger sister, Peony isn't. Even though that strays from the original, I loved that Cinder had at least one person who cared for her. Cinder loves her little sister very much, and I felt so awful when her one ally is taken away by med-droids after contracting the plague. At that point Cinder's life as she knows it changes forever.<br /><br />Cinder now has to deal with her stepmother's backlash, since she blames Cinder for her youngest daughter's illness as well as her husband's death. It's no secret that Adri is disgusted by Cinder and wants her gone. Cinder also gets sold off to become a lab rat in order to find a cure for the plague, but her test results reveal a lot of unknown things about her heritage. There's a bit of a mystery surrounding that, but it was very predictable. However, that didn't keep me from enjoying it.<br /><br />In addition to the new technology and the swiftly spreading disease, Cinder also covers some of the politics of the time. The moon is now inhabited by Lunars and a peace treaty is needed between them and Earth. However, the Lunar queen, Levada, is a horrible woman! She wants what she wants, and she wants it now! She'll stop at nothing to gain power and take control of Earth, but Prince Kai does his best to not allow it. Kai has a huge burden to carry, but he still manages to be incredibly charming. Unfortunately, Cinder makes sure to keep him at a steel arm's length.<br /><br />Cinder is a highly imaginative retelling of Cinderella! It keeps just enough of the original premise in tact to make it recognizable, but it also has plenty of unique features to set it apart. It's also full of characters that you'll both love and hate, and maybe love to hate! This book is full of twists and turns for our heroine, but she handles them to the best of her ability. The ending has left me wanting more! Damn that cliffhanger!arth, but Prince Kai does his best to not allow it. Kai has a huge burden to carry, but he still manages to be incredibly charming.

0062082353|1.0|Chris jumps over the details and never explains why things happen. Over and over he leads up to a situation and then it's over and he can't wait for that next step. He's always pi--ed and ready for a fist fight. He misses a chance at telling us a great story and feeling good about the SEAL's role in defending everything we love about the USA. On the other hand, he never misses an opportunity to throw in another: some kinda sh--, you motherfu--er, or go fu-- yourself detail! Made himself out to be too dumb to find his way out of a paper-sack. Made me sick and sorry I spent money on it. Didn't finish it and never going back! We all lose on this book.
B006T5FDLG|1.0|Just four more pop rock infused attempts at metal.  Same whimpy breaks in the songs from load to dm, same maaaaaa sheep vocals over done to the point of cheese, horrid drumming, dr.

B002VWNIAY|5.0|Every scene in Casablanca is a triumph of art.  While I have many favorite scenes such as the musical 'battle', they all build inexorably toward the climax of the love scene at the end. The many relationships within the cast are all solidly structured including Rick and Sam, who seizes control at times (much like Mammie in GWTW).  Like many fans of Casablanca, I could write thousands of words before touching lightly on all of this movie's virtues.  (BTW, shooting for Casablanca began the day I was born.)

B001GCUNYO|5.0|Taken is one of those action packed movies that makes you not want to blink, for fear that you might miss something. Liam Neeson is a wonderful actor; hardcore, and ruthless without even batting an eye when necessary, yet looks suave and innocent, until rubbed the wrong way. It gave the viewer action, suspense, and made ever minute well worth watching. While I by no means condone killing; Mr. Neeson actually made it interesting to watch. Taken, has definitely made it to my favorite movies of all time list. I highly recommend this movie, and I give it 5 stars.

1932907009|5.0|Blake Snyder, master of the screenplay, shares his unique insight and talent with us in his masterwork, \\"Save the Cat!\\"  The man who brought us the sublime wit and sharp dialogue of \\"Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot!\\" and \\"Blank Check\\" now reveals his surefire secrets of the black art of dramatic writing in this indispensable volume.  Forget your Philistine preoccupation with trying to write the next \\"Citizen Kane\\", \\"Sunset Boulevard\\", or \\"Casablanca\\".  Those films,  you will learn, suck mightily compared against the awesome dramatic power and life-changing scope of films like \\"Miss Congeniality\\" and \\"Legally Blonde\\".  Is the Academy blind, deaf, and dumb?!  Why do they insist on handing out Oscars to boring, senseless dreck like \\"Amadeus\\", \\"No Country for Old Men\\", \\"The King's Speech\\", or \\"The Departed\\", while overlooking masterpieces like \\"Outbreak\\", and \\"Mean Girls\\"?  Why, or why, did these paragons of subtlety, so worthy of the attention lavished upon them by a master screen writer such as Snyder, not get the recognition they deserved?<br /><br />If you want to write trite, shallow, commercial garbage like \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\", \\"The Wild Bunch\\", or \\"The Godfather\\", turn instead to some hack like Robert McKee (who has never had a feature film produced!).  But if you want to create work of literary distinction that will stand the test of time, then Snyder is your man.<br /><br />I urge you to check out his ouvre, to see for yourself the level of craftsmanship embodied in his work, before you buy this book - the better to appreciate the nuance and flavor of his approach - the precision, the distinguishing, singular vision - that separates his genius from that of the merely \\"average\\" dolts like Robert Towne or William Goldman.  Imagine how much more successful bombs like \\"The English Patient\\", \\"Chinatown\\", or \\"Midnight Cowboy\\" could have been, if only their authors had access to Snyder's brilliance.<br /><br />It's a shame.
0312641893|4.0|I'll admit the first chapter I was scratching my head in confusion while I worked on assimilating myself into this world. But after I got comfortable, I couldn't put the book down!<br /><br />Cinder is a cyborg who is the best mechanic in town, which is pretty strange for a teenage girl. She is in her shop when Prince Kai comes in to have her work on his android. And the romantic spark begins...well sort of. I did appreciate it wasn't insta-love at first sight.<br /><br />The Lunar people...man, how do I even explain them? Pretty scary, is what. The fact that they can glamour people to listen and agree with whatever they want, that put me on edge. I can't imagine having to deal with that on a political or even a personal level.<br /><br />While I pretty much guessed the story's outcome within the first three chapters, it didn't make it any less of an enjoyable read. I still found myself entirely engrossed in this book.<br /><br />The story itself ended on a cliffhanger which will lead fabulously into the second book, which I definitely want to read!<br /><br />I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome game Im hooked love the puzzles. prides for some games are a little high towards the end. other than that it rocks. so download this
B004RCUJ9E|4.0|Great game, but does anyone know how I can prevent apps that I purchased on the Amazon Appstore for Android (where it indicates the app is current) from showing up on the Android Market (where it indicates an update is available), and vice versa?  This game is a great example.  Amazon Appstore for Android indicates it's up to date, but the Android Market constantly notifies me an update is available.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this app combines simplicity with complexity, and is as challenging as understanding this statement! definitely worth the dollar, or 99 cents, whatever
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Kudos to Hugh Howey and hope he becomes widely popular. What a fun and thrilling read. Can't believe this is just $4.99.

Hugh Howey, you just won yourself a fan.

B005DKLPRE|4.0|ok, let me explain myself.  it all sounds good, yah? the remasters are well done, which I knew from singularly buying queen is dead. The vinyl takes a few moments to get but as always it sounds better. My problem, and maybe I'm the only one who thinks this, is an original version of THIS CHARMING MAN appears NOWHERE on the whole boxset! How can I begin to describe my frustration?  I know, I know, I'm a sucker for thinking the original was going to be on the first album when it was actually a bonus track on the us version, but ******, I was used to it! Include the ******* thing! I have pretty much everything else here (including the exceptional louder than bombs which carries most of the excellent original versions of the singles) including repeats of singles collections, which for some ungodly reason never seem to include this charming man!  listen, I bought this boxset for one reason and one reason only: louder than bombs. but then of course within the past couple of months, and only then, did I realize there was this AMAZING song I had never heard before (because I always just went by the albums) and that was THIS CHARMING ******* MAN. [while charming man was on first album as a bonus track, I never really noticed it because the early remasters sound like a flat tire...I really first noticed charming man after recently viewing that totps video of them doing it, and my god is it beautiful] It has literally become my favorite song, and it's stuck in my head all the time now. Ever since I heard it in a restaurant I have been on a ******* smiths RAMPAGE.  but no, hatful of hollow has the peel sessions version, which sucks and doesn't pull you in like the better version the band eventually made. You're telling me you couldn't put it on the world won't listen? really? perhaps it's not johnny marr's fault, that he obligingly went out to rerelease the original albums and couldn't be bothered about lost singles, and his little plan was very simple and didn't need details,but my god! their best song missing? are you ******* kidding me!?  this box set would be perfect, but now I'm completely let down. some guy for some record company somewhere thought it would be a good idea to nix tcm because, what, they'd sell more singles? this is a huge oversight! add it as a bonus to the world won't listen, for ****'s sake! add it anywhere! I don't care! just include it!  ***********************************!!!!!!!  now I have to go out and buy the original single (not possible since prohibitively expensive everywhere on vinyl) or go out and get the 2008 reissue from the box set (surprised anyone's selling it individually) and pay three times what I should. but you know what? 45 singles are an annoyance to me! I don't want to have to consciously put on that single every time I hear that song. I want the ******* song on a ******* album so I can hear it along with other classics whenever I want! dam!!!!!!!  ugh. anyways, my little tirade is over. I'm sorry if I offended. it's just you pay money you expect people to get the basic stuff right. It's my fault for not looking at the track selection close enough, but I never should have had to. TCM should have ******* been included.

B0067QPVJ6|1.0|OK, a few minutes-long bits of the creature were scary, BUT...just quick impressions: Lead \\"lady paleontologist\\" looked way too much like Alix Borstein (sp.?) of the much-missed Mad TV show (prompting one to wonder \\"how would Ms. Swann handle this??\\"), the \\"Thing\\" looked pitiably & hurriedly thrown-together, in one early scene like a stucco-covered coffee table w/ a couple skinny limbs stapled to it; every tedious time it scuttled (ALWAYS belatedly on fire), out of the room,I figured it was ashamed of its jerry-built appearance. No PASSION, no daring,no character development,way too many milling Norwegian scientists, not enough creature scenes for cryin' out loud !!! BORING, yes, boring, the unforgivable sin in a horror flick, one would think.  Everytime some bozo picked up a flamethrower, I flashed to \\"Burn it, Giles!\\", & the great interplay between that hard-ass McCready & that equally hard-assed Giles. And that last Thing appearance in the space ship, here's a grim, sneering all-too-human human FACE slapped on the front of it like an afterthought, sorry, folks, it was just too funny, but what a colossal waste of anyones  moviegoing time & dollars. You've been warned...
B000000WJZ|4.0|I think this is the best Smashing Pumpkins album. Not too much of their quiet stuff. Loads of loud, snarling guitars, and sneering from Billy Corgan. Cherub Rock, Disarm, and Today are among my favorite Pumpkins tunes. Settle back and play it LOUD !
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a great game and it's free so I'd suggest to anyone to get it.  It can be difficult but still has easy simple movements for the games.  Also a very wide variety.
B0040JHWKS|4.0|The Promise contains some material that you probably heard about, but had never heard. Brice's version of the Patti Smith hit, \\"Because the Night\\", written by Bruce, is one of the many highlights. This is for Bruce completists, by more casual fans will enjoy too.

B003S897UK|4.0|More quality blues rock from the Mule. As much as I enjoy the current Mule lineup, it is good to hear Alan Woody on the bass, from New Years Eve 12/31/99.  As always, an excellent mix of originals and covers, with a set highlighted by singer Little Milton. The Mule had backed up Little Milton on his recent album at the time; this is a great live treatment of those tunes. Go get it.

B003Y5H4Y8|5.0|What is there to say about Ms. Mirren.  She can do no wrong.  As usual, she has totally immersed herself in a role of a tragically wounded and physically scarred woman that is forced by circumstances to confront a devil from her past.  A brilliant performance that is full of subtley realized action and drama.
0307593312|1.0|I'm about 700 pages in and for the past 100 pages I have been wishing it would all just END. I have to say, I didn't find the book all that interesting to begin with but here are the things I like the least:  1.  I was first put off by the authors complete preoccupation with breasts.  Each woman character has multiple breast descriptions- practically every scene she is in.  Even the children get descriptions like \\"and her chest had not begun to swell yet.\\" Um, ew. Also, I get to hear about the characters nipples getting hard on waaayyy too many occasions. I feel like I am reading the work of a 14 year old boy who is busier doodling anime characters all over the pages than thinking of a readable story to write.  Not only is that a terrible way to create a picture in my mind of the character (unless I want to be able to identify her by her boobs) but it adds NOTHING to the story.  2.  So my first complaint about the book would have been enough for me to put it down, but I got it from my husband for Christmas so complaint 2----  The REALLY WEAK love story line going on.  So I am supposed to believe that the 2 main characters have some sort of \\"connection\\" from their holding hands once in 5th grade?  Oh right, there is something \\"special\\" about their connection... but here I am on page 700 and they still haven't even met.... I'M BORED.  UPDATE:  I got through it and it really didn't get any better.  I'm glad I finished it but I really don't recommend anyone read this book.  3.  I feel the style of writing where each character has a chapter to have their perspective detailed is generally  a lazy writers way to try to add a certain dynamic to his/her writing but 1Q84 takes this style to the extreme.  1/3 of the way through the book he goes from 2 character perspectives to 3, adding an addition layer of boredom for the reader because at page 700, none of these character have met.  I am reading the day-to-day boring life of each person, one monotonous chapter after another.4.  The detail, oh the detail!  This could easily be a 200 page book but Murakami is careful to go into great detail about things like: the ingredients of the characters food (for each meal),  repetitive physical descriptions, repetitive \\"flashback\\" scenes, the day-to-day activities of the characters, and more stuff that you don't care about and do nothing to add to the story.  I read one review that advised that he had taken to skipping entire paragraphs... not a bad idea really since none of the incredibly boring details has been connected to anything- it is truly just filler.  Finally, if I make it through the next 250 pages and find that the end of this book makes  sheer boredom of reading it somehow worth it, then I  will give you all an update.  My advice though, is to not get yourself in this situation and just don't start reading this weird snoozefest in the first place.
B004T32SOK|4.0|Although SugarSync has many robust features, sometimes you just want something that simply works without all the configuration hassle. Initially I wasn't a Box.net fan/User, but I recently gave them another chance and their service has improved significantly! They are getting closer to Dropbox status. They still don't offer cloud to desktop syncing for free, but if you don't need that function, I'd suggest giving theme a second look. Thanks for reading my review.

B0070Z4M4I|5.0|This movies stands on its own and is more entertaining than any of the much more glorified current releases.  Will keep you glued to the television from start to finish.  Unbelievable that this was done by a first time or little known director.  Casting was perfect.  The girl was pretty enough to enjoy looking at for the length of the film but still believable in the action scenes, the monster was plenty scary and original and it mattered none whether it was partly or all cg.  They did a real nice job of blending languages with the dialogue and the story was engaging.  This was the last of the new releases that I rented because I really didn't think it was going to be very good based on what I had read in the reviews.  Personally I was more entertained by this \\"prequil\\" than Carpenter's version.  I didn't start watching it until after midnight and didn't move until it was over.  Well worth the rental fee.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|This is the second book I have read this week about a creative genius who is no longer with us. The other one, which is also a great read is:  [[ASIN:B0073VDKZG Michael Jackson...Sex, Drugs and Rock & Roll: The Truth About the Man Behind The Legend]]  Both give fascinating insights into what drives people like these to achieve so much, and how fragile it all is.  But I don't think there will be another Steve Jobs...he was one of a kind.
B006W0QOF2|5.0|Very well done.  The opening drive scene is very cool.  Never seen anything like it and the whole thing is very entertaining.  Well worth the rental fee.
0307279189|5.0|I'm not even a runner, but thought this book was awesome. It is a great story about ultramarathoners, a historical book of an Indian running people, anthropology of human evolution, history of the sport including how we got the current types of shoes, and an alternative view on how humans were meant to run. Really something in here for everybody with great characters that you end up cheering for through the book.
0385504209|5.0|[[ASIN:0307474275 The Da Vinci Code]]Whether it be based in fact or totally fiction, the story is GREAT! I couldn't put it down. Dan Brown in on my top 10 list of favorite authors and story tellers. He really pulls you in from the first paragraph and takes you on an exciting ride that never disappoints. I rarely read books twice, but after a couple years, I reread after I had read Angels & Demons. Both excellent reads.
1601251505|5.0|Simply by page count, at 576 pages this book is a steal for the price its being sold for. Those pages aren't lacking in content either; the book is chock full of so much material to play a game of Pathfinder it makes you wonder how Paizo thought they would keep customers returning after putting everything into the core book. The answer is of course the very thing that makes this book work so well; a respect for its reader, and a very high level of quality. Instead of spamming its pages with boxed quotes, or needless fluff that will get skimmed over on each reading, Paizo has kept everything succinct. There are patches of world flavor, with very short stories and brilliant art, but they are only used to give a feel for each chapter's contents, and don't ramble on past that point.<br /><br />In short, this is an RPG core book that understands the purpose of an RPG core book. It doesn't need to be fancy, it needs to have a lot of basic content and rules that can be easily referenced and read. The fact that the books artwork is absolutely stunning doesn't count against that though.<br /><br />The game itself is immense fun, and from a simple price point buying the two books you need for Pathfinder (The Core Book, and the Bestiary) ends up being much cheaper then its now 2nd place market competitor D&D, which requires three books. This core book is two of those books put together essentially (hence the 576 page count), but is still priced as one book.<br /><br />Its cheap. Its fun. Its very well done and very high quality. I didn't think Pathfinder was going to live up to the hype I heard about it, but I am gladly eating my words now. Well done Paizo!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is a fun time waster.  I love how you can unlock many different levels. kind of addicting though.
B005T87QCI|1.0|it was terrible,the app didn't even install and I had to waste 2.00$ and it didn't even download. don't buy it
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I love the quality of this set. It's just what you think it should be. For an example my 18 year old newphew was suprised by the picture while we were watching \\"Empire\\". He actually said \\"It looks like it was just shot this year\\" and that a lot of newer movies don't look that good.  It's a great set. At first the extras seem few. But, there is a lot of small interviews and overviews, concept art and back story of each movie on the first bonus disc. The two best parts of the bonus discs are on bonus disc two. \\"Star Warriors\\" and \\"A Conversation With The Masters\\". Star Warriors is all about the \\"501st\\", cool stuff. Plus, the extras include three classic documentries of Ep. IV, V, and VI. There's also spoofs, Star Wars Tech and much more.  I have all the other releases of these films, and I did wounder about getting this. Now, that I have it. I'm glad. The picture and sound is will worth it.

B0073Q0DZG|1.0|Not only was this bad it was really bad. Poor acting, poor story and too long.  What I find entertaining about this little gem of a movie is that every last problem the characters have, can be solved with copious amounts of money, and driving.  Rubbish like this portrays a way of life that does not really exist, thankfully the characters in this movie were either wealthy New York ad executives, or had their Daddy cover the costs of their fun when they are 36 years old. I marvel at the level of delusion in this film. Since I am not a wealthy executive I am now out of $3.99, money that would have been better used if thrown in the street.

B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Evernote is one of the best cloud-based apps on the market.  It's very convenient to have access to your notes from practically any device.  Two things are needed for me to give 5 stars: 1) improve text editing and 2) need a way to secure access to your notes.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this program and probably will end up subscribing to it but was disappointed to find out that for all features to be used, a subscription was necessary.  Of course, it may have said that when I signed up for the free account and I might have missed it.  Either way, it's a great program that I know I'll get a lit of use out of and it works seemlessly with my Kindle Fire!
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is an  intense 20 minute workout.  It's good for those times when you want to work out but don't have a lot of time.  For me it's a \\"no-excuse\\" workout because no matter what my schedule, I can find 20 minutes!
B005TBWN0K|4.0|Works great on the Kindle Fire. Like to have access to a quick and very user-friendly sketch &quot;book.&quot; Interfaces well with Evernote to add graphics. Somewhat limited color palette but can't really complain when it's free!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When i first started reading this book itwas a little slow but still loved it. i'm glad i found this series because i am a picky reader and for a little while i didn't like to read. this book is packed with action, saddnes, romance, suspense, and more! i couldn't put the book down for a second!
B005ZUR724|5.0|Wonderful game if you appreciate MMO's. Monthly fee is totally affordable, as are the in game items;which are optional to purchase with real money (as opposed to other games that force you to pay or else you cannot progress in the game.) AND when you first purchase the game, they give you 3-6 months free.
B0057RCFQS|4.0|I got this DVD for my mom for her birthday and she was so excited when she opened her present! She is a monster/dinosaur fan so she was completely in love.  I was very impressed with how fast it was delivered and how amazing the clarity was on this DVD collection. I bought this wonderful set brand new, still in the plastic wrapping, but when my mom and I watched the second and third movie, the DVD actually froze for one second and then continued. Just the one freeze-up on each DVD, but besides that nothing else happened. It bummed me out that a brand new movie would do that considering we just opened it and it had not been touched by anyone else except the manufacturers.  Besides those two freeze ups with the two DVDs, the movies were incredible! Thanks!
B004132I20|5.0|I don't think there can be much more said about how amazing Sherlock is.  I've watched many, many different renditions of Sherlock Holmes and none of them have grabbed me the way this Sherlock and John have.  Everyone should watch Sherlock, it's amazing.

B00005221M|1.0|Don't buy it! This is not the \\"Director's expanded edition\\". I was scammed!  It's a different dvd version, a badly composed one. Funny, they don't even try to make it look similar to the product advertised - they just shove a different dvd with a different cover picture right in your face... too bad i forgot what the cover looked like at amazon's page - and opened it, and even watched it - which was not enjoyable,by the way.. Returning it to bring it to amazon's attention, not for the sake of a refund...

B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is very useful when you are bored. what I don't like is that to unlock games you need certain amour of points
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Fantastic app. so much functionality in such a small program. You have so many options you'll try to find new ways to take notes or add new things to your notes just to use this elephant better. other note taking apps are like jeeps, good for just getting around. Evernote is an Apollo rocket, this thing will fly you to the moon.

B006T4NQNO|4.0|\\"Anodized\\" implies that this is a metal (aluminum) ring that has been plated. The ring I received is plastic. It fits my Canon SX40, and it holds 67mm filters, but I expected metal construction.  EDIT 2/6/12: While not thrilled about the plastic construction, these appear to be materially the same as the official Canon product. If installed carefully the adapter fits snugly. If the adapter is installed carelessly it will leave a gap.  Installation: Align the dash inside the filter ring with the dash on the lens mount, then turn clockwise 90deg so the dot on the filter ring is aligned with the dash on the lens mount.
B003Q6D25K|2.0|This movie isn't real.  It's actually done in a Hollywood set and uses \\"footage\\" to convince people that this is actual footage.  In the credits at the end of the movie it clearly says that this isn't a good movie.  If this movie had actual footage, then sure it would shock me like it's shocking a lot of people.  But now that I know it's fake, the whole point of this movie is pretty much destroyed.  There's really no point in watching it unless you want to pretend this is actually happening.  If you want fantasy scary movies, there's a lot better titles out there that are scarier.
B003Y5H5HY|4.0|Tonight I went to see the American version of the movie \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\", which is a remake of the excellent Swedish movie of the same name, which was based on the outstanding book of the same name written by Stieg Larsson.  I'm pretty certain that I was captivated by the story since I have the Larsson trilogy  in hard cover, Kindle edition, Audible edition as well as owning the Swedish movies (which I have watched in both the English dubbed version and the subtitled version).<br /><br />I waited for weeks before going to see the American version, because we Americans tend to go for the heavy action and drama and sex and violence while forgetting the story.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Since this is a blog and not a movie review, I will talk about the story and characters first.<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist are two of the most interesting characters ever written.  There is something so compelling about each.<br /><br />Lisbeth is a world class computer hacker with a photographic memory who may have some form of autism.  She has a complex past that is not unveiled in the first book, but we are given hints based upon her being a ward of the state, requiring a guardian to oversee her financial and personal life.  While many say she anti-social, I see her as asocial.  And she is a very strong, unique female who depends only upon herself for survival.<br /><br />Mikael is a brilliant journalist who is fiercely dedicated to the moral fight against unscrupulous businesses.  He is incorruptible, and has many affairs without emotional attachment.  He is one of the few people to see Lisbeth for who she is, and not as she presents herself to the world.<br /><br />About the movies.  Had I not read the books, or seen the Swedish films, I would like have rated the American version very highly.  It was an excellent thriller.  It just didn't have the bite of the original and the characters were missing the depth that make them so unique.<br /><br />The American Remake<br />The Good:<br />Filmed in Sweden, which maintained the authenticity of the story.<br />Some of the actors were simply excellent.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />The opening with the credits was just weird.<br />The score was so loud throughout the movie that it was often difficult to hear what the actors were saying.<br /><br />The Strange:<br />The movie at times held tightly to the story as written by Larsson, while other aspects were changed completely with no value added to the film.  It felt that the makers of the American film wanted to change something, anything, to make it unique.<br /><br />The Comparison:<br />Original Swedish film<br />* Noomi Rapace captured Lisbeth perfectly,showing both her strength and vulnerability - she is very much a mystery<br />* Focused more on Blomkvist, his personal relationships, the Wennerstrom affair, problems at Millennium<br />* The musical score was so right for the movie it is virtually unremarkable<br />* Michael Nyqvist portrays Blomkvist as an ethical and moral balance to Lisbeth's questionable hacker practices<br />* Harriet - story remains true to the book<br />* Lisbeth's history is unknown, making the character even more interesting<br />**** Outstanding<br /><br />American remake<br /><br />* Rooney Mara was too chatty for Lisbeth, and showed none of the vulnerability - more of a cold robotic figure who is a badass<br />* Ignored prison time for Blomkvist.  Like the legal system just forgot?<br />* The musical score was amazing, but too loud and better suited to a musical CD<br />* Daniel Craig looks gorgeous, but the character is somewhat bland and is secondary to Lisbeth in this film<br />* Harriet's story is not only left out, but rewritten in a way that loses the impact<br />* Chatty Lisbeth gives us her history, lessening the impact of the story<br />**** Very Very Goodmaintained the authenticity of the story.  Some of the actors were simply excellent.  The Bad:  The opening with the credits was just weird.

B0073LWEXK|5.0|I've been waiting for another game like this from them! This one is even better. Awesome graphics, great music and lots of fun! well worth the price. I hope they make another!
B005QPMB2Y|5.0|Awesome app... Bad reviews don't get what ip cams are. You need your own cams, the traffic cams are just for show. If you have ip cameras or a network dvr this app is one of the best out there. Tiny cam is a nice alternative.... Still waiting for audio support on Wansview 536 megapixel...
B0068TL23G|4.0|Challenging puzzle game in which you have to connect the same colored dots together, but without crossing each others path. Sometimes only 3-4 colors and sometimes 7-8 colors. Sometimes using a large rectangular board and sometimes using a smaller odd shaped board. Solving the puzzle by using the shortest possible path nets you 5 stars for that level and one star point, which can be used towards hints when you're stuck.  One major problem I have found is that the music often continues playing if you just exit to the home screen without actually exiting the game. Sometimes the music will stop and then randomly start playing again when you're in the middle of a phone call! It's very sporadic. Just be sure to use the back arrow to exit, which prompts an actual exit menu, and you'll be golden.
B0059QJ6HI|4.0|The movies covers the twisted turns of two brothers and their families. Suffice it to say that events turn completely, and in unexpected ways. The film is not unlike a Greek tragedy, and to say the least, pulls at your heart.  The acting is superb, and the cinematography matches the drama as it unfolds. It is quite a story, and well worth the investment of time.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|not many games hold my interest, but both this and Grisly Manor by Fire Maple are fantastic.  Beautiful, not too difficult that I cant figure out the puzzles on my own (mostly), all around great.  Anxiously awaiting Fire Maple's next offering!

B005T87QCI|4.0|cool game to pass the time. but needs zeuz atom twin cities. I thought this was going to have those guys. especially when atom is on the front cover
B004UA8D2S|4.0|This film should be watched for what it is, a fascinating and mesmerizing action-adventure flick. The acting is way above average for this type of film and it is well-paced and beautifully photographed. It takes the viewer to places few of us can ever hope to see. The primary interest, aside from the amazing atomsphere and scenery, is the psychological reaction the characters experience when they realize they are trapped in a life-or-death situation. Thanks to solid performances from the mostly Aussie cast, we feel their struggle and desperately hope for a satisfactory outcome. I agree that the script could have been better-crafted in order to provide the characters with a more humane perspective rather than the cliched, every-person-for-himself mentality we're shown. But the bottom line is that this film will remain with you long after you viewed it, giving you pause and wonder about this amazing rock we call earth.

B005KJJ4F8|4.0|I was caught up immediately with the characters & setting after reading the first five chapters. I bought the book immediately after that. I rolled along a good while but honestly between books 2 & 3 I was waiting for the story to engage me again. Maybe this is because I could see the big reveals coming & I just wanted to get to it already so we could get on to the exciting bit after. I'm not sure if that's a problem with the storytelling pace or that I'm not necessarily the intended target audience. I rooted for Cinder, Iko, Kai & Peony throughout.Cinder was a fun heroine & a refreshing change from the sort who seem to pervade YA (many books, in general), who don't seem to have any talents whatsoever but are still supposed to be special. Cinder may not have known her bigger destiny but she knew she was a kickass mechanic & I loved that! I wanted to know much more about the Lunars that we actually find out because I found the idea of them extremely fascinating. I will definitely read the next in the series.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I find it difficult to tell someone about this story without crying. It is just a really moving story and the ending was phenomenal. There are many detailed reviews here but I just wanted to add that this story taught me that children can be much more resilient than we could ever anticipate and (SPOILER) I loved how Jack innately knew what his mother needed to do in order to let go and begin healing.
B005ZUR724|4.0|This game is beautiful. It is fun and has a cheap subscription fee for anyone who is going to get it. I bought this game for a dollar and impressed with everything. My only complaint is that the camera won't respond well.
B000001Y79|4.0|This is still, in my opinion, the best No Doubt album. They quickly ventured away from the ska sound after this, which wasn't the worst move since ska faded pretty quickly from popular music. The lyrics are really aimed at teen girls, but in a smart way that I can still appreciate as an adult.
B002UM5BXW|2.0|it gets old. I had such a hard time getting to the end, it just went on and on. I can't stand to not finish a book so I kept at it, but really who can talk about themselves that much? I felt so sorry for his wife by the end, since he admitted more than once that he does not listen to her...you know food on the brain and all.
B001HN6918|5.0|We really loved the movie so of course we love the dvd! Sound, picture, everything is great. In terms of special features they have \\"Kickin It With The Cast\\" which is about 13 minutes of behind the scenes footage with the different major characters in the film as well as with the producer and director talking about the film and what the different actors brought to their parts. It was very fun to watch! There are also 3 deleted scenes each with a small intro from the director. There is a commentary (which I haven't yet listened to) with the director, producer, production designer and the person who was supervising animator, kung fu choreographer and story artist. I think if you liked the movie you'll like the dvd :)
0897502027|5.0|Bruce Lee was more than just a movie star.  He proves that with Tao of Jeet Kune Do which has given me much more than any other Martial Arts book I've read to date.  He advanced the Art form and I highly recommend Tao of Jeet Kune Do.

B006H3MIV8|5.0|I am admittedly a big Bob Dylan fan and probably have 40 of his albums and tribute albums.  This is my favorite of the tribute albums.  It is packed full of great cover versions.  The song selection is excellent.  Although I am not familiar with many of the artists, almost all of them do a great job.  There were only a few I didn't care for.  The ones I found really good include: Pete Townshend covering Corrina Corrina, Miley Cyrus on You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go, Lenny Kravitz on Rainy Day Women, The Johnny Cash and Avert Brothers was nice on One too Many Mornings, Adele does justice to Make You Feel My Love.  Elvis Costello and Diana Krall do a great job on License to Kill and Simple Twist of Fate.  There are also great versions of  Most of the Time, Love Sick, Ziggy Marley on Blowin' in the Wind, Not Dark Yet, Ballad of Hollis Brown. The list litterally goes on and on across the four discs.  Mark Knopfler does a beautiful job on Restless Farewell.  Can't say enough good things about this collection!

0307120007|5.0|I bought this book for my firstborn almost 40 years ago. I remember seeing it while babysitting in the 60's. I believe the first publication was in the 1940's. All three of my babies loved it, so I bought one for my two tiny grandbabies. Jade, the five month old likes looking at it and lets me guide her hand to touch the pages. Her brother, Jacob, 17 months old LOVES the book, especially the peek-a-boo page and will bring the book to any adult to help him \\"read\\". It is a timeless classic in all its simplicity. I highly recommend it.

B004HW7JMO|5.0|Okay so you basically are required to watch \\"Spartacus: Blood in Sand\\" before you watch \\"Gods of the Arena\\" because this is a prequel series, note, NOT a second season as many people believe.<br /><br />Yes, this was written to accomodate the late and great Andy Whitfield when he was first diagnosed with his condition, but it works out beautifully as we get a glimpse into the world inside the ludus before the Slayer of Theokoles, the Bringer of Rain ever stepped foot upon the sands! You see the characters that you know and love much differently- finding Batiatus and Lucrectia under the quake of his father, Titus, who is yet alive still, how Doctore became the wise and somewhat respected trainer of gladiators, and Crixus as he first trains to become a gladiator.  Lucretia finds an old friend named Gaia who lives with them- and futher question has to be asked: once you see the relationship between the two of them, does it make you think she was searching for the same type of friendship with Ilithyia? And you meet Doctore's wife, Melitta as well. Though more importantly, you meet the current champion of the House of Batiatus: Gannicus. This man is very different as he seeks at first, nothing other than the \\"lazy\\" life of a rock star- sleeping in, women, wine, the glory of the crowd and showing off, but it seems to me that he has a much deeper issue lying inside!<br /><br />This world is DIFFERENT. Right?<br /><br />The show is still fast-paced, high action, lots of blood, beautiful backgrounds and inevitably nudity and sex at every turn! It holds to the same standards as the other show hands down! And it ties in beautifully with the rest of the plots. Some characters return in the new season. It feels as if the stories we always wondered about were answered! Yet there are still many questions to be answered, once you watch this, you will find yourself excited for more.<br /><br />There's only six episodes, but hang on. They're fantastic. And you'll have a few new favorite characters by the time you're done with it!ith it!
0670022950|5.0|I have read many of Steven Pinker's epic and thoroughly researched books (The Blank Slate, The Stuff of Thought, the preset work) and I always find him to be a careful critical thinker. He cherishes providing nuanced critiques of the theories of other modern thinkers, many of whom he has great respect for, while mounting a skillful defense of his own theories. His work is often unsettling in that it challenges our most precious notions but in the end you are left realizing that your earlier suppositions were unhealthy and preposterous. This leaves the reader with a deeper understanding of the shades of grey involved with their cherished truths. One of my favorite examples of this discussed in The Blank Slate in reference to whether genes or environment control the personalities, intelligence and demeanor of our children. We hope and presume that we can shape and mould our children in to model citizens and to be told that genes comprise a large portion of their personality is devastating. But Mr Pinker reminds us that very often bad children come from great parents and to assume it is entirely their fault is monstrous and unproductive. Besides, every parent knows that to the best of their intentional moulding, children's personalities appear to spring out of nowhere.<br /><br />With the present work Steven Pinker demolishes the conception that we are living in a despicable age. Cultural myopia has caused many to long for the past and lack the proper appreciation for the amazing times we live in. This can be seen in those who discard the amazing public health revolution and refuse to get their children vaccinated to those who are living in an amazing age of scientific discovery yet believe the earth is 6,000 years old and evolution is a lie. Steven's current work demolishes the unflinching belief that we are living in incredibly troubled and tumultous times, instead exposing the relatively tranquil period we inhabit. In so doing, he mounts one of the most successful defenses of the enlightenment, humanism and liberalism and demonstrates the results of these successful experiments in philosophy through empirical results indicating declines in all forms of violence corresponding to these ideals. This book feels to me like a celebration of what social science should entail, a careful, experimental and empirical analysis of existing questions. Utilizing experimental psychology, neuroimagining and careful statistics on existing populations, we can find answers to questions about our humanity that were once only the realm of groundless philosophers, fiction writers and idealistic humanity professors.the enlightenment, humanism and liberalism and demonstrates the results of these successful experiments in philosophy through empirical results indicating declines in all forms of violence corresponding to these ideals.

B003PIUBZS|5.0|Hold onto your hats, kids. This is not your typical show. It's filled with lies and deceit, and obviously blood, sex and scantily clad men and women. It's not for the faint of heart or those sensitive to language, though, and throughout the entire show, they reinvent new sayings and ways to say the most common things! It's producers include Rob Tapert and Sam Raimi, famous for such things as Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess, and even if you take note, the lovely \\"Xena\\" herself, Lucy Lawless, is in the show.<br /><br />Not only does it revolve around notably Spartacus, but it surrounds several other stories that are told evenly throughout the show. Spartacus's choices and his actions reflect other characters, creating a perfect foil in desire and characterization. Another prominent person is the lanista (otherwise known as an owner of a \\"gladiator school\\") Quintus Lentulus Batiatus, portrayed by John Hannah (famously known as his role in the Mummy franchise). He purchases Spartacus with goals toward becoming a more important person in the government system. Once Spartacus (Which isn't his real name- we never learn it, by the way. Clever, huh?) is brought to the ludus, he is introduced to an array of others which influence his fate. Crixus, the Undefeated Gaul, who is the current champion gladiator in the House of Batiatis, is driven by power, the roar of the crowd and the glory of winning in the arena and Varro, a man willingly enlisting as a gladiator in the ludus to pay off personal debts, sooner becoming his closest friend are only two of the many people that become an important part of the show. Spartacus himself is fueled by the desire to see his wife again- who was ripped from his hands and taken into Roman slavery- and even as you see the desires of these characters shift, you watch them grow and develop even more, making them more than just charcters, but faceted human beings and wanting their own goals, each betraying others to be able to get the things they want through any means possible!. In the meantime, above the \\"animals\\" lies Batiatus and his wife, Lucretia (Lawless). He sets Lucretia to befriending a young woman, Ilithyia, the wife of the very man who stole Spartacus's wife.<br /><br />The plot thickens!<br /><br />Truly, I have personally turned several people on to the show. Steven DeKnight deserves some sort of trophy for writing the way that he does! The visual effects, created with Phantom, high-motion cameras, and green screening to create entire worlds, are completely stunning in all aspects. The care taken to make sure gladiator fights are anatomically correct, how the costumes are showing classes that greatly vary (which are all stunning and historically accurate!) was an additional, stunning measure.<br /><br />The acting is fantastic- the late, yet amazingly great, Andy Whitfield was an excellent Spartacus. Filled with passion and emotion, but with the right amount of lightness and comedy at times that could make anybody smile (I'm still saddened by his passing, but I have the utmost respect for Liam McIntyre for becoming the new Spartacus- but that is for another review!). Manu Bennett who plays the mighty Crixus is a champion in acting as well as in the arena- look into his eyes and you can see every emotion as genuine no matter what his character's circumstances are. Lawless and Hannah are stunning- she once said they were akin to the MacBeths, an intelligent comparison by far! The rest of the cast are just as magnificent- there is not a flawed actor among them!<br /><br />This show is nothing less than addicting- it has ups and downs and is willing to take you on a wild roller coaster of a glimpse inside the world of one of the most famous revolts in history! Again- I caution, it is very graphically gory, filled with language and sex. But if don't mind any of these, by all means, delve into Capua! And ladies, don't let anyone tell you that you can't watch it or that it's only for guys- it is filled with hot, sweaty gladiators with rippling muscles! Need I say more? Actually, the female population should adore the costumes as well- the romance and the surprising element of heartfelt passion in each of the episodes- and heck, as the ladies in the arena audience, these gladiators are like rockstars! Feel free to jump in as well!<br /><br />Don't be surprised if you get excited or start cheering with the crowd!<br /><br />...It's just that good.diators with rippling muscles! Need I say more?

B005E7AOHI|4.0|As others have noted, this album is a bit more \\"jammy\\" than prior efforts.  However, that doesn't mean that they compromised on the production (which is great, in my opinion).  This album will keep you grooving and thinking at the same time, and the tracks have a sense of atmosphere about them that draws you in and keeps you coming back for more.  It's nice to see Primus in such good form.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|I am very pleased with this product. Having only the use of one arm, this makes sweeping the floor a cinch !! Like one reviewer stated, do NOT leave the battery in the charger for more than 8 hours. I accidently did and it it pretty much ruined the  battery.

0307959856|1.0|I had been so excited to read this as I am a big fan of both PD James and Pride and Prejudice. Both me and my Mum were terribly disappointed. I feel as though every character was portrayed so negatively. She tells us that Elizabeth and Darcy are blissfully married, and then each of them spends paragraphs agonizing over whether they even know the other and what shallow people they are.  Capt Fitzwilliam was so nice in the original and she made him into more of a prig than Darcy was in the original! I had always thought that Fitzwilliam was a little in love with Elizabeth and told her that he couldn't marry to please himself as he could not afford to, because it was obvious that he might otherwise have wanted to marry her. This book made it seem like his explanation was meant as an insult--you're good enough to spend time with, but not to marry.  ***SPOILER*** Killing off Denny seemed unnecessary. He seemed like the most decent of the military characters. I realize that someone had to be killed as it is a murder mystery, but I liked Denny and she could easily have killed off someone newly invented... ***SPOILER END***  I also thought it was weird that it was from Darcy's perspective when we really only know Elizabeth's voice. And so much more...

B006W0QOF2|2.0|This could have been a really good Movie. The problem with it is that the main character is protrayed as a smart quick witted driver, fast on his feet thinker. That us , until we see his social skills. It almost like Rain Man, when he deals with people. The Soundtrack was good. there was good action but the movie falls short. Skip the rental , skip the movie. Perhaps the director will be better in a few more projects. I get the sense that Jeffory can act but it was not in the script. Some good actors have some bit parts but it just falls short of good , into almost there, might have been good catagory. Who needs to see movies like that - I vote skip it.

B0069UV0LS|5.0|Very rarely does a film so bleak, so prone to trample over its characters until they might not come back up, manage to avoid the usual melodrama and clichés we have come to expect and instead stay an honest, unflinching and powerful glimpse of two individuals, one too hard and the other too soft for the world, just trying to make it through the day. Peter Mullan gives one of the year's most destructive and powerful performances as Joseph, a widower who spends his time drinking, picking fights and experiencing bouts of anger that tends to come crashing down into paralyzing moments of regret. We understand he wants better for himself and could use a bit of redemption but it isn't an easy thing to achieve. However, he does find some solace in Hannah played by Olivia Colman who also gives one of the year's most devastating performances as a thrift store owner and born again Christian. Joseph feels drawn to her glow and the sort of warmth he has been looking for. Sadly she isn't who she seems because behind her smile is immense pain for she lives with an abusive husband who beats her. Hannah had hoped religion could be her savior but when that didn't work she turned to alcohol. At times Hannah and Joseph can seem total opposites but yet exactly the same. As we watch their relationship develop there are brief moments of hope and even a few laughs, but for me even they are incredibly emotional and at times almost moved me to tears. Considine's exploration into violence and rage is so gut wrenching and brutally honest that when good things happen you are glad but also very cautious because moods could change without warning and this fine line they walk is hard to watch.  At the center of it all is Joseph's anger which comes from a place many films rarely explore unless the main character is a villain, and maybe under other circumstances or a different life he would be. But here he is just your \\"Average Joe\\" whose fury isn't brought on by some terrible event or the result of any wrong doing, it is just his nature. He was born with a fire inside. It caused him to be mean and abusive to his wife, it causes him to rough up kids at a pub, and throw a rock through the front window of a shop. The best Joseph can do is try to control this rage and when it gets the best of him, like in the film's opening when in a fit he kicks his dog's ribs in, he shows what little kindness he can by carrying it home, being by its side as it dies and then burying it in the back yard. In any other film is would be impossible to expect the audience to forgive such an act, but Considine understands that. You see he isn't asking for forgiveness but just hoping to reach an understanding with the viewer. As terrible as Joseph's actions may be at the time the idea that it is his nature, something he can't control which is destroying him, and the fact that he tries his best to do good evens out the scales just enough for us to have faith in him.   The most important of these attempts to adjust comes with helping Hannah who he tries to protect even though everything about him says otherwise. This leads to the film's most shocking moment in which he discovers a truth about her, and perhaps about himself and every human, that rattles him to the core. This truth being that even the most glowing and kind of people are capable of unthinkable violence and rage. Now this might seem to be a totally bleak assessment on life, and maybe it is, but Considine doesn't allow it to prevail without putting up a fight. Instead he tries to make us and Joseph realize that the best you can do is battle through it all and although you will not always find redemption at least maybe a bit of peace and happiness can be earned, which might mean sacrificing yourself.  I really have to hand it to Paddy Considine who most know from his acting in such films as \\"Deadman's Shoes\\" or \\"In America\\". For this to be his first feature is quite impressive. He shows a level of maturity and confidence you would only expect from a veteran director. This could have easily become a preachy or overly stylized independent film that drowned in its own melodramatic miserablism but instead Considine wasn't afraid to be dark, gritty and realistic and stay true to his characters, caring for them and their emotions in a way that didn't feel artificial, and making a real connection with the audience. To say it is an easy watch would be a lie but its profoundness in its exploration of violence and anger along with two of the year's best performances make it a must watch and one of my favorite films of the year.
B006YJIIC8|3.0|I must confess that I found the first season of this series less than riveting.  If it weren't for the costumes and settings--as well as the complex manners and mores of people who require other people to dress them and can't host a dinner party without multiple footmen, it would have put me to sleep.  Just at the most dramatic moment, when the handsome Turk is about to deflower the eldest daughter, he drops dead!  This left me feeling incredibly frustrated...  But this season the War brings change, affecting the characters in surprising ways.  New villains, including Bates' estranged wife and Mary's publisher fiance (Is he exactly a villain?) plot and counterplot and I find myself increasingly caught up in the story.  I actually find myself looking forward to each new episode.  While hardly great drama, this second series is a major improvement over Season One.  It is actually quite good entertainment.

B004OBQDHK|5.0|Whenever this movie came up on the tv listing I would always find myself watching it. However, this blu-ray blows those viewings out of the water.

She has the right balance of snark and sweet that makes her exactly my sort of people. I love that colorful wigs and costumes make up her closet - and she dreams of dressing like Marie Antoinette for winter prom. Lola is the very definition of unforgettable, and it is so very easy for readers to fall in love with her and want the absolute bestest of best lives for her.<br /><br />{Cricket Bell} YUMZERS! Who knew a Cricket to be so scrumptious? I would dare to say that Cricket far outshines Etienne by a long shot. I am not sure if that is because he is definitely single when he declares his interest in Lola, but I know that was always the tricky part about Etienne in the beginning. Cricket was just the right sort of boy - adorable, smart, and quirky - and he fit just right with Lola that it was baffling to watch Lola try to resist and cling to her boyfriend Max. Especially when Cricket offers to help Lola with her tricky costume design!<br /><br />{Cameos of Anna and Etienne} OMG, my heart nearly skipped a beat as these two came on scene. Their love sparkled with such sigh-worthy brightness to cause envy, but Anna and Etienne mostly kept to the sidelines unless called out to advise Lola with her relationship troubles. Stephanie Perkins did not have to include Anna and Etienne to make this story work, but I am always so THRILLED to see familiar characters make guest appearances (usually in romance series). It feels like they are giving a blessing or guidance to the new couple in the spotlight.<br /><br />THE BAD BITS<br />{Nothing!} Are you crazy?

0312641893|5.0|I know I am late coming to the debut ball, but I am here now and I will join the masses who say that CINDER will rock you to the moon - and no, I am not saying this because the Lunar queen has brainwashed me. I envy Marissa Meyer for dreaming up such a wonderful Cinderella re-telling and creating a breathtaking world with a cast of characters that you will fall in love with. I love a heroine who does not mind getting her hands dirty and can talk shop, not to mention a prince who slums it among the commoners for a little slice of freedom. I am still curious to see how Cinder's cyborg-ness will factor into things; currently Marissa Meyer has used it to present some minor drawbacks which make Cinder all the more adorable when she interacts with Prince Kai. The story ends right before trouble can fully unfurl its nasty head, but CINDER leaves readers in a rock-solid happy place with a sense of satisfaction for how the fairy tale pans out. Of course, you will want MORE, but trust me when I say that CINDER will not leave you barely hanging on the cliff - you will hang for certain, you will ask for seconds, but you will feel safe in knowing that Book 2 will be SO worth the wait!

B00526ZKYS|3.0|I really liked this book except  for one thing. I thought that since this book is placed in the future they should have a large  technology advance, because there was none. Otherwise  I LOVED the book.
0143119680|4.0|Finally a grown-up, intelligent, well-written fantasy novel!!!!!!!!  Kudos to you Deborah Harkness...your writing is brilliant, your characters are fresh, believable and so well-rounded, and the historic aspect makes this the best book I've read in 2011!!!!  (Read it twice back-to-back!)  Am anxiously awaiting the sequel with baited breath!!!!!
B001F6TXME|4.0|This manual shutter release does exactly what it supposed to do... the only reason for docking it one star is because it is short.  i've used it a number of times some portrait work and some macro photography.  It beats using the timed release control.  I've had no trouble using a halfway release press to set the exposure control settings.  I've used in in bulb settings at night.  It's definitely a good add on accessory.
B001KVZ6FW|1.0|Why is it when they make movies that are in English but the subtitles are in French & Spanish never in English.

B004SGWYW4|4.0|As far as zombie stories go, High School of the Dead is a very fun story. I was often on the edge of my seat when I watched many of the episodes.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Great engaging story line<br />2) Action is good<br />3) I liked this universe's zombies.<br />4) I loved how the characters took a more pragmatic approach to the zombie invasion. One of the things I cannot stand about The Walking Dead is how ridiculous and emotional the characters can be.<br />5) The imagery, specifically at the high school, was at times frightening.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) Fanservice. It was too much at times that it often took away from the horror of what was happening. There was also absoluetly no male fan service for us female viewers.<br />2) Some of the characters are very cliche. Did this show really need a dumb, no absolutely stupid blond girl? Saeko could also use more development. I'm tired of cold blooded action girls.<br />3) Stop making Rei a damsel. Yeah she gets her moments to shine, but it gets tiresome to see her always needing help when the other characters can handle themselves just fine. I'd seriously make her sit in the car because she at times seems to be too much trouble.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a very cool app. I like how there are so many games. most of the games are addictive.
B006WPSQVC|5.0|I highly recommend this movie whether you are a Christian or not. The principals used are just plain common sense. The movie is clean, Christian, family oriented, teaches values, teaches responsibility not only to family but to job, to friends, to every aspect of life where a man values his name, trust and honesty! Watch it and you will not be disappointed.In fact, you may come away with a different outlook on life.

B001974DG0|5.0|I have just started reading Dean Koontz in the last year and continue to be pleased with his books. Watchers is my favorite to date. As an avid dog lover, this book was extra special for me. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time I was reading.  This book also makes you think about the government and exactly how far they will go to keep a secret. Is the storyline really fiction or could stuff like this really happen? Scary. Fact or fiction, it's very entertaining.

B005HS00ZU|5.0|I've purchased just about every 3D Blu-ray published, and this is by far the most compelling thing I've seen.  It's amazing how gripping the experience is... like being at a Peter Gabriel concert.  I'd never watch a 2D concert disc, but this is NOT like watching in 2D.
B0073Q0DZG|4.0|This is a high quality film from Hollywood. Pleasantly surprised by the lack of junior high humor that typically plagues Jack Black films. This is Wilson's highest quality film in a decade - and I liked Midnight in Paris. This is a film that you won't be embarrassed to watch. Simply one of the best of the well known titles currently available.
B006ZDS7CE|3.0|I'm in a bit of a quandary right now seeing as I only recently discovered LDR just after the infamous SNL performance. I wanted to hear what all the fuss/hate was about so I went to the many Youtube videos to hear her music and note whether she could really sing. Overall I decided that I wasn't going to let groupthink deter my opinion and I actually was looking forward to the release of \\"Born To Die\\". Fortunately though, I managed to get a copy of \\"Lana Del Ray a.k.a. Lizzy Grant\\" several days before the release of \\"BTD\\". I have to say I very much prefer her first release over this new over-manufactured version of her.  It's really strange, because I'm fairly disappointed by Born to Die during the same week that  that I'm wholly in love with her eponymous album, listening to the full album at least 5 times in a row, when not humming the songs involuntarily. The only good songs (in my opinion) on BTD are mainly the songs that had already been out there on the internets: Video Games, Blue Jeans, Born to Die, and (maybe) DMD. The rest of the songs on the new release seem vapid, incohesive, and wrong for her vocal style, especially in comparison to the eponymous album. I seriously don't get what kind of \\"legendary and iconic\\" debut her production/image/management teams were going for here.  I'm giving the release 3 stars because of the 3-4 songs worth hearing and because I'm hoping someday she will release her self-titled album again (though it will probably be reproduced and into something crap-tastically mainstream).

034552554X|5.0|When I bought this book, I was expecting a very victorianesque book with alot of discussion on the meanings of flowers, and maybe even a little of the magical elements that are found in so many of today's books. That was not what this book was at all. What I found was a great modern day story about one girl's journey to be loved, and to believe herself loveable, and therefore able to love others. Although it was not quite what I thought it was going to be, I thoroughly enjoyed what it was. I thought the story of Victoria was compelling and interesting. I think I felt sorry for Victoria, even though I wanted to slap her some of the time. Elizabeth and Grant were easy to love, although at one point I thought that Grant was almost too good to be believed. And I thought that Renata and her family were a kick. What great characters the author peppered this book with.  I thought the story line was great also. It was poignant without being sappy and I liked the way that the author let you guess as to what the big deal between Victoria and Elizabeth was. Although I guessed what caused their break up before it was revealed, there were elements of the situation that the author was able to surprise me with.  Last comment is I have to give Kudos to the author on the ending. It was hopeful while still staying true to the characters and the tone of the story.
B003IY48PS|1.0|Thios rating is for the blu-ray DVD only, not the movie. If you decide to buy this, there are some things you should be aware of...  This IS NOT the two disc edition. For the new 1 disc blu-ray, all the special features have been removed except a commentary track.  This WILL NOT play in all players. When you start the disc, you either have to watch or skip thru 4 trailers. At this point, my LG player goes black. I was only able to get a menu 3 times out of dozens of tries (by fast forwarding thru the last trailers instead of using skip) and then I was not able to make any selections, so I never got to watch the movie. If you decide to buy this, make sure you know what you are getting into.

The paradox of this book is that because the idea of a black swan would be an event, it has resemblance to the idea that this book could have become a black swan itself.  I would bet that this one becomes a classic.

B005IML464|3.0|This box is made possible by recent changes to the ownership of EMI. Its chief merit is price.<br /><br />Here are some vignettes.<br /><br /> - The Symphonies are Karajan's fourth survey - the Gold Edition - from the 1980s. They were made at a time when his relationship with the Berlin Philharmonic was toxic. The pick of them are Three (wow), Eight and much of the Ninth. The other symphonies do not add materially to previous performances of these works. The Eroica notwithstanding, the '63 or '77 cycles have much stronger claims on a collector [[ASIN:B0000C03AH Beethoven: The Symphonies]] & [[ASIN:B001DCQI82 Beethoven: The Symphonies [Box Set]]].<br /><br /> - The recording of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 1 with Christoph Eschenbach was made in the 1960s by DG. It is delightful.<br /><br /> - Piano Concertos 2 - 5 were recorded by EMI in the '70s with Alexis Weissenberg. It's difficult to think of a less heroic survey of these works. What a snoozefest !<br /><br /> - The performance of the Violin Concerto with Ann-Sophie Mutter was made towards the end of the analogue era; I can't think of a slower, more turgid version on the market. Don't listen to it when you're driving at night.<br /><br /> - The Missa Solemnis was recorded in 1985. The soloists are lacklustre, the recording is congested, and if Karajan has anything new to say in this much traversed work, I cannot hear it. The performance lacks spontaneity and joy - it is a pale reflection of the stellar 1966 performance with Janowitz and Wunderlich [[ASIN:B000024JPW Beethoven: Missa Solemnis / Mozart: Coronation Mass]].<br /><br /> - The orchestra swamps the soloists in the Triple Concerto, and the performance itself cannot compete with the charisma of the famous 1969 recording with Richter, Rostropovich and Oistrakh [[ASIN:B003YCRXZQ Beethoven: Triple Concerto / Brahms: Double Concerto]] - not that the latter is any great shakes as a recording itself.<br /><br /> - Egmont and the ballet were recorded in the late 1960s as stopgaps in preparation for the Beethoven Bicentenary. Karajan never returned to them and there's no deep alignment here. They're good performances; it's always a joy to hear Janowitz at the height of her powers.<br /><br /> - The overtures were slickly recorded at the same time - the digital alternatives included in the Gold Edition of the symphonies have more substance and clout. An accusation of soupy-ness would be upheld by a magistrate.<br /><br /> - The Grosse Fuge was recorded in Switzerland in 1969. It is a worthwhile acquisition and all the more so as orchestral arrangements are rare nowadays.<br /><br />All in all, this is a handy enough set even if so little of it is definitive.

Includes some of his already introduced coworkers.  I thought Child had done away with the excessive sex.  So why the unnecessary, gratuitous sex in this one?  We know she's a babe Lee, no reason to take it so far.  Minor but expected sub plot: after some give and take dialog (could have been better) the usual local hicks get Reachered.  I too must protest Tom Cruise as the cinema Jack Reacher though I know it's a done deal.

B0002XMF5S|3.0|Let me just say right off the bat that I like this album - I really do! From the blistering/thundering opening track \\"In For The Kill\\" to the moving/emotional closing \\"In Memory\\", I think this is one of the best rock albums of the 80's.<br /><br />Why do I only give it 3 stars? Well, that is because of it being released as a Black Sabbath album. Whoa, nelly! What a HUGE mistake that was on the parts of everyone involved with this misstep. Ok, I'll admit I do think a few tracks on here have that Sabbath \\"flavor\\" (\\"In For The Kill\\", \\"Heart Like A Wheel\\", \\"In Memory\\", and the title track), but there is still something missing.<br /><br />And that \\"something\\" is Geezer Butler's bass! Yes, ladies and gentlemen, in case you haven't already guessed, Geezer Butler (and his rumbling bass) is not on this album. Nope! Gone! Missing in action! Bye-bye. And that is the main important reason that this should have never in a million years been called \\"Black Sabbath\\"! Not in a million years! I know I repeated myself. I meant to.<br /><br />It should have been obvious to anyone listening to Black Sabbath over the years ever since their inception to realize and recognize that the main ingredients to the band's success wasn't who was singing (or drumming -but we'll get to *that* factor in a minute-), the core of the band was always Tony Iommi's mindblowing stoner riffs, alongside Geezer Butler's bass thundering at you like a hurricane in July. Together, they sounded like, well, a giant beast lumbering toward you, hovering with threatening power. This was especially apparent on the last three Black Sabbath releases (\\"Heaven And Hell\\", \\"Mob Rules\\", \\"Born Again\\").<br /><br />Ok, now about the drums in Black Sabbath, as opposed to the drums on this album: Well, again, the drums have always been part of the soundscape, blended in with Tony and Geezer, to make that awesome thunderous sound. Well, beware, because that is also now gone. And it's not that new guy Eric Singer is a bad drummer. No! Matter of fact, he is a great drummer! He just wasn't the right drummer for Black Sabbath. Maybe if his drums were turned down on here? Because that is the problem, the drums on here are mixed in way too LOUD! Overpowering everything else. And don't get me started on the whole Motley Crue \\"Red Hot\\" style of double bass drumming that had no place in the confines of a Black Sabbath record.<br /><br />And that leads me to conclude that one of two things should have went down when Iommi was told by Don Arden (and a few others at Warner Bros) that his solo album (yes, this was solely intended to be a Tony Iommi solo project, NOT a Black Sabbath album) that this was going to be released as a Black Sabbath album.<br />1) Iommi should have stuck to his guns and said \\"no way is this going out as a Black Sabbath album! This is my solo album!\\"<br />2) Iommi should have stepped up and said \\"Well, if you insist on it being released as a Sabbath album, then I need more time to remix it.\\"<br /><br />Yes. Remix it! He should have demanded more time to take this and completely remix it into a Black Sabbath record, meaning make the bass more prominent, lower the drums (maybe even re-record some drum tracks), and maybe even re-record some tracks, namely \\"Danger Zone\\", my least favorite track on here.<br /><br />Like I said, this is not a \\"Black Sabbath\\" album, but The Tony Iommi Project. And under that moniker this is a great 80's heavy blues rock metal album, but under the Sabbath name, it was almost a disgrace. But the ultimate disgrace to the Sabbath name was yet to come (imagine Jimmy Page reforming Led Zeppelin with three new members, then immediately continue to interchange members of the band like a smorgasboard out of control right before your eyes, and you may get the idea of how the Sabbath name got drug through the mud starting with this album here, continuing through to 1990's \\"Tyr\\").<br /><br />Anyways, check this out if you (like myself) are a fan of anything with Tony Iommi, but if you're looking for something with that magical Sabbath sound, then you may wanna pick up after \\"Born Again\\" with \\"Dehumanizer\\" (and maybe even \\"Cross Purposes\\" after that), but you may wanna skip this one.<br /><br />Thanks for reading! Rock on! :)may wanna pick up after \\"Born Again\\" with \\"Dehumanizer\\" (and maybe even \\"Cross Purposes\\" after that), but you may wanna skip this one.  Thanks for reading! Rock on! :)

B005DC68NI|2.0|As I said in my title, if you know anything about self-publishing, then skip this.  I agree with the other reviewer that said maybe if you've been living under a rock you won't know this stuff...so I gave it two stars because if you're really a newbie who knows NOTHING about self-publishing and ebooks, this might be helpful.  But if you have been publishing at all, this isn't helpful.  I wanted the section that interviewed other authors to tell me a bit about what they actually did that helped them succeed, but that wasn't present.  All of the basics on self-publishing ebooks can be found for free on Amazon's sites or many other places, so why pay for it?  If you want a decent marketing plan, read 10 Steps by MR Mathias.  And for anyone just getting into this self-publishing business, know that things change quickly.  What worked for the authors that Gaughran lists probably won't work now because every Tom, Dick, and Harry who \\"thinks\\" he or she is a writer but isn't (because he/she hasn't honed their craft enough to be \\"good\\" let alone \\"great\\") is publishing now, and it's more difficult to get a reader's attention.  Spend time on blogs to keep up with everything, but save your money on this one.

B003L77GRO|5.0|- Lumen (walking into the room): \\"I think we have a problem.\\"<br />- Dexter's voiceover (as he and Aster sit in stony silence): \\"Yeah, I'm in a battle of wills with my drunk, shoplifting teenaged step-daughter... and she's going to win.\\"<br /><br />DEXTER's fifth season is another excellent season, of which sub-header could be \\"Dexter finds his soul mate.\\" The horrifying closing moments of Season 4 still seared onto our brains, we turn to Season 5 to see how Dexter Morgan is coping. And could it be that our self-avowed monster is wracked with guilt over Rita's death? Seems so. The opening episode, which immediately picks up from Season 4, finds him in a distraught state. To make matters worse, Rita's daughter, Aster, blames him for her death.<br /><br />But the story arc must evolve, and soon those dark urges roil up to the surface. Dexter stumbles onto a serial killer case, of which investigation gradually brings him out of his deep funk. His day job as a blood spatter analyst at Miami Metro PD also has him involved with a rash of beheadings in a Venezuelan neighborhood. But it's the first one, the Barrel Girl case, which propels this season. Because it's while pursuing the Barrel Girl case that Dexter would inadvertently rescue a kidnapped, near crazed girl named Lumen Ann Pierce (a strong Julia Stiles). Dexter perceives a fellow Dark Passenger within Lumen. Lumen is obsessed with finding and punishing her asssailants, and a reluctant Dexter decides to help her, possibly partly to atone for his having failed Rita. Although the prevailing thought then may have been: Huh. Picking up another co-conspirator... look how well that turned out the last time with Jimmy Smits.<br /><br />Except that, as good as Jimmy Smits was, this season's big bad really made my skin crawl. Jonny Lee Miller plays a charismatic self-help guru who may or may not be a criminal mastermind (but who are we kiddin'?). Miller injects a disturbing fastidiousness into his character which ramps up the skin crawl factor by several degrees. He's one of them folks what loves to manipulate people into performing depraved acts. He likes to watch. Creeeeeepy. The vile stuff he's wrought compels even someone as alienated as Dexter make this observation: \\"Despite having considered myself a monster for as long as I can remember, it still comes as a shock when I'm confronted with the depth of evil that exists in this world.\\"<br /><br />The rest of the cast? Jennifer Carpenter as Dexter's profane yet fragile detective sister continues to be a favorite. I hate that she gets closer to her partner Quinn who isn't at all a substitute for Sgt. Doakes. Still, Quinn does his best Doakes impression as he begins to pry into Dexter's private business. Batista and LaGuerta's marital situation also becomes a focus of the show, which is a good thing if you like the couple (Me, I like Batista). Peter Weller signs on as a season-long guest star, playing a shady shamus who sniffs out some nasty things about Dexter. Except that this is a series in which guest stars rarely ever make a return appearance. They usually end up taped up on Dexter's table and getting their cheeks sliced up.<br /><br />Season 5 doesn't achieve the heights of Season 4, how could it? The sublime John Lithgow won't be coming back. But this is still a triumphant season, highlighted by Dexter and Lumen's emotional interactions and Dexter's learning how to be a single parent. To me, the key episode is \\"Everything is Illumenated.\\" It's the one that coalesced the main story arc for me. It cemented Lumen as a fascinating foil for Dex. I love the warehouse scene which showcases Dexter applying his knowledge of blood spatter to track down a fleeing baddie. I also really liked \\"Teenage Wasteland\\" which reconnects Dex to Aster. Don't get it twisted. The other ten episodes sparkle as well. I still can't believe it took me this long to start watching this show. It's certainly one of the best shows currently going on television. And if it's not THE best, it's certainly the most fiendishly fun. Dexter, you murderous, diaper-changing charmer.. And if it's not THE best, it's certainly the most fiendishly fun. Dexter, you murderous, diaper-changing charmer.
B0063GORYU|5.0|very addicting and easy to function. I have it on my kindle and I enjoy playing to pass the time.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|COMMUNITY is undeniably streets ahead. If you want to know what the fuss is all about, and the furor and the hullabaloo, then you ought to give COMMUNITY a try. While the season's first half is mostly the show trying to get its sea legs - and so there are episodes which are a bit shaky - press on, sir, and you'll get to the turnaround. From the Christmas episode on, COMMUNITY picks up momentum and begins to consistently knock it out the park. Except, even before that, there were already glimmers of awesome. Like Troy and Abed's Spanish rap to close out the second episode (\\"Spanish 101\\") or Vaughn's song, \\"Gettin' Rid of Britta\\" (\\"Home Economics\\"), or Abed dressed up as Batman in the Halloween episode (\\"Introduction to Statistics\\").<br /><br />Even though the show is about a, well, community of people of all ages and from all walks of life attending community college, our point-of-view character is initially Jeff Winger (Joel McHale), a smug lawyer who was disallowed from plying his craft when the state bar learned that his law degree is from Colombia instead of Columbia. So he's forced to enroll in Greendale Community College. This show is as much about Jeff Winger's redemption from a shady counselor who is endlessly manipulative to a better human being (who, okay, is still pretty manipulative). Thru Jeff - who establishes a fake Spanish study group so that he can chat up pretty fellow student Britta (Jillian Jacobs) - we meet the rest of the diverse cast.<br /><br />I like me the unapologetic snark, and COMMUNITY happens not only to shovel in the meta-references, it also parodies everything under the sun, and does it in sharp, wicked ways. But a sense of the ridiculous also infuses the stories, and I love that because I'm down with the goofy stuff as well. It all culminates in the funniest half-hour of television in 2010, the paintball episode \\"Modern Warfare,\\" a sublime send-up of the action/post-apocalyptic horror genre. This episode also escalates Jeff and Britta's ongoing flirtation to the next level.<br /><br />I had never heard of any of the actors before, except for Chevy Chase but I warmed up to the cast soon enough. Donald Glover (\\"Troy\\") and Danny Pudi (\\"Abed\\") in particular just have this very cool chemistry, and they're very funny together. One of the things I look forward to are the closing credit tags which prominently feature Troy and Abed. And while I was on board with the Jeff/Britta thing, the show does throw an excellent plot swerve in the final episode. And the rabid Spanish 101 instructor, Se&ntilde;or Chang, is always good for chuckles. Heck, even Chevy Chase folds neatly into the group.<br /><br />There are so many terrific episodes, but if I have to highlight a few... There's the Halloween episode \\"Introduction to Statistics\\" which has Chevy under the influence and introduces Jeff's hot statistics professor. And also \\"Debate 109\\" which pits indifferent debater Jeff against a charismatic disabled opponent. The Christmas episode smiles at re1igion and ends in a free-for-all, all-hands-on-deck scrap. Most of the episodes from then on are pretty gold, including most definitely \\"Contemporary American Poultry,\\" which satirizes gangster films like GOODFELLAS, and, of course, the awesomely awesome \\"Modern Warfare.\\" The neat thing is that these actors are frequently called on to be silly and over-the-top, and yet they ground their performances enough that you do end up caring what happens to their characters. Except maybe for Se&ntilde;or Chang. Even Chevy Chase says he's abrasive.<br /><br />The DVD set isn't stingy with the bonus features:<br /><br />- Cast & Crew Commentary for each episode<br />- An Outtake Reel for each disc<br />- Alternate Scenes from the \\"Advanced Criminal Law\\" episode<br />- \\"Creative Compromises\\" - tongue-in-cheek featurette in which show creator Dan Harmon harps on about the creative changes the show's had to make to appease the network executives; oh, that poor Gillian Jacobs (00:02:52 minutes)<br />- \\"Season One Cast Evaluations\\" - Another not-to-be-taken-too-seriously featurette in which Dan Harmon sits each cast member down and evaluates their performances throughout the first season (00:11:41 minutes)<br />- 3 Mini-Episodes<br />- Season One Highlight Reel<br />- Extended Producer's Cut of the \\"Communication Studies\\" episode<br />- The DVD package also comes with the mini comic book, \\"Kickpuncher,\\" drawn by indie comic book artist Jim Mahfood and supposedly written by Troy Barnes:52 minutes)<br />- \\"Season One Cast Evaluations\\" - Another not-to-be-taken-too-seriously featurette in which Dan Harmon sits each cast member down and evaluates their performances throughout the first season (00:11:41 minutes)<br />- 3 Mini-Episodes<br />- Season One Highlight Reel<br />- Extended Producer's Cut of the \\"Communication Studies\\" episode<br />- The DVD package also comes with the mini comic book, \\"Kickpuncher,\\" drawn by indie comic book artist Jim Mahfood and supposedly written by Troy Barnes
0451228375|5.0|More years ago than I can recall exactly, I read perhaps the most riveting piece of historical non-fiction writing that I've ever come across, Barbara Tuchman's [[ASIN:0345349571 A Distant Mirror:  The Calamitous 14th Century]].<br /><br />Here, in WORLD WITHOUT END, one can revisit many topics of Barbara's book in a fictional milieu. Here, the story is placed somewhere in south-central England, in Kingsbridge, over a span of time from 1327 to 1361 in seven chunks: November 1327 - June 8 to 14, 1337 - June to December, 1337 - June 1338 to May 1339 - March 1346 to December 1348 - January 1349 to January 1351 - March to November 1361.<br /><br />This novel by Ken Follett is the sequel to his marvelous [[ASIN:045123281X The Pillars of the Earth]], which was set in Kingsbridge some 200 years previous and revolved around the building of the city's cathedral.<br /><br />There are a multitude of characters in WORLD WITHOUT END, the principal four being Merthin, Ralph, Caris and Gwenda.<br /><br />Merthin and Ralph are brothers, the sons of a landless knight reduced to a low state by debt. Caris is the daughter of the most prominent wool merchant of Kingsbridge. Gwenda is the daughter of a petty thief.<br /><br />The plot of the book incorporates the range of human behavior from the noble to the most base against a medieval background that includes two of the most momentous events in English history of that century, the Battle of Cr&eacute;cy and the Black Death: love, hatred, revenge, adultery, ambition, greed, bravery, rapine, cowardice, selfishness, selflessness, devotion, treachery, kindness, cruelty, cleverness, and cunning - why, just like any normal day for me at the office.<br /><br />Along the way, we become acquainted with monks, bishops, nuns, craftsmen, outlaws, reeves, earls, a king, lawyers, thieves, merchants, inn keepers, prostitutes, knights, flagellants, laborers, serfs, and herbalists.<br /><br />What makes WORLD WITHOUT END particularly interesting in general, due no doubt to the author's research, is the insight the reader gets into contemporary practices and methods - how to build the underwater foundations of a river bridge, how to weave cloth, how to build an octagonal church spire, how to slow the spread of the plague, how to flay a man alive - as well as 14th century societal relationships - the Church and the laity, merchants' guilds and towns, landed lords and their serfs, landed lords and free tenants, the King and the nobility, monasteries and nunneries, women and men - and the guiding tenets of feudalism, medical practice, the King's law, Church law, and common law.<br /><br />For me personally, the novel is pure joy because of my familiarity with and love for English history and, after more than a dozen visits, the landscape itself. And most especially because of my several stops at Salisbury Cathedral, which the author has said he used, along with Wells Cathedral, as a descriptive model for that at Kingsbridge. Insofar as the author describes the latter, Kingsbridge Cathedral is very much the Salisbury edifice in appearance and footprint. (Ok, I know that every English cathedral I've been in resembles Kingsbridge with a nave, transept, cloisters, and tower. But Salisbury screams Kingsbridge - you have to have been there. Or maybe it's just wishful thinking since Salisbury has a double-transept and Kingsbridge doesn't.) So, reading WORLD WITHOUT END takes me back in my mind's eye to treasured experiences.)<br /><br />At over one-thousand pages of small type, this book is a monster.

0439023521|3.0|I guess I just did not connect with the characters much. Or the setting. Everything seemed quite simplistic. A dystopian parody of our obsession with reality tv and the callousness of our society. A girl who is a total survivalist and a sweet boy who is in love with her. The action was fast-paced and I read the book in one sitting, but I didn't really experience anything that would make me want to read it again, recommend it to others, care about any of the characters, read the sequel, or do anything more with the book. The whole thing is predictable, loaded with throw-away characters, and shallow. There are so many more exciting books that I feel like I wasted my time reading it on the basis of all the glowing recommendations out there.

Jay's only response to the emotional comfort many of us get from our stuff is to tell us to stop being so attached and lecture us about how we are destroying the planet and exploiting the downtrodden. Between the author's radical minimalism and a hoarder's extreme fear of deprivation lies a happy medium in which, I suspect, most of us would prefer to live - we don't want stacks of paperwork or junk everywhere, but we do want enough tableware to entertain guests, enough craft supplies for hobbies we really do expect to get back to when our current project is finished, etc. For me, Julie Morgenstern's \\"Organizing from the Inside Out\\" was a better fit for the kind of less-extreme decluttering that I was looking for.

B004G600A4|5.0|I am watching Tangled now while cleaning my house and thought that I would leave a review on it!  I have been singing to Disney movies since before I could form sentences on my own. This movie is a relevant, spunky tale for an updated generation. However, it has all of the old charm of princesses singing about their excitement , love, or challenges, and even the \\"bad guy's (or woman's rather)\\" song reminds me of The Little Mermaid when Ursula is that lady with the black hair and sings deviously. So many great memories!  There are a bunch of things that will seem clever and ridiculously sarcastic to us adults that kids will not quite understand, but it makes me laugh over and over because of the cleverness in such a great kids movie. I love all of the songs, and although I am not a huge fan of Mandy Moore, her voice doesn't annoy me, it's quite cute actually, and she sings beautifully with personality.  I do not own it, but when they take it off of Netflix I will buy it. I watch it about at least 2 times a month. Usually it's on in the background while I work around the house singing, but I will always find myself stopping to sneak a peek ;)  You will not regret this movie. I cannot speak from a kids point of view, but from an adult who loves to sing Disney, it will be nice to have a kids movie replayed over and over (as kids will do)that you WANT to watch!  Enjoy!  Mrs. D.

1451648537|5.0|THIS is what a biography should look like! I've never read any of Walter Isaacson's other works, but I was just blown away by this one. It perfectly encapsulates all of Steve Jobs' life, work, and personality in an easily digestible format. Following Steve Jobs mantra that simplicity is the greatest form of sophistication, Mr. Isaacson explains all of Apple's & Jobs' products in such a way that even the layest of computer/electronic laities could understand it, while still capturing both its complexity and innovation. He also does the same to his subject, Steve Jobs. One line from the last chapter perfectly sums up Mr. Jobs: \\"[He was] charismatic and inspiring, yet also, to use the technical term, an a**hole at times.\\" The same driving force behind the Macintosh, iPod, and iPad, also parked in handicapped spots (sometimes covering up two handicapped spots!) and could completely destroy someone's 6-month project with one \\"It looks like s***\\" line. Yet, Mr. Isaacson ably makes the case that his drive and his d***-ish attitude helped to push his products to their maximum potential, putting them and Apple, Inc. on the cutting edge of consumer innovation. Steve Jobs was an inspiration and, to use a term Jobs once used, a \\"f***ing d***less a**hole\\" that will be greatly missed. And Steve Jobs couldn't have found a better biographer.
1451648537|5.0|[[ASIN:1451648537 Steve Jobs]]  Isaacson's biography of Jobs is fascinating, not just as an insightful look into the life of someone who will likely go down in history as an American business icon, but also because Jobs' commissioning of the book resulted in an unvarnished recounting of his life story that revealed lessons even more important than his impressive accomplishments in the technology field.  Jobs was a genius at his work, in part because he was doing what he truly loved to do. While he did become wealthy as a result, his motivating force wasn't money, but rather the desire to create a company that would endure and produce products that he believed in. That mindset was inspired by the unflagging love and support of his adoptive parents, who made every effort to counteract any sense of abandonment that he may have felt by assuring him that he had been chosen specifically and was loved unconditionally. They encouraged him to follow his dreams wherever they might lead him. The result was a man who often seemed to function in what Isaacson characterized as a \\"reality distortion field\\". He simply didn't accept the notion that certain things weren't possible, and in so believing managed to get others to do what they had previously deemed \\"impossible\\". While it made him difficult to work with at times, he effectively empowered those around him so that they too came to believe in the absence of limitations. That was a profound gift, and was likely the reason so many people were able to see beyond his difficult demeanor and appreciate the relationships they had with him.  He was the epitome of control, focus and intensity when it came to his work, a man with an uncanny intuition that enabled him to know what people wanted and how to deliver it in a form that delighted them. He managed to be perceptive enough to see the big picture, while at the same time maintaining focus on the details. However, when taken to extremes in a manner that was often way out of balance, these same attributes became the roots of his periodic setbacks. Often those with tremendous ability in one area show equally severe difficulties in other areas. Human relationships weren't Jobs forte, and he was excessively judgmental to the point where other people were often seen as either geniuses or idiots. Throughout the course of the book it becomes evident how these character traits permeated every facet of his life. He was definitely a man full of interesting idiosyncrasies. In some ways Jobs may always remain somewhat of an enigma, but this book goes a long way toward trying to explain his actions and motivations.  When faced with his own mortality, it spurred the already prolific Jobs to expedite the release of both the iPhone and the iPad. However, another decision it provoked may well be one of his greatest personal accomplishments. He chose to be interviewed extensively for this biography, and authorized the interviewing of numerous others who played pivotal roles in his life. During his last meetings with the author, Jobs admitted to Isaacson that he \\"had a lot of trepidation\\" about the project. When asked why he'd gone along with it despite his worry, Jobs explained that \\"I wanted my kids to know me. I wasn't always there for them, and I want them to know why and to understand what I did.\\" He also wanted what was said about him posthumously to be accurate, so he wanted his biographer to hear what he had to say firsthand. He didn't insist on seeing what was being written or what conclusions Isaacson had drawn from his many interviews, and he wasn't bothered by the fact that there would be a lot in the book that he wouldn't like.  For a man who at times seemed to have an almost obsessive need to control, a trait likely rooted in perfectionism, this ultimate voluntary surrender of control speaks volumes. It was a tacit admission that he realized his intense focus on the pursuit of the work he loved had yielded success at a significant cost in terms ofhis relationships. You often hear it said that no one on their death bed ever wishes they'd spent more time at work. Human relationships and quality time spent with the people you love are what really matter most when it's all said and done. If you recognize that truth early on, or others who learn it are willing to share their stories, that knowledge can change your life.  I suspect Jobs recognized that there were important lessons to be learned from his life story. Quite possibly he didn't want to be put on a pedestal and revered as the icon the world was making him out to be, but rather in the end preferred to be seen as a complex man from whom as much could be learned from his mistakes as from his triumphs. Jobs' business accomplishments were incomparable, yet here is another message the reader can take away from his story that is perhaps an even more valuable legacy. He did well in courageously choosing Isaacson as his biographer. The balanced presentation of his life that comes across in the pages of this book isn't always complimentary, but it is unquestionably honest, thought provoking, and well documented. I came away with a greater admiration for Jobs after having read it. I highly recommend this book. Enjoy.

B004MC8CA2|4.0|I really do like this Bible app. It's easy to use and the options that come with it (reading plans, versions, notes, highlighting, bookmarking, etc.) make it an excellent resource. My only complaint is that I haven't been able to use it unless I was somewhere that had Internet access. Other than that, I highly recommend this Bible app.

1612130607|5.0|I am so thrilled to see that all three of E.L. James Fifty Shades books are on the New York Times Best Seller list as of April 1, 2012.  It is so refreshing to see a new author make the best seller list, especially all three of the books that she wrote.<br /><br />I absolutely loved the fifty shades series.  I read the first two books in a row and thought the third one would never get here.  I thought E.L. James did a wonderful job of closing this series though I will really miss Christian and Ana.  Your heart just went out to Christian and it was so good to see Christian finally happy.  Once the book came out and I purchased it, I couldn't put it down.  It was the same way with the first two.  I don't usually read a book more than once, but I will definately read this trilogy again now that I can read them one right after the other.<br /><br />I will look forward to reading more of her books and highly recommend you read her \\"Fifty Shades\\" trilogy.  You won't regret it.

B004289ZW0|1.0|I purchased the GNS 5870 last year.  My success rate with this external GPS has been about 25% - at best.  The device does not stay charged, the sliding 'off and on' technology is sporadic at best, so it is a struggle to turn off and on.  I use this for flying, and dependability is essential.  Overall, I'm very disappointed with this device.  I'm going to shop for a replacement, and it won't be this brand.

B000PATZQK|4.0|In 1968 I was 12 years old and from the time I heard the Beatles song I Want To Hold Your Hand when it came out I always had a little Transistor radio with me that I would have on... as long as the battery lasted anyway! I would put it under the pillow and get to hear tunes after I was suppose to be going to sleep. There was only one local station that played popular songs and one of the DJs had a house just down the road from us. Anyway..I remember liking the Zombie songs a lot that were played but never got any of their vinyl because any vinyl was a Christmas of birthday gift and always 45's and I always had to narrow down the choices because there was so much out there! Up until I started buying LP's in the early 70's when I could do odd jobs and buy my own stuff my parents were real good about giving me Music I asked for starting with The Beatles and Johnny Cash, The Supremes The Cowsills ...then on to The Monkees, The Doors, Stones. I had a Silvertone Record Player. So I thought I might check this Odessey and Oracle Zombies release on Big Beat and I'm glad I got it. Every time I hear Time Of The Season I get flashbacks of that era and to me that tune defines that time. Butchers Tale really brings that all home to me.  At the time I was watching Walter Cronkite doing the as It turns out purposely incorrect casualty figures from Vietnam hoping like hell that unbelievibly insane conflict would be over with before I was old enough to be forced ( drafted ) to go  because as a person who didn't have the means to go to college or the son of someone with influence I could not have avoided going. Scary times...people have no idea now how that threat of dieing somewhere for no reason other than to make someone else rich can make one realize just how vulnerable a regular citizen can be. Had to be there I guess....Sorry Off topic....those darn flashbacks! So I do like all these songs and have listened to this several times just to make sure...hehe...  I'm not that hung up on the past I like a lot of the newer stuff like Porcupine Tree and Sieges Even...still way too much out there and way too little time to sample everything...same as back then!on the past I like a lot of the newer stuff like Porcupine Tree and Sieges Even...still way too much out there and way too little time to sample everything...same as back then!

B004WJRF6C|4.0|Quite a piece of work this. Love all the songs here myself. The man here starting on a solo journey that would prove to be seriously fruitful. The songs are fun and great to play on an acoustic guitar just hanging around with friends. Paul proves here he could play about any instrument he wanted to on a level most people would be pleased to be able to do on just one of any of them. To me he never got the credit he deserved for being so good at being able to play so many different ones...especially the guitar! They did a nice job with the packaging on this although the pages with the lyrics and photos are done a bit oddly. It's nice to have the extra 24 minutes on the second disc but the live songs from later times (1979?) doesn't quite fit... for me anyway. Worth getting for the better sound quality of the original release anyway! This isn't my favorite one Paul ever did but it's excellent none the less.
B0064NTZJO|2.0|I guess it isn't to hard to do what my title says. Basically take Ryan Gosling who is a great actor, have him have an empty stare on his face through basically oh more than half of the film. Have him only say about 50 words or less through the whole film. Have him do small nods when someone speaks or asks him a question. Then make him into one tough S.O.B. Take a super cute girl like Carey Mullingan, whom i don't mind staring at the camera, but would rather hear her speak a lot. Make her as emotionless as a mannequin, watch her drive around with Gosling in a car and her son. Add a few shooting scenes with gruesome violence and you have Drive summed up in a net shell, that's all, that's it. I've never seen such a stupid move get such a good rating from critics, well, not lately. Albert Brooks brings absolutely nothing to this film, and anytime he speaks with his foul mouth you can't help thinking of Finding Nemo (he was the dad fish.) So this is just a boring all around film where everyone stares off into the distance, goes in slow motion, have awkward pauses, 30 second standing and sitting scenes, and basically look like they are all waiting for someone to say \\"ACTION\\", which there is very little of. So Drive, drive away from this film, as fast as possible.  I give two stars for the very very very cute/beautiful Carey Mulligan, and the 2012 Mustang GT 5.0 who were the best things in this terrible flick. Nothing else to really say. Later.
B000OPPBEQ|4.0|Blue quality/ hd audio is as per expectation, but the box, the covers are pretty pedestrian. I was expecting better.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|I'm old enough to have been a fan of the old Mission: Impossible TV show, when things ALWAYS went according to plan.  Not only did the tactical scheme always go off without a hitch, but the efficiency of the team members never varied, devices worked perfectly, and, heck, Barney the technical whiz never even had a screwdriver slip off the notch.<br /><br />PERFECT - every time.<br /><br />But that stopped in the movies.<br /><br />It angered me in M:I, Movie Number One, when they not only actually had the gall to take a major character from the original series--in fact, the very backbone of it--and \\"flip\\" him, but they went one step worse: they made the storyline so incomprehensibly jumbled and unclear that what was IMPOSSIBLE about it was trying to comprehending it.<br /><br />Two was better, but it wasn't until M:I Three that they really got the formula right.  And, coincidentally, it was exactly that movie that brought about the arrival of J.J. Abrams, the creator of \\"Lost\\" and a host of other great projects.  His touch enlivened the M:I series in a manner similar to his reawakening of the Star Trek franchise: his emphasis has always been the development of intriguing characters alongside a compelling story line, and that \\"mission\\" has been accomplished here.<br /><br />\\"Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol\\" is a terrific afternoon film: it does a wonderful job at removing you from the everyday tedium of your own life, convincing you that someone else's problems are worse than yours, and fills the two hours with wall-to-wall action.<br /><br />Now, whether \\"M:I-GP\\" is believable--that's another discussion point.  But it's like asking an avid football fan whether the Super Bowl is really all it's cracked up to be: it just doesn't matter.<br /><br />What is important is what's before you on the screen, and it's here \\"M:I-GP\\" excels.  From the opening rooftop shoot-out to the wham-bam finale, this movie really delivers.  There is scarcely enough time between chases and explosions and ingenious devices and lavish set pieces to let you chomp your popcorn or candy.<br /><br />I'm not the biggest Cruise fan out there, and frankly quite often have to overlook his presence in a project before I'm interested in it, but even I have to admit he really delivers here.  He has a commanding screen presence, and combines a cunning, thinks-fast-on-his-feet persona with a healthy dose of big ol' Mark Wahlberg-ish arms and a whole bunch of can-do American earnestness.  He's a force to be reckoned with here, and it's hard not to get behind him.<br /><br />Speaking of behind him, as his backup we have Simon Pegg as the suitably nerdy and usually reliable computer nerd, Paula Patton as the sexy and quite capable fellow agent, and Jeremy Renner as the shaky final member in the quartet who is hiding a compelling secret of his own.<br /><br />The four make up a suitably efficient team that can be both resourceful yet capable of making, if not mistakes, then, well, miscalculations.  So, while it may be true that the M:I of yesteryear is no longer here, what stands in its place is a much more visceral, in-your-face representation of it.  A clever indication of that occurred very early in the movie when, following the obligatory \\"this message will self-destruct in five seconds\\" pause, Ethan Hunt waits, and waits, and waits some more, then walks back to the device (a Russian pay phone) and thumps it, wherein it finally sizzles and smokes.<br /><br />It's an indication of what's to come, for almost everything that CAN go wrong DOES in this flick, and the film is barely moments old when not only an important agent is offed (Josh Holloway, an Abrams' castaway from the old Lost\\" series), the Kremlin is demolished, and the U.S. has been blamed for it.  Likewise, once assigned to the case the steel-jawed Cruise and his able crew fight off power outages, betrayals, a sandstorm, the constant breaking down of equipment, and a never-say-die Russian agent who dogsEthan Hunt every step of the way.<br /><br />What's important is that \\"M:I-GP\\" never disappoints, and in fact rewards us like the best of the Bond series with expensive equipment, international scenery, dazzling set pieces, and a series of \\"Can you top this?\\" stunts that even have Hunt hanging off the ridiculously tall Burj Khalifa building in Dubai--where yes, as usual, Cruise did most of his own stunts.<br /><br />Much of the credit must also go to the excellent work of Brad Bird, who directed not only \\"Iron Giant\\" but also the terrific \\"The Incredibles\\" animated movies, the latter of which is the CGI equivalent of any Bond/M:I film out there.  It was Bird's decision to shoot some of the footage in \\"M:I-GP\\" with IMAX cameras, and it pays off on the screen--this movie is a real beauty to watch.<br /><br />See \\"M:I-GP\\" if you are looking for some high-octane entertainment: it delivers in every sense of the word.like the best of the Bond series with expensive equipment, international scenery, dazzling set pieces, and a series of \\"Can you top this?\\" stunts that even have Hunt hanging off the ridiculously tall Burj Khalifa building in Dubai--where yes, as usual, Cruise did most of his own stunts.

B002ZG977Y|1.0|I grew up with the original Ray Harryhausen version and I don't even consider that to be the best film of his career. But it was still a \\"classic\\" and time has proven that. Yeah, it had its share of corn and cheese, and it even looked dated for its own time. But those creatures that Ray brought to life were truly \\"memorable characters\\" that will always live on in our minds. And it didn't hurt that it was supported by some heavywieght actors like Lawrence olivier, Burgess Meridith and Ursula Andress. The only respectable name in this one was Liam Neesin and as talented as he is, he just couldn't save this stinker. When I first heard they were doing a remake, it sounded promising... if done right. But the Hollywood suits like to rake in some extra dough by doing remakes of classic films knowing that the fans of the originals will be guarunteed curious suckers, and sure enough... this one was absolute CRAP!!! First off, these new CGI monsters (with the exception of the \\"Black Pegasus\\") were no better than what I've seen in a Playstation video game. The script and storyboard sucked hard. I mean real hard. When they weren't stealing the most memorable lines from the original and delivering them so bad that it made your stomach turn, it was just vomitable adventure movie clap-trap. Not a single clever line or anything that would put a smile on your face. There were also some lines that sounded more like \\"modern speak\\". Not at all period correct. Back in the golden days of Hollywood it was standard practice for the actors to sport Shakespearian English accents in these epic-tale movies. But with the realism of modern film making, it just doesn't fly anymore. Remember Colin Farrel as Alexander The Great with that thick Irish accent? Clash Of The Titans is a Greek tale of adventure, mythical gods and creatures. Right? Perseus is an shrimp-eatin' Aussie, Zeus (Liam Neeson) sounded like a Scottish sheepherder... Uggghhh!!! I can't go on... Trust me, it SUCKED!!!!!!!
B006O5XYWG|4.0|I was excited to check this movie but my wife was less than enthusiastic. After five minutes, she was asking me to turn it up! Amazing visuals, interesting storyline and lots of action made this a fun option for our Friday night at home.
0312641893|5.0|This review was originally posted on my blog: The Bibliophile's Corner  First Impression: When I read the synopsis for this story, I was very intrigued. Lunar people? I have always wanted to write a book about people on the moon. The fact that they are supposed to be ruthless in this story, made me a little sad. But a world with humans, androids, and cyborgs? I can totally deal with it.  First 50 to 100 Pages: Is it good or bad that I read through the first 140 without stopping? Good? I thought so too. I am so insanely impressed with the creation of this world. Meyer has done a wonderful job and I would love to pick her brain to figure out how she did this. I have always loved new tellings of fairy tales and this one will definitely go down as my favorite retelling of Cinderella.  When you read this book, I encourage you to take the time to read the first several chapters to really get into to story. It was very much needed. Not because it was hard to get into, but because I wanted to thoroughly understand the new language and the new world. As I started the story, I felt as though I was new to the town and needed to get a quick understanding. Meyer provides this very quickly and it's not hard to get hooked.  Characters: Cinder is smart, strong, inventive, and a truly amazing heroine. She knows that being a cyborg has caused others to look down on her, but that doesn't stop her from staying strong. Prince Kai is kind, sensitive, and already has the makings of a wonderful leader. He truly cares for his people and will do anything to protect them.  Final Thoughts: I don't know if I have the patience to wait for the next three books! Geez.
B00455VVZY|4.0|As I'm sure you've heard this is Fleetwood Mac at their absolute strangest.  Unlike Rumours or their self-titled album, it's almost completely devoid of catchy pop songs.  It has more than its fair share of Christine McVie piano ballads, but even they sound more morose than usual and lack immediate hooks.  Most of the Lindsey Buckingham songs are downright infuriating, sped-up country rock.  BUT, upon repeated listens, the album will seriously grow on you.  The Stevie Nicks songs are as usual the best.  \\"Sara\\" is a classic, even though it has no immediately catchy melodies like all of her songs on previous albums.  \\"Angel\\" is absolutely beautiful and stands up to \\"Rhiannon\\" and \\"Landslide\\" as one of my favorite Fleetwood Mac songs, and \\"Sisters of the Moon\\" is almost uncharacteristically creepy but just as great.  \\"Brown Eyes\\" is one of Christine's best songs.  The most memorable part of the album though, comes during the title track.  Lindsey's \\"Tusk\\" is the second-to-last song on the second disk.  It is the most bizarre point of the album and possibly their career, but, like the rest of the album, reveals its charm upon repeated listening.  It is an extremely catchy song despite its dark, emotional quality, and it's the one that sticks with you after the album's over.  If you're a fan of the Mac's other work with Buckingham and Nicks, then buy this album for \\"Angel\\" and \\"Tusk\\" alone.  Just expect less \\"Go Your Own Way,\\" and more \\"Gold Dust Woman\\"-type material.
0385534639|5.0|This review was originally posted on my blog: The Bibliophile's Corner  First, let me just talk about the circus. Le Cirque des Reves. I desperately want this to pop up in a field near me. Right now. While I was reading this book, I found myself transported in a way that I have never felt before. I could taste the caramel popcorn, the apple cider. I could feel the excitement and the awe all around me. I could hear people's laughter and talking. While I was reading, I found myself crossing my fingers for someone to please make this a movie so I can see it all again. I know I can just read the book again, but this would be incredibly stunning on a big screen. And then, someone literally has to make the circus! Right? Because Hollywood is real...right?  Now as for the two lovers, Celia and Marco, my heart was breaking for them the entire time. Going into this novel, knowing that they are pitted against each other and knowing they are going to fall in love, I found myself in tears constantly. From about part 3 to the end, I had to dry my eyes many times. Celia is beautiful and incredibly talented. She is complemented perfectly by Marco who is loyal and charming. The Labyrinth is my favorite attraction in the circus and I feel it best describes the relationship between the two, powerful and intense.  Aside from Celia and Marco, my favorite characters have to be the twins, Widget and Poppet. They were born on the opening night of the circus and harnessed some incredible powers. And if that weren't enough reason to love them, they're redheads! Also, Bailey is another of my favorite characters. When I first read his bit in the story, I was incredibly confused, but it all becomes clear in the end.  This book is unlike anything you will read. If you have not read this book yet, don't wait any longer. I promise you will not be disappointed. And, it will have you wanting to buy a red scarf. Don't know the significance? Well then, you're going to have to read the book.
B000SE5BLG|5.0|This is Black Sabbath's heaviest record out of the ones they did with Ozzie, and probably the only one where the songs are memorable all the way through.  All of their records have great songs, but this one is pretty consistent.  The bookends \\"Sweet Leaf\\" and \\"Into the Void\\" are the best, but \\"Children of the Grave\\" has a cool, more classic metal-sounding galloping riff, and an ending that reminds me of Soundgarden.  \\"After Forever\\" actually has a Christian message -- something 99% of Christians and Satan-worshipping metal fans alike apparently missed back when this came out.  Every song also has a consistently great guitar tone; it's not as muffled as their other records, and again sounds more like early, heavy Soundgarden than the corny '70s metal Sabbath is known for making.  Buy this if you want something truly HEAVY, raw, and dynamic that doesn't sound at all dated.
0143119680|5.0|This review was originally posted on my blog: The Bibliophile's Corner  First Impression: From the time it released in hardcover, I have heard nothing but wonderful things about. Once it came out in paperback, real quick I might add, I bought it the very day. So full of history, magic, and a new world to explore. How can I jump in?  First 50-100 Pages: I was hooked in the first chapter. You are thrown right in to Diana's usual day at the library, she is a historian after all, and she comes upon a book that changes her life forever. Soon vampires, daemons, and witches are showing up everywhere she turns. I loved the world that Harkness has created and the bit about the four humanoid creatures that walk the earth. What is particularly intriguing is in these first pages, this idea of creation of all of the creatures is said to be contained in this mysterious book. What captures my attention though is that every creature has a different version of what they think is in it. This is what kept me going through this novel. I had to know what it said.  Characters: Diana is a fierce witch who is determined not to use magic. Along with being fierce, she is stubborn and perhaps one of the strongest witches of all time. Michael, my dear vampire, is ancient and is drawn to Diana in a way that he knows should be wrong. Vampires and witches don't mix. His loyalty and protectiveness makes him a wonderful partner for Diana as they try to figure out this mysterious book.  There are some really interesting secondary characters ranging from daemons to vampires and witches. All of which are trying to get up with Diana and get the book from her. Knox is a particularly nasty witch. And Gillian for that matter. I would not want to get on their bad side. (Too bad Diana is.)  Final Thoughts: I am desperately awaiting the next book in the trilogy.

0439023521|5.0|This review was originally posted on my blog: The Bibliophile's Corner  Katniss Everdeen is a wonderful, strong, female character. She is a fighter and survivor but not completely calloused to love. I feel like that last bit is incredibly important to her character and how she develops throughout the story. I also love how confident she is in her abilities. Some readers took this as arrogance, I took this as advice to teen girls, telling them that they SHOULD be confident in their abilities. I truly love Katniss's love for her family, compassion for her opponents (at least those who deserved it), and strength to keep fighting.  Peeta Mellark is not your typical male character. While brute force is not his forte, his cleverness and charm makes him a strong contender in the Hunger Games. The son of a baker, he is easily looked over and considered soft. But there is something far greater than strength that keeps Peeta fighting.  Now for some supporting characters. Haymitch Abernathy is the victor of the 50th Hunger Games. He is to be the mentor of Katniss and Peeta for the 74th Hunger Games. Well, if he can stay sober. Cinna is Katniss and Peeta's sytlist because they must look good on TV while slashing and beating each other to death. And Rue. A small, twelve year old from District 11. You will love her.  As for the plot of the story, I thought it was wonderful. It moved along nicely, there were some nice twists. At times it was slightly predictable, but I was perfectly okay with that. And as for the descriptions, they were not overly done like I tend to see in more young adult novels. But by the same token, it was by no means under descriptive either. It gave you plenty to visualize, but left a lot up to imagination too.  Along with loving the characters and the plot, I give this book such a high rating because of how much I love dystopian novels.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|I own 800 DVDs and 150 Blu-rays and needless to say a hopeless fan of film.<br /><br />Ratatouille is a unique wonderful gem, watchable again and again. It looks amazing, has good pace, and the musical score is super fun and cool. The mix, the sound quality and usage of subwoofers and surrounds are spot on and of the highest quality.<br /><br />The story is great, the characters well played, and I can honestly say this is one of my favourite movies. I admit I watch it at least once a month - and I'm a 40 year old straight white guy with a hot girlfriend and no kids. :)

B005K17RU0|5.0|It works perfectly, even picking up new wi-fi connections quick enough to keep me informed on the move. The only thing that is not working is the time which can be off as much as 2 hours. Hopefully this will be fixed soon. I love this app.
B004VMVTNU|3.0|Going from the free app to the &quot;Extreme&quot; version seemed like a good move because alarms put me in shock, and this version is said to allow you to use your own music as the wakeup.  Well . . . it doesn't pick up my music even when I go through all the steps: it keeps going back to the &quot;Silent&quot; default&quot; despite my having  just selected a piece of music: it doesn't allow you to save the song selection.  Maybe it isn't supposed to work on Kindle Fire.  Too bad,it would have been a cool app.

B005UKJX4E|1.0|While the message of love and faith are wonderful, the movie was painful to watch. It jumped around, the sound was awful, the planetary depition of God was way too long, boring and predictable.
0091939526|5.0|I enjoyed reading the facts of this book and the knowledge of the author. I have been doing the diet for three weeks with no results of any weight loss. So I'm disappointed in the fact the diet doesn't work for me so far.
1609611543|5.0|This book is a very interesting look at what is and has been a staple of diet for thousands of years. Aside from the tinge of \\"conspiracy theory\\" implied (justifiably so), the book is anchored in science and direct observation of thousands of patients. I can say that as an experiment, having given up wheat and grains for 6 weeks, I haven't felt this good in years. My energy is up, I don't have the fatigue or joint pain I used to, and between meal cravings are gone. Combined with a low carb diet (I'm following Atkins), I'm losing weight and my type1 diabetes is coming into much better control. I've cut insulin from 140 units a day to under 30 units, and my needs are still dropping.<br /><br />Considering the number of potential ailments caused by wheat and grains, this book is worth reading and giving the advice Dr. Davis has written a try. You might be in for a very pleasant surprise with the results.
B005DVIPJY|4.0|The movie itself is so so, but the service was fast and very professional. I received these disc very quickly. Thanks!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this game soooo much it is really fun to play I play it all the time its awesome
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|I enjoyed playing this game very much and found it extremely entertaining and challenging  It kept me guessing and trying to not use my hints
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game is addicing! I thought the game may have been overhyped but it's very enjoyable and relaxing to play. I got stuck trying to finish the whole thing in one sitting! The music is nice but it's also nice to turn it off when you're playing for long periods. This is a very fun game and worth the nominal cost :-)
1609981111|5.0|I listened to the Woman in White on unabridged audio CD narrated by Ian Holm who played Bilbo Baggins in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings Trilogy.  Mr. Holm does terrific work bringing life to Walter, Marian, Percival, Fosco and all the wonderful characters in this book.<br /><br />The main comment I want to offer here, is how this wonderful work stands the test of time.  The language is Dickensian era (Dickens and Collins were not just contemporaries but friends), but it's clear, contemporary, expressive and entirely understandable.  Wilkie Collins created a timeless, modern classic in the Woman in White.  The story is a joy with its twists and turns, and even though I cheated by reading the Wikipedia plot summary beforehand, I still couldn't wait to hear the story unfold.<br /><br />In sum, the audio book is wonderful - great to fill three weeks of car commuting - but the story itself and Wilkie Collins' prose is a surprising, modern delight.  I offer high praise for the Woman in White and Wilkie Collins!
B004IF8TLU|5.0|A personal favorite; one of the few that I can watch five, even ten years later and still enjoy the same way when I saw it as a kid. My only disappointment was that I could only rent the movie and not buy it permanently as a digital play - I'm not sure of this was Amazon or the studio but, for two bucks for two days , it definitely left my face with a grin.
B006C1DH92|3.0|I quickly uninstalled this game for two reasons: it is the same game as Fruit Ninja with product placement and the game takes forever to install and load. The graphics aren't any better so its unclear why it runs so slow on my devices (Galaxy Tab and Droid Bionic.)<br /><br />If you like Fruit Ninja play that version instead. If you've never played any of these games then try it out. But I don't think it's worth paying for especially since it is basically an advertisement.<br /><br />(BTW: this is the second time an advertisement has masqueraded as a game like Fruit Ninja - see Brisksaber at the Android Marketplace which is a Star Wars Fruit Ninja with Lipton Brisk Iced Tea sponsoring. It's free though.)

B0067QPVJ6|5.0|\\" . . .  fills in gaps . . . \\"someone said.  Said gaps are in the Carpenter film . . . there are no gaps in the original [1951] film or in the original story by Campbell.  Now . . . in 1951 we lacked the GCI tchnology to have TheThing marph shapes as in Campbell's original story.  So we had James Arness + the USAF and a love story.  Today we have the gci effects and it is possible, tho no one has had the guts to do it, to make the film an honest adaptation of the Campbell story.  While the original film had the spaceship be both a recent arrival and a flying saucer in shape [which of course reflected  the flying saucer reports of that era] at least the ship was destroyed accidentally . . . as Campbell wrote it.  BUT, the Campbell spaceship was not saucer shaped but an obvious space ship design. It's destruction was  also accidental as was the discovery of The Thing some distance away apparently having be sent on a solo reconnaisance before whatever happened to bury both that individual and ship/crew in ice.  Moreover it had been in the Arctic ice  for apparent eons AND the dicoverers and scientits who had to fight it out with The Thing had to improvise -- no flamethrowers, helicopters, assault rifles etc -- both the human/non human tests and ways to kill the morphing monster: blowtorch and a jury-rigged electrocution gadget.  [Campbell's heroes were always earth humans, of mostly anglo-saxon descent and instoppably ingenious in a pinch.]  Now that could be one helluva movie.  Too bad no one has the guts and/or brains to do it.  Go read the original Campbell story and then let your imagination truly soar!    Cheers, George  ==========  30  ========

B0070Z4M4I|3.0|If you compare this one to the original,yes you will ask yourself many questions, this one was made with today's movie technology,special and computerized effects,the original one was made with hand made effects, The original \\"Thing\\" is in my movie collection but I dont think I will add this one to my collection, its just good for -one time- watch but I dont know how many times I watched the original one.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's a good way to pass the time, and a lot of fun, I play it every chance I get.
B006MQRLSA|5.0|Hats off to Brad Pitt for moving this project forward and getting it completed.  A FANTASTIC adaptation of the book.  I wondered how they were going to turn the book into a feature length film given its content and organization but they did it!  I don't want to spout too much and ruin this film for anyone so I'll just end with...  \\"what a surprisingly great picture\\".
1451627289|5.0|I received this as a gift and wasn't quite sure what to expect.  But once I started it was hard for me to put down.  I love this book!  It is large, but I think so worth the read.  Enjoy!!
B006UAWH2S|5.0|I won't spend a lot on the synopsis since most have already explained it. Simply put, this movie is a story of two people who fall in love just as an epidemic spreads across the world ridding people of their five senses, one by one.<br /><br />Personally, I loved the film! It is a beautiful film to look at, even in the most devastating of scenes. I felt multiple emotions throughout the film, of which I felt the movie accomplished well. There are scenes that may make you laugh, scenes that may make you feel tense, scenes that may make you shed some tears, scenes that may make you feel more appreciative of what we have in life.<br /><br />Now like I said in the title of this review this film is not for everyone. Some will find it silly or weird such as the symptoms that precede the loss of each sense (an example includes a massive consumption of everything in sight, from flowers to lipstick to a whole can of mustard). Some may also feel the movie is too optimistic in an end-of-the-world-scenario. You will either go with the film or you won't. I went with it and was thoroughly moved.<br /><br />I've read multiple reviews on this film, and it seems that many people take different things away from it. That is what I think makes a great film, when people are left to discuss after the credits roll. This is definitely one of my most favorites films in a while, and I wouldn't hesitate to watch it again.
B005T87QCI|1.0|do not buy this game it is a waste of your money it sucks very very baddly it is also a waste of your time
B000VZYXPC|5.0|This by far is my favorite album from The Killers.  Others will jump up and down that Hot Fuss was the best, however, I think this is what makes The Killers such a great band.  Each album brings a different style and for each person who likes one of the other albums better I can completely understand.  I like all the albums but for me this one is the best all around.  This band writes lyrics and music that is just different from the standard \\"formula\\" we hear from most bands these days.  I for one have heard enough of the un-original standard formula of songs to last a lifetime, and this band delivers something different that my ears crave.  It reminds me of being young and discovering all of the \\"new\\" music out there.  New is in quotes because at the time it may not have actually been new, just new to me.  Unfortunately, there is just not enough music out there that creates this feeling of \\"new\\".  At least there's The Killers there to help fill that void.
B001USHRCK|4.0|Bought this for my nephew who has been in to Lego's ever since he got out of the Thomas the Train phase.  Although he is 10, he was looking for something more challenging.  This fit the bill.  It takes a lot of free space to build this, but the hours of fun during and after completion is worth it.  The price is about double what I believe it to be worth, but sometimes you just spend a little more to make the kids happy.
B003XYERRM|5.0|This was the first time I've read anything sympathetic to Richard III, he's usually portrayed as a monstrous villain. It was interesting to see an author so convincingly take a different stance on the type of man he was.  I won't rehash the entire book, but just wanted to say that this is another example of why SKP has quickly become one of my favorite authors.
B004QSQML8|4.0|4 Stars = Classic<br /><br />Classic dark fantasy film, with beautiful cinematography, fantastic make up & special effects by one Rob Bottin! The Devil (\\"the Dark Lord\\") may be the best looking Devil in cinema, & Tim Curry's acting & his deep voice, perfect it!. The soundtrack (Tangerine Dream) is ethereal, that is, depending on which version of the movie you see, there is two, & unfortunately, the more pedestrian soundtrack is on the better version. Still, either version is a classic!<br /><br />A real treat for fantasy film lovers!

0307957934|3.0|Computer savant Alex Hoffman has developed an artificial intelligence (AI) program pretty much as a hobby - to see if he could.  Hugh Quarry is a salesman with a major investment firm.  When they meet at a party - both bored - they start talking finance.  Their conversation leads to starting their own hedge fund based solely on program trading, using Alex's specifically designed AI program.  His program is built around the financial markets' Volatility Index (VIX) plus an analysis of bad news - which Alex calls the \\"fear factor.\\"  His program is designed to monitor both the VIX for every financial transaction plus the fear factor at each moment, and then act via direct market trading with no human input.  The program also analyzes its results and adjusts its assumptions based on these results - again, with no human input.  It continues to trade, analyze, and revise its strategy and becomes quite literally unstoppable.  This is an interesting book.  I read it in a matter of hours.  It is well thought out; the program trading AI concept is plausible - not much different than the program trading occurring every day on major financial markets.  The addition of the fear factor is also logical - and reflective of the markets' reactions to the recent debt crisis here in the US and the sovereign debt crisis overseas.  This novel suffers on two counts:  1), I had no empathetic correction with Alex, the main protagonist.  I really didn't care what happened to him.  2), there were too many coincidences used to make the story work.
B006T5FDLG|5.0|I will join other who've asked why Metallica left these songs off DM and suggest these songs added to DM would've made a killer double LP!

1559408855|1.0|Contrary to what claimed by Amazon, this NOT the uncut version which, originally, lasted 145 minutes. To my knowledge, the uncut version has not been released yet.

0812550706|5.0|I had not read anything in the science fiction genre in decades, and I really did not know what to expect from this book.  I was very pleasantly surprised with \\"Ender's Game\\".  The book presents an engaging story that pulls the reader in right away and keeps things moving along and interesting.  The pace is good and the story is a very creative take on the Hero's Journey myth.  I thought I could predict the ending but it took me by surprise, and, although a relatively simple plot, the story is well written and quite an enjoyable read.  There is some extensive description of a fantasy game Ender plays (within the main \\"game\\") and it is a quaint old first generation fantasy style game  - makes one realize just how far computers and video games have come in the last twenty years.  Good book.  I recommend it.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hungar Games is a magnifiscent novel that is creative and original. it looks at the future, and in my mind points out and exaderates some ofthe problems in our present world that most americans dont even  realize  exist. i highly rccomend this to people over the age of  12.
B003Y5H5HY|1.0|Without the previous Swedish version I would probably be less critical.  Everything that this version does differently is to its detriment.  Subtleties are gone, the story is confused and give the impression that the director did not know himself what was happening.  While I was riveted watching the Swedish version, I kept looking on my watch to see when the movie would end.  Things that should be left to the viewer are spelled out--just how dumb does Hollywood think all viewers are!  For example, Lisbeth does not fail to point out right away that she videotaped the rape using a fiber optics camera!  The sappy ending is pathetic!  Mara does a decent job but is no match for the stunning Rapace!  Craig is completely out of place as a journalist.  Too bad to do such a poor job with a good cast!

B0067LY4WG|4.0|I wrote a response to someone else's review of this album basically revealing myself as a former Cohen addict.  I won't recreate all the traveling and collecting I've done over the years but I will say that seeing Old Ideas on the shelf made me feel like I'd seen an old friend resurface after many years of having been parted.  You know that feeling when you try to remember the last time the two of you got together- was it enjoyable?  was it strange?  a little awkward?  was it hard to catch up because it just felt too mechanical?  The last time I 'saw' Leonard was Dear Heather, not a record I would recommend to anyone but absolute die hards (and even for them I would issue a warning of forced writing and lifeless delivery on many tracks).  It was like seeing an old friend in rough shape, wanting to say; \\"Is everything alright?  You got a place to stay?\\"  Then came the Live in London 'rebirth' period of Cohen- where PBS helped to reintroduce Cohen to many who either didn't know him, thought he was dead, had forgotten him or had (like myself) given up hope after his last studio album.  The old friend looked better, dressed well, and apparently had a shave, stopped living in his car and taken up yoga.  \\"You look good!  It's nice to see you again! We should get together sometime!\\"  Old Ideas is the old friend returning yet again- a couple of years removed from the yoga classes, a couple of years from empty pizza boxes on the passenger side floor (okay, I'm exaggerating) with his sh** together.  Again we have our creative and clever old friend back with songs about visiting his stage persona (Going Home), predatory acoustic instruments (Banjo) and songs of faith (Show Me the Place and Come Healing).  The best songs on Old Ideas rival Various Positions best offerings in their sense of melody and lyrics.  Yes, there are a couple of too slow, unmelodic pieces (Amen being one of them, Anyhow being the other).  However, mostly this album has melody (Show Me the Place, Come Healing), has atmosphere (The Darkness), has bounce (Banjo), and thankfully has lyrics that, unlike some more recent material, are accessible and beautiful at the same time (\\"Had to go Crazy to love you, You who were never the one, Whom I chased through the souvenir heartache, Her braids and her blouse all undone\\").  In his previous outings (dating back to the Future in my opinion), Cohen was more like an old friend who'd been drinking and happened upon me in a train station babbling nonsense than the wordsmith I remembered from our earlier days together.  The wordsmith has started showing his face again here.  It's nice to see he got out of the subway and came to his senses.  The music on Old Ideas is less synthesizer driven, more basic.  The songs are less meandering and more brief, to the point.  The album as a whole is a more cohesive piece of art, complete with the songwriter's artistic images decorating the jacket and disc itself.  I would absolutely recommend this record; despite the 20% that I find to be a bit of a drag, this is a very good sign from someone who was rumored to be retiring.

B001EAWMGA|5.0|If you are a Jim Caviezel fan, this movie is for you. Men will like the fast action and fight scenes. Women will like the fantasy of a good looking, blue eyed man coming to the aide of the village and being the hero who falls in love.  I have watched this twice already in the 2 weeks I received it.

B005IGVYUG|4.0|Now, I might be mistaken about this, but back in the mid-1990's I began buying all of Waits' albums several years prior to the release of \\"Mule Variations\\". My relationship with Waits actually occurred at age 16 when, in 1990, I bought the \\"Red, Hot + Blue\\" compilation with his version of Cole Porter's \\"It' Alright With Me\\". My friends and I had a good laugh and said to ourselves, \\"Is this guy for real?\\" At that point in my pop music education I had not heard anything like Waits, and he certainly was not making music that was like anything else coming out at that time. It did not occur to me that he was influenced by Louis Armstrong or Howlin' Wolf (in fact I don't think at 16 I knew who Howlin' Wolf was, and let me just add here that I don't believe any kid at my suburban mid-western high school even knew who Tom Waits was except me).<br /><br />I also remember seeing Tom Waits on David Letterman around 1987/1988 for \\"Frank's Wild Years\\" and thinking how odd.<br /><br />Now, of course, I am fully briefed and experienced with Waits' oeuvre. I own all of his studio albums and in preparation for \\"Bad As Me\\" I listened to all of them back to back during the past two weeks. This, I feel, helped me put \\"Bad As Me\\" into proper perspective.<br /><br />Waits' has to have had one of the most unusual careers in popular music. I mean, his 70's output barely made any popular dent, nor did it sell very well. The 80's was pretty much the same. However, in the 90's, there was a strange turn of events as somehow his music was rediscovered. How that happened is anyone's guess. By the time \\"Mule Variations\\" was released in 1999, it seemed that more people than ever knew his music and sent that album up the charts making it his highest charting album to date. Since that time, each successive release has climbed higher and sold better. What? The last I checked in popular music the older you get the more you become irrelevant. Yet, here is Waits, age 62, with his highest charting album ever, \\"Bad As Me\\", cracking the top 10 for the first time in his life. So, if \\"Bad As Me\\" sucks, how do you explain its success? Waits is far from a sellout or a pop idol, so you can't say he's sold out and that's why it's gone to number 6.<br /><br />All of this leaves me mystified. But I like it. A lot. More 60+ musicians should crack the top 10. To me, Waits is a national treasure like Randy Newman or Warren Zevon or Lindsey Buckingham.<br /><br />But I digress...\\"Bad As Me\\" is exactly what you have been reading--an amalgamation of everything he's done throughout his career. It's like an abridged version of his career all on one disc in 16 songs. Look, \\"Kiss Me\\" is the closest thing here to something you might find on \\"The Heart Of Saturday Night\\" or \\"Small Change\\", and \\"Pay Me\\" could have come right from \\"Frank's Wild Years\\". Or how about \\"Hell Broke Luce\\"? That could have come from \\"Real Gone\\" or \\"Bone Machine\\". \\"Chicago\\" could have been on \\"Rain Dogs\\" or \\"Swordfishtrombones\\". There's something for every fan of Waits here. This is why it has received the high ratings. Waits does Waits, a real good, too. Now, I can see how if you weren't familiar with Waits that you could have the same reaction I had when I was 16, but if you give his music a chance and you get familiar with it, that initial shock wears off. Also, I can see if you are a hardcore fan, how you might have been hoping that he was going to reinvent himself like he does every decade, only to find that \\"Bad As Me\\" is just a compilation of everything Waits does best.<br /><br />Still, \\"Bad As Me\\" has the right mix of songs both serious and humorous, dour and hopeful, fast, slow, bluesy, jazzy, rocky. The greasy \\"Raised Right Men\\" and \\"Satisfied\\" and the lunacy of \\"Bad As Me\\" and \\"Hell Broke Luce\\", the somberness of \\"Talking At The Same Time\\", \\"Face To The Highway\\" and \\"Last Leaf\\" or the the 50's sock hop of \\"Get Lost\\", there's much to appreciate here. The three bonus tracks \\"She Stole The Blush\\", \\"TellMe\\" and \\"After You Die\\" round out the album in a way. It was unnecessary to put them on a separate disc on the deluxe edition. Also, I did not appreciate the book-like packaging of the deluxe edition--now where will I store it? It won't fit next to all my other Waits' cds!<br /><br />The bottom line, after listening to \\"Bad As Me\\" for two weeks straight is that my wife doesn't enjoy Waits (and I don't know any women who do for that matter), and he has come up with a good album that's not his best work but not his weakest either. Four stars solid. Here is how \\"Bad As Me\\" compares to Waits' previous works:<br /><br />1973 Closing Time: Five Stars<br />1974 The Heart Of Saturday Night: Four Stars<br />1975 Nighthawks At The Diner: Four Stars<br />1976 Small Change: Five Stars<br />1977 Foreign Affairs: Four Stars<br />1978 Blue Valentine: Three Stars<br />1980 Heartattack & Vine: Four Stars<br />1983 Swordfishtrombones: Four Stars<br />1985 Rain Dogs: Five Stars<br />1987 Frank's Wild Years: Four Stars<br />1992 Bone Machine: Five Stars<br />1993 The Black Rider: Three Stars<br />1999 Mule Variations: Five Stars<br />2002 Blood Money: Three and a Half Stars<br />2002 Alice: Four Stars<br />2004 Real Gone: Three Stars<br />2006 Orphans: Brawlers, Bawlers & Bastards: Four Stars<br />2011 Bad As Me: Four Starsunnecessary to put them on a separate disc on the deluxe edition.

B0064NTZJO|4.0|This is yet another Hollywood noire tale, told amid the extreme violence of bullets spraying bodies and blood flying all over the place. Why why why is this considered entertainment? You will need a strong stomach if you watch, yet the tale, such as it is, is well told. Ryan Gosling keeps an emotionless stare on his face throughout most of the film, sometimes smirking a bit, and delaying for long seconds any words that he does manage to speak. In fact, there's no dialogue for the first, oh, 10 minutes of this film. Finally, the brooding silences erupt into the inevitable violence. There's a tale of bad love here, some Mafia thrown in for good measure, and some well done car chases, as well as some slo-mo gun and knife play. The acting is above reproach, but there is no redeeming social value to this dark film.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This is a great game.The graphics are beautiful and the gameplay is fun.I have been thoroughly enjoying the game but I do now have a problem.For some unknown reason I can no longer open the journal to see the journal pages or hints.I can still use all the other inventory including the map.I have already made it to each statue and can activate each season.Has this happened to anyone else?<br />  It worked fine last night but now today when started playing I was unable to get into journal.<br />  I am playing on my Kindle Fire.I left the game and then tried again when reopened, but still no luck.<br />  I definitely do not want to have to restart the game from scratch again,especially not even knowing if that would help.

B004I8WD6E|3.0|This case provides good protection. I drop my phone a couple times a week and there's never any problem. The lip around the front provides good protection for the screen if you set the phone face down.<br /><br />Regarding the looks of this case.  The iPhone 4/4s without a case is beautiful, and most cases don't look as good as the phone AND hide the phone's good looks. Since this case is clear, it lets the phone's good looks show through. I have used it on both a black and white iPhone. It looks good on both, and is especially nice on the white one. The only thing I don't like about the looks is the circles on the back. To me, they aren't attractive at all, they look a bit tacky and unattractive.  But, they're on the back, and the case is super inexpensive, and the case is very protective, and nothing's perfect. So I can live with the circles.<br /><br />What's harder to live with, though, is the gradual yellowing that started showing up after about two months. It is more noticeable on the white iPhone. I would throw the case out, but I value it's protection a lot and I haven't found another case yet. I thought about buying another one of these--they're very inexpensive. But i think it's cheaper in the long run to pay $20 or even $40 for a case that will look good for a year or two than to keep replacing a $9 case every couple of months.

0812550706|5.0|My main advice to anyone interested in reading this is that they have to: 1) read the introduction and 2) suspend their disbelief that children could act, talk and think this way.  The introduction explains that teachers and parents of bright children have dismissed this book because it has the children thinking, acting and talking in ways that are far more mature than their years.  I basically agree with this.  But since another part of the introduction explained that bright teens write to the author to express that he has captured how they feel, I decided to release that criticism.  It doesn't matter that kids aged 6 - 11 are not capable of the kind of thoughts and behavior that Card writes for them.  What matters is that OSC creates characters who could be ANY age and would still feel three-dimensional.  Don't think of Ender as 6 years old, think of him as 15 if that's what you have to do to get through the story.  (And I think that's what they're doing to make the movie.)  It's a riveting story - one you won't regret getting lost in...unless you can't let go of that disbelief.

B001E45XT4|3.0|This is the second time I have purchased this headset (the first set broke).  However, for the money it is an excellent headset.  I have several friends who have purchased this set and we all had the same failure point.  After about a year to a year and a half, the headset will break on the left side near where the microphone comes up to hide.  Every single person I know that has had this has had the same failure point.  However, during the year you use them they are great.  Good sound quality and the around the ear design does a good job at keeping out ambient noise if there are other things going on in the room.  It won't be silent, but all the sounds are muted so that when my wife is watching TV around 8 feet away at normal volume, it doesn't bother me too much when I have these on.  They will be a little tight if you have a larger than average head but they will loosen up within a week or so.  Stick with it.  After that they are very comfortable.

B000PMG16U|4.0|The Star Wars saga has come a long way since the original releases of the prequels in 1999, 2002, and 2005, and since then technology has rapidly advanced. This re-release of the original prequels is worth every dime. Lucas managed to address problems found in the originals and raised the quality of the movies ten-fold. Episode I in particular was given very nice attention, starting with the added CGI and remastering of old technology that was already in the movie. It looks refreshed and ready for the 21st century, with errors that were addressed in them and fixes that help make enjoying the movie easier. The same can go for episode II and III, with III looking absolutely gorgeous. Overall, if your a fan of star wars, buy the prequel blu rays, as for the original saga, stick to the Theatrical editions :p

1451627289|3.0|I've only read a few Stephen King books (Gunslinger Series) but the writing here was familiar to me. The story is automatically going to be interesting, seeing as how it's about time travel and changing history. Many issues arise that you've never thought of and the main character has to maneuver around time constantly trying to kick his arse. This is more of a personally biased review, but worth stating regardless. I read this huge book because of my interest in JFK's assassination. I have become convinced of some certain things based on overwhelming evidence (See \\"Me & Lee\\" by Judyth Vary Baker, best book available on Lee Harvey Oswald), and unfortunately Stephen King makes an effort to ensure his Lee Oswald is exactly the way the media painted him in the '60s. I was hoping for some interesting twists in Lee's character, something that would surprise the reader or the main character. Instead, the protagonist's initial assumptions and wild guesses about Lee stay constant throughout the whole story, and he is completely spot-on when he finally meets him at the end. It was a huge missed opportunity in my opinion. Making him exactly how everyone expects is incredibly boring, and also very untrue. His character never did anything unusual or unpredictable. I was sad to see that King so blindly accepted the media view of Lee, as well. It doesn't take much digging to find a different person than the one we were shown on tv.

B001HN6922|1.0|The first Cars movie may be the best kids movie ever. It was fun loving and taught kids about relationship building, respect for others and how to learn from your mistakes. Cars 2 might of tried to teach something but, it was overshadowed by guns, hate, drug use and the intent to kill. There were fights, many cars were shot and several were destroyed using a laser. The scene that disgusted me the most was when a character was visually tortured on screen and at the end of the torturing he was put to death. Now I am a man that owns guns, hunts for food and have taught my children to respect the dangers of guns. I would not suggest this movie to anyone it has no values. I am not sure how this was rated G, had the same scenes done with people it would of been rated R. All of our children are smart enough to make the correlation between these characters and people. I am disappointed in Disney/Pixar.
B000002J2B|4.0|An extremely moody and atmospheric album. Released the same year as the superb Trick Of The Tail, Genesis would take thier progressive rock sound to its grand finale (although thier is still an underlying prog sound on thier masterful Duke album).  This was one Of Tony Banks favorites and its not hard to see why considering that his keyboards are on the forfront of this albums sound.  His epic suite One For The Vine is nothing short of brilliant.  This was the album where Steve Hacket began to feel resentful do to lack of consideration of his input.  Hacket should have been more respected at this point considering how he proved himself as a world class guitar player helping propel genesis into the greatest 70s rock band, (sorry Zeppelin but its true).  Wind and wuthering has a wintery feel and takes its listener on a journey thru old english story telling.  Afterglow is another standout track, just listening to this song conjures up images of a bright sun peircing through dark grey clouds.  This is not one of my favorite Genesis albums but its still good, (Genesis didn't put out any bad albums in the 70s).
B0053KWDES|3.0|I got this to be an amp for my helmet speakers when I'm snowmobiling in the mountains.  The first day out what I found is that the \\"In\\" port on it didn't hold onto the cable end very well.  In fact, the longer the day went, the looser it got until all I had was one ear.  I will say that the QUALITY of the audio I get out of it is very good, when I hold it still, and I'm sitting somewhere where the cables don't get wiggled.  Works great, sounds great.  If it wasn't for the bad input port, and the fact that it won't firmly get both left/right audio, I would rate it 5 stars.
B00679T1EO|5.0|I LOVE DOWNTON ABBEY! When I read that the American PBS version was edited and in doing so they have left out portions of the story that gave it more cohesiveness and background I was on the hunt for the UK version. Problem number 1 was the UK DVD version won't play in the US because we are in a different \\"region\\"...bummer but I kept reading and searching (I'm not a techie I'm a Granny)and discovered that if I could find a Blu-ray version AND I had a Blu-ray player I could eliminate the \\"non-US region\\" problem...yippee....found a Sony Blu-ray Disc/DVD player BDP-S185 for $79 that works great on Amazon...and two UK suppliers (one that had Downton Abbey Series 1 Blu-ray<br />and another that had Downton Abbey Series 2 Blu-ray in the original uncut British versions). I was a little freaked out that it might take forever for delivery to arrive but no problem with \\"Factory Distributor\\" (an Amazon UK supplier) I ordered it Jan 30 and received it Feb 3!!!! That's faster than I've gotten deliveries sent from the same state and cheaper as shipping was only $2.98.<br />If live in the US and want to get the original versions here's one caveat. When you search Amazon it seems to take you to PBS versions even though you've specified British versions...look carefully at the pictures. The UK version does NOT say PBS on the cover and the DVD's jewel case is predominantly blue.

0385344228|5.0|Defending Jacob is a thrilling and powerful book. I literally could not put it down. This book needs to be added to everyone's to read list. It is so well written and had me frantically turning pages. The ending left me breathless and I am still thinking about this book. It is that good!  Andy and his wife Laurie live in an affluent, idyllic town in Massachusetts with their fourteen year old son, Jacob. However, their world is torn apart when Jacob is charged with the murder of one of his classmates. What follows is an amazing, edge of your seat story. This is an unthinkable situation these parents are faced with. Andy and Laurie's life sounds like any other ordinary family but after their son is accused of murder, every aspect of their near perfect life begins to fall apart and crumble. Andy refuses to allow himself a shadow of a doubt in his son's innocence. Laurie has a more difficult time and begins to question if she ever really knew her son at all. Jacob comes across as the stereotypical, moody teenager and left me constantly wondering how the ending would play out. All I can say is, \\"wow.\\"  The story has twists and turns. It is a love story, suspense thriller, as well as the psychology of a family in crisis. The entire book is compelling from beginning to end. I can't recommend this book enough! Excellent!!!

B004V5QWU2|5.0|I have trouble falling asleep and have been rigging up background noises for decades.  A few years ago I bought a white noise maker for $50 - cheap for white noise makers.  So when I bought Sleepy Time, it was with the attitude that I didn't really NEED to buy it.  But now my previous white noise maker is permanently retired.  This app is amazing!  The full moon logo is visually pleasing and the app has a black background so it's easy on the sleepy eye.  It has tons of sounds that you can choose to download or not (of course I downloaded them all).  You then can add a single sound to your list of favorites, or you can \\"mix\\" up to three sounds at a time, and add those to your favorites too. You can customize the volume settings for each sound, and when saved to your favorites list the app remembers those settings plus the timer settings as well.  My favorite is currently a mix of rain, thunderstorm, and distant train, each set at different volumes.<br /><br />The sound quality is amazing and puts my $50 white noise machine to shame.  The sounds keep playing, even after your Kindle Fire has entered sleep mode.  When the timer is up, the sounds fade out nicely.  If you happen to have your Kindle on at the time, you'll see a little \\"good night\\" message.<br /><br />I like it so much that I have even started listening to Sleepy Time in the background when I'm playing game apps.<br /><br />I haven't used this at the office yet, but I could see where it would be valuable, especially if you work in a noisy cube farm and you're not allowed to use music to drown out the blabbersnouts who sit in your vicinity.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was reluctant to read this book as it came highly recommended by a teenager who told me it was all the<br />rage amongst her friends.  My concern was it would be something far more appealing to the younger set.  What a<br />surprise to find myself locked into the novel from the start and unwilling to put it down and attend to mundane household chores. The book is fast paced, believable and a real page turner.  You will have no problem<br />stepping into the shoes of Katliss our heroine.  This is not a super girl, she has emotions, fears, wants and needs<br />any of us would have.  She and the other characters in the book(s) remain real throughout the entire three book series.  I would highly recommend this and the two following novels to anyone who is up for some first class fast paced book entertainment.

0345533054|1.0|I don't know why so many authors of mystery books have to have so many one dimensional idiots as the \\"hero\\" of their books. Here's another one. I think any good work of mystery fiction should at least have some degree of plausibility, but none here. Mr. Coben could have at least TRIED to write an interesting book, but I guess it's just a lot easier to plagiarise your own mindless drivel. Maybe his next book could involve \\"self-plagiarism\\". On that topic Mr. C. is an expert.

B006OT03BM|1.0|I'm really disappointed to find out that this whole \\"only 5000 Box sets made!\\" seems to be nothing more than false advertisement. Amazon has them, Best buy did too and other websites as well. There are more than 5,000 Transformers fans out there and those 5,000 Box sets should've been gone on the very first days or so, if not the first few weeks at the most. No just that, IF there were indeed only 5,000 Box sets made, they must've come with a certificate of authenticity or at least something that said \\"copy 1,500 of 5,000\\" for example. None of that came with it. Another thing about the \\"signature\\", according to Michael Bay himself on this video: [...] he says he \\"signed\\" all 5,000 of them. If you look at his video you can very well see his actual signature. All of them match. The one that comes with the Box set doesn't even come close to his actual signature. I love the Transformers franchise, I really do. I just don't like being ripped off.

0385736002|4.0|I'm really looking forward to this series now that the first book got all of the background and introductions out of the way.  This book covered the first two days of Josh and Sophie's adventures with the famous Nicholas Flamel.  The 15 year-old twins unwittingly became involved in a magical struggle that has been looming for centuries.  I loved how Scott incorporated history and mythology to create this enchanting world full of god-like Elders and fantastical creatures.  He effectively takes the legend of Flamel and transforms it into a complex and spellbinding universe going back thousands of years.  The twins must rescue Flamel's wife and the powerful Codex from Dr. John Dee to prevent the demise of life on earth.  Working with a motley group of immortals, Flamel uses the twins to fulfill an ancient prophecy, and by the end of the second day, Josh and Sophie's lives have been changed forever.  I have a good feeling that the best is yet to come as the conflict escalates, the twins develop their new found powers, and they learn more about the magical world they have been thrust into.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is such an amazing app! You are able to read at your leisure or follow plans designed by professional pastors and whatnot with different topics such as Learning to Forgive, Healing With Grief, and tons of other areas. You can bookmark favorite verses and share them on different social networks with your spiritual friends. As a woman suffering from grief, depression, and learning to trust in God again, this helps me to understand the Bible in ways I never thought possible as it is written in words understood by all. Great job to YouVersion for designing the perfect accompaniment especially for someone like me!
B0063IH60K|4.0|fun to play. would recommend for everyone.  Good graphics and sound. set your own backgrounds using your own photos or theirs.
0307959856|3.0|It may come as a shock that this book is my actual introduction into the world of Jane Austen, unless you count a million viewings of the movie Clueless, which is based off a different Austen novel.  I haven't ever read a stitch of Austen's work, so I entered this book with no knowledge or prejudices about any of the characters.  This book gives enough background so that someone like me is not entirely confused as to who is who, and hints just enough at the past and present of each of these characters that you can get a bit of an idea about them before the bulk of the novel starts.<br /><br />Given that most other readers probably have read Pride & Prejudice, I'll spare a description or comment on our cast of characters, since I don't have P&P to compare them to anyway.  What we have in this story is really a classic whodunit, with a bloody supposed murderer standing over a dead body.  To make matters worse, we get a confession of sorts, which throws everything into disarray.<br /><br />The rest of the book deals primarily with the trial(s) of the accused, and a telling of how it affects the other characters in the novel.  Due to the Darcy's strained relationship with the Wickham's, there is a lot of speculation regarding that aspect, which I found confusing and somewhat irrelevant.  Also, I kind of felt like I was actually in the courtroom, because we spend a lot of time reading testimony from various witnesses - testimony we had already read the night of the murder, then again at the initial hearing, and then at the final trial.  I was a bit bored by this, I would have happily read a little summary that said \\"so and so gave their testimony from the day, it was the same as before\\", and been spared the extra time.<br /><br />The actual motivations for the mysterious fight that takes place right before the murder, and the circumstances surrounding that entire scenario, felt weird and kind of forced to me.  I understand there will be secrets revealed in this kind of investigation, but a lot of it felt awfully convenient to me.  Perhaps I'm more accustomed to modern proceedings, or the reading of murder mysteries where more time is spent on the investigation and unraveling through police work rather than coincidence.  I guess what I'm trying to say is, I didn't love the way this all played out.<br /><br />All that said, I didn't hate the novel and it did entertain me.  There were times I felt it difficult to read, I think due to the previously mentioned boredom.  It's a little disappointing, I've heard such great things about the source novel and PD James, so I'm hoping her other work is better than this.felt awfully convenient to me.

B005KTZ05G|4.0|I was glad to get my little Ezio. He is very well sculpted. I mean, you can see the veins in his hands and even his fingernails.  He's a little on the small side, but I don't really mind. He's about the same height as my Tidus action figure. Ezio is flexible to a degree. His joints are stiff in his arms and legs, but his feet seem loose. He comes with three hand sets. If you're careful enough you can bend the wrist on the hands. Yes the hands come with an up and down motions. Don't worry, I've noticed some of the paint may come off of the hands, but the sleeves of Ezio's shirt should hide it. The hidden blades do come out, but I wouldn't if you do not have a safe place to put them.  So over all: 4 out of 5 stars.  Parts are small. You need to keep them in a safe place.  VERY well sculpted.  Slight stiff, but not to stiff.  Around the size of a normal action figure, around 6 inches(15 cm)
B000000H57|4.0|Melody and atmosphere have become more important to Type O Negative than being offensive and hostile in raging songs of hardcore fury and dark, epic heavy metal. The sound of October Rust leans towards an almost pure form of gothic rock, but played with the volume and energy of heavy metal; nearly all traces of their hardcore punk roots are gone, in favor of a lush, atmospherically layered sound combining the slow dirge rhythms of Black Sabbath, the pop-rock vocal harmonies of The Beatles, the gloomy impetus of Sisters of Mercy, the melancholic elegance of The Cure, and ethereal ambience of Lycia.  \\"Wake up, it's Christmas mourn  Those loved have long since gone  The stocking are hung but who cares  preserved for those no longer there  six feet beneath me sleep\\"  Unlike the previous two albums, which presented a variety of song-styles and expressive tones, October Rust is characterized by a unified sense of the romantic, mostly slow songs of sensitive emotion and sensual desire. The album is a connected whole, with each track either blending into the next or harshly and unexpectedly cut off for the immediate introduction of the following song.  These are intelligent and stimulating songs of intimate longing in styles of laid-back atmospheric rock, somber, impassionate post-punk, and catchy keyboard-driven exercises of dramatic emotion, all structured with a more pronounced emphasis on direct expression in expansive composition. Most of these songs are dark, haunting laments expressing a very real sense of vulnerability that has until now been effectively protected behind the shield of anger and self-deprecating humor.  Extended instrumental passages, some of which seem like episodes of experimental improvisation, and a generally gradual course of unfolding events in slow and expansive rhythmic constructions result in lengthy compositions, usually of an unnecessary application of repetition or excessive elaborations on a conceptual theme. In \\"Wolf Moon\\" and \\"Haunted\\"they come to the ominous presentations of torment that made up much of the previous two albums, but even the colossal \\"Red Water\\", a brooding epic of seasonal mourning and futility, demonstrates a level of orchestration and elegance alien to past releases, along with a broadened application of atmospheric mood and deep feeling.  Peter Steele's remarkably abyssal vocal tone is less inflected with contempt, instead a rumbling, quaking voice of groaning lamentation, erotic, submissive, and reaching a near weeping tone when raising his voice to its highest register, and at times even curiously, yet blaringly, detached, before succumbing to an almost theatrical sorrow and agony.  \\"Now we'll make love by fire light  A blaze so high it lights the night  Long fingernails dug in my skin  Yourself so wet invites me in\\"  Guitar is totally fuzzed out in an electric haze of enhanced distortion, never really producing anything in the way of a distinct riff, but more a droning sound of vaguely shaped rhythmic melody. \\"Die with Me\\" and \\"Green Man\\" employ acoustic guitar in a folk-style mode of reflection, while towering, swooning solos drive home the emotional core with melodic eloquence.  The rhythm is an almost constant motion of slow drifting, with few instances of increased tempo toward rock-oriented standard shifts of momentum, save perhaps for the humorous \\"My Girlfriend's Girlfriend\\", the catchiest, simplest, and weakest song on offer. Churning underneath is the somewhat unsettling rumble of a deep bass guitar providing an element of degraded harmonic support, the bottom-end root source providing the low mass of sonic texture to this otherwise beautiful music.  Josh Silver's outrageous keyboards spread a backdrop of gloomy and ethereal sound rich with dramatic effect. An array of various electronic nuances and effects supply ambient texture, filling the vacant spaces with environmental residue to enhance the experience of this music, which is autumnal, nature-themed, and lovelorn in a fit of restless desire. Piano forms delicate melodies, particularly in the gorgeous \\"Love You to Death\\", while organ adds an almost shivering religious aspect to the sound.  The sound is immaculate, massive and electric as is standard for this band, a tremendous production enhancing the presence and experiential magnitude of the music. For this particular demonstration, the sound emphasizes the high-end elements with an extra sheen of radiance on keyboards and lead guitar, though at levels in harmony with the chosen aesthetic of sound presentation.  \\"Autumn in her flaming dress  Of orange, brown, gold fallen leaves  My mistress of the frigid night  I worship, pray to on my knees\\"  October Rust is an epic and intense work that considerably decreases the hostile element of this band's character as expressed on earlier material, more ambitious and affectionate yet still dark and pessimistic, pagan and deeply melancholy in a more mature and grim awareness of existence. Though this music exists primarily for a manifestation of its own aesthetic, resulting in captivating and exquisitely demonstrated music that uses conceptual evolution as an endorsement to its surface presentation, the strong individuality of sound, charismatic expression, and impressive creative vision makes Type O Negative a thoroughly engaging and intriguing act with mastery for disintegrating atmospheric design of sublime trance-inducing quality.
0345472322|5.0|All teachers, parents, and coaches should read this book. It is powerful. It will change the way you think about talent and hard work, and how you praise your children, students, and athletes.

0743437497|5.0|Ever since I've seen Stanley Kubrick's 1980 film version of \\"The Shining\\", I really wanted to read the book, but never got to it, and when I did, it was hard putting it down. It's 500 pages worth of emotion, terror, and great suspense. After reading the book, I compared it to the movie. There are certain things that are better in the book and better in the movie. The book hits the emotional level better since it talks about the struggles in the Torrance family. It delves into all of their lives more and you really feel for all of the characters. When they get to the hotel, they all seem happy, and that's when I really didn't want all of that bad stuff to happen, so when it happens, it's extremely suspenseful. The film version doesn't delve into the emotional factor enough. There also many different cool things that aren't it the movie, like the scrapbook of the history of the hotel, the wasps, their trips to Sidewinder, and the topiary animals (but I'm glad they didn't have the animals in the film). There are a lot of entertaining things in the book that aren't present in the film. The thing that's better in the film is the way they upgraded the terror. In one of the pivotal scenes in the book, when Jack appears behind Wendy and she hits him on the head with a wine bottle, they definitely made it more intense in the film, where instead she finds hundreds of papers with the line \\"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\\" and Jack creeps up behind her, where he follows Wendy up the stairs and she hits him on the head with a baseball bat, in a scene that lasts 10 minutes. It's by far my favorite scene in the movie and I was a little disappointed that it wasn't like that in the book, but there was a great build-up of suspense before that part in the book.    The endings were different, and I don't know which one I liked better, but I can conclude I enjoyed the book probably just as much as the film. Even though the 1997 Mick Garris version probably sucks, I still am gonna see it soon. Altogether, this book was pure enjoyment from beginning to end. It's heartwarming, sad, suspenseful, and even though I knew what was going to happen, I was terrified. Stephen King wrote this book so uniquely and it's definitely the best book I've ever read!
0062082353|5.0|THis is clearly one of the best books you will ever read. It is funny, scary, real, and inspiring. It is a MUST read for any Navy SEAL fan
B004QXJZXA|5.0|This is still the best racing movie ever made in my opinion.  I had not seen the film in years and questioned how it would look today's HD TV's.  However, after reading the other reviews it encouraged me to check it out.  And I am glad I did, it was worth every penny.  I am truly shocked that a 40 year old movie can look and sound this good.  The remastering that they did was excellent.  And if you are truly a fan check out the trailer that is narrated by Chad McQueen.
B0064NTZQ2|2.0|Just add an \\"L\\" to the end of the title and there's your one-word review.<br />What a waste of (my) time and (their) talent, especially the lovely Carey Mulligan, who was horribly underutilized. Heck, Ryan Gosling was better in \\"The Notebook\\" than in this, in my opinion, and I didn't care for that movie either.<br />And using pop-culture music (also horrible!) and gory, gratuitous violence doesn't make you Quentin Tarantino.  Art house movie, my ass.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game. I play it all the time.It is easy to operate and play. I give it a 5 star rating.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|This movie was very boring and repetitive. Doesn't even deserve a single star. The first one was bad, but this one makes the first one look not so bad.
B0041KW4H2|5.0|I Love this movie I have had all the formats when I saw it was available on blu-ray I had to have it and the blu-ray lived up to my expectation. I guess I purchased the import version from Italy. The only downfall is that it took about 2 weeks before it arrived and the back of the blu-ray case is in another language but the price was right.
B006P0FD4W|2.0|You know, I've been a fan of these Paranormal Activity movies since it debuted a few years ago. The first and second movies were pretty decent, although you can tell they were made on a low-budget. The first two relied more on getting to know the characters and heavily on very slow-building tension, which is why I loved them so much. That makes me wonder why this one just went off-track. PA3 is, quite literally, a weak mess of a movie. You'd think these guys would up the wow factor of this movie, considering how the first two were, but no. I know they were trying to tell the backstory to the series but they could do that and still wow us. The acting was very dry and that made it unbelievable to me. I mean, the knockoff movie:Paranormal Entity, was way better than this one. I was really disappointed and just can't recommend anyone buy this movie. If you can find it in a bargain bin somewheres, okay-maybe then. But for full asking price-No. These guys better get their game on in the next movie or fans are going to jump ship, plain and simple.
0385534639|5.0|I bought this book a while ago but took some time before reading it.  I'm now debating reading it again right away!  The scenes and descriptions are as important as the plot.  The characters are deep with fully developed personalities.  The world you are brought into is one you won't want to leave, and when you finish reading you'll miss the world you discovered.  The plot has some weak spots (the origins of the plot seemed contrived and rushed into the book), but the imagery more than makes up for any downfalls the book may have.
B002HQWQOI|5.0|As far as I can tell, this is a  fine recording - I enjoy it, though I haven't heard alternatives.<br /><br />Anyway, what I'm really here to say is that this is available as part of the DHM 50th anniversary box set, which is getting hard to find but may be a good deal if you can. [[ASIN:B0014RIULO Deutsche Harmonia Mundi 50th Anniversary Box]]. So if you're considering this recording, you might consider that box. You really won't go wrong either way.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The minigames are abundant, and they keep a steady flow, but the huge prices on most of the mingames are ridiculous.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Any of you old enough to love or even like Myst, will like The Lost City. Hard game, and beautiful graphics. I spent an hour playing this hidden object game without even realizing it. The graphics are amazing, just gorgeous. Sounds are insanely awesome. When you put the color coded key into the color coded lock for each lion, when the key turns, the lion makes a low growl. Worth the money to get, and easy to get lost in the game.
1400052181|5.0|This is not my normal reading material. I was very aware of the book but, like many people, I run the other direction when I hear the word \\"science\\" and 400 pages devoted to science wasn't something I was planning on dedicating my time towards. However, a good friend ask me if I was interested in attending a book discussion at her church and this was the book they were reading. I decided that maybe I should do it just for some self-improvement and for expanding my horizons. Even then, I kept finding other things to read until I finally had to pick it up in order to be finished by the time I needed to be. Once I actually started reading and got into the story, I finished it within about three days and was just bowled over.<br /><br />There is no need to go into what this book is about; with almost 1000 reviews here and all the publicity around it, you can figure out the basic content. What I will add is that if you are even mildly interested in the topic of cell research or want to read something that will have a lasting effect on you -- give it a try.<br /><br />To me, this book is an example of journalism at its best. The author knows her subject, took the time to fully grasp the topic, gives you the story in an engrossing fashion, and manages to do all that while not slanting the facts to fit her own personal philosphy. She doesn't whitewash the facts nor does she lead the reader down the road of telling you what to think.<br /><br />It's thought-provoking and interesting --- well worth a read!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like this game a lot more than the regular solitaire. I would recommend this game to anyone that likes any kind of solitaire.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|lots of fun games. I recommend it to anybody willing to spend time struggling thru various games. I have so much fun with this app. cant believe its free
B00479SVBU|5.0|Do not let the price fool you...This FM transmitter is very well built, has great fidelity and a lot of power...It even has built-in equalizer...The remote control also works very well...The hardest part of setting it up is to find an unused frequency on your radio...Once it gains popularity Amazon will probably up the price a bit.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I got it for free as the application of the day,  but I think it's easily worth a Buck.  the touch ui is excellent. and the game fun.  many ports are lacking,  but not this one.

B005HSL626|4.0|This game is so fun and I think evereone should get but the only thing I don't like is all the bombs.
B005UT29Z0|5.0|This movie was one of three that was recommended my Financial Sense News Hour.  The other was Inside Job and the last I can't remember :>(.  This movie is not for everybody if you expecting Zombies car chases and shoot out this move is not for you.  If want a well acted at times funny drama about the mentally on Wall Street this is well worth a look.  If you have been keeping abreast of the financial system since 2008 this is worth a look.  This is my one of my top ten moves (The only non military non science fiction, non horror).
B0073LWEXK|5.0|My kids and I spent a few fun hours solving this game on a snow day.Nice graphics and soundtrack. It would have been nice to be able to tour the restored lost city when finished.

B005K17RU0|5.0|love the detail this gives me and it even works better than local radar! love having it at my fingertips!
0061990477|5.0|This is the story of many generations in one family. The book spans years and the reader is taken on a journey with them through life. This one for me was one of the few epics that I actually enjoyed. Not once was I ever bored reading this book. I loved it!
0307593312|4.0|If you get past the first 200 pages, it's likely you'll go the distance.  You will speed through the rest, maybe doing a little skimming along the way.  When you get around the 700's you know how it will end, but wonder how Murakami will get you there. By page 800 you are fully invested, you want it resolved.<br /><br />The way the pages are numbered is unusual. The position of the numbers rotates and the right hand side is a mirror image. Perhaps it relates to the moon's phases in 1984 and the parallel 1Q84, but the text seems to be independent of it.<br /><br />Other reviews cover this book very well. It's a love story and fantasy... The characters are well drawn through the experience of everyday living... It needs to be cut.... It's full of allusions to American music and film.  The New York Times had a thorough review (although it did give a lot of the story away) last year.  There is nothing to add to what has been well said here and elsewhere.<br /><br />One thing that I haven't seen anywhere, is any note of the parallel of 1Q84 to the Millennium Trilogy.  The books come from different parts of the world. It is not just that they are both long and translate well to English; it's that in both, the abuse of women drives the story. Neither is a conventional crime novel. In both, a strong, single, unusual woman, knowledgeable in martial arts tracks down serial abusers of women. Both operate outside the law.  Neither seems to be concerned about \\"bringing them to justice\\". Neither has qualms about killing an abuser.  Have there any been parallel high profile novels written in English or other languages?  Is this a new, or have there been previous (high profile) works with these plot characteristics?<br /><br />Other than some short stories, this is my first Murakami. I presume I'll read another.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use it on kindle fire and it is always accurate and instantly on! A fabulous tool! Thanx to everyone involved in creating one of my constant apps!
B003274QH6|5.0|\\"Breaking Bad\\" is primarily a crime story, told from the perspective of a criminal, however it in no way glorifies the crime or the criminal.  Yet this show skillfully  tackles so many other topics - the less you know about it, the more impactful I think  the subplots  would be.<br /><br />The first episode lead me to believe that this was going to be a comedy, and while most of the episodes do have some pretty funny moments, this is at its heart a finely crafted drama.<br /><br />There's a reason Bryan Cranston keeps winning Emmys for his portrayal of Walt White, but the rest of the cast is superb, especially Aaron Paul. These two make the most compelling odd couple you are ever likely to see on television.<br /><br />If you read the the one star reviews here, you will see that most of them aren't knocking the show, but the number of episodes in the first season (only 7). The price on the first season has come down to being reasonable, and I will definitely watch these episodes again, they're that good.<br /><br />My only hope is that this series doesn't fizzle out on poor writing, but ends while it's still at the top of its game.
0385534639|1.0|This book is, in all honesty, just a bunch of words formed together to make sentences that fail to form an actual story. I waited a long time to get this from my library, but only ended up getting a third of the way through, because even a third of the way through this very long book, NOTHING had happened. I was excited for the competition and the romance, but unfortunately neither of them really happen to the extent that they are hyped up in the descriptions. This book has too much time switching, too many characters that serve no purpose, not enough actual plot, and just not enough anything to keep my interest. My advice is to not even start this book. The writing is horrible and too wordy. I could skim entire chapters and not miss anything because it was all pointless descriptions.
B00479SVBU|5.0|This is my first FM transmitter, so I can't compare it to others, but  can tell you that this Soundly does everything it's advertised to do and does it well. I left it on the default frequency, and get virtually no interference. Operation is easy and remote works well too. Overall build quality is solid, doesn't feel like a cheap product. Bottom line - highly recommended.
B006H3MIV8|2.0|Not my type of Dylan interpreting. There's a few gems in amongst the rubble. The thing is - there's so much good music to listen to now that the crap gets shoveled aside very quickly by me. These types of projects need some real thought at attempting something special - whose idea was it to get this lineup to \\"try\\" and \\"have a go\\" at Bobs stuff. It's either this compilation sounds souless or I am becoming to discerning with the choices? The Dont Think Twice is interesting and the other best song is sung by a guy at the end of the set list called Bob Dylan.

B00062RCBW|5.0|Being a science fiction fan and owning Firefly, original Star Trek, Babylon 5 Complete + Movies and Farscape, it was inevitable I'd order The Next Generation.   I bought the package with the 7 seasons in individual boxes after reading poor reviews for the less expensive 'Green (Borg?) Cube'.  The package is a little fussy to get in and out of but is high-quality. I'm only up to the 3rd disc of the 1st season but so far audio and video quality are excellant.

0385344325|1.0|I have read each Reacher book and have enjoyed most. But sometimes Childs will go off on the US Army in ways that are absurd. Must be the arrogant British tainted with New York City publishing world affecting him. I was part of two US Army down-sizings and no one was just thrown out in the cold with nothing. It was not a nice time, often it was not fair but his portrayal of guys being kicked to the street is absurd. Two, the military reactions he outlines throughout this tale are beyond an rational belief. I am starting to think that Child is simply laughing at us all of the way to the Bank.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|having not played chess in years, this is an excellent way to reacquaint yourself with the game or help beginners build skill
0062082353|1.0|The book started out ok, but slowly turned into a personal diary of disconnected events and items sprinkled with random thoughts and opinions.  I have no doubt this is the kind of guy I would want on the front lines, but not someone who should be writing a book.  His ego is also quite large and shows throughout the book.  Not worth the money or the time to read (I stopped around half way through).  If you were a sniper, knew a sniper, new a SEAL, know this guy, then it would be something you would want to read.
B001992NW4|5.0|I´m a great fan of this movie since i have memory, and i know every detail of it, and i can say that with the blu ray version, i could see the diference in sound (amazing) and in the image, included i could see the thin ropes in the levitation scene. And the extras is only for fans like me, thank you very much for this version  see ya!!  Pablo
B00530FC6O|3.0|It was recommended by my book club, so I read it. Had it not been the choice of the club, I would never have picked it up. Fortunately, it's on my Kindle, so I don't have a paperback hanging around collecting dust.

B003Y5H5FQ|4.0|My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.<br /><br />OOS EFFECTS:<br />There are about 20 out of screen effects that extend about 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer and 17 more reached the 20%-30% range. In addition, a cross floats to 35%, a rock flies out to 40% and on 3 separate occasions burning embers reach a maximum of 40, 45 & 50%.<br /><br />IN SCREEN / OBSERVATIONS:<br />As you would expect with a vampire movie, there are many dark scenes. Dim lighting is not a friend to 3D so on occasion, you may find yourself straining to see the action. The depth is slightly inconsistent from scene to scene but it is said to be a variation that this film maker intended.<br /><br />If you like vampire/gore movies, this makes a good addition to your 3D collection.<br /><br />ACTIVE GLASSES USERS:<br />On my system, in addition to some slight ghosting, 9 scenes had easily noticeable crosstalk and in 2 of them, double images were very distracting. However I still found this film very enjoyable.<br />(crosstalk varies from system to system)<br /><br />  3  ½ star<br />MY 3D RATING = GOOD to VERY GOOD  (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)<br /><br />Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised.<br /><br />Click on `See all my reviews' for the lowdown on other 3Ds
B005HSL626|4.0|the adds are not as bad as people think they are but other than that it worked fine on kindle fire
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great app. I just wish it started with more games. but the games on it are fun and will keep you busy if you are bored.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Where on earth have you been if you HAVEN'T heard of the Angry Birds? I have several iDevices and a Kindle Fire and the Angry Birds collection is on them all. Great game, very addictive and very annoying when you can't get the stinkin' pigs in their hideouts. Highly enjoyable!
B0044RUSZM|1.0|Stand broke and my laptop fell and was damaged.  I've had my Griffin stand 4 years, with no problem.  Last night though after hearing a crash I came to find the plastic bar that hols the stand together at the base shattered and my laptop fell.  I'd had external speakers connected via the headphone jack, and it pulled out the insert in my laptop.  The computer seems to think there is something pulled into the now non-existent headphone jack and thus no sound out of the built in speakers either.<br /><br />If you don't want your computer to be damage I wouldn't trust this stand.
B005NQ5LSC|3.0|This is NOT made with same Director, Cast an all .. as same regional IP-MAN Director view & shot, is cheaper made, Not FINE quality and viewing like in Big & Epic, camera shots, Fight scenes & Cast  like IP-man 1 & 2 is & made.<br />Is more drama/love story mix with soft little fight scenes..Just boring slow azz flick!<br />I Bought Both IP-MAN 1 & 2 after I rented it on blu-ray, Coz is AMAZIN in every LEVEL ..But this one U can easily SKIP or just a rental worth like I did, noting more then that , mediocre, spin off ,cheaper version/drama/boring & FORGETTABLE quick soon as Ends!!!<br />C

Great book for anyone that is interested in a first hand account of the war on terror, the brotherhood of the US Navy SEALS and the impact that the US media has on the smallest decision made in the field and the destiny that it sealed for these young warriors. Great book!

1466401885|5.0|I fell in love with this book as soon as I picked it up.  Instead of wasting the first half of the book working up to the drama and emotion, Jamie McGuire wasted no time getting right to the good stuff.  There are so many twists and turns, never a dull moment when reading Beautiful Disaster. As soon as you think you have everything figured out, something happens and you're back to the drawing board. All I can truly say about this book is that I couldn't put it down, it was just too good.
0385534639|5.0|best book I have read in the past year...did not want it to end but could not put it down to make it last
B006ZS81GG|5.0|I got wind of this young lady by listening to a music review segment on NPR. Her voice just clicks with my taste in music. I started searching for her tracks on youtube and felt in love. I bought the deluxe \\"born to die\\" album through download on amazon, and started listening to the album through all kinds of medium. I listen to it on my stereo, on the computer, in my car, and on my MP3 player. I can not stop listening to this album!<br /><br />My favorite tracks are:<br /><br />1) Blue Jeans<br />2) Born to Die<br />3) Radio<br /><br />I love the way she writes the lyrics, they're so witty and funny!
B0001I55NS|5.0|It is my opinion that the Movie \\"Timeline\\" is Very Good!  First of all, I like timetravel movies, and of course, Romance.  Also, I Very much like Gerard Butler, I find him versatile and that he gets into his characters so well he really feels and seems like the person he is portraying.  The movie had some drama, suspence, a bit of mystery, and I liked the loyalty they showed each other.  And need I say, how much I liked the ending.  I am enthusiastic for happy endings!  And Yes, I did purchase this movie and it came very quickly and in top condition, it was New of course.  I am very Happy I bought this movie!    Sincerely,    LaVerne Conerly
B004SBQAN8|3.0|Better than most SF movies done these days. Good: Beautiful characters, good cinematography, good story, lots of action and not boring. Bad: Some what plugged together, a little bit of this and a little bit of that, predicatable, leader to a next movie and the characters are playing parts younger than themselves. I'm guessing that a younger person (12 -20)would enjoy it a bit more.
B004I8WD7S|4.0|Case is great (it's been \\"dropped checked\\" already). The screen protector goes on easy. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5: Smudge marks show up on the screen protector with normal use.
0743437497|5.0|The Shining is an amalgam of the best in horror scenes, seamlessly blended into a nightmare. As with many of King's novels, a young child is at the center of the story, and when this child has super strong telepathic abilities, he proves to be unique as well as vulnerable.<br /><br />A huge empty hotel, an emotionally unstable father who falls deep under the influence of the spirits that haunt the hotel, and a mother who watches her husband go insane before her eyes, with no intervening force standing between them makes for an eerie and frightening novel.<br /><br />A lot of horror relies on blood and guts, slashers, murders, and the like. The Shining is much more elegant in its presentation, and is, in my opinion, the very best of King's books, and maybe the greatest horror novel ever written.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great Bible app. One of the best out there...It allows you to read offline which is great, and you have access to many version. I just love it!!
0823095223|5.0|After reading Modeling the Figure in Clay: A Sculptor's Guide to Anatomy, which didn't answer any of my questions; I was hoping to find a really good book on sculpting. I have to admit that I judged this book by its cover the first time I came across it, thinking the font in the tittle is sort of silly and so must be the info within the book. Man was I wrong, this book has everything you need to know on the subject. It walks you through the whole process from cutting and bending wire for your armature to finishing and painting your final sculpt. If you want to learn about technique, armatures, clays, wax, casting, molds, resins and the tools related to each of these materials plus how to add articulation to your figures then this book is definitely for you.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Was hoping to play this on my Transformer Prime as I played it on an iPad. Guess PopCap can't bother to keep up with the times.
B00000G3PL|4.0|For the fans, great presentation, great collection. Mel Gibson and Dany Glover made a great performance as the best action police couple. Strongly recommended.
B004SIP7S0|5.0|This film begins with young Frida Kahlo and her adventurous spirit.It rolls into the incident that changed her life and then focuses on her career, as well as Diego's.  A rich tapestry of images and feelings, this film has passion, art and adventure!  Highly reccomended and enjoyable!
0736092269|5.0|The info on the exercises and the muscles each of these help develop is great. However this book earned a spot in my shelf for all it has taught me about anatomy. Most anatomy books, if not all; only depic a male figure of average build which is good in creating some pieces but not so helpful when you are trying to portray the pinnacle of muscular development like in a Conan, Hulk or Superman cover. This book takes away most of that guesswork  which really comes handy when you need to create such a piece and you can't seem to find a useful reference or a suitable model. I use this book in combination with Atlas of Human Anatomy for the Artist and Muscle System Pro III for iPad.
1592537251|5.0|Gabi Campanario has made two landmark contributions to the world of art in founding Urban Sketchers, one of the largest interactive communities of artists in the world, and by authoring The Art of Urban Sketching, which extends the boundaries of Urban Sketchers to include not only those who produce art, but also those who enjoy the unique and creative way sketching portrays the world around us.  The book provides a unique opportunity to travel the world geographically and at the same time explore the often overlooked mystery and beauty which these artists uncover.  It will no doubt inspire many more of us to take part in the joyful enterprise of sketching, sharing with others the things each of us sees in a unique and individual way.  The Art of Urban Sketching, along with Cathy Johnson's Artist's Journal Workshop, will be particularly useful to the traveler who keeps a travel journal.  It will soon become a classic in the world of art, particularly the art of sketching.<br /><br />The book very intentionally includes a wide diversity of styles, materials and methods in order to suggest that everyone can find a place and a way to both enjoy and create this art form. Some of the sketches require as little as a pencil, a piece of scrap paper, and a few minutes of time.  Other sketches are more exotic, complex, intricate, and time-consuming, reflecting the unique skills, experience and interests of each artist.  The book is unique in that it is not a \\"how-to\\" book on sketching, but each sketch does include such \\"how-to\\" information as time required, materials used, the unique challenges of various categories of subjects, tips from the artist, and insights into each artist's background, interests and signature style.<br /><br />There is an added benefit that this book and Urban Sketchers represent. Seeing and sharing the world with artist friends from other cultures and societies is an exercise in grassroots international diplomacy, leading to understandings and mutualappreciation which cannot help but contribute to a better, friendlier and more peaceful world!  This is a book that belongs in the library of all artists and all who appreciate art and the world it portrays.  Don't miss it.
B0015XHP4K|4.0|Rambo is one of the best action heroes. A super soldier that knows that the only way of life is doing his duty. Great product, now in high-definition. Strongly recommended

B005LAIGOQ|4.0|Daniel Radcliffe is on screen most of the time in this movie.  He is alone much of the time, too.  The haunted house in question is the quintessentially spooky house that is inaccessable parts of the day or night due to the tide washing over a swamp.  The eerie atmosphere is well kept and Daniel's really good in the film.  As one review said above, how many ways can this kind of scary movie tell the same story?  For those who expect decapitations and lots of gratuitous blood, I'm sorry, but this movie isn't that kind of movie.  Some of the thrill moments are standard, but if, like the other reviewer above, the only thing you're doing is counting the number of them, then you obviously should not be reviewing this movie. The brief glimpses of shadows moving or figures moving past a mirror get to you almost at once. NOthing is scarier than shadows that move.  Being indelicate, Daniel Radcliffe's not a tall person, and in this movie that doesn't matter at all.  Still he didn't have to have a love scene with a taller woman or have to out-yell someone who is a foot taller.  It was a wise choice, because now we can just concentrate on the good job he does.  (There are long moments when there is no dialogue, and they don't drag - not for me, anyway.)  Is it perfect? No. But it certainly is preferable to me over those slasher movies (in which I lost interest years ago.)  It isn't quite as surprising as \\"Sixth Sense\\", but the ending was not expected.  My real complaint, not addressed by any others, is that the dialogue in some places is slightly muffled.  I have some hearing problems, but this wasn't in that category.  The dialogue was simply not clear in places, notably Daniel Radcliffe's first conversations with his boss and with the man who eventually helps him (whose son has also died.)  Dan was fine, but the others were muffled, relying on the British mumble to get through.  I'm glad I went, and my reservations are minor.  There were moments when I had reall chills fromfright.
B006W0QOF2|5.0|This is an absolutely fantastic film.  I understand now why it has received so much acclaim.  It is a beautiful film.
B000067J24|4.0|A great romantic adventure where Penélope Cruz (Isabella) tries to live her dreams of cooking. Great movie. Recommended. And the best is Watch it with someone you love jeje.
0061969656|5.0|I just finished \\"Death of kings\\" today and it was classic Cornwell.  I cannot wait for the next in the series.  If you are a Cornwell fan you will not be disappointed.  if you are new to the Author, you will be hooked.
B005VT42BS|5.0|Slick, polished, professional interface makes this app a joy to use. Only quibble is that some items are spaced rather close together vertically, but even with my fat &quot;stupid human fingers*&quot; I had little trouble making selections. Can't wait to try it out on my Nook Color tablet!  *Futurama ref for extra cred.
B0063GORYU|5.0|so much fun. I spend most of my waking hours playing the game. Its a good thing to keep the mind busy.
B002WCLG3O|4.0|Halo is one of the best video-games in history. This LEGENDS are a great complemente to this super shoter game. Watch it in High-def and enjoy new adventures. Recommended.
0609610570|4.0|This book is aimed largely at high level (CEO/VP) management in big business and as such it loses some appropriateness for middle and lower level managers and smaller businesses. Despite this, the fame work given is clear, concise and applicable to most execution processes. The book concentrates on key areas of people, operations and strategy and particularly the importance of continually linking these together.<br />Simple themes such as those below are presented concisely and clearly and give a good insight into priorities that can greatly improve the chances of successful strategy implementation<br />Top level managements continual assessment of whether we have the operational capability and appropriate personnel is vital to successfully executing any strategy. Direct involvement in the Who as well as What, When and How of strategy improve chances of success dramatically.<br />Holding people accountable for their contribution to the greater goal and giving them the understanding of their purpose and the tools to succeed are key tasks in execution.<br />Communicate clearly, openly and honestly, if we do not all know the reality how can we succeed?<br />Overall a good framework of ideas.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|thi game was way longer and much harder than grisly manor.I played this game with my friends we beat it in two hours. I wish it had a better ending.

B002M9WW30|4.0|Great presentation in high-def. Rocky's collection transports you to the life of the great Champion Rocky Balboa where you can see the begining and end of the career of the Italian Stallion. Strongly Recommended.
0060523808|5.0|Gerstner polarises opinion with this book as much as he did throughout his IBM leadership.<br />There is no doubt that Gerstner made tough decisions that were hugely unpopular amongst long term IBMers, particularly around the dismantling of the IBM 'welfare' system and large scale redundancies. These changes undoubtedly changed the company's direction dramatically.<br />The book gives a good insight into how Gerstner saw IBM(tm)s strategic positioning and what, in his view, it could and could not do to change successfully. Sufficient focus is given to why he saw things the way he did to give context to the decisions he made. In doing this, the book is a good portrayal of how the strategy changes were developed and executed.<br />Whilst being specific to the challenges of the IT industry during his tenure the book gives good coverage of cultural and organisational changes that are of relevance and interest to managers in any industry.<br />Gerstner is often portrayed as arrogant, probably with good reason, yet this book has enough anecdotes and examples of decisions not panning out the way he planned to show a different side as well.<br />It is an easy read yet gives enough industry, strategy and execution depth and detail to be thought provoking and informative.<br />I would recommend this book as an excellent, educational read, whether you ultimately agree with Gerstner's approach or not.
B006P0FD4W|1.0|The only real purpose of this movie is to set us up for a Paranormal Activity 4. I didn't get this one at all. It doesn't pick up from where PA2 left off. So that's still up in the air. Unlike PA2 which was also a prequel, but then continued on where PA left off, this one doesn't do that. It has it's own ending, completely unrelated to PA2. So now PA2 and PA3's endings are both unanswered. So hopefully PA4 will tie everything up and they will stop making them, which they should've done after the first one.  My favorite one of the three is Paranormal Activity, the first one. I think it's appeal is the way it was shot. It made it seem like it could be happening in anyone's house. After seeing it, I couldn't stop talking about it for a week. PA2 and PA3, not so much. One more thing I will say re: PA3 is about the panning camera effect. That was clever and added a different twist to the cameras. So if you're a fan of this series, see all three. But for Me, Paranormal Activity is the best one hands down. Plus, the alternate ending and the original ending, which isn't the Theater ending, are both cool & creepy.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is a really good game overall, but some of the games r glitched and they need to be fixed. they should also lower their reqs for the games
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|I went to see this movie in theaters thinking that it would be almost as good as the first(I wasn't expecting a great movie), but I went and watched it. I had to force myself to sit through the entire movie. There were some PARENTS walking out of the theatre after their children told them that they wanted to leave. It was THAT bad! Please people do yourself a favor and DO NOT buy this movie.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game its complicated but fun and addicting. Its so awesome. I would never delete this game&lt;3. lol.#1. luv. :)..............................
B003UESJFG|5.0|This movie was brilliant. First glance at the commercials looked like nothing, but don't let that fool you! It's a sweet, funny, story with a MORAL at the end, and NO potty humor... It's wonderful!:) Not to mention the rockin' soundtrack...  Megamind was a genius alien who was misunderstood as a child, and bullied, and felt that because people TREATED him as bad, he must BE bad. But, he comes to realize, with the help of love, that you don't HAVE to be as everyone sees you--- YOU create your own destiny. The bad guy CAN be the good guy, earn redemption and forgiveness... And love.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|best app ever I'm halfway through the old testaments and I get a better understanding of the Bible with this app highly recommended!!
B002CVQAX6|5.0|Ghost Ship is a really good, old-fashioned ghost story. Full of atmosphere and foreboding, this little gem has an unusual take on hauntings. The twist in the plot happens about halfway through, and I admit I didn't see it coming.<br /><br />Perhaps these days, everyone thinks \\"Friday the 13th\\" slasher films when they think horror. Today's films are \\"in your face\\" with gore.<br /><br />But Ghost Ship is more subtle in its frights, and its attraction is the effective use of atmosphere...and...it actually has a plot. The acting is good, especially the little girl on the ship, who is very convincing and rather sad, creating empathy for her.<br /><br />Even though there is a small bit of blood in the beginning of the film, most of this movie concentrates on very effective, creepy ghosts. When the ghost captain sits at a table drinking with the mortal captain of the tug boat, it produced a really chilling effect.<br /><br />If you are seeking a gore fest, move on. But if you miss the old-fashioned haunted house tales (except this takes place on a ship), then give Ghost Ship a try. I was very pleasantly surprised at how good this movie is. But then again, I enjoy the old-fashioned ghost stories that don't have gore simply for gore's sake.<br /><br />Jeani Rector, Editor<br />The Horror Zine
B0060V1WJ6|1.0|This movie was disgusting and lewd. I would not recommend this to anyone, ever. Made jokes about horrible things. just plain ew.
B004I744AS|5.0|fun and educational. Enjoy the games as much as the dictionary. hearing the words spoken is so helpful. quote of the is fun.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I bought this october 2010.  Everything is still working and I semi abuse this. (I bought this because I snapped the brackets off of my Creative HS-1200 USB Connector Circumaural Digital Wireless Gaming Headset). I lie in bed with this with my head pressing against the material. I walk around my place in this thing. I can make it probably 25 feet through walls and still get a signal.  I read another review and do not know what buzzing they are talking about. Although I've never tried the mic without a person to talk to. (no recording my voice for anything needed.)  I've always had another person on skype or in game when I talk on the mic. However I've had sound come out of speakers and had the headset sitting over my ears, no buzzing sound. I do have a Creative Labs SB0880 PCI Express Sound Blaster X-Fi Titanium Sound Card installed and am running windows 7 64bit.  Only con! I do have a wireless home theatre system in my living room which can cut out my signal.
B00664AM5C|1.0|Stephen King's The Stand this ain't.<br /><br />I read the premise for this film, and saw that it had an all-star cast, incuding Gwyneth Paltrow and Matt Damon. Had to be good, right?<br /><br />Wrong. I don't know how this film managed to be a cliched, boring drag when the subject matter is a 1918 Spanish-flu-like virus spreading around the world. But it seems to be lacking in anything stimulating or exciting. The characters were wooden and shallow, making it difficult to care about any of them.<br /><br />And the plot dragged on and on, showing scene after scene of people panicking. There was the usual conspiracy theories produced by a cliched internet blogger, the government of the United States was ineffectual and bumbling, and the government of other countries either didn't care or had no clue as to what they should do, so they did nothing.<br /><br />Avoid this turkey and if you want a thrilling virus movie, find Stephen King's The Stand, which is absolutely true to his book.<br /><br />Jeani Rector, Editor<br />The Horror Zine
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it. a very fun game, you can open new levels and everything. its very cool. easy for kids and adults too.
B006VA57CY|5.0|Wonderful version of the book.  Part one has been very good Can't wait for Part Two. Like period pieces, such a gentler time.
B004TPJMLA|5.0|See the title of my review to learn that it all turned out \\"great\\" -- and that, for that, I offered heartfelt \\"thanks.\\" So ... Thanks!
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This case is exactly what i needed.  Its not bulky and gets in and out your pockets easily. It fits very tight. It also includes a screen protector. From what it seems that if u were to drop your phone from around waist level it should be fine. This case also compliments the white iphones and shows the cool chrome apple logo on the back. The camera cut out is very big which prevents the flash from making messing up the shots. The button and port cut outs are also very generous and easily accessible. All this for this price is a definite buy!
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|I love animation movies! But this one was just really bad... Don't recommend at all, for any age. There are much better movies out there.
B005ZUR724|5.0|Gameloft has taken care of the issue and due the inconveniences they have given us all 25 Runes and repeated the Double XP weekend! Gameloft DOES care about their customers! the game looks crisper than ever in the Kindle Fire with the new update. Thanks Gameloft!<br /><br />///<br /><br />Gameloft made an update which should have been how they released the game from day one. They took care of the pixelated and unpolished interface, and overall enhanced it for the kindle fire which was a sign of mediocrity and rush to have a functional version on the Kindle Fire. But what's the point of it if the game renders unplayable ? since the update, I can't connect with my character, it just shuts down and sends me to the home screen. Not changing my score until they fix this. Gameloft really needs to take their time before they make an update, and I really hope I don't miss the double XP weekend because of this or I will not give the score 5 stars for a second time.<br /><br />////<br />(review below before Feb 16th update)<br /><br />Amazing so far. This game and WoW are like two waterdrops<br /><br />Amazing game, I've only played for a little though so I will add more details as I play more. I'm not giving it 5 stars so far because I think they could have enhanced the optinization for Kindle Fire, PLUS I got it for .99 cents. Some of the UI elements feel that they overlap such as the ability icons and the chat window (which is annoying and there's no way to turn off completely) Other than that, the sound, music, and graphics are pretty top notch. I'll keep this post updated.
B002BU0DPE|2.0|The first time I bought it, it lasted a good 3 months. Second pair only lasted 2 months. There is no doubt that this is a good quality headset, just that it breaks TOO EASILY! Treat this with extreme care or else it won't even last for a month. Oh and the cushion falls off sometimes and is a pain in the butt to reattach.
B000002B30|1.0|I ordered this CD through Amazon and received it promptly as with all of my orders. The CD cover was as advertised. Even the title printed on the CD was \\"Bruce Springsteen: Greatest Hits\\", as advertised. However, the actual music on the disc was \\"Toni Braxton: Greatest Hits\\". I thought this was just a one in a million fluke and that Columbia must have just had a little burning accident. I returned the disc, and reordered through a different seller. Unfortunately, once again I received Toni Braxton's Greatest Hits. What are the chances?!? I would avoid this CD unless you are willing to make multiple trips to the UPS Store to return the product... Update (2/21/12) Third time was the charm. However, I must agree with previous reviews that the sound quality is severely lacking. In hindsight, I should have just purchased the higher quality songs I wanted on iTunes or Amazon Digital...
1439153663|1.0|This book is mind-numbingly bad. I can't imagine who would enjoy a novel that's simultaneously so creepy and historically inaccurate. One or the other would have been forgivable. One tiny example: the African American expression for death is misused. If you're going to affect a dialect not your own, you'd better get every detail right. This author doesn't and the results are cringe-worthy. I never review books on amazon but I had to weigh in to let other horrified readers know: you are not alone.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|This cover is great!  The texture is so soft and the cover is sturdy. The Kindle is held securely in place and feels well supported.  I initially had some reservations after reading some reviews that claimed the cover did not close properly and was ill-fitting. I will admit that the cover was a little stiff at first (obviously because it was new), but became supple very quickly. The best thing about it is the classic look. I love the fact that it resembles a book; it looks so natural and makes me feel connected to the \\"old-style\\"of classic literature.  I would definately recommend this product!
B006PZBR8S|5.0|It starts with some dull acting, and predictable plot line. However, the robots make the movie, and the boxing is guilt-free excitement. Hugh and the young boy are wonderful and engaging.
B000002KHB|5.0|Without any doubt, if you really know what heavy classic rock is, you will agree this album is the best Deep Purple album and superb amongst the best classic rock albums. Each band sounded their own way, thus comparisons to other excellent bands are non sense. I love this album as much as I love Led Zeppelin II. Therefore, when you read a bad review about this album immediately you can say it's just done by somebody who hates good classic rock and of course they have the right to express that. For example if you love Fleetwood Mac, you are not going to like Deep Purple, and don't get me wrong I'm not saying that bands like Fleetwood Mac are bad, because those guys were truly good, but it's a different kind of music, so please do not mix oil and water because they are totally different. Well, I'm writing down this because I read some bad reviews about this album, and let me clarify, those reviews are absolutely invalid. MACHINE HEAD remains one of the greatest classic rock albums of all time, this album is so known and loved that I shouldn't be writing down anything at all, but I did because of the saboteurs.

B00322PK2G|1.0|I still have watches that I purchased at flea markets 20 years ago -- and the bands are still in tact and the watches are running perfectly. I only have the Swatch Just White Watch less than 2 months and the plastic buckle broke. I paid $50 for this watch and expected it to live up to the Swatch brand.  I can't agree more with the people who said that they can't sleep in the same room with the loud ticking of this watch. Further, the face is already showing scratches. I don't think I am going to put more money into this watch by purchasing another band for $10 to $25 ((that's what a new one would cost and they still come with a plastic buckle). No wonder when I called the Swatch store, they were all out of bands. Is it any wonder?  I will never buy another Swatch watch. Cutting my losses.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|This movie is so horrible. its main goal is just to cash in on the first movie. infact, go watch the first movie! right now! its better than the sequel. i cant erase how horrible it was from my mind and now i wish that i could just kill myself and it would all be over. oh and sony, YOUUUUU SUUUUUUUCK!!!! YOU AND THE MPAA!!!

0307891372|5.0|I was a little lenient about buying this book when it said it was out of stock but amazon shipped it to me the next day and i got it 2 days later!  When i first saw the book my reactions were: holy ____ . I don't even know where to begin to tell you how in depth this book gets with the game.  My only problem with this book is that it covers every little detail that probably the creators didn't even catch, its very disorganized.  When you want to look something up you have to go all the way back in the tiny font index and find it and when you do find it they  give you more than one location where that certain thing is found, for example if i wanted to look up \\"Whiterun\\" this is what it would look like:  Whiterun pages: 27, 35, 257, 453  This can be extremely annoying especially when you play the game and use the handbook at the same time (like i do), but the organization didn't stop  me from buying it because this is the cheapest price i have found even at like game-stop (ect.)  This amazing in depth handbook still got 5 stars and i definitely got my moneys worth.

B006W0QOF2|1.0|Most of this movie is people sitting in silence starring at each other.  The amount of dialogue wouldn't be enough to fill one page, and is drowned out by the worst synthesized 80's-sounding music I've ever heard. The terrible music, brutal killings, and 1 SINGLE CAR CHASE are the only things that kept me awake through this garbage. To top it off, the whole thing leaves you feeling depressed and sad. Yuck!  Just, yuck!!  I want my money back!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|not bad for the cost, a bit activating having to play a limited number of games only to earn points to basically guess whet gets unlocked.
B0064NTZQ2|2.0|This looked like a cool action flick.  It looked like a movie that would keep me on the edge of my seat.  It looked like something I might want to buy after renting from Netflix.  It wasn't, it didn't and it ain't.  This is the dullest, most boring movie I have seen in a long time.  With all the stars in the film you would think that there should be something going for it.  There isn't.  It starts out really good for the first fifteen/twenty minutes.  Then it slide downhill into pure boredom and you are just waiting for the movie to end because there is one question you want answered that you know will get answered at the end of the film.  The problem is that this movie so boring that you forget the question you had at the beginning because you just want the movie to end.  It's incredibly slow paced, plodding to its lame conclusion.  This is the most boring, dullest film I have seen in a long time.  Stay away from this movie.  I am not sure but I think that it is based on an old Steve McQueen film.  If I am right, I can guarantee you that the original is light years better than this.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|This album is wonderful. I love it. I've probably listened to it 40+ times and counting. This is the first Coldplay album I've bought, but since then, I've got a few more. Mylo Xyloto still remains my favorite. My favorite songs are Charlie Brown, Hurts Like Heaven and Paradise.

Its one of those books that you can't bear to put down, and when you're finished reading it, you're still thinking about the characters and their story! The Fifty Shades Trilogy had me hooked from the very beginning; From the steamy romance, to the suspensful drama, to the heartache, this trilogy is a must read for anyone.

B000NVL9FQ|4.0|1. Atlantic 7567-81519-2 Unsure where this CD has been manufactured - possibly Japan for USA.<br />191202 4/91 2DA1X in the dead wax<br />2. Victory 383-480016-2 Manufactured by JVC in the USA.<br />3834800162 2C1I MFD BY JVC in the dead wax<br />3. Shout Factory<br /><br />The original Atlantic CD is quite bright compared with the Victory - Carl's high hat playing sounds almost overmodulated as do the cymbals especially during \\"The Barbarian\\". Sibilants are far more under control in the Victory mastering than the Atlantic especially on \\"Take A Pebble\\", so the Victory in this case, sounds the best. The treble is just too hot on the Atlantic and this overrides any other virtues that the Atlantic may have (such as very clear vocals). This is the first time I haven't liked an Atlantic more than a remaster. Barry Diament and Stephen Innocenzi are both listed as mastering the CD in its booklet - most believe that Barry did not do this one, as the sound of the CD is unlike Barry's typical mastering style.<br />The Shout Factory sounds excellent, but not a lot different from the Victory, which remains the gold standard. The beginning of \\"The Barbarian\\" on all releases, both vinyl and CD, has something that sounds like microsecond interruptions in the cymbal sound - much like crinkled tape at the very beginning of a reel. I have noticed this type of fault in 3 albums recorded around that time at Island Studios (the other two are Led Zeppelin's fourth \\"Runes\\" and Jethro Tull's Aqualung). Possibly the tape recorders at Island Studios were not gentle with tapes.<br />The Victory booklet is nicer than the later Rhino version as the script on the back of the booklet is in pink on the Victory (which is more consistent with the original front cover) and in white on the Rhino. The S/F cover (AGAIN - take note Shout Factory) is poorly reproduced (slightly blurry), but the extra pictures and notes in the booklet are good.

B000SQKZKG|2.0|Victory USA 383484001-2. Discs made by JVC USA.<br />Victor Japan VICP 64227-8. K2HD Discs made by JVC Japan.<br />Shout Factory 82666310539-1. Discs made by Sony USA.<br />Many years ago, I had a copy of the triple vinyl trifold album on UK Kinney/ WEA/Manticore. The Manticore UK labels in general were either a higher resolution print of a brown manticore on a lighter cream background or the lower resolution darker brown Manticore imprint on a darker, yellowish background. This album had the latter label design, with each internal E, L and P letter of the cover housing an album inside a thin dark blue inner sleeve. Although past albums' recording had their faults, this one was the first time the recording quality of an ELP album had dipped below clear into murkier bootleg quality.  However, the performances contained therein were absolutely first rate and showed that ELP (and in particular Keith) really could do a lot of the blinding speed and multi-tracked keyboards of their less simple, later albums actually live and in front of you. I was of the opinion that there had been no overdubs on this album (splicing of different performances - yes) - the sound was so cavernous and dull, that it would have been nearly impossible to actually replicate this in a studio, without the overdub standing out in an extremely obvious, higher quality fashion. There was great trumpeting of the recording quality in an old Circus magazine I had from 1974 previewing the album, citing quadraphonic sound, concert ambience, concert sound mixer acoustic perspective.... yada yada yada. In reality, it sounded like a stereo Trade Mark Of Quality recording - good quality for a bootleg, with a similar \\"I'm holding a microphone up in the front row of the audience\\" ambience.<br />Let's take the Japanese K2HD copy first, as this one has been modelled after the vinyl album set. The cover is the same in miniature - a trifold with the rear concert picture in over-exposed and red tinted detail. The H.R Giger screen projection on the stage screen is clearly visible. The original very dark blue thin paper inner sleeves haven't been reproduced, but as they were only one colour and had no information on them, this is excusable. The album has been put onto 2CDs without any attempt to join up the original vinyl side breaks into a flowing performance. So, the album fades out and in just as the vinyl sides did. This leads me to the suspicion that vinyl eq. tapes had been used for the creation of this version.<br />The Japanese engineers for ELP albums seem to eschew the usage of NoNoise (which IMHO is a positive on their behalf), but insist on digitally compressing these albums (which is a glaring flaw). Apparently this has become worse as the series has been reissued over the years. Original K2 sets are less affected than the later K2HD and SHM sets. At the opening of the album, the hiss fading up and the retained concert ambience makes you think, \\"All right - they got the sound of the vinyl very nicely here\\". However, at any volume above quiet, the recording becomes quite harsh as any mid to loud transients are just squashed flat. It is very sad that an opportunity at vinyl replication like this has been squandered at the sonic starting line.<br />The Victory USA copy sounds completely different from the Victor Japan K2HD. The tapes (were they the same vinyl eq. tapes or the original flat masters - who knows?) were heavily NoNoised by Scott Hull at Masterdisk, New York and the side breaks were digitally joined by forum member Zal Schreiber at Atlantic Studios, to create a superbly flowing concert.  The concert ambience is nearly gone, however, due to the heavy NoNoise usage and the band sounds like it is mostly playing in a vacuum compared with the Japanese Victor. The original Japanese Atlantic CD issue of this album is exactly the same as the later Victory and Rhino. Cheers for the digital compilation, but great pity about the heavy NoNoise usage. There has been noobvious digital compression that I can hear, and transients are quite prominent without any hardness whatsoever. The booklet has the back cover of the album in a much darker, but less lurid and more natural colour spectrum, printing, but the H.R. Giger projection on the stage screen is now all but invisible. Nothing, really, apart from that, has been lost in this issue in the reduction to a booklet.<br />Finally, we have the Shout Factory CD set, remastered by Andy Pearce. This version has the usual Shout Factory reduction in printing quality, but adds a short essay regarding the album that isn't particularly informative. The CD set appears to be based on the same old Scott Hull NoNoised reworking of the original stereo master tapes, except with even more NoNoise on top of the original, rather marked, noise reduction. There has been some elevation in the bass, as well as attenuation in the treble - this gives a slightly more prominent bass guitar and a bit more kick to Carl's bass drums (both of which were needed), but rolls off the cymbals even more severely (which is way too much). Then there are the odd noise reduction artefacts - in particular a strange inconsistency of volume levels when things get quieter, almost like there are only quantum levels of volume available and the recording is jumping between levels constantly. This is not at all audible in the Scott Hull/Zal Schreiber versions.<br />So, we have the option of buying vinyl for the original experience (both auditory and for the original album graphics), or accepting compromises in the sound that shouldn't have been inflicted upon us for the CD issues.ion that I can hear, and transients are quite prominent without any hardness whatsoever.

B00687XO1G|1.0|First I ask simply, what is the purpose of making this film? What is the lesson? Do characters grow from their experiences? Is there a moral message behind the film? These are not rhetorical questions - I would like to know your opinion.  In the Lincoln Lawyer, for example, we are shown a defense attorney who comes to the realization that his client is a murderer of willful intent. He is given ample reason to want to make the right decision, including the threats made by his client, and the apparent murder of his colleague. He is given a chance to make things right, both with his past client (who was wrongly-accused) and by putting his current client in prison for murder. And he takes that chance through a series of clever actions.  In Anatomy of a Murder, the defense attorney knows immediately that the defendant is guilty of murder with willful intent. Knowing fully that the defendant is guilty, and *before* even accepting the defendant as his client, the defense attorney gives the defendant a variety of resources and defenses to win his case. Why? And when told that he might not even get paid for his work, he still decides to take on the case. In his own words, \\"I think I'll just stay with you, to make damned sure you get off.\\" Why? What is in it for him?  People often make the argument that, \\"he is just doing his job\\", but it was not his job to take on the case, or to help the defendant *before* accepting him as a client, or to do the job even on risk of not being paid, just to \\"make damned sure\\" the murderer is set free.  Why was Jimmy Stewart chosen for this film? He is shown acting deplorably, with no recognition whatsoever that his choices are wrong. What was the purpose of using his lovable character? To persuade through emotional appeal that his actions are good? To show the audience how easily they can be won over by emotion alone?  Some additional points:  * No chance for him to vindicate his past actions is provided by the plot. The conflict between hischaracter and his actions is never resolved, and appears to have been purposely left unresolved, or even unacknowledged, as if to assume that there are no negative emotional consequences to bad actions - i.e., asserting a mind-body dichotomy.  * No examination is given for why he went from being a prosecutor to defense attorney, and how that has impacted him. Any such examination would have presented a contradiction between the lovable character and his choices - a conflict which would have demanded resolution through character development or final vindication.  * We are never clear on why exactly he proceeded with the case. He accepts the case just to \\"make damned sure\\" the murderer was set free, and he makes occasional reference to the legal fees, as if he is only in it for the money. Is this to demonstrate that he is greedy or selfish? If so, then how is it in his self-interest to set loose an extremely jealous, violent murderer, whose wife has made multiple passes at him. At the end of the film he is shown happily choosing to meet up with the murderer and his wife, knowing that the husband had witnessed his wife make passes at him. How is that a wise choice, if he is just being greedy and selfish?  * At the end, the lawyer is presented with clear evidence that the murderer never believed he was acting based on \\"irresistible impulse\\", by using the term jokingly. How does the lawyer react? By laughing it off.  * Even the title makes no sense, as nobody in the film is interested in examining the murder itself. The reason there is apparent ambiguity is simply because nobody in the film is interested in the truth except as it relates to helping or hurting their case. What actually happened doesn't matter to them - all that matters is that people believe what they claim happened.  I see praise for the film's representation of trial law. Now, if the film had only depicted a trial (a la 12 Angry Men), maybe I could agree. But we are given a preface and afterword, and myanalysis has focused primarily on those, as they are the only means by which to judge the lawyer's decisions during the trial.  As I said, before even accepting to represent Manion, Biegler gave him vital legal advice and coaching, while knowing and explicitly stating that Manion was a deliberate murderer and there was no justification for his action. And after the trial is over, Biegler made clear his disinterest in the consequences of his actions, laughing at the bogus insanity plea.  Any law professor, judge, or lawyer who praises this film must necessarily damn himself.  I'll ask my original questions again: what is the purpose of making this film? What is the lesson? Do characters grow from their experiences? Is there a moral message behind the film?

B004I8WD7S|4.0|This is a great little case and screen protector combo.  Putting on the screen protector was actually easier than I expected, and I had no problems getting it lined up right or smoothing it out to prevent bubbles.  Getting the case on took a bit more maneuvering, as it is a very tight fit, but I got it on without peeling the screen protector up at all.  I have only two complaints.  The first is that the opening for the headphone jack is rather small, so that I actually cannot use the stereo cable that I have hooked up to my car stereo's line in.  I'm not sure that there is much to be done about this, other than buy another cable with a smaller connector -- there's just not a lot of real estate for Amazon to work with around the jack, so the opening is bound to be a little small.  Second, the thin piece along the front at the bottom of the case is kind of flimsy and can slide around a little.  Again, I'm not sure what could be done about this, given that it's guaranteed to be the weakest part of the case, but it could probably be a little tougher.  Overall, it's a great case.  I'm not planning on swapping this one out with a weekend case or anything like that, so I can't comment on how easy it is to get the case off, and I'm not going to drop-test it, but otherwise it is everything I need in a case and better than I expected it to be.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like the game because me and my sister bond when we play it together. However, a not so good thing is that I had to put a password on my kindle so that my brother would not get on it and play this game. :D!
B0061QD82E|5.0|When I was a kid, I loved Lady and the Tramp! It was one of my favorite movies and I would watch it over and over again.  It is a love story that has stuck with me and probably has a lot to do with my love for dogs.  When I found out that they were releasing Lady and the Tramp Diamond Edition, I couldn't wait to share one of my favorite movies with my favorite little man.<br /><br />My nephew loves it when I come over.  Most of the time when I show up to see him, I have something special to give him.  Yesterday, I went over to see him and my sister and I brought the Lady and the Tramp Diamond Edition with me.  As of this afternoon he had already watched it twice.  I love watching him enjoy a good, wholesome movie.  The graphics were better than I imagined and the special features really help bring this film alive.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received a free copy of this movie for review purposes. All opinions expressed are 100% my own.

B001TODO54|5.0|Wow, I absolutely loved this book! The author creates vivid pictures of her world and the characters within it.  In her world there are people called Gracelings, who have extraordinary skills, and can be identified by 2 different colored eyes. If the skills they possess are of use, the ruler of the kingdom in which they live exploits them. This is where we meet Katsa, a Graceling with one blue and one green eye, who has the grace of killing. She is used by her uncle, King Randa of the Middluns, to ensure his subjects' bid to his will. Katsa is feared, and knows she is nothing but a killer. Ms Cashore's characters are not without flaw and Katsa's journey is a remarkable one.  This book will definitely be in the keeper pile as I know I will want to reread this many times. I'm heading to the bookstore today to pick up the prequel Fire that was just released. If you love the fantasy genre you need to read this book!

0385341008|4.0|This was a great story about the German occupation of the channel isle of Guernsey told through a series of letters. I was a little weary of a book told through a series of letters as you only receive bits and pieces of everything. I still feel like it was a bit choppy and would have liked more detail in the every day lives of the correspondants. Once you get into this book you really become captivated with the little isle and lives and stories of the people there. I think this will make a fantastic film.
0307887960|5.0|Great book!  It is like a bible for dieting and changing from a fat person to a thin, fit person.
0061726826|5.0|Love love love these types of genres. Delirium really presents interesting concepts about love as a disease and society as a whole succumbed to the thought that life without love is better then to love at all. Enter Lena, a girl who knows she sees and thinks a little differently, but wants to proceed with the social norm of having a procedure to end the possibility of love and feeling. I think deep down Lena knows she wants love because of how fondly she always remembers her mom and their small happy moments. Enter Alex, who open Lena's eyes to a real life. I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy. I was in tears at the end of this book. The story idea and concepts reminded me of a combination of The Giver by Lois Lori and The Uglies books by Scott Westerfield. All in all I this the story was well laid out, timed, and beautifully written with very vivid sentences to emit feelings and images.

B004LROMSO|2.0|The acting is fabulous, the visuals spectacular, and the story has been hijacked!  This is NOT Camelot.  It's Camelot - subverted/perverted.  There is nothing legendary, presented.  There are no moral victories.  All the \\"magic\\" has been distorted, the \\"tale\\" misrepresented.  Everything pertaining to belief is tossed out and made to be \\"everyday,\\" normal war, bickering, and terror.  All the focal points...Lady of the Lake, Sword of the Stone, and even Merlin are re-written to be, basically, lies.  IF you are expecting the series to resemble the legend, don't bother.  It's a complete let down to the fantasy kingdom of yesteryear.
0062082353|4.0|This one has gotten a lot of press, so it doesn't need me to promote it.  Further, from Richard Marcinko's [[ASIN:0671795937 Rogue Warrior]] to the Discovery Channel's BUD/s series (which Kyle describes as heavily edited - we can't handle the truth) this elite branch of the USN has certainly been well-introduced to us all.  However, since SEAL Team Six put a bullet in Bin Laden's face, we asked for more. So it is that in this insatiable \\"tell-us-everything-or-we'll-Google-you\\" age, Chris Kyle's autobiography, [[ASIN:0062082353 American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History]], delivers fist first.  This won't go down in history as a literary masterpiece or the definitive guide to the Navy SEALS.  Kyle even slaps Wikipedia once for maybe being too detailed about them, and so instead guides us through a sort of bloody and often horrific overview of his life behind the scope. Co-written with Scott McEwen and Jim DeFelice, the book also lets Kyle's wife deliver the homefront counter-punch throughout on what it was like for her to be married to, in her own words, \\"a bad-ass\\" that wouldn't stop deploying.  Their marital problems are dealt with like everything else Kyle and his wife do - directly, and without apology.  It's  a great touch, and done very, very well.  150+ Iraqi insurgents/enemies no longer walk the earth thanks to Kyle's trigger finger, one of which was sent to his maker from a distance of 1.2 miles - with one shot.  Now offically recognized as the most lethal sniper in U.S. military history, Kyle will disappoint you if you are expecting a swaggering braggert who can't stop talking about himself.  Rather, his humility comes across as honest as his accounts of the war, and he does it with courage, diginity, and humor.  For all his compelling stories of death and danger, you'll also never see dolphins in quite the same way after reading his hilarious complaint of being their practice dummy.  You won't like this book if you're on the Code Pink mailing list or you believe that all the problems of the world can be solved via beer summits.  Kyle disabuses you right away of the notion that evil doesn't exist in the world, makes no apology for his role in eradicating it, and along the way manages to show you maybe a little more than you asked for.  Like as not, you won't think of the Iraq War - and more importantly, the men we asked to fight it - in the same way ever again.  Nor should we.

0525478817|5.0|Doubt is the clay out of which faith is made...we do not inherit it. The illusions of childhood and the societal teachings must be examined on the journey of life or \\"the life unexamined is not worth living\\". I see John examining his journey in this book and being honest with his dis-illusionment of earlier idealism. As a retired pediatrician and psychiatrist, I appreciate John's character development. Helping people experience \\"outcasts\\" (cancer patients frequently are) as human beings and \\"normal\\" human beings appreciating them is a difficult feat....John did that!
B005ZUR724|4.0|This game works great for the Kindle Fire contrary to the other reviews saying it doesn't work. I've been playing for over a week now and I have experienced no problems. The only drawback is that the game requires in game gold and runes to expand you inventory and start a guild, get a summoned creature, etc...  While it is only $2.99 for 6 months of subscription, these constant plays for a few bucks here and there are annoying and can add up quickly. If you aren't careful you could spend as much as you would on a PC or console MMORPG. Everything costs gold, and so far in my game, quests only pay in silver and copper. Theoretically you could farm money and earn gold maybe at higher levels, but at lower levels that could take forever just to unlock a few more backpack slots for instance.  The depth of gameplay is not par with PC/Console games of the genre. This is to be expected from a Tablet/Phone game. But overall it is better than I expected it to be.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really fun when you are bored! lots of neverending games for all ages! never a dull moment with this game

B0073LWEXK|5.0|There should be more games like this. Fire Maple Games are really fun and I've never played anything like it. The Lost City I think is the best game they've made. The same search and use your inventory game, but a different, better plot.
B004EPZ0AM|1.0|Honestly, the title is enough. Please, do yourself a favor, don't buy this. I have entertained myself more looking at the wall.
B0070Z97LG|4.0|Like others, I was unfortunate enough to see the previews.  However, even when I believed I knew what the movie was about, I thoroughly enjoyed the chilling suspense and beautiful cinematography.  It was an engaging, haunting thriller that is a combination of THE SHINING, THE OTHERS and THE SIXTH SENSE.  I don't do reviews, but felt that the more people who get the message out that this movie IS worthwhile, the better.
B0064UPU4G|5.0|I took a chance on this album and I wasn't disappointed. I had only ever heard Daft Punk once before, when I went to see Tron: Legacy. I listened to one or two of the tracks and decided that ten dollars was a good price.  And boy, was that a good decision. \\"Harder Better Faster Stronger\\" and \\"Something About Us\\" quickly became my two favorites. The only song I didn't really fall in love with was \\"Short Circuit.\\" That's okay; it appears that plenty of people share my feelings about that particular track.  All in all, I would say that you definitely have to buy this, whether you're a first time listener or you've loved them ever since 1997. It's quickly become the most played album on my iPod. If you can, buy the CD; I appreciated having the lyrics book with the poster on the back.

1416562605|3.0|Is corruption a path to succes? Aravind Adinga chose to tell us a story from a provocativa Point of view. From the very begining we know that Balram Halwai, the main  character is a killer but he calls himself an entrepeneur that chooses to tell his story to the prime mynister od China. With a very intelligent style he males us see the nowadays India in comparison to China, but at the sabe time he compares the India in the cities opposed to the India in the little towns. He makes us discover the differences between the servants and masters,  he makes us understand the point of view held by people that work for others. Hypocrecy on booth sides of the line mixed with excellent writing, good humour and a keen way to see life.  In the middle: corruption. Corruption as the worst sickness of the world, same in India as in almost everything country of the globe. The White Tiger makes us laugh, get angry, mad, but most of all makes us reflect.
B003H9M1QM|5.0|It is hard to believe that this movie was made 70 years ago, yet I still find it enjoyable to watch. I got this for my daughter, who has taken an interst in elephants. The first time she watched it, she was glued to it, very intent in watching it. I like the fact that it came with both Blu ray and DVD. I can have the high quality of the Blu ray, and the DVD to play in my daughter's room. It comes with some really cool features as well.
B000002AGN|1.0|YAWWWWWWWWN! I think I'll go watch paint dry instead. Or water boil. Either one is preferable than going stark raving mad listening to this dreck.

B002BWP49C|3.0|(Spoiler Alert!)  I've read a lot of the reviews here, and I had to have my say, as it seems most reviewers are either die-hard fans or Twilight-loathers.  I'm somewhere in between.  I have read all the Twilight books, and have seen all the movies.  I am a fan, and for a while, I was an avid fan.  Not so much anymore. Possibly because I got over the hype (and my own immaturity), and also because ever since Eclipse I have found the movies increasingly disappointing.  Twilight is like the junk food of literature, and the same can probably be said of the movies.  The story is captivating, even if it gets a little silly.  The first book was probably the best, and there is a certain charm to the first movie - it was moody and atmospheric, and really captured the spirit of the book.  I was a bigger fan of New Moon.  In my opinion it's the best movie of the four films that have been made so far.  Chris Weitz inspired the best performances, and really delved into that sense of melancholy and heartbreak.  Eclipse, to my mind, focused far too much on the tediously boring and badly acted newborns.  And then Breaking Dawn came along, and made Eclipse look like an Oscar nominee.  It was so disappointing I was annoyed.  Breaking Dawn is definitely the weakest movie so far.  It is also perhaps the hardest of all the books to adapt to film, what with the telepathic wolves and vampire babies.  But it was more than that.  It lacked the indie touch that I liked in Twilight.  It felt like it'd been edited too heavily, and in some places, not enough.  The simpering, over-sentimentalized soundtrack made it sound like a soap opera, and I was surprised by how little emphasis was placed on the wedding, and how quickly it was concluded.  Edward and Bella didn't even get to dance together properly, which was definitely a scene that could have been milked for all it was worth.  The wedding was meant to be romantic, not funny.  There was also a certain awkwardness about the honeymoon, and I don't mean in the bedroom.  Some of the scenes were stilted, the acting stiff.  Worst of all were the wolves.  I laughed out loud when Jacob met up with his buddies for a pow wow.  I don't know how else they could have done it, but it was too silly to be taken seriously.  And these are just some of my complaints.  There are too many to note, or we'd be here all day.  The director finally showed some sense and produced a gripping birthing scene, with enough artiness and drama that it actually woke me up and got me interested.  I even thought he handled the whole Jacob/Renesme imprinting thing pretty well.  (Sorry if you haven't read the book or seen the movie yet.)  But on the whole, the movie was unconvincing, and slightly embarrassing. Not even Robert Pattinson's gorgeousness did it for me this time, which is saying something.  Oh, and that's something else that surprised me - somehow they managed to make a lot of rather beautiful people look as pale and unattractive as Bella did once she got pregnant.  What were they thinking?  Even though I've bought all the other movies on DVD, I'm not sure I can be bothered with this one.  I just hope they learn from the failures of Part 1 and improve Part 2.  I've given the movie-makers a lot of leeway with these films because I'm a fan, but as a movie lover, I'm hoping for a lot better.
B000W9EOEC|1.0|I love electronic music... my favorite groups are Skrillex, LMFAO, Black Eyed Peas, Bananarama, and anything on MTV or any Dubstep made in the USA... lol :) but these Daft Punk jokers really know nothing about Electronic music. First of all... what's up with the stupid robot suits they wear? That makes no sense! If you are gonna wear anything it should be SLIPKNOT masks :P. Next, none of their songs make any sense its like just a bunch of noise... they have no song structure! Songs like \\"Veridious Quo\\", \\"Around the World\\", and \\"something about us\\" are horrible! And their music videos are just as dumb... This Alive 2007 performance was really boring.. I think I feel asleep!  These guys need to take a few pointers from Skrillex... and get his COOL haircut. Then try to get aired on MTV if they want any commercial success :] Oh and be sure to check out other cool groups like Jonas Brothers, Nickelback, and Slipknot!
B005T87QCI|1.0|do not buy this its robbery. Do not waste your time or money. I'm in the process of filing fraudulent. charge with my bank. If you don't want to go through this do not buy it.
B0069GRIHW|1.0|Another generic classic rock band that deserves no attention from music fans.. I mean, really, what did Jim Morrison and the Doors do for rock n roll music? NOTHING!  Nickelback has taken rock to new heights with songs like \\"How you Remind me\\" and \\"Photograph\\"... none of the Doors songs even come close to the greatness that Nickelback has achieved.  For good music AVOID the Doors and stick with good stuff like Nickelback, Jonas Brothers, Linkin Park, Black Eyed Peas, Blink 182, Green Day, Shaggy, Slipknot, Papa Roach, My Chemical Romance, Evanescence, Simple Plan, Limp Bizkit, Good Charlotte, Avril Lavinge, 50 Cent, Ja Rule, Vengaboys, Nelly, Puff Daddy, Usher, Crazy Town, Kid Rock, Creed, Soulfly, Korn, Justin Timberlake, HoobaStank, Incubus, Default, Staind, P.O.D., Three Days, Grace, Sisqo, R Kelly, 3 Doors Down, and Alient Ant Farm. Just... anything on the radio or MTV  ;) All those bands are 1000 better than the Doors :)

B0053KWDES|5.0|This thing is a little beast! This is my first headphone amp and i must say great job FiiO. The E11 is great for portability. Its compact, the volume knob is nice with the EQ and High/Low buttons on the side. The E11 bring s the most out of my XB1000, XB700, Crossfade LP, ZX700, and even my PiiQ Marqii. If you want the most out of your headphones while using your ipod or walkman the you need to get the FiiO E11.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|So my husband flies thought the first version in record time . I send him the updated much harder version over in Afghanistan for his 29th birthday. Does he spend time focused on figuring this challenging game out? No he sets it down in front of himself and watches in pure amusement as other guys try very hard to complete the maze. Lol this toy rocks and so does my hubby's sense of humour !
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|I went to see this movie in the theater and it sucked. I rather have my head boiled in acid.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|would be a five star if you can change the size of the tool you're using, kinda too fat to do any detail work. also, some kind of memory of the last too/color used.would be cool.
B0064NTZJO|2.0|Wow. This movie was very slow to start. When things did start to happen it was brutally violent and bloody. I wish I had just rented it instead of buying the blu ray. I cant think of a reason I would want to watch this again.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|These games are fun and the whole family enjoys playing all the games. We get very competive. And some are very educational.

0062082353|1.0|Do not read.  Poor story and poorly written.  Chris fails to draw the reader in.  Chris bravado is overshadowed by the poor story line.
0515142247|2.0|This is my second book in this series. I started with the first and planned on reading them all but I am considering calling it quits. The main character is likieable but would a man like Jack Reacher really travel around with no possessions but the clothes on his back? He also didn't take a shower during the entire book.  First of all the plot is rather unlikely and there are too many coincidences. Another issue I have is the over use of the term \\"shrugged\\". All of his characters shrug. The term is normally used when someone asks you a question that you don't have an answer for but in Lee Child's novels a character will shrug, than answer the question. People in his books shrug their coat on. They shrug every 5 minutes.  He also needs to work on the way American people talk. Lee Child is British and in England, people may add the word \\"right?\\" after a statement to form a question. All the American people I know don't say that right? This author uses it too much, right? He also says that \\"the car was parked up\\". Who in America says that they parked \\"up\\"? Or who says they \\"slew\\" the car?  The most annoying part of his writing style is the shot choppy sentences. Would it kill him to add a subject and a predicate to his one and two word sentences? Got tired of it. Read some more. Frustrated. Read more. Still frustrated. Turned page. Fell asleep. Woke up. Read more. Still frustrated. Not Hemingway. Parked up......
B003EY7IRC|5.0|It's been a long time since I was satisfied with the final (suppposed final) book of a series.  Shadowfever delivers, answers many questions, and is just an amazing read!  I've read all of KMM's books and was just blown away with the culmination of many subplots and characters which all blended seamlessly within this one book.  I won't give away any spoilers, but I feel that KMM gave a sweet tip of her hat to those of her fans who have faithfully read all of her material.  You can't breeze through Shadowfever, in fact, there were many times during my first reading in which I would re-read various passages just to make certain that I wasn't shocked by the outcome of an event. I was so disappointed to finish the book, that I secretly hoped to find an epilogue after reading the author's acknowledgements.  This was a great series!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is sooooooooo much and so addicting! I can not stop playing it!! however some times I get aggravated because I cant beat the game but over all my favorite game ever!
B004HD61KE|5.0|I have read all of James Rollins books, and this is the best yet.  If you like history, mystery and intrigue, this is the book for you.  I couldn't wait to turn the page!  Rollins weaves a mystery that questions our countries beginning, it is wonderful!  Don't think if you should read this....just do it!
B005OCFHHK|4.0|I bought this Bluray set as a gift for the holidays. At first it was very disappointing as the person I gave it to reported that the discs didnt play correctly and often skipped past sections of the films making them unwatchable. I did some research and I urge everyone who has had playback issues to look into this, check your model of bluray player and check to make sure you have UPDATED THE FIRMWARE! Issues were on a Samsung BDP-1600 which was running 1.01 firmware, upgrading to the latest 2.19 firmware fixed the playback issues - there is nothing wrong with the discs in this set.

B005EGXTEE|4.0|Having purchased this book based only on other readers' reviews, I must say what an intriguing read.  To be honest, it took me a couple of chapters to get into the storyline, but once there, found it difficult to put down.  A thoroughly enjoyable read.
B005LZYL3G|3.0|A friend mentioned that I had to get this DVD. My wife is a big Pearl Jam fan and the friend has been to five concerts, so I thought it was a good idea.  I ordered the Blu-Ray in advance and thanks to Amazon for giving me a refund to the lowest price before it was released, that rocks.  Unfortunately the content just does not.  I get the Seattle scene thing, but it is amazing how little they speak of or show Nirvana and Soundgarden.  Being a 26 year-old from Spokane, Washington, it was interesting to hear about Mother Love Bone and go back and look at all the connections going on that I missed because I was too young at the time, but I had to really read after the DVD to figure out why Pearl Jam formed as it did.  The bonus content is absolutely weak.  I expected much more out of this material.  Really, all it was good for was a laugh to find a grammy in a basement, and as justification to download music for free because musicians' cribs show they don't even know what to do with the money.  Finally, the real problem is I don't feel like I know Eddie Vedder better at all.  Maybe he's just another mythic rockstar, but one learns nothing more about him im my opinion, other than he drinks wine all the time...weak.  If you're a big Pearl Jam fan, enjoy, but if not don't expect to become one based on this footage.  Seems like it could have been so much better.  Oh, also maybe its because its really based on a book (same title) I learned after the fact.  I recommend the book before this.
1423101499|5.0|The story was fun and addicting as usual.  I first got the 1-3 box set just to try out. I ordered book 4&5 immediately after I was done with book 3.  Thanks to Amazon Prime who made me got the books so fast.
B007G5K066|4.0|This 2011 Working Title Films production of Le Carre's 1974 novel 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' has attracted positive critical reviews, been generally liked by audiences, received some well-deserved award nominations and reportedly made a healthy box-office profit on its modest US$21 million production cost, so is an unexpected commercial success for the French investor StudioCanal.<br /><br />Director Tomas Alfredson has delivered a serious film for an intelligent audience, but due to the time-constraints of a single 120-minute feature film, the result necessarily compresses the story so much that you need to pay close attention. A complex plot full of intrigue, double-bluff and the slow revelation of characters' hidden motives through real-time action and flashbacks means if you know Le Carre's novel then you'll be better placed to enjoy the film on first time viewing; if you're unfamiliar with the source material, then seeing the film a second time might make for a more satisfying viewing experience as the number of characters and complexity of the plot can be a bit confusing on first pass.<br /><br />All the cast deliver fine performances with Gary Oldman in superb form as the world-weary but calculating and highly intelligent George Smiley, who has been called out of forced retirement to carry out a discrete investigation to uncover a suspected Soviet mole operating at the highest level of `the circus', the inner core of the UK overseas intelligence service MI6. Oldman has become a fine mature actor and proves here that `less is more', dominating some of his scenes by sheer presence, often with sparse or even no dialogue.<br /><br />The 1970s period detail is pretty accurate with clothes, hairstyles, cars, interiors and the drab accoutrements of office life - paper files, tele-printers, manual typewriters, telephones, dreary furniture - setting the tone. There's not much color here, and the film's look is bleak and washed-out to reinforce the subject matter and the mood. The scenes set in Budapest and Istanbul look even bleaker and greyer than London.<br /><br />The film is true in spirit to Le Carre's 1974 novel, so not natural Hollywood fodder. There is no `hero' (Smiley is a kind of anti-hero); all the characters are in some way flawed and none very sympathetic; there is little cinematic action, no gun battles, explosions or car chases. There is precious little humor, but it's not that kind of film. The few scenes of violence are brief and understated, casual and shocking but never dwelled on. The audience is invited to pay attention, to watch the characters closely, to listen to the dialogue and think. The duplicitous and closed world of the secretive cold war spying game is very well realised, and has little in common with the glamorous, fast-paced eye-candy of James Bond films.<br /><br />If you like your entertainment served on a plastic plate with fries and fizzy cola to wash it down, best steer clear of `Tinker Tailor'. This is a film for grown-ups, and a more sophisticated palette will better savour its qualities.<br /><br />See if you can spot John Le Carre himself in a brief cameo role…the mood.

1423101502|5.0|It finally comes to the last book in the series.  It was very hard for me to put the book down.  Had to stop myself.  Otherwise, I would have read it all the long until I finished the last page.
B001MYIXAC|3.0|I have read articles and reviews by individuals who said \\"Let the Right One In\\" was better than \\"Let Me In\\". Lest you be confused, \\"Let the Right One In\\" is subtitled, while \\"Let Me In\\" is in English. I prefer the latter. They are both based on a book by John Ajvide Lindqvist. Both follow the book fairly closely. The difference, to me, is purely a personal one. I like Richard Jenkins (Six Feet Under), and he only appears in \\"Let Me In\\". I also found the portrayal of Oskar in \\"Let Me In\\" to be much more sympathetic and believable than in \\"Let the Right One In\\".  Having said all that, you can't go wrong with either movie. If you prefer--or don't mind--reading sub-titles, then you may prefer this version. It is somewhat more faithful to Lindqvist's book in that it shows how Eli came to be what she is.
B004AYCWY4|2.0|Richard Dawkins may be the official poster boy of Evolution, but unfortunately, I cannot recommend this book. It sounds like a crazy, rambling college lecture.

0385344228|5.0|A child is murdered on his way to school. ADA Andy Barber decides to keep the case, seeing no conflict based on the fact his son, Jake, is another 8th grader at the same school. Until Jake is charged with murder.  How well does anyone know their child? When students are finally interviewed concerning the murder, Andy discovers maybe he doesn't know his son as well as he'd thought. After being removed from the case, Andy sets out to prove his son innocent. Having spent years in the DA's office, he knows all too well the 'tricks of the trade', that guilty/innocent doesn't matter as much as the conviction rate. Does he have to prove this to his wife Laurie too?  Defending Jacob will keep you reading, turning page after page as evidence is gathered. You'll feel the ostracism from the community. And you'll probably be able to understand too many points-of-view to not start thinking.  Wondering.
