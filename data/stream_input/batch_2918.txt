B0046B3QTG|5.0|But loved it as much if not more than him. It's a delightful and colorful movie filled with action and charm and hilarity. I loved it and always suggest it on movie night. Really fun.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|I love eureka, it may not be the best science fiction around but the humor is fun, and that is the reason to watch eureka.<br />It is just plain fun!
B005723JSQ|5.0|I read it in 2 days. Could not put it down. What fun. Rare to find a romantic comedy with meaning.
B00E5Q1LTY|2.0|Honestly I am confused.<br />They got off to a good start, though some folks didn't like the new actors.<br />I did, but I have to say - couldn't they have come up with something better?<br />Love the Actors , the ship, but the writing leaves a lot to be desired. It is Not original, nor is it really entertaining.<br />Some of us are past kindergarten, - I do hope the producer knows that, and I feel bad for the actors who are doing an exceptional job in a mediocre production.
B003MXB4FC|5.0|Napoleon Dynamite is the Citizen Kane of nerd coming of age flicks. \\"Yesssss.\\" is the new Rosebud. In 20 years, it will be recognized as the greatest Idaho film ever made.
B009LDD54K|5.0|Nukky does a great job playing the part.  Atlantic City is the place to be. Fascination with learning how the government is ran, even today.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|The first one may have been a little better, but I loved this one too. It had acton right from the opening scene. They then brought in one of the best characters from the original series, alternate timeline, while the new actor wasn't as good it still peaks the interest of us older trekkies. It is hard to reproduce the classic Spock character,but Zachary Quinto is a very good actor. He made the show Heroes and I think he really makes the new Star Trek work as well. He can be a little more human than the origina, but he has really made that character his own.
B000068QKT|5.0|Definitely worth seeing and buying.  It's a classic! Thanks for offering the original version...some of the new versions aren't in French..
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As usual John Grisham has written a suspenseful book with enough twists and turns to keep you wondering. Well written!
B00A0SICYI|5.0|The movie is fun to watch and very entertaining.  This is a great family movie.  The kids love all the songs and keep singing them.
0802130208|1.0|This book won a Pulitzer Prize?  It is supposed to be hilarious  and I didn't find any of it funny.
B00000G6TL|5.0|Album has some good songs; would recommend.  Great price for so many songs.  Between this and the Platinum Collection; it's all you need if you are just looking for the big songs.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|One of my favorite games next to temple run and subway surfers if you like those games you will love this game it's full of cute minnion so cute I recommend this game to any one who likes subway surfers and temple run and adorable and no I didn't get paid to say that
B004ZN9W5M|5.0|awesome, sounds good on a bose radio.  been good for 30 years.  for all generations.  1 day a collectors item.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I love how Gaiman gathers up ancient and basic myths and weaves them into modern tales.  This book is full of prototypical myth figures and themes that wind their way into a terrifying and wonderful adventure of a young boy.  The imagery is, as always, beautiful.  If you reach the end without knowing what exactly happened, it's meant to be that way.  The last chapter explains things, if you pay attention.  And there is something bittersweet to the whole thing.  Alas, it loses one star (for me) for being a tad too similar to Coraline, but it's enjoyable nonetheless.
B00009L1UP|5.0|awesome  awesome, sounds good on a bose radio.  been good for 20 years.  for all generations.  1 day a collectors item.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I'm not a huge fan of this type of book, but since it was the next book for book club and I had plenty of time to read it, I bought it for my Kindle and started it.  And then didn't stop.  The great thing about this book is that you will doubt and wonder to the very last page--and beyond.  I will not summarize this book, as many have already, but this book had a twist that I didn't anticipate, which is a very rare event (and why I don't usually go for this genre--too often predictable).  One particular thing that I loved about this book, because you don't see it terribly often, is that names mean something.  Perhaps the author didn't intend to do it, but I think he did.
B0070YDOT8|4.0|It's mindless just have to push the spin button!!  Sometimes it's good to unwind and relax your mind with a little fun!
B000JIN3J8|5.0|I do not rank this as my favorite version, but it is enjoyable to watch.  The acting is fine and I have been entertained many times watching it to pass a few hours.  I find all my Pride and Prejudice versions to be my &#34;feel good&#34; moment.  I turn this on and immerse myself in a world long ago with problems so far from what we experience now.  I recommend this version to anyone just wanting to have a few hours of total enjoyment.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Although I never read the original comic series, I can say without a doubt that this is a lot better than the one with Sly. It doesnt take itself too seriously, has some beautiful shots, great performance by urban, and is just down right fun!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|great for adults and my preteen kids.  very edge of your seat, and the quality of the video was very good.
B00AC8ZJ6K|2.0|The style and methodology didnt draw me like the original HALO 3 advertising campaign did, as much as this film attempts to copy it.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susa Boyle is quite the talent and is so good at using her voice to communicate to other people, young and old.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|The first time I used this I got like 1.5 gigs free!!! Your tablet collects crap that takes up so much space. This app just cleans it out. Love it.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|There appears to be some confusion due to some of the marketing of this product.  While it works very well for YouTube, Netflix, and some chrome based videos, it will not stream anything else. This is a huge disappointment.  Some marketing implied that you could stream anything on your tablet, or android phone.  Quality of the video is good if this is all you want - but it's just plain stupid to offer a product like this with such limited functionality.
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|I will tell you a story about this game<br /><br />The actual game is not to tough. Each level by itself is<br />hard but overall not to bad. Like most games the difficulty<br />increases as you go but it never is<br />so hard you get stuck<br /><br />Getting to the last level is easy but it's a game you'll want to play<br />again. The spider webs are sometimes really complicated and<br />massively confusing but if you think about it you will do<br />exceptionally well.<br /><br />Instead of giving up this game encourages you to press forward with<br />strengths in mind and weakness forgotten.<br /><br />Timing is everything in this game. You must do everything just right<br />or you might have to start again.<br />oh, and don't forget to follow instructions carefully.<br /><br />Happiness and a bordom free life should come guaranteed with this<br />amazing game.  You always feel so smart after completing the<br />really confusing levels. That's when you realize you love this game.<br />don't forget this review it will help you decide if you want to buy.<br /><br />P.S. you read this wrong
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|I had no idea that electronic music had such lower quality for music.  It is a fun trip through music history at this one location.
B004GBIE3Y|4.0|Funny twist on a somewhat sad part of life.  This was entertaining for me and my brother who is 12 years younger.
B009WW1HUY|1.0|What the heck! I love this album so much I bought the actual CD. Imagine my horror that it sounded like a poor quality AM radio. I thought it was a defect, so I purchased the high-quality MP3's - still distorted. I thought maybe my equipment was faulty? However, ALL my other music sounded perfect. I am soooo confused. Please, anyone - if you come across a clear copy of this album, please post it!<br /><br />thanks.
B00CATSONE|4.0|This book should be mandatory reading for every engineering student.  The man literally owned Westinghouse yet died broke.  One of the greatest scientist/engineers who just got screwed in life by &#34;big&#34; men.  We will never know the truth about this man as he was hobbled in life and his records censored by our own government.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful series with a great cast. Can't stop marathon watching. Only wish season 4 was out. I'm hooked on it
B0027MJU00|5.0|Like all Flynn's books, this keeps you in suspense with the  &#34;who done it?&#34; I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good thriller
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I Ioved the husband`s secret.  Ending was stunning yet satisfying. Best book I've read in months.  I highly recommend it.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|Great story<br />You really get to know the characters and see how lives are entwined across oceans, cultures and socioeconomic classes
B00DW39B2K|4.0|What can be said about Two of Hollywood's greatest actors Robert De Niro and John Travolta provided excellent performance in this movie.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I liked the twists and turns in this book without the excessive violence of many other books. It causes one to think on their life.
1451650728|3.0|MOSTLY SPOILER-FREE REVIEW<br /><br />I say 'mostly' because I can't talk about the book without giving away at least a smidge of info.  That guy on the cover with Geordi is not Data. It's not Lore.  And it's not B-4.  It's Noonien Soong.  And if you thought he died in Season 3 of TNG you are mistaken.<br /><br />This book is Part 1 of 3 of a story that centrally addresses Data, the lingering plot thread from Nemesis that has not been addressed in over 4 years in book time and 11 years in real time. Up until the final chapter of this book I was leaning heavily on giving it 4 stars.  The book wastes absolutely no time getting right into the action by Page 5 and soon we are on a rather grand adventure that rolls back to that TNG episode where Noonien \\"died\\" and the plays forward over the next 17 in-story years.  We experience the Doc's great adventure during the entirety of what has happened going through all of DS9, Nemesis, the Borg invasion, Typhon Pact - all of it.  And along the way every important person in Data's life is brought in which, considering Soong was on a quest for most of that time, it actually makes sense for such an oddball pack of characters to surface.<br /><br />What we end up with is a fairly moving story of a father and his artificial offspring and what happens when one man's dream is turned into a genocidal nightmare.  That dramatic turn was very gripping for sure.  There's also some great character moments from the Star Trek crew tho since 80% of the book centers on Soong they don't get a lot of page time.<br /><br />Now here's why this book did not get 4 stars - first, Noonien's main motivation is based on his fatherly notions yet we are never given any real insight as to WHY he chose artificial offspring instead of clones or, hell, good old-fashion adoption.  While the story doesn't mention anything, I seem to recall there was a biological reason why he never had kids tho I admit I could be wrong - wouldn't have to be if the story addressed that point, just stating a fact.  That is a main motivating factor for the book and it is quite a major let down not having it.  I learned more about how he felt about his ships AI than I did about why he felt such a need to replicate himself and live on.  Some may think that is motivation enough.  I do not.  It's a shallow tagline at best, a trite conceit at worst.<br /><br />Then there is that last chapter. The book just ends. No denouement. No resolution.  Just - this chess piece here, this chess piece there, aaand - END SCENE.  Don't think you know what happens because you don't, I have to give props for an extremely inventive plot twist that I did not see coming, but then everything just ends. I do not care that there is a second and third book that will probably deal with that because I'm not reading those books, I'm reading this one and this one should give a full story not a partial one.  Finally there is a very unfortunate, but very hackneyed, incident near the end that just had me saying, \\"Again? Really?\\".  Madonna made it cool but it is apropos here - it's reductive.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong.  I'm very much looking forward to the next book which I will start reading in about 10 minutes.  There is an amazingly interesting set up that I want to see unfold but that unfortunately is all this book is - set-up for what is to come later. It's a pot roast TV dinner.  It may look good in the package but once you actually eat it, you find it filling but not exactly satisfying.
B005HSL626|5.0|I really like this game.  I have watched it played at a fun zone, but had never played it.  It is more fun than watching it.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Everything you would want out of a good book! Cline is brilliant in his writing. I couldn't put it down and I'm thirsty for more!
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|Movie was very pretty good; I saw part of the original with Sylvester Stallone and could stomach watching the whole thing. This modern version was good!
B0094D462M|5.0|I enjoyed all the action and interaction of the personalities. The acting by all the different characters was fantastic! Will be excited to watch it again!!
0812550706|3.0|My son wanted to read this book before the movie comes out.  It was a great price, but the print is small.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Downloaded to pass time, and am now hooked. Needless to say, I am passjng more time then I need to be!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I thought the handling of the war was very good.  It showed the agony of the people without getting horribly graphic.
1401207529|5.0|Has material used in the Batman Begins movie by Chris Nolan. Great graphic novel, I aprove and recomend to anyone.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I almost never review anything, but I loved this game so much and I'm sad that I have to wait for the sequel.  The epilogue was a satisfying extra that kept it all from ending far too soon, though I would have loved even more puzzles. Take the advice of other reviewers and try not to use hints, because then it's over even faster.<br /><br />The graphics were fantastic, the touch controls were so responsive, the music/background noise was neat, and so on and so forth. It was beautiful to watch and play. Every time I opened another hidden thing I'd say \\"OOOH!\\" and my husband would laugh at me, but I didn't care because it was exciting to beat another puzzle.  Great job on this.  I want more just like it.
B009NPLIFE|4.0|The show was better than I expected. Me and my wife enjoyed it very much! Way 2 go Chuck and finally get what you wanted
B00E193TM2|4.0|Pretty goood! This is classic FFDP! Definitely will buy volume 2 when it comes out. I wish I got the version with the second disc of live music... I recommend spending the few extra dollars to buy it.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app gave me more than I knew I needed....you can change and design it in various ways. I can not imagine it not meeting anyone's needs. It bright enough to read from across the room. The weather is visible if you want it. I really enjoy using this app. I have now deleted my weather app since getting this one
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|not only are you solving a little puzzle but you have the option of doing it as fast as possible....very fun
0375869026|5.0|This was a selection in my book club, loved it. Bought it so both my son & daughter could read it.  My son didn't love it because there was not enough &#34;action&#34; my daughter couldn't put it down.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is expensive like pet shop story!!!!! This is an awesome game, you get to go in a competition, or help friends out, or... do care tasks, and money tasks :) :) :) :) :) !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B006MW3V6U|4.0|I am glad to see some good things happening for the characters you like, and bad for those you don't.
B001N4RORE|5.0|One of my favorite musicals in movie form! YAY! I think this is one of my favorite movies now. My daughters and I will watch it and sing along. If you have not seen this yet and you dig Abba and musicals - you will probably like it!
B00EMJD6TC|5.0|Great movie to watch late at night, for all you zombie lovers out there, my family and I enjoyed a great zombie movie
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This was a cute game - kind of like Temple run but obviously some different goals. My little ones have fun with it and the graphics were really cool - almost like the movie.
0525478817|4.0|Once again john green has managed to make me shed a tear at the end. At the beginning i was a little annoyed by the dialogue of one of the characters (i'm trying to to give away too many details). No one at that age really talks like that, it just made him sound a little arrogant. I will admit that once i got over that the rest of the book was enjoyable. I had higher expectations from this book but for a teen book its deserves four stars.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|This is a cute game but it was hard for me and it got a little frustrating which led to boredom. My daughter (16) loves it though. So, maybe it's just for the younger crowd...
B003VANOFY|5.0|This was the top rated headset when I bought it last month I believe (from the time this is being posted). I was torn between a Razer and this one because of aesthetic purposes, I did some research and found that Razer headsets had too many negative reviews for my taste. ( I love Razer and own two of their products) That being said, this headset sounds amazing and has a good mic as well as being comfortable. With that in mind I don't think I would have liked this headset as much if I used it for long periods of time, if you use your PC for long periods of time it will makes your ear area sweat. If ear sweat is something you don't enjoy I recommend looking for ones that use that foam/sponge material.
B009GED3HS|5.0|this is the best show. completely hilarious with heart. it is the new friends if you want a comparison. get it!
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|My 3 year old &#34;LOVES&#34; to play with this app. It keeps her busy with the &#34;stickers&#34; and &#34;stamps&#34;.  It has paint and crayon options too.  The best part is - no mess or art supplies to buy.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Not only was the storyline phenomenal, but the actors were amazing! This was an overall wonderful movie that has you laughing, crying, and on the edge of your seat, always wanting more. I highly recommend this movie to everybody!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Very entertaining, makes you think. One of my favorite games if not the best. Would recommend to anyone who likes using their brain not just pushing a button
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I read this in a couple days.  Every spare moment I had I spent reading this book. I fought reading this series because of the popularity and because it's a young adult series, but I was pleasantly surprised that the themes were still mature enough for adult readers.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Game is great but customer service sucks. Do not, I repeat Do NOT! Spend your money with them! They will take your money and then not give you your credits and the only way of communication is through emails which they reply with a generic response and then Never get back to you. I play the game because it is fun and very addictive but keep it at that. You would think they would want to make money and keep customers
B009UX2YAC|5.0|my son got this game for my sun and he almost suited his peninsula you no goodness sake ahhhhhhh I'm not high Jacob ahhhhhhh goodness sake you know
B005K17RU0|5.0|Best weather app I have found.  Provides great information,  and I love the maps.  I can keep tabs on six different cities easily.  Very easy to use.
B00AFEX83C|5.0|I love this movie.. I may be an adult but watching it with the kids.. its a blast its funny to watch. It has it all a character for both girls and boys to like.. if you have a girl or boy at home its a cute must have movie to add to your collection.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|I loved this show. In some ways it was like my high school life. A little more emo than I usually watch.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I love Emily and Ruppert!! but I also do love period movies.. so ..This is a great movie for anyone who likes period movies .. like the Duchess,  Last of the Mohicans or A royal affair or even Interview with the vampire this is one of those must add to your collection
B00EMJD6TC|4.0|I saw this movie in the theater and it was very good - I love zombie/apocalypse flicks but, only a few are good.  This is one of my 3 favorites (28 days later and Req are the other 2).  Epic special effects and a couple of really great scenes.  It's like Die Hard + 28 Days later = WWZ.  Most everyone in the theater seemed to really enjoy the movie.  Two Thumbs UP!  Hope they make a sequel. Even if you do not like zombie flicks - you will enjoy this movie as it is more of an adventure flick.  I think many folks decided to not see this movie because they didn't want to see a zombie flick but, it is really a suspense/action movie.  Fun flick! and I normally don't but, I will actually purchase this movie.
B00005JNS0|5.0|My nephew is so into this movie ... he had me ree-du his whole room with Cars theme its been a while that Disney has made a movie that appeals to boys vs just gals.. this is a must have movie if you have a son or nephew its fun and funny.. I recommend
B00BRUYNBE|5.0|Walk off the Earth is what music is about! Singing Talent + Unique Choreography style + Entertainment Value; always looking forward to their next album to add to our collection!
B000K4WPCM|5.0|For anyone that who likes the craft and the crow this is a great movie to watch and add to your collection.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Different in an awesome way! Space, action, and personal story lines all rolled into one. Well developed characters that I want to read more about.
1452110581|5.0|This is a great book, for those that have cats.  Cat owners will understand, laugh and relate to the poems in this book.  This makes a great gift for cat lovers.
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|Burn out 3 meets need for speed in a free game. I just started playing and I'm hooked. Try it out if you like racing with jumps.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Great movie. Now I see why it won so many awards. Fascinating to see people dealing with bi-polar disease. Lots of laughs and some tears also. Recommend highly.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Loved it. The Cast Worked well together and the script was excellent!  One of the best this year in my opinion.
B00ANAC32U|5.0|I had bought one previously from an online seller and although it looks the same as this one, did not fit the same. This item fit my phone perfectly, so much that some people think that it is part of the phone.<br /><br />Great product!
B009CG29RK|5.0|sometimes juvenile with fart jokes and butt humor, but very cute, re-watchable, and the kids love it!  very benign villain with cute father-daughter moments and silly little minions.  gotta love those minions!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Great graphics, challenging levels. You have to be able to see consequence of anticipated moves.<br />Will keep you on your toes as you play. I have well surpassed 1,000,000 mark from replaying multiple times and it hasn't gotten stale! Good fun addictive game. Will be happy to recommend.
B003EV6DBW|5.0|i love it good series and fast shipping i like it because its gets better and better  I watch it every day
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I can not stop watching The Good Wife. I recently became an Amazon Prime customer and, with that little gold mine, came access to ALL the OLD seasons of The Good Wife and many other shows and movies that I had never found time for. In the HOT summer of Houston, I found the steamy Good Wife an excellent respite.  Season TWO continues the trend of interesting law cases mixed with character development that really is intoxicating.  They make drinking straight tequila look absolutely awesome! Must see TV! The fact that I have access on any of my technology, anytime, completes the package of watching for me. Also, my ipad knows where I left off on my TV, etc etc etc......AMAZING!
B0018RFLN0|5.0|It was the first in the series, a great movie, and should be part of any home theater movie collection.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|YOU must read my review of season one so you will know that season two is equally intoxicating! If you loved, the first year, the second reveals more details about the characters and continues interesting story lines of a legal nature. Every character has a few flaws, some many more than others, but the flaws make me watch with even more intensity. Who wants to watch perfect???
B000067FP8|5.0|ive loved both flicks since i was a lad so i had to pick up the 2nd since i already owned the first.. great old school horror classic..
B004VMUS9G|5.0|delivers as promised.  can set multiple repeat alarms with a variety of tones.  I use it daily not just as an alarm but as a reminded.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Get so many power ups and so many minions go to  different  places<br />very cool game 5stars maybe the best game I ever download
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a very fun brain game, and it's free! It's a good game to play when you're in a waiting room or on a trip. The only thing I don't like is that you have to review the app to continue past level 10. But this is definitely a 5-Star app!!
B00DM0XXCM|4.0|Very refreshing story line for a sci-fi. Had a few shaking spokes in the acting/storyline about 1/3 through. but picked up nicely and kept me interested.
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|It keep you thinking what you are up to I got all six of then that how Iam with the game enjoy I sure do
B009AJDET6|5.0|I just saw Chicago in concert. Went online and found this package of albums. It's a great value and I would recommend this product. I love Chicago
B005XUC398|4.0|It's likely an accurate portrayal of our &#34;titans of finance&#34;.  Makes you wonder why most of Wall St. isn't in the gray bar hotel.
B000BJS4TO|5.0|This cd is so beautiful.  It is nice to just sit with a glass of wine and relax to the entire musical works of this cd.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|This movie has a cute but predictable storyline. The characters are highly original and entertaining. It promotes good values and offers an example of adoption of older children by a single individual.
B00005N6KG|4.0|It's up to Sony's good reputation for quality products. Could readily recommend it. Price is a little high but quality overrides it.
B00EY8A6BC|1.0|Probably the worst movie ever made. The poorest $5 purchase I have made in my life. All aspects were juvenile. The special effects were nausea inducing.
B009JZSC9S|4.0|good - but not great<br />lesser plots - more filler...!?<br />better cast than usual<br />good directing<br />nice staging & wardrobe
B00ESY77LO|5.0|I have heard that many critics and movie fans alike pan this version of F. Scott Fitzgerald's famous novel, but I disagree. From the visually sumptuous opening credits to the final sad scenes, I enjoyed every minute. True, I might not have made some of the casting choices, but the actors are all effective; and it took about 20 minutes to get fully into the action, as is typical of a Baz Luhrmann movie; but the costumes and scenery and acting all combined to make a beautiful film that underscored the pathos of this famous character study. Is Gatsby the ultimate optimist, as the narrator believes, or are all the characters complete fools? The question is one decided by each viewer, and opens some stimulating conversations. My only real criticism of this version is of it being in 3D. Why? Such a distraction! Other than that, it's a feast for the eyes and the intellect.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Hard enough to be a challenge without being impossible.  Super fun and addictive.  Great graphics.  A little hard for young kids but my 4 year olds enjoy it and do fairly well.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|This game is fun however there is not very much to play unless you want to pay actual money. Also in the evenings the game runs pretty slow.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|Very nice short book. It explains why all ideas are pretty much amalgamation of other ideas and that there is no shame in stealing ideas from other people, combining them in new makes and make it your own. Just don't plagiarize!
B002QEXN2K|4.0|I remember seeing Mayer's YouTube videos about the making of this album. They were good and the samples you'd hear sounded great and excited me to hear the album.<br />Though there are many songs I like on the album, and none I dislike, I do find the album to be a bit disjointed in a way. It doesn't congeal like the other albums. It seems like the California Rock seed was planted, but wasn't in full bloom. Isolated from the perspective of a concept album I think each song is for the most part is solid. However, together they don't all match. Many do, but Assassins, one of the albums best tracks, doesn't fit into the mood many of the other songs bring. I say he needed a bit more time to let the feel he was going for flourish.<br />Mayer has said himself that it's not his best and that the culprit is that it is ultimately unfinished. That's exactly how I feel when listening to this album as a whole.<br />Some bright spots within a slew of solid songs that I'd point to are; &#34;Assassins,&#34; his &#34;Crossroads&#34; cover, &#34;Edge of Desire,&#34; and a really nice deep track gem, &#34;Do You Know Me.&#34;
B001OGWY1W|4.0|Always a good one. Heath ledger is missed. Only issue is with the downloading but that's not the movies fault. You should be able to watch longer than 24. Hrs.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Not one of his better books.  I'm kind of bored reading it, but I want to know how it ends, so I'm forcing myself to finish it.  I love reading Nelson DeMille books, but this one does not grab me.
030758836X|4.0|I liked the book. Once you get into it, it's very hard to get out. The twist are amazing and they continue to build. It does take a long time to get going. There is a lot of narrative that a bit unneeded, but for the most part- it's very well written.
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|I love all of her songs. They seem to have messages but either way she has great vocals and the tunes are unique.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|I was not a big fan of Lady Gaga's but this is very upbeat!! I love this song, enough said!! Best for exercising too!!
B0015USNCQ|5.0|Thought this product would be too flimsy and that it would bent-up after a few uses, but after almost a year of use, it has proven to be very sturdy and functional.  Also cleans easily.  Highly recommend.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Lot of action and very very entertaining.  I downloaded it in my kindle fire to see it in two parts, as it was a little bit late, but I could not stop watching it,  I had to see the whole movie. It truly deserved the academy awards it received.
B004VD3YIM|5.0|I had the FREE version and upgraded to be able to pan and tilt my cameras.  I like the zoom feature also.  I have not used all the available controls included but will investigate those soon.
B00ESY827C|3.0|There is nothing like the first.  I didn't like the remake of this one!!!!!!!<br />Just not like the one with Robert Redford, he made the first movie.
0679642609|5.0|The Gregory Hays translation is head and shoulders above the rest.<br /><br />Great lessons in virtue, duty, humility, and staying in tune with nature of things.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great family, great people downstairs, wonderful story. Matthew has to come back in the 4th season to be a father.
B005PZ85SO|5.0|Criminal Minds is the best show out there.  If I had a whole week I would watch it from beginning to end.
B0074VTHKM|4.0|Not as good as other novels by Grisham, but a good, quick read nonetheless.  Theo is a likable character as is his uncle Ike.  I would recommend to others and would read more novels with Theo as the character.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|I enjoyed the book, but be prepared, it's a tearjerker.  Overall it's well written but there are a few parts that are difficult to read.
B000U6BT40|5.0|This was an amazing series when it debut.  Funny and able to poke fun at the &#34;smart&#34; people without being disrespectful.  Fun for the whole family.  I wish that they had stayed to to the original premise all thru the life of the series.  But  a great first season, not to be missed.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I enjoy playing Diamond Dash to unwind after work. It is a fun and easy game to play. You just match 3 or more like colors to increase your score.
B000X5SPBI|4.0|I have all the seasons of Supernatural. I love the show. I love the plot. I LOVE the actors. But nearly every seasons DVD case has arrived damaged! The plastic pieces that hold the different DVDs in place (like the binding on a book, that allows you to flip through the DVDs for the right episode) are always broken. So the DVD cases go everywhere and it makes it hard to close the case correctly. Otherwise it would be a 5 star.
B009JZTP4Y|5.0|A good solid movie. This movie relies on a good story. Although the original series had allot of action, The Motion Picture reminds us that the Enterprise is a science vessel. There is some action and descent special effects but its a modern/old school scifi. I love it!
B001FB4W0C|4.0|I have all the seasons of Supernatural. I love the show. I love the plot. I LOVE the actors. But nearly every seasons DVD case has arrived damaged!

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The cord charges that Kindle perfectly and the cord is still intact. It shows no signs of breaking. It's all I expected of Amazon - a great product!
B002JVWRAO|4.0|I have all the seasons of Supernatural. I love the show. I love the plot. I LOVE the actors. But nearly every seasons DVD case has arrived damaged!

B003VXMMTK|1.0|I'm a bit of a prude so I like my classic novels to not include nudity in the video version. I figured a BBC version would be relatively safe but I was incorrect. I only got through the first two episodes before bailing so the rest might be fine.
B00E0MCYPS|2.0|Not a game person<br />But its ok my boyfriend likes to play this game alot I will give it a passing
B006QV30JU|3.0|An enjoyable old musical but as most old movies, it tends to drag in several spots. The romances begin as love-at-first-sight and never develop beyond that.
B0040I09RM|5.0|My Grandson watched all of the previous seasons and told me how much he liked it so now I am hooked. Watched this seasons premier and was lost so I am trying to get through all of them before Tuesday!
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|This app makes finding free ebooks so much easier than having to sift through all the filters on an actual kindle. I just look up books on my phone and have them sent to my kindle for when I'm ready to read.
B009AMANH4|5.0|The awards for the performance of Daniel Day Lewis for his portrayal of Lincoln was well deserved.  Sally Field humanizes the struggles that Mary Lincoln experienced.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I like flipboard because I can customize it to get news in any category I want. It takes a little getting used to as far as navigating but other than that I would recommend it, unless you don't want a time waster, it is so useful, it can keep you  busy for hours. And I don't like news!
076115678X|5.0|Finally! I found a step by step guide how to work with my curls and I am learning to love them.  Includes an excellent instructional DVD.
B002RVCD0U|5.0|I am a sucker for scifi and I thought this movie was more thought provoking than the other shoot-em-up ones. I like the terminator movies but if you've seen one you've seen them all. This one was different in that respect.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey seems to be getting better and better.  It was suggested to me to watch this series and proceeded to watch all three seasons in just 4 days!  I can't wait for season 4 to start in January 2014.
B005K17RU0|2.0|The app is ok if all you want is today's weather, but it doesn't seem to have the functionality of WeatherBug app. Sorry about that, but what can I say? I went back to weatherbug.
039472903X|5.0|I would consider OOA a true self-help book. It is written by a very intelligent and reflective man and concerns a topic that spills over into other areas of life. As I get older I have noticed that when you let a very smart person who writes very well write about a subject he/she is a genius at the results are almost always worth reading, whether the subject is baseball, gardening, fashion, or overthrowing governments. If you want to be better at communicating with people this book will help you, and it's also a fascinating cultural artifact, giving us a glimpse into the cultural foundations of post-war America. In particular, the section on political advertising is of timeless interest. You may also enjoy the reproductions of famous ads of the past whether you are old enough to remember them or not. Plus there's a hot girl. What more do you want?
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|I own around 15 Blu ray concert video's.This one easily has the sharpest video and the best sound.If you wanted to show off your system(or just want to know how good it can look and sound) this would be the one to get.I was amazed at how clear and powerful the bass was also.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I downloaded to my Stratosphere phone. It works great. I am pleased that I can have my Kindle ebooks in the cloud,  wherever i go!
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|Based on the previews, I thought this was going to be an enjoyable story in which to escape. Unfortunately, no luck. There is always a certain element of hanging reality up and just getting in to a story on the screen, but try as I might, the sheer ridiculousness of this movie wouldn't let me escape. The acting was sub par (actually, it was terrible), the dialogue trite with the heir of an after school special (okay yes, I'm a tad older than the targeted demographic), and the story had so many holes it was sheer magic I even made it to the end. While I can't say I knew what was going to happen at every turn, the \\"twists\\" that did exist were so contrived it lacked any kind of impact or interest. If you must watch this, I recommend you waiting until it's free. It's not worth the $5 to rent, let alone the purchase price.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|I love the series... Love Bruce Willis... This movie was rushed into production using the cookie cutter formula and it is a flop. End of story. :)
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Easy to navigate. You can follow the weather of your favorite places with just a swipe. I do think the radar was more accurate before this last update. Overall, this is a must have app.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Highly recommend. Well written, easy to understand and insightful. I don't like most diet books but this is just interesting.
B00594XOZU|3.0|Needs update becuease the app is difefent onandroid so it suck now seriously fix app now frfr i still love it
B003MAS9S0|3.0|[[ASIN:B000IMKDPC X-Men]] Playback stopped at 30 minutes into movie and would not progress even though download continued. Had to stop watching.
B00C061I3K|3.0|Obviously &#34;Get Lucky&#34; is a great song and I thought the rest of the album would have at least one other great song but it doesn't. It's mainly disappointing attempts to recreate sounds from the 80's and while these are OK, they won't have you bouncing in your seat (or on your feet) like &#34;Get Lucky.&#34; Skip the album and buy just the song.
B00F35BV64|3.0|Having been a fan of Star Trek for most of my life, I struggled greatly with JJ Abrams reboot/reimagining from the very beginning. The key for me was to regard this new Star Trek as a completely new entity, and not compare it with the original \\"classic\\" series cinematic outings. The first film was a good start, and as long as I avoided any comparisons, I found I could enjoy it fairly well. This film, \\"Into Darkness\\" is a well made, mostly well acted second effort, but its insistence on putting its own spin on an original \\"classic\\" movie storyline basically crashed this voyage for me. These films, in my opinion, should be establishing their own universe and stories with these characters, not mirroring or mining what has come before. The film doesn't seem to know whether it wants to strike out on its own, or simply be a reworked homage. This incarnation will never escape its predecessors shadow if it continues on this path, and in my opinion, it can only fall short as a result. The conclusion to this adventure seems to indicate that a third film will do just that, and I hope for its sake that it does.
B00064WSNW|5.0|This to me is one of King Crimson's best, and a worthy return of the Crimson band name. From the raucous heights of &#34;Indiscipline&#34; to the quiet beauty of &#34;Sheltering Sky&#34; and the precision interlocking guitar play on the title track, this is a great record.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|So totally unexpected from a brilliant writer/director.<br /><br />It's a literary person's dream come true and one felt that we came to know who the great writers, artists, musicians of the twenties were.
B004TPJMLA|5.0|I'm a big Paul Simon fan and I think this may just be his best record. The combination of beautifully written songs with Brazilian percussion just works to an even greater degree than his collaboration with South African musicians on &#34;Graceland.&#34; I particularly love &#34;Further to Fly,&#34; &#34;She Moves On,&#34; and &#34;The Cool, Cool River.&#34;
B009O2XY12|4.0|Very fun game for All ages. I downloaded bubble mania for my Mom she's 76 and Loves the game :-)
B00499NHLC|5.0|I watched the first episode and it was very good. I like this updated take on Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. I definitely would like to watch more of this series.
B004J4WN0I|4.0|Does it measure up to Jim Butcher's series? No. The character development is shallower. But it's fun, a good way to relax after a day's work.
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|This is the worst sci fi movie ever! And I've seen some bad ones in my time. Those professing to be \\"Star Trek\\" Fans are either liars or Trekkers. The Casual Fan who really doesn't pay too much attention to anything but the cute actors and the special effects. But REAL TREK FANS PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE STORY AND THE CHARACTERS. And this story was a horrible rehash of a much superior movie. MAGIC BLOOD!? LOL!<br />Abrams and his little writers forgot half-way through that they were TRYING to write a wanna-be Star Trek film and instead wandered in a Harry Potter one.<br />These may be \\"Big Budget\\" but they are extremely Low Quality!<br />I know a lot of fools are babbling that Abrams allegedly \\"REVIVED INTEREST IN A DYING FRANCHISE\\".................BALONEY! Anyone saying that is either a liar OR they are completely clueless!<br />There has always been and always WILL be a HIGH INTEREST IN STAR TREK!<br />Just because the fans DON'T LIKE what they offer DOES NOT MEAN THEY HAVE NO INTEREST IN STAR TREK! It just means they have NO INTEREST in the garbage they put before us!<br />BTW! Reboots are for stupid incompetent lazy writers who have never had an original idea in their entire life! There are thousands of Fresh Original Ideas left in the RODDENBERRY UNIVERSE!<br />Oh and is it just me or do a lot of these \\"Reviews\\" look almost IDENTICAL to the ones found on IMDB and other web sites?! I wonder why that is!? LOL!
B0080M3OGW|4.0|The anatomy of an affair is brought out with subtlety and finesses instead of the usual cliche plots.<br />The only scene that is a bit overdone is when DeNiro gets slapped.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Read the reviews and articles to see limitations. I use it with a Mac and a pc. Only words with a Netflix on smartphones.
B009NX409M|5.0|Two people miserably married to other people meet by chance in New York City several times<br />without knowing it. Then finally meet in a bookstore where they each leave with the other's<br />purchase for their spouses.  The spouses are shocked by the wrong books and the future<br />lovers get the first inkling of each other's tastes. Soon they bump into each other again and<br />the mutual chase is on.<br /><br />If you enjoy the fantasy of being with the one that got away, this is for you. It's what happens when you<br />meet your true love while stuck with the one you had settled for.  Eventually, they divorce their spouses<br />and get together in the final moments of the film.<br /><br />The happy ending is the payoff for this old fashioned love story. I have watched it a dozen times through<br />the years when I'm weepy and pondering the one that got away from me a long time ago.
B00F2362IE|5.0|This game is fun it doesn't download because you need to buy coins and then get it.Lastly it's a awesome
B005MLOKXA|4.0|Believable characters, timely plot lines, and skillful directing.<br /><br />There are many hours of TV drama out there competing fir our time, and this series is worth dedicating some if my few hours.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|A really fun game to pass the time. Doesn't matter your age it's fun to play with your kids you can visit each other's villages. Very cute game!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I think this is a great little game. It makes you think and I like the fact that so far it hasn't been a free start up that gets you hooked so you pay later for the full version. Not as complex as The Room, but fun none the less.
B00DIZS4LQ|2.0|I would be interested in knowing if any other purchasers of this Blu-ray (or DVD) have the same reaction as I.  While the performances are of top quality, the video is almost unwatchable owing to a jerkiness in the video often seen in non-professional transfers from European t.v. being played on American equipment, but NEVER in a professional release.  Especially the shots of Barenboim who, of course, is constantly moving almost resemble a slow-motion movie and not a smooth one, either!  There is also a strange momentary \\"flicker\\" when moving between camera shots.  Shame on DECCA for not taking the time to rectify this problem.  In this day and age where the ultimate in video and audio are expected, this is unacceptable.  If anyone knows of a solution or why this performance was released like this, please feel free to comment.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|great cast especially Maggie Smith as the Dowager Countess. Lots of twists and sub-plots. I can't wait until season four.
B004UG7RQ0|2.0|I received this in the mail the other day for use with my Beatbox stereo system by Dre / Monster Audio. Sad to say it barely works...I plug it in and while I DO hear sound coming through, there is an intense buzzing that doesn't seem to stop. Even on the lowest volume the buzzing stays the same. I've tried moving around the dockboss hoping it was just plugged in wrong but nothing gives. No red light either. Bummed. Hoping I can get my money back for this.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|great cast especially Maggie Smith as the Dowager Countess. Lots of twists and sub-plots. I can't wait until season four.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A fun and challenging game, but not so difficult that you want to give up on it entirely. An entertaining find.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Good writing, fun watch.  Nice take on alien invasions, along with great plot twists.  Probably not something to watch with young kids
B009RH9J7W|1.0|I choose this rating because the case for kindle fire hd  is not working .  when you close it, the tablet should turn off it does not. I have to manually turn the table off & on. the case is good for protecting my tablet only.  I should have returned it. I am sure this is a great case, I just got hold of a bad apple apple.
B00BFUC8RC|3.0|I tried this app a while back and at first it was interesting, but then after a while it got boring. It was a fun app for a little while but there wasn't enough to make me keep wanting to play it. It's a cute app but not something someone would play over and over.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|I was expecting so much more from this film, but since it let me down so much I won't spend much time with it.<br /><br />I'm a Tom Cruise fan, but this is not one of his better films.  It's okay--Tom Cruise  being Tom Cruise in a lackluster walk through of the movie.  I think he saw the boredom of the story at hand, but was anxious to collect his paycheck on the way out.<br /><br />The story has potential, but this was not fully realized by the screenwriters.  After  a while I found myself saying lines before they were said and predicting what would happen next.  Nothing too original here.<br /><br />Set and effects were okay, but we've seen it all before in better films.  Fairly dumb action sequences.  This is a film with a lot of gaps in logic where some things occur to show technology of the future, but then don't work later to show how heroic our hero is.<br /><br />I won't discourage anyone who is a sci-fi fan from seeing it, but I'm not going to say it's a must see.  I would have been better off watching something else on this movie night.
044024613X|5.0|Awesome plot and easy read for anyone suspensefull to the very last page.  This is a must read book for all
B004S9AK7C|5.0|Great story line and as always, so well written by Follett.  Captivating tale and good detail provided.  Excellent storyline and one is right there while reading.
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|I started the game and immediately you're faced with all sorts of things with no idea what they are.  I had to stop it once I figured some of it out, and had to uninstall it completely so I might have a chance of starting with a clue about the basics.
B001EBWINQ|4.0|Ingrid Bergman is so beautiful. So many famous lines, loved hearing them again. Movies have come along way! Here's lookin at you.
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|I Liked this book, the writer writes really confidently about what he has learned throughout his life. Only bad think I can say is that some paragraphs didn't have much of an introduction and he went straight to the point and  it could of been a bit smoother in some parts.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very easy to get and read all the different information you receive when you load the app. I like the weather alerts you receive.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This cable along with amazon kindle powerfast for accelerated charging seems to work amazingly together which has solved the several kindle fire replacement units. Problem solved!
B000FC13UE|4.0|Such fun. I've not enjoyed a collection of short stories like this in a long time. The only drawback was the desire to have long forms of some of the stories.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game! Very fun and challenging! This is a game all ages can play and enjoy. I would recommend this game
0525952926|5.0|\\"Winter of the World\\" is book two of Ken Follet's Century Trilogy and one should first read book one \\"Fall of Giants\\" before tackling this one. This mammoth undertaking follows many families in Europe, Russia and America starting pre WW 1 and covering in this book WW 2. As well as these conflicts the story covers the huge changes which occurred socially at this time. The history is impressive and the personal stories are engaging and interesting. There is to be a third volume some time covering the post WW 2 years and the start of the space race and the cold war. As you can see this is a big saga and one that I recommend you follow as it is well written and highly readable.
B003M70O5O|5.0|This series keeps you guessing.  It is very interesting.  My wife is totally addicted to it.  Love this series.  watched all the seasons
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Awesome movie! Very interesting look at a disturbing world created by the author. Very entertaining and can't wait to see catching fire.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this show because of the two main characters (and actors), sci-fi themes, good story writing, and good British humor. Great to see Dr Who again.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I'm playing through it for the second time, beating my previous high scores.  I haven't settled for less than 2 stars. I am very addicted to the game!!!
B007WZ55XI|5.0|Great information and explanation.  Glad a bought the Kindle version--it will allow me to quickly find the information I want to use over and over.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Strong women.  Historical fiction.  Both favorites of mine. I have read many of Phillipa Gregory's books - never disappointed.  Love her.
B001REZMG0|4.0|Review based on standard LP. The great jazz pianist Theloious Monk with 2 back up bands with solos from the sax master himself John Coltrane. Recorded in 1957 reveals a lack of upfrontness & separation from better mastered recordings. The 2 backup bands of Wilbur Ware on bass & 'Shadow' Wilson on drums verus Coleman Hawkins on tenor sax, Gigi Gryce on alto sax, Ray Copland on trumpet, Wilbur Ware on bass, & Art Blakey on drums are center stage with Monk on piano, with the sax solos mostly from the left channel. Songs are abit modern & abstract to a minor degree compared to Jazz standards with jumpy rhythms & fast runs. A must for any late 1950's to early 1960's jazz lover.
B004SIIBGU|2.0|Not as easy as the regular system.  I will use it only to look at items, not to buy.  Awkward.
B001GJ315K|5.0|Review based on standard LP. The LP comes with only 4 songs: side 1 with &#34;You'd Be So Nice To Come Home To&#34;, &#34;Two's Blues&#34;, & &#34;The Answer Is Yes&#34;' side 2 with the famous classical piece from Joaquin Rodrigo's &#34;Concerto De Aranjuez&#34;. Back up musicians with limited solos by Roland Hanna on piano, Ron Carter on bass, Steve Gadd on drums, Chet Baker on trumpet, Paul Desmond on Alto sax, with Jim Hall on guitar. Recorded in 1975, the LP is of average sound with a little hiss & pop. Separation is good in fine stereo, piano seems to be on the left channel with drums in the center. Solos are with an easy kick back inclination for a relaxing afternoon. Then again this is after listening to Monk & Coltrane, so any solos after those 2 will sound easy, but easy in a good sense.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I find it to be a Good book and a very good buy, I recommend for young adults.. easy read
B008QZ1ZYQ|4.0|last September this was also faotd. personally I don't want a repeat. should be our choice. even if they offer a crappy one.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|Very well done. Beautiful scenery, at times.  You will not be disappointed, if you want a bit of British entertainment for an evening or two.
0143113100|5.0|This is more than a book, it is an inspiration to explore the brain in amazing new ways.  It reminds you throughout that you don't have to settle for the way thing have always been in your life.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Probably my least favorite book in the series. The overall way it ended was fine but there was something about this that just seemed to drag on and on. The characters internal angst practically leaks out of the pages. I also thought some of the things that happened oddly out of place/pointless, like the impromptu music video of the 'mockyingjay'. I think you could honestly cut the book down by half and still get as much of a story out of it.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|Yes, it's another zombie flick. Yes, it's Brad Pitt playing the lead. Yes, there were many stories of how this film went through many trials and tribulations...all to have it finally come together and it delivers. Just relax and lower your expectations and enjoy what they set out to do: Zombie Armageddon in a more horrifying way (zombies on steroids via a virus that turns you in about 10 seconds and just spreads like crazy across the globe). Even more chilling is how they show those (cities, countries, etc.) who aren't infected would have to deal with such a crisis and that is mostly chaotic on the onset of the virus. I also appreciated the story line of how they technically couldn't stop---well, i'll leave it for you to find out. Lets hope they can deliver on the next installment as well and up the ante a little bit (i heard they had to PG this one a little bit , so, start there)...Enjoy!
B009I2UH2W|1.0|iPad 4th Gen and iPhone 5 require 3.0 VDC power inputs. The Power Jolt is a 5.0 VDC output and is not compatible. Only worked sporadically on the iPhone. Did not work at all on the iPad. Returned the product.
0440178002|5.0|I ordered this book because I read it ages ago and loved it so much I want to read it again.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I found the book to be a good read and hard to put down. The story of Ender intriguingly moves through a story that is simply constructed but humanly complex. The book became a bit predictable as the constructs were few and straight forward but the evolution of character and passage of time makes the story feasibly easier to lend one's imagination and empathy juxtaposing Ender's youth and inexperience in an adult and alien world. I would recommend this book if you like science fiction. There is an Isaac Asimov and Ray Bradbury influence that resonates. The tactical portions reminded me more of War Games. Overall I enjoyed the read and would recommend The Host as a more current rendition of science fiction fashioned similarly like these classics.
B007FEFLTO|1.0|This is nothing like The Fall of Giants. Not true to the times. I doubt that a woman in Parliament would give a &#34;thumbs up&#34; to a member after a speech or that &#34;Was it something I said?&#34; be in the vernacular.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|This is a great show!  The characters are well-written.  The cast is great.  Great story lines.  Always leaves me wanting more!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This is my first read by this author, and boy, what a tangled web we weave. This one kept me on my toes the entire time, making sure that I was keeping up with all the twist and turns of this web. But the one thing that keep running through my mind as I was reading was what would I do in this situation. Would I open the letter?, Would I stay with my husband?, How would I cope with my daughters death? How would I live with a terrible secret that could change the entire course of my life and my families? I had this internal moral struggle with myself as I was finishing this story, and  I did not have a black and white answer. Even with the heavy subject matter, there were truly some funny, laugh out loud moments, and I loved how everything always came back to the monumental fall of the Berlin Wall. Will definitely check out more of this authors work.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Keeps you reading. Story of a man Jesus who changed the world by being Christ. The story is as honest as possible,considering we have very few facts available of Jesus life.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Complete waste of time....just like this review. Can't believe Tom Hanks reduced himself to this level of drivel.<br />That's all..<br />PS...we cancelled out at the 30-40 minute mark....couldn't stand another minute.
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|I absolutely love this game play as the allies or axis in world war 2. I will be straight this is basically a tf 2 clone but I love it been playing about 4 hours straight and am level 9. Easy to learn hard to master. The only problems I have are the frame rate and lag sometimes. I will die and not even know I was being shot at. I also wish there was bigger teams.
B006SV2LWA|5.0|This was an excellent movie to show my medical assisting students. Great information and the excitement kept their eyes on the screen.
0812993292|4.0|I thought it was a good book. It was a slow read just like his Pilgrimage. It made you want to &#34;get up and go&#34;.
B009G41CG2|1.0|This version was just too small and to my knowledge, there was not a way to make it larger. Otherwise, game is good.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great to see a unique plot in a multiple movie series. I did not read the book, but now am inclined to do so. The acting was good, the plot was very creative. Overall I Really enjoyed the movie. I was on the edge of my seat, not predicting each obvious next move.<br />Well done! Can't wait for the next one.
B008602KQI|3.0|I enjoyed the movie. It was another female heroine type movie.  Reminded me of future violent ame movie like roller ball. Fight to the death. But it had a good story line.
B008KE3960|5.0|It is a simple game that keeps both my 7 year old grandson and I interested as we move through the levels.
B00A2H9P98|1.0|This movie is Anti Republican and Pro Democrat. It's a knock off of Olympus Has Fallen. There's a good reason why it was a $150 million dollar flop in the box office.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|You can combine the sounds in so many ways it is mind boggling. I use this app again and again and I would give it 6 stars if I could. After umy cat passed I used the cat purring for comfort.  I love the ocean sounds and nature in general. The timer feature  lets you listen as you fall asleep and then turns itself off. It even saves your sounds favorite and keep them for later.
B009JZWO3I|4.0|I really enjoy the legal wrangling but get bored when it devolves into romance.  Julianna Margulies has created a fascinating female character.  I also get a kick from  the character of Eli Gold.  Good writing, good casting.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|However, the kindle's version of the 4 books is hard to use because it doesn't list pages and will not let you select a chapter nor lists the chapters by character POV when you find the table of contents, screw you Kindle. Gods, it doesn't even let you select a book YOU HAVE TO SEARCH FOR IT BY GUESSING! Needless to add, horrible product, maybe Amazon should buy out B&N and use their nook services because Kindle is terrible.
B000T9OP7G|5.0|I don't like the DVR's because one cannot download a copy to a disk, and the new HD TV's don't have an output jack on the back of the TV.<br /><br />I am quite happy with the DVD's in the season set, and enjoyed seeing the episodes that I had missed.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Jack Nicholson
B009ZFPQOQ|3.0|Unlike other apps, get feedback from fellow travelers on the road ahead and return the favor. Maps are easy to read.
B00E0MCYPS|4.0|I find this game very fun and very, very challenging. This is one of the most challenging driving games I've tried.
B00447L4KA|5.0|I have been looking for this movie everywhere and finally decided to get it off Amazon.  I was scared that it wasn't going to be in good condition, but when I received it it was new - not even open yet. I was so excited!
1451695187|5.0|I had always believed that there was something for us after we died.  I have always believed in God.<br /><br />I was reading this book the week of the 20th-26th of May, when my wife was in<br />Hospice dieing from lung cancer.  She passed on the 26th of May 2013.<br />Dr. Alexander's book gave me great comfort in reinforcing my belief.<br /><br />The day she died, I was reading the last part of the book and read the poem<br />\\"When Tomorrow Starts Without Me\\" by David M Romano written in 1993.<br />I would not have been able to bare the pain of my loss without this.<br />Thank you Dr. Eben Alexander, for your wonderful journey.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so cool I just can't put it down . Sometimes it can be so addicting to try and beat your friends .
B003G4W49C|5.0|This was a great book and very few books could meet what it has to offer. I encourage others to read it.
B008602KQI|5.0|It is a very good movie and is inspiring. Reminds you that family is always number one and you should do anything for the ones you love and hold dear.
B0063GORYU|5.0|It is exactly what I need when I have the urge to keep busy. Not too difficult, not too easy, it is just right.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I have used this app before on my cell. I like all the features and functionality of this app. You can customize it the way you like. The radar is good. I don't really need the video section, as it really doesn't cover my specific area, but, it is good to see the fronts and major weather that will be coming. There aren't too many free weather apps out there for the kindle. Overall, I am happy with it and it serves my needs.
B00594XOZU|5.0|It's an awesome way to communicate with people. It's also good because you don't have to give out your phone number to people just tell them to message you on kik! Kik: jasmine_hammond_
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|gaiman is supposed to have written this book for adults.  i think he missed his mark.  i didn't like it as an adult novel, and i liked it even less as a young adult novel.  the protagonist is dull and stodgy; the story line is slow; and the ending is very unsatisfactory.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Excellent book by keeping you enticed in the action. This book had good elements between action and twists. A must read
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I really enjoyed the characters and the plot.  Of course, I also liked the Massachusetts setting since its where I live.<br />It was well done, a quick read, but interesting twist to the end.  I may now read something else by Landay.
B00DQVSTCG|2.0|I actually loved the video quality of the Blu-Ray; however, some parts of the audio come through my sound system as completely A Cappella!  I hope this issue is corrected & new discs are made available to those of us with defective discs.
B00D97HNC4|5.0|I say unexpected because I had no idea Lynch even made music. I went into it not knowing what to expect to expecting a big turd. This might have made me like it more. I have never liked any movie-star-related dabble in music attempt. I know he's not a movie star but I still associate Lynch with film of course.<br /><br />This album has a definite atmosphere to it. Kind of like an undiscovered soundtrack to an undiscovered indi-film. After a few songs I realized that the themes explored on this album are a little predictable. I think of it as continuity to keep a narrative going throughout the album. There is good imagery in this work. Which all musicians should strive for.
B0085MK2C6|5.0|what can we say?  it's glenn, amazing contrapuntal clarity and voicing.  on this, no one touches him or comes close..
B003L77G6A|5.0|I gave this as a birthday gift. The recipient is<br />a follower of this show and was very pleased with the gift.
B0035JNTA6|5.0|There is something about this film that makes a bad day much better. The camera framing is spot on and the colors in each frame brings the shots to life.<br /><br />There is always complains of the poor acting, but in this case it is the genius of playing down to the part.
1451627297|5.0|So, a Stephen King book makes the top ten list for the year on The New York Times booklist.  Is it the apocalypse?  All the hoopla, fortunately, is true.  This is arguably Stephen King's best work ever.  Yes, even better than The Stand.<br /><br />The title of this novel, however, probably isn't exactly the best or most accurate.  Although the assassination of President Kennedy does play a pretty significant role in the story.  The story, quite simple, is one of time travel.  A topic that fascinates me no matter how implausible.  Judging from the rave reviews, maybe it fascinates others as well.<br /><br />Jake Epping is  a Thirty Something High School teacher.  No kids, and he's recovering from a somewhat unpleasant divorce.  His wife, an alcoholic, leaves him for a man she met at an AA meeting.  All of this sets up a perfect \\"specimen\\" for such a project.  Without going into too much detail, Jake finds a portal that he can go through, which leads him to the exact same spot - in 1958.  He can stay there as long as he wants, and do whatever he wants, and when he comes back to the present, the clock advances only two minutes.  The only downside to this is that if he stays in the past for several years, well, he comes back \\"only\\" two minutes later - but his body has actually aged those several years.  So he can't necessarily keep going back time and time again for months at a time.  Another cool thing is that, if he changes the past, well, the \\"present\\" then obviously changes again.  HOWEVER, the next time he goes back, he, in effect, presses a \\"reset\\" button.  Follow all that?<br /><br />So what is there to actually do in 1958?  Well, in a world where one is used to cable t.v. and the internet, not that much.  Yet when he remembers what happens only five years after 1958, he makes it a mission to change history - and stop the assassination of President Kennedy.  It won't be that easy - as he finds out the past is obdurate (I didn't know what that word meant before I read the book.  Look it up!) and there's a lot of free time between 1958 until 1963.<br /><br />This is actually the main strength of the story.  We see the world of 1958 through an observer's eyes who wasn't even born until the 1970s, and it's a fascinating view.  We see just how different things were, and not all of them were necessarily good, but overall, this new (old) world seems to be a much better place.  He travels from Maine to right outside of Dallas to prepare for his mission, and a lot of the story deals with his new life as a school teacher in a small Texas town.  Sometimes, a bit too much detail, this is the one area where the story might have been done a tad better, although it is necessary that we do observe Jake's new life.  Of course, he falls in love, and this oddly only makes the story better.  There are many things I could discuss about his new relationship, but let's just say that the story, with its two \\"worlds\\" has endless possibilities as to what can happen, and you're never quite sure which direction you'll be  pulled next.<br /><br />During his time in Texas, he takes secret trips to Dallas/Irivng/Fort Worth where Lee Harvey Oswald and his new Russian bride are living, and does a lot of spying.  This is the man he has to stop from killing the President, remember.  Fortunately, money is no problem for Jake.  Since he's from the future, it makes it easy for him to visit the local bookie and make several long shot bets.  Plus, things were so much cheaper back then.  So renting multiple apartments and driving all over the place is never a financial burden.<br /><br />It should be pointed out that, with all of the fascination around the Kennedy assassination, Stephen King is not a conspiracy believer.  You won't find the CIA, the Mafia, the three tramps, or G. Gordon Liddy on the grassy knoll.  No, I guess King could have gone in that direction, but he simply doesn't need to.  Even those who staunchly believe that Oswald was a patsy and had nothing to do with the killing of Kennedy won't be deterred from enjoying this story.<br />In conclusion, we must remember that Stephen King isn't always the macabre monster when he puts pen to paper.  He's written some very safe, mainstream stories that have been loved by so many of the public without the horror stamp.  Who can forget The Green Mile, The Shawshank Redemption, or Stand By Me?  This novel ranks up at the very top of his \\"safe\\" books - the ones that anyone can read and not be grossed out.  I have the feeling I'll reread this one someday.  I actually cried at the end of this book and, like Jake in the story, I don't cry that much.  Ten out of ten.hing to do with the killing of Kennedy won't be deterred from enjoying this story.<br />In conclusion, we must remember that Stephen King isn't always the macabre monster when he puts pen to paper.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|Bought it for my 15-year old for his birthday. Even though he disdains some of Lucas' re-do's he treasures this collection.
B00CATSONE|2.0|I did not realize how abbreviated this biography would be, and was annoyed by its Horatio Alger tone.  Now that this book has given me a blurb on his creativity, I will find a real study of his life and a accomplishments. If, however, your child reads at at fourth grade level, this book is a good introduction to better scientific biographies.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My kids love this game, so addictive and fun. It's like taking care of a real horse. I even have favorite actions!
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|I strongly recommend &#34;House of Cards&#34; to any political junkie. Its what I imagine the real world to be like in Washington.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I really had a hard time reading this one. Seemed much less romance in the beginning and more like porn. I'm left feeling disappointed.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is great for kids my age it keeps me busy every day!Every day after school I check on my ponies!I love it and I think you will to:)
B00AFPVPDG|1.0|The theory part of the book supplies no real theory. It simply says: deconstruct what you wish to learn into smaller pieces and practice intelligently for at least 20 hours.<br />The practical part (80%) offers case descriptions that are too shallow to be good primers in the subject and does not bind to the &#34;theory&#34;. Kaufman writes well, but that is not a good enough reason to buy this book.
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|Readable but simple plot and character development.  No reason to continue the series.  Lacked that original spin that would make it magical.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this app is entertaining when you're bored. it simulates kinda how you wuld treat an actual show horse. i like to play  it its fun.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I loved this book. Mysterious and fun to read.  I just wish there was a stronger moral theme. I hope you get as sucked in to the book as I did.
B004JMY312|4.0|the sanderson sisters are the classic evil old hags preying on little children to restore their youth.<br />Brilliantly acted and directed ,this halloween themed comedy is a barrels of laughs and sillyness with just enough scary to keep you in the Halloween goosebumps.<br />awesome scenery and costumes too. my all time favorite for years.<br />a must see !
B009AY04A8|4.0|I like this type of game with lots of  things to find and puzzles at different levels.<br /><br />I want them have more levels, I left Santiago to continue discovering more things.
B005HED11Y|5.0|I have never sat down and watched all the original shows before. I'm glad it's now on A-Prime  So the first season was great and I look forward to seeing the rest of the series in its entirety.
B002PEP4C8|5.0|This is a very daring way to get her story out in the world. It shows that you can get over obstacles in your way, though it might take time.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|It works perfectly and is user friendly. I would recommend it to everyone. I have tried other print apps and was diappointed
B000LJ9ZWO|4.0|I'm a sci-fi fan and always try to find good ones. Well, this was a diamond in the rough from the early 70's. Check it out.
B00DYCBH4O|5.0|I love Jane Austen books. Pride and Prejudice is my favorite one of her books. It captures the reader from the beginning till end. Wish it was longer!!!!!
B00DYTKKGI|5.0|this is a game for u to play and most of the people say that this app is a waste of time and its worth money that it asks for and its also a fun game for younger people.
B00CHS31DG|5.0|We all love it!! The whole family.  Even the kids take the note pad and walk around with it to see what &#34;pops&#34; in  ;)  Thanks to the Spud Pickles group for making this app available and we hope to see upgraded versions for the Windows phones soon, I know they are working on it!!!  Great job!
B003P2WO5E|4.0|A complex plot but written well. Characters are well developed and easily followed. I'm looking forward to the next book.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|This is nothing like Sylvester Stalone's version of the movie. Much better story than the previous version.  Take the time to watch!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|i was buying books from ibooks but realized i couldnt transfer them over to my samsung tablet, so i started using kindle app and its so great! now i can have my books on all my devices! awesome app - would highly recommend
B000PGNDM6|5.0|Extraordinery novel. I am greatful for the Kindle built in dictionary; learned, enjoyed and was transported to another area as if on a magic carpet. I immediately ordered more books by this gifted author and was not disappointed
B000ZLFALS|5.0|If anybody in today's world ever wanted to know what the sixties were like tell them to watch this movie. While it might not be the best dialogue, or plot it captures the essence of protests, draft boards, and just being spontaneous and doing whatever crazy thing came along, all set to the timeless music of the Beatles songs. Watching this movie brought back the restlessness and desire for change so prevelant in society back then.  A great representation of a pivotal time in our history.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Wasn't expecting much but I actually liked it.  Karl Urban plays a good badass.  I liked better than the old Stallone one
B009UX2YAC|5.0|play this game or you will regret it for EVER<br />while your friends play you will be there, being... LAME<br />this is flunking awesome
B000JIN3J8|5.0|I love period films. Having the convenience of watching this at my leisure was brilliant!! A great product! Would recommend!!
B00280LYHS|5.0|THE TITAN KRONOS WAS DEFEATED BY PERCY AND RACHEL BECAME THE ORACLE . SO COOL I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK FOR PERCY JACKSON FANS .EPIC!
B0087IT8FK|5.0|This is a quality movie; based on a true story which makes it all the more compelling. I would recommend this movie for male and female movie goers. the dvd was new and good quality, no issues when watching
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I felt this book is one of the best ways to teach you to apply the methods we always read about in these types of books. Simple and easy.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book will keep your attention. Ana comes across as a real person  Inexperienced  in lovemaking trying to get to know her lover Christian and learn his needs as well as her needs. I pulled for as, :/ my opinion, he was a sick person who could not get his shit together.<br />James did a good job and I will order another<br />.
B002361MLA|2.0|I tried to read this but just couldn't get into it and it's one that you really have to concentrate when you read it.
B0091REZMW|2.0|This game was too expensive to play. Also, I couldn't get help to figure out what I was supposed to do. I was going to the same room over and over again to get points get to the next level to gain I don't know what? Deleted it. Don't waste your time.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|I have been playing this game now for about 1 month just to see what it was like.  At times when I would purchase tokens, I would be in the middle of a game and the server goes down (happens quite often once you purchase tokens) and when the server goes down it kicks you out the game and takes the tokens for that game, like you played it.  Another thing I noticed is once you start advancing higher up the leader board (to try to win free silver tokens) you begin to see the same players in the game with you.  I believe that these are either computer generated players or a team of individuals who are cheating.  I was playing for a complete week after spending my money and had reached #137, I was trying to reach position 100 so that I could be eligible for more tokens.  After I had played I looked on the leaderboard and they had put me all the way back down the leaderboard to position 137,000 like I had never play.  I was pissed, and I am upset that I wasted my money and trusted that this game was fair.  I don't believe we are just playing against humans I think there is some computer generated weirdness going on to take your money.  What ever you do don't waste your money play online somewhere for free.  Total SHAM...................I RATE THIS 0
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book was really good and I hope other people will enjoy it as much as I enjoyed it I also read all of the Percy Jackson series luv rick riordan
B009YN2M7S|5.0|This is a great read! I read it in 3 days, and I couldn't put it down the whole weekend:)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Excellent basic calculator. Always works as it should. Works perfect on Kindle Fire HD. The only electronic calculator I own.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The Husband's Secret was a thoroughly captivating piece of literature which I praise so highly because the author's characters came alive with every word.<br /><br />She has done a remarkable job and I admire her wit, humor, and drama which made this such a wonderfully enjoyable book.  The twists and turns were so original and the best part of this book had to be that it truly was not predictable, which I find so exciting because there are so few authors who can achieve these results.  I would recommend this book and author to my friends and I give this five stars.<br /><br />I read this on my most-prized kindle.
B00EQ0CKRQ|2.0|Typical string you in racing game.  Fun until you have to upgrade. Then an Audi Etron has trouble catching a station wagon. It would be nice to win a race without needing a ton of nitros. Why oh why do all you game makers fallow the same dam format all the time. Cheap cars first super cars last. How about letting us drive the cars you advertise on the cover without having to win everything already. What's the point. I play these games cause I want to drive a dam Lambo not some little smoke burner in my first race.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|The saga continues as the lives of our Welch, Russian and American characters' lives are seamlessly interwoven.  The historical perspective is terrific and informative.  World War II was interesting, I can't wait to see what the 'Cold War' will bring.  Start at the beginning of the trilogy and enjoy
B000FC0OOU|5.0|Hemingway's finest novel. A must read. The characters, the backround, the scenery all combine to transport you back to the revolution
B005HJU7HA|5.0|These stories never get old - they continue to be interesting and entertaining even today. Anyone who loves a good mystery will not be disappointed.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I sobbed when I got to the end of Strayed's book. Her honesty about her past, the devastating loss of her mother and the tenacity witlh which she continues along the trail despite being so unprepared just resonated with me. This is One of the very few books I've read where I wanted to go back to page one and start over again and have thought about a lot in the days since finishing it.<br /><br />I will certainly be reading more of her writing.
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|I just watched the blu ray and I have no issues with sound at all.  Sure, it is not as bass heavy as the Confessions Tour or Sticky and Sweet Tour, but it still sounds great on my system.  Sound coming from all speakers on my surround sound and the picture is filtered but it looks amazing.  I watched the premiere on epix on my computer and was a little indifferent to this show ( I saw it live in Atlanta, it was an incredible show), too many cuts and weird edits with that premiere.  This blu ray seems different from the epix show.  It doesn't seem as frantic to me, or maybe it is the differnce between watching it on a 17 inch computer screen vs a 42 inch high def tv.  I really enjoyed the blu ray.  Maybe there are defective discs out there, but mine was not one of them I am happy to say.
B00CG5MVD6|5.0|It is one of my all time favorite Depp movies and the one that won me to never missing one of his movies. Some I have loved, some not so much but this one I have viewed at least 10 times and will see again.  PS, I'm 70 years old and an unabashed Depp fan.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS AMAZING AND BASED ON A TRUE STORY AND BEN AFFLECK IS SO AMAZING IN THIS MOVIE IT IS ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT A MUST SEE
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so much fun to play that I have to make myself put it down because of how addictive it is!
1423136802|5.0|This box set is Such a great deal. This is a really great series & I was excited to get the full set for such a great price.<br />I read these books when I was 24 or 25 & I truly loved them. I know that the target audience is much younger, but they're so good.<br />I bought this set for my nephew for Christmas & I know he will love it.<br />They were shipped quickly & packaged very well.<br /><br />I recommend Rick Riordan books because he is a very well educated & clever author. His books are captivating. :)
B0079IEPHA|4.0|I love this show. I love the humor, the movie references in the dialogue, and the character dynamics. I wasn't disappointed with that. The show deserves five stars and is definitely worth the money. But dealing with UltraViolet was painful for me. I only had a vague understanding of UltraViolet and that was my downfall it seemed. After setting up my account (a painful process in itself; three confirmation pages and two email registrations later), I then proceeded to add the show to my library but I never figured out how to actually download the digital copy. I scoured the web on how to do this but nothing I found was helpful. It said there would be a download button next to each episode and there wasn't so I just gave up. So in short, great show, happy with the physical copy, NOT impressed with UltraViolet.
B00DQVSTCG|4.0|When I played it on my laptop with my BOSE QuietComfort 15 headphones, the Blu-ray audio was horrible. The sound was playing mostly in left side of headphones. Annoying!! And no bass!! I was so despondent.<br /><br />I have the CyberLink PowerDVD 13 software and with some audio adjustments I actually got the right audio balance and bass boosted quite significantly!! I didn't even expect it to work. I'm now enjoying the show!!<br /><br />The only thing is that this works for me while watching it on my Sony VAIO (laptop). So this does me really well for now until the fixed product gets released (hopefully soon so I can watch it on my 5.1 Surround system).<br /><br />The audio adjustments (if you have the PowerDVD software): 1) Go to Audio Settings; 2) Make &#34;Output&#34; set to &#34;Headphones&#34;; 3) then More Audio Settings; 4) Output Mode: Set this to &#34;TrueTheater Surround&#34;; 5) Then under &#34;TrueTheater Surround Options&#34; choose &#34;Theater&#34;; 6) Then under that you'll have &#34;Dynamic Range Compression&#34; - Choose &#34;Boosted for noisy environments (highly recommended for notebooks).<br /><br />The difference is great!<br /><br />I was going to rate this Blu-ray PRODUCT (not the show!) just 1 star for bad quality audio, but now that I fixed this I can enjoy the concert better than the way it previously sounded. I will rate it 5 stars when they get this Blu-ray fixed. Until then, I give it a 4.<br />I really hope this helps. It's better than having to wait for the next reissue. I really hope this helps for a lot of you, because as a Madonna fan, I know how it is to be impatient over this setback, especially after the long wait. Good luck!
B00AW57L96|5.0|Highly engaging and not the predictable tale I had expected. Well written with really likeable characters who add to the complexity of the tale.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Not a better camping knife for the price.  I got two: one for each BOB.  Don't think you could hurt this thing.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|I started reading this book with much anticipation.  I was sorely disappointed.<br />In reading many reviews it seems as though many readers are upset with Piper Kerman because she comes across as someone who thought she was \\"better than  others\\" and \\"blonde, pretty and educated.\\"<br />That was not my gripe at all.  What irritated me is that more than once she felt the need to give stats and write paragraphs about how the \\"feds\\" put drug dealers in prison and do not address the drug problem.  I really saw nowhere that she addressed her role in BEING A PART OF the drug problem nor did she show much remorse for it!  Instead she acts like a victim of \\"the system\\" instead of acting like a part of the problem!  You'd think a little time in prison would make her a bit more introspective.<br /><br />With all that said I found the book boring, annoying and not at all entertaining.
B002WV5A9G|1.0|The video always comes out splochy with whatever device I use.  Use Google Play or something else.  This is the second time this has happened to me using amazon instant rentals.  I will be sending in another complaint once I figure out how.
B00336C3EY|5.0|wonderful acting by all. Story line very odd but would except nothing less from the Coen brothers. A must see for all ages.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Really really good! I already started &#34;City of ashes&#34; and so far it's so so much better than the last book series they made movies with (Twilight).
0894803123|5.0|This cookbook has terrific recipes for making your own ice cream.  The directions are clearly written and easy to follow.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love this.  makes me remember an old game I used to play called MOTAS (mystery of time and space)  and Myst. yay for brain games:)
B007JNWJMI|5.0|I love this ap. I have spent way too many hours playing around with my photos on it. Very easy to use for us novices!
B00E0MCYPS|5.0|I love racing games, and rally racing is my favorite type of racing. This game is really enjoyable and has better AI than Mini Motor. The physics is also done well. Graphics aren't spectacular, but they can improve in the future. The only way the game is really playable is with tilt controls, so if you don't like tilting your phone, this game isn't for you. I'm almost done with the campaign. It could use more tracks/cars.
B000BB1MIC|5.0|This was a gift for my sister and she has enjoyed the series immensely. The packaging keeps the CDs organized and free of scratches, holding up well. It's been a few years and I don't regret the purchase from this seller.
B003YFIUW8|1.0|This book gave a very insightful look into the survival of  kidnapped victims.  You had to remember that the writing was coming from a five year old as the sentence structure was often hard to understand.  I would recommend this to friends.
B00DSTBMMU|5.0|Sheryl Crow comes up with another hit CD.  The song &#34;Easy&#34; is the headliner here, but the entire album is filled with &#34;sit on the porch&#34; and enjoy songs.<br /><br />This is a can't-miss album from a terrific music artist.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I am Dan Rodgers author of Call Me Sergeant Rock (How a Boy Becomes a Man in Vietnam). My wife, Sue told me that if I wanted Ladies to read my book I needed to read a book that is directed to both women and men written by a lady. As I started reading I just wondered how would a lady, like the author of this book, work out as a leader in Vietnam. I believe that women are more precise in their decision making than many men. To be a leader in Vietnam you must want to lead. Women do want to lead. The author brought up another point that I had never thought about. Pregnant women need reserved parking. Thank you Sue for making me read this book.[[ASIN:1625162219 Call Me Sergeant Rock: How a Boy Becomes a Man in Vietnam]]
B006ZPJWBM|5.0|HIGHLY recommend this DVD!<br />Viewed it at a friends place & got a copy for my Mother - knowing she would love it as well!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I am Dan Rodgers author of Call Me Sergeant Rock Jesus sent a Guardian Angel to protect me in Vietnam.

B00BI4BA4C|5.0|And after playing this I do.<br /><br />What? That's too short for an Amazon review?<br /><br />OK it's all good, but the best bit is on the DVD when you see the Tyne Tees TV cameraman trying to follow Wilko.<br /><br />BUY,THE BEST DELTA BLUES ALBUM EVAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|Something's amiss here, no sound coming from right channels and rears,  Not much bass.  Picture  quality is ok but this blu-ray is going back to Amazon.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|My favorite part of the book: The simplicity yet profound message, which provides you an action guide after each chapter to force you to implement what you read.<br /><br />Small steps done consistently, that's the power of the compound effect!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I was looking for an app similar to notes on iPhone, and found this one.  It's better than iPhone notes.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|Interesting and a good short read. I really like the Theodore Boone characters and look forward to reading the next one in the series.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time. \\"When I hear the music, that's when the gas comes out. The same Valium gas the Russian soldiers used against Chechen terrorists.\\" Actually, I believe it was Fentanyl vapor that the Russians used, but it's mysteries like this that add to the hauntingly poetic nature of this film. To fully submit to the hypnotic spell of Oldboy, it helps to know the story originated as Manga, a hybrid comic book/literary art form. (You can read the Manga Oldboy free online--just search for \\"oldboy manga.\\" The Manga is a must for anyone who enjoyed the film.) We'll soon see how Spike Lee's new Oldboy holds up against the original.<br /><br />This is one case where \\"the movie is so much better than the book.\\" The plot of the film is much more intricate and compelling, yet it maintains a fantasy/dream feeling throughout, even as it rips out your teeth and shoves a knife into your back. There are holes in the way the story unfolds, and some scenes that may make little sense the first time around--like the flashback with the central character, Oh dae Su, as a youngster when he tells his friend what he saw through the schoolroom window that fateful day, which began the whole mess that left him--er, speechless. Or his deciphering of a code containing a biblical reference that enabled him to find his nemesis's home in a high tower. Oldboy contains numerous threads and some loose ends, and it's marvelous to watch them unravel. Oh dae Su is a tragic Manga superhero, more enthralling than Batman or any member of the rogues' gallery. \\"Even though I'm a beast,\\" asks Oh dae Su, \\"don't I deserve to live?\\" He's no beast, but can he exorcise his demons?<br /><br />Through all its decades of tragedy and outrage, the story has moments of hilarity, like the 'dinging' of the bell when the dotted line is drawn from the claw hammer to the jailer's head. Few scenes can compare to seeing Oh dae Su emerge on a grass-covered rooftop in blinding daylight after 15 years in solitary ... or chasing down that one pot sticker with the unmistakable taste that he was forced to eat every day in his confinement. The film is a riddle that bears up well under multiple viewings. \\"A grain of sand or a rock, they both sink.\\" Like Li Woo Jin's sister ... but oh what an unforgettable fall it is.<br /><br />After watching Oldboy dubbed in English on a major video streaming service, I was surprised to find recently that the same service now offers a subtitled version only. Although I've never had a problem watching movies with subtitles, I recommend the dubbed version for English speakers over the subtitled version. Better yet, watch both.
B0043CSBKM|2.0|Probably my fault for not checking first, but this was in Italian with optional Japanese subtitles (and vice-versa). I speak neither.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|I thought that this book was great. It was short, to the point and the author provided some very useful tools that I can't wait to implement in my own work ethic.
B00DJSUORE|5.0|Few facts about the vinyl edition that are not stated upfront:<br /><br />This is not a remaster, remix or anything like that.<br />This is a 2 disc 180-gram audiophile black vinyl issue.<br />Comes with a download code but No Amazon AutoRip.<br /><br />If you're here you're probably familiar with this album so I won't bother you with shit you already know. If you don't know, welcome to the awesomeness that was 13 years ago. Get with the times. I'm going to just touch on the vinyl edition. This is very dynamic, they didn't mess with the mastering as I can tell. The loudness War claimed no casualties here. I got out a scale and weighted the discs and they were 180 grams even. They probably would get more sales if they had mentioned this. They come in plastic lined sleeves for safe storage. Gate fold, digital download, and lyrics included. Lot's of good artwork, even on the labels.<br /><br />This will probably never pan out to be much of a rare item but it is mighty tasty if you don't own a first pressing or a RSD edition.
B002HFP0QU|4.0|Good recording of quality BEE GEEs music. I would purchase it again. The 2CD set arrived as advertised and quickly.
B0007TKNII|5.0|Love the production! Beautifully done. Myi granddaughter is hooked, and now loves operatic musicals and all the intrigue that is involved in the retelling of Gaston LeRoux's tale.
B002W7H3EA|5.0|Slightly dated but one great thriller. Hitchcock can't be beat he brings out the best by story and his actors
B00992CF6W|5.0|BEST GAME EVER  MINECRAFT GAMES better IT'S  ONE OF THE BEST GAME in the world l play it all the time
B00CLD65X0|4.0|...my grandmother was British. this show reminds me of her and gives an excellent portrayal of the lords&ladies system in England.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game, challenging. Needs card touch system software upgraded. If the touched card is not playable it needs to go dark not just sit there motionless.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|The Fairway game is fun but I cant play it at school dang only if I can change the rule
B0023SDPS6|5.0|As always Craig Johnson is a great writer of today's western books I love the Longmire books thanks for a great read
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This app used to be very helpful and accurate now it is garbage. I have uninstalled this app. Way to take a good thing and make it crap.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I love Hill Climb, but whenever I open the app, it force closes. I then have to restart my Kindle so I can play it again. Fix this and I will give you 5 stars.

1452101248|5.0|My wife viewed this at a friend.  Friend gave me positive advice for getting it as a gift.  My wife loved it and cooked a great dish almost immediately.  Ends up as a two-way gift.
0812982622|1.0|Although the story line is different and at times interesting,<br />my feeling is that 1/2 of this story could have been omitted.  It is repetitive: torture, hunger, pain, filth, death - in songs, stories, over the loud speaker. in dreams.  Parts of the book were totally unrealistic, ridiculous; for instance the Texas Senator having the NK contingent cutting weeds.  If I didn't have to read this book for my Book Club, I would have never wasted my time finishing it, which to me was my torture!<br />An avid reader, it is beyond my comprehension how this book could win a Pulitzer prize.  Regardless of the hoopla and 4 stars -I would not recommend this book.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|Lots of great special effect with a cast that makes it all work.  I have had discussions with several people that liked it as well.
B00EH6SK78|4.0|Nice to have the brutality back! Winter Kills is an amazing metal adventure that only DevilDriver can provide! This rocks!
B005LAIIN0|1.0|It is taken as a given that any science fiction, fantasy, etc. type of book will ask for a suspension of belief. The dead rise, people do stupid things, ordinary people continually do extraordinary things. That's OK. But this movie lost me when the protagonist (Pitt), allegedly a UN troubleshooter, magically escapes from downtown Philadelphia, in an RV, no less, while overhead camera angles continue to show absolute gridlock on the roads. I can handle that. But what blew me away is the fact that this guy, an expert at getting out of trouble, when contacted by his UN handler, is told to standby for extraction for a few hours. By then he and his family are on I95 in the middle of nowhere, still in the RV. Great, take an exit and pull into a farm field somewhere. However his daughter is having an asthma attack and they don't have her inhaler.<br />So they need to get to a drugstore. Now, outside Philly, there are numerous little towns, all with drugstores. But instead, after escaping the death trap that is Philly, he heads to the sleepy little town of NEWARK, NJ. And, of course, they end up on the streets.<br /><br />Really?<br /><br />That occurred probably 15 minutes into the movie. The rest is just as bad.<br /><br />The book is brilliant. Read and enjoy it. Avoid this mess.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|This is the first book of Taleb's I have read and as a result I plan to read more.  I love his ability to make complex ideas simple and boil them down to simple bits of wisdom.  I also love his witty, sarcastic and funny style. It seem like I the reader am sitting at an outdoor Village cafe listening and having great conversation with a friend who has absorbed the wisdom of the ages and enjoys sharing it.  I once had a much loved  and  very wise business mentor  who despite having degrees from Harvard and MIT and  having been a career military officer, drove a broken down pick up with his dog, wore coveralls and who I thought was very wise.  He had little regard for most MBA's and once told me I had overcome mine.  To this day I consider it the best compliment I have ever received.  Taleb reminds me of him although he used his kitchen table instead of a Village cafe and books to dispense his wisdom.  He was my thoughtful, generous but strict banker (yes I know, a walking oxymoron) , sometimes plumber and air condition repair man, not to mention a substitute father.  He is deeply missed and Taleb, while flawed, is the best replacement I have found. It is probably not a coincidence that they both are immigrants that have or had recent family roots in collapsed or collapsing societies.  His Russia and Talebs of course Syria and Lebanon.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Many unexpected twists and turns in this book, which focuses on four main characters  It was &#34;different&#34; and I enjoyed it immensely,.
B001VEE5KK|5.0|I was born in Munich, Germany, in 1942.  Luckily, I was not aware of the horrors that went on during that time but as I grew up I was always interested in finding the truth about what had happened.  My favorite literature is a novel based on historic facts and Kate Winslet presented a great combination of those two aspects.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The story moves from generation to generation and may be a little difficult to get into at first for some people.  The author shows the intertwining of lives through time.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book as I have Khaled Hosseini's previous books.
B0064MGU98|5.0|So glad amazon prime has The Good Wife. Have thoroughly enjoyed this series. The actors are all outstanding. And not too racy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game!  I can't get enough of the minions.  I play it all the time but I can't seem to get any better.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Season 2 did not disappoint! The plot continues to thicken and characters develop. Enjoyed it more than season 1! Thank you amazon prime!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|A great thriller that keeps you watching the whole way in and doesn't disappoint with an amazing ending. A must see
B00004RJEG|5.0|All of the Corrs concerts and live performance DVDs are packed with great music and talent.  This particular one, though obviously subdued because it is unplugged, really was a great performance for Andrea. Everyone else has a superb performance as well. It's good music!
B00915G6WQ|5.0|As Dexter approaches its final season, I will be sad to see it go. I'm glad that amazon was always there to provide me with a reasonably priced box set. Season 7 is a must see like the others.
B001XUPF2O|2.0|Jerky, forced plot. Awful dialogue (usually can't even understand Bane), forgettable action. Awful.<br /><br />For the record, I loved the first 2 with Bale.
1463707606|4.0|I have been interested in origami for 40 plus years now and this is a great addition to my library.
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|THis is a good movie. The cast is good, but did we need a story where the villain is from star fleet?. The return of Khan is a good thing. But part of the greatness of star trek was that the best villains were easily seen to be on the wrong side. DO we need the perverse attitudes about conspiracies and evil military  people from todays Hollywood.  They dropped the ball. We needed a movie about Klingons attacking and conquering. Or some such thing. But in spite of that with actors like peter weller on board the movie is still very good. BUT please have them fight some good villains and not bad star fleet officers from now on. Star trek is not about cynicism and that is not updating the premise.  this looks best in 3d of course. But then any film I have seen that is properly done in 3d looks better to me.  There's plenty of extras in this set. But I don't want or need a dvd in my set. It just raises the price for nothing.  Same with a digital copy. Just give them a code to download with. But the idiots keep foisting dvd's on us in blu ray sets. Thanks FOR NOTHING!.  You don't have to be a star trek fan to enjoy this movie. And most people won't care that the villain is a bad officer. But it's just not what I wanted. In spite of that , I did enjoy this film a lot , for it's action and such.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Eccleston gives us a decidedly snarky and cynical Doctor, but his acerbic wit is tempered by Rose's spunky gameness. The writing is great: funny, poignant, and accessible.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Pitch Perfect was a fun movie to watch.  I loved the story and the singing.  I just wish that there were more in the movie.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|excellent sharpness, plus i'm a trekkie, need I say more ? CLARITY IS VERY GOOD AND IS THE SOUND CLEAR
B00932A4XE|4.0|It was very funny and heartwarming too! I'm often skeptical when I see this many big names in one film, but this one was a hit! Laughed til I cried!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Refreshed format and story lines from the older Doctor Who's.  Usually collapsed to the new one hour format for a complete story the plots are still well developed given the fast pace and action.  Occasionally the writers do bring up points of ethical introspection.  Throughout a wonderful character development takes place.  In this opening season we see affection develop by Rose for the Doctor.  Given the accents and how quickly the dialogue moves, best to watch it uninterrupted if possible and not multi-tasking because from time to time a couple of words are used to build key motivations and subplots.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|One of the best shows I've ever seen. I also love the music score. I've watched all three seasons and am looking forward to season 4.
0316056898|3.0|This book starts out pretty sad.  There seems to be a lot of bitterness about her childhood, but none of it is appropriately directed at the fact that her childhood was painfully boring.  It didn't need the amount of space in the book dedicated to it.  There are some funny parts, but the writing seems forced.  It gets better, but she is very guarded and the sarcastic tone gets old.  My favorite parts are about her dad, becoming a mother, and feminist jabs.  I don't get the rave reviews about how funny it is, though.  I haven't seen 30 Rock.  I've seen some SNL, but I am not sure what skits are hers other than those she addresses in the book.  Maybe if you are a huge fan of her show you'll enjoy this.  Maybe if you are a writer you'll learn something from her.  I expected more lol moments because of the reviews.
B008TT7CXW|4.0|Turns out to be a great little sd card carrier. Has slots for micro and standard (or an adapter). If i worked with more portable electronics i would really appreciate the credit card size (which matches a certain microcomputer that runs on sd cards). I haven't filled mine up except that i have 5 of those adapters somewhere else, i guess for backup, or hoarding at this point :)  Good to fill out an order for super saver shipping.
B00CU0UE0E|4.0|Very relaxed album, pretty eclectic. More than just safe and sound good to listen to. Can#t beat the price they put on it this week.
B000077VR3|1.0|If I could have given this movie a 0 rating, I would have. I bought this movie because I LOVE musicals (whether on Broadway or in movie form). This is by far one of the most disappointing musicals I have yet seen.  There is basically no story line, no central characters and no REAL plot. This movie was just a jumble of special effects, overdone sets (not realistic, kind of cartoon-like) and over the top and overdone costumes. I forced myself to watch it half-way through hoping it would get better as the story progressed, but what you see in the beginning is what you get throughout the entire movie. Needless to say, I stopped watching it half-way through and donated the dvd to charity. I wonder if THEY kept it?
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME AND IF I LOVE THIS GAME YOU WILL TOO!!!! I love princesses I love them so much I want to be one!!!
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|Great device to pair with scale and accurate information on I phone - great way to track sleep and activity
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|It has a few scenes that I think would have given my kids bad dreams.<br />Two that I can think of is a guy rips a zombies heart out in the movie.<br />There are bugs that attack and are quite scary for little ones.<br /><br />It was a very good movie for adults looking for clean movies to watch or for older children. I would have given it 5 stars, if I wasn't looking for a movie for my younger children. It's a good thing I try and prescreen movies before letting my kids watch them.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like action games like this a jump right into it format no instructions really needed.<br />Challenging but not discouraging
B001O6W9QC|2.0|It had a few funny moments, but overall not that good. I would not watch it again. The plus side of renting is I don't have to look at it anymore.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|The premise of this book is very original and the writing good. However, the characters were hard to like and even seemed a little incomplete. I felt the story was rushed. Never like a summary on the end.  But I can see how this book is very appealing, it is a quick read with a gossipy feel.  Sorry just not head over heels.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Although I feel the need to use the closed captioning in order to catch every word, the story line and acting in this series is outstanding!
0393312836|5.0|Absolutely amazing read! One of, if not, Burgess's works. Definitely watch the movie after, though, not before. For mature audiences only.
0452298482|5.0|This book is worth reading even if you feel you have too little time to read these days.  After all, do you want to spend your precious time now foolishly only to look back later in regret?  This book is a time machine for you to see your future state of mind, but have access to it now and be able to adjust your path in life.<br />The older people interviewed in this book have lived life - in large, they represent your future thinking.  Spend an evening with the book.  At least read the summaries at the end of the chapters and glean the nuggets you'll consider truth later.  And likely the changed perspective will improve your life even now, so that you live easier now, be at peace with yourself and others.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This may be one of the best books I have ever read.  It is definitely one of the most disturbing.  After reading my friend's review I expected to stay up all night and finish it in one sitting, but it is so intense I have to get away from it regularly.  After an hour I begin to feel as if I am closed up in that little room.  Recent news stories make it all too believable.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Stop changing it every three days.  It gets annoying trying to figure out what I did and how to get back to where I wanna go.  Just leave it alone. Us old folks don't do well with change.  (ok, I'm not really old)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Although this book is recommended for young adults, there is joy in reading it as an adult. The language is intelligent, the characters are people you would want to interact with and the plot line is intriguing. This should be on all school's summer reading list because it demonstrates the strength and perseverance in children and adults.
0783230079|5.0|Gives one a whole different idea about &#34;invisible friends&#34;! Great movie for a young Robert Downey, Jr. Just a feel good movie. Fun to watch!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I like the way this show balances the law procedural crime-of-the-week element with the long arc story. Also, the acting.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|It is a well written book though some parts are longer then needed and a lot of cases where the same story or idea being told again and again.<br />For those people who were active in the Hi-Tech industries during the late 80th and through the 90th it is amazing book,but for the enterprenurs generation of today  I am not sure there is a good lesson to adopt.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|I Love this app easy to use. A daily help with the kids homework and my go to app for budgeting household expenses.
B00DDXJRJG|4.0|Great app, very usefull, is the perfect complement for my kindke, you can change your volume preference, really a great aplication
B00CW7KK9K|2.0|I really tried hard to like my Withings Pulse. I have a Fitbit Ultra and used it at the same time for a comparison.<br />The good bits First. Small compact light and when it worked the Bluetooth transfer along with extended battery life able to use for 7 days no problems. In the sunlight same problem as the Fitbit Ultra you can not read the data screen at all you need some shade. The carry 'pouch/clip) stays clipped on however at times due to the rubber design and small lips at both ends I found that the device would pop out of the holder, only happened a few times. The pulse reading I found at times semi accurate, its a novelty addition, I have the Withings WS-50 scale and would find that pulse readings differ on both products.<br />For the Bad part WITHINGS get your act together.....your customer support is non existent, to the point that there are many articles all over the web stating the same. I have written 3 emails over a 4 day period trying to sought out why my Pulse device will no longer sync and no response. This brings me to the most annoying feature. The Pulse has stopped syncing, there by making the device useless. My ipad and the Pulse will both hook up and indicate that a transfer is/has taken place however no data transferred. This problem happened after the last firmware update. SO if your device is working and your asked to do an update DONT. obviously there is a bug in the firmware. Great Device when it works let down by lack of support from withings and a Bluetooth sync issue. NOTE I tried Pulse on Android would not sync and also uninstalled the Withings Health App and also restarted the Pulse ( Hold button on for 15 sec) No luck so if any one has had a similar issue and been able to solve it please let us all know. I have my Fitbit Ultra still slogging along for over a year and have to give the Pulse 2 stars . Had the bluetooth issue been soughted would give it 4 stars however as it is its pretty much useless. Very Disappointed.
B004X80QNG|5.0|An excellent application for my kindle, very useful and easy to use, really an excellent application for my tablet kindle fire hd
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book does a great job of being the middle book. A lot has changed in Panem and Katniss has many doubts about her role in the future of the city. You will want to read Mocking Jay as soon as you finish the last word of this book.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|An excellent movie, the Avengers are the maximum, I never tire of seeing and the ability to see it on my kindle.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Real or not real? This is a great quick read. Real. Pick it up and read it in your spare time. I downloaded it for my iPhone and read to and from work on the train.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|Not that good and really wanted it to be. Wait for it to come to tv so you don't lose any money
B000JIN3J8|1.0|This is a  poor acting version of the movie.  The BBC version with Colin Firth is much more superior.  Also the movie version is better. This is the worst version ive seen.
B008Y1RTUG|5.0|The scenery and CGI in this movie were beautiful, although incomplete and choppy sometimes. I liked the way this story was retold. Any good fairytale is unrealistic; one should have no other expectations. The main actors were well directed, although the supporting actors were less believable. The love subtlety was intriguing.
B000FBFM9S|3.0|I couldnt finish the book but the first half was good. I felt the story got dragged too much and too many ideas were brought together
B0044XRIMW|5.0|This story is a classic moment in time, with reminders of tragic events in history. But the light that pushed through those dark times is the focal point, and what a great job the director(et al) did composing such a masterpiece. The love scene and scenes leading up to it can trap any heart and keep it there for all time.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|This movie had great music, a great story and a great cast. Very well done, will watch this one again.
B006PZBR8S|5.0|Movie was like rocky 4 and over the top together special effects are good Iwish they had things like this for real. A must see.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun for the whole family, great brain exercise. Love playing, can't wait for more levels,our eight year old loves it.
B00EQNYOYU|5.0|GLAD I WAS WRONG!  Welcome back Trent Reznor...have to admit, I was surprised at how good the good songs were and how much they still get to me!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I never thought I would feel this way, but I think these new Star Trek movies are far better than the originals with Shatner and Nimoy.  So much of that old Trek was so cornball and cheesy, I like that these are played (more or less) straight and serious.  I just recently watched \\"Space Seed\\" from the first season of Trek and was surprised that this episode was so loved by fans.  It just wasn't very good, and some of the acting was beyond dreadful.  I guess that's what makes them appealing, and I still enjoy \\"The Voyage Home\\" to this day, but this re-telling of the \\"Khan\\" story is far superior in almost every way.
B008Y73XTQ|4.0|Enjoyed.  Realism.  Life on the boats was clearly not an easy one regardless of which nation you served.  Even with today's advancements in submarines it takes a special individual to serve.
B00CXVX1OQ|1.0|This was way too repetitive and boring for my taste.  Not enough variety with the punches and combos.  I got it when it was the free app of the day, but this wasn't even worth it for free. Graphics were nice, though.
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|This album sucks really, really bad. The music is terrible for the most I couldn't figure when one song ended and another begin it's just that bad!!! I really don't know how the rap industry is going to continue to survive with music like this. Kanye West may need to take a creative break from music.
B004SKHJF2|3.0|Didn't recognize Roger Waters songs, so for that it gets 3 stars.  I guess this would be great for today's popular hits, but go back a few decades and it's not so reliable.
B0090EJR1K|3.0|Typical humor, but still provides good laughs.  Good movie that doesn't  require any amount of thinking :)  Just the right  the length of time, too.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|My son loved this game when we first downloaded it, but now it just freezes up constantly and there's no way to close it without shutting off the Kindle completely.  Too much trouble for a free app, so I had to delete it.
B00DDXJRJG|4.0|You can jump right in and begin to use this app without too much effort.  The slide controls make tweaking the sound easy.
B004OC07GM|4.0|This is a really good read if you are an entrepreneur looking to turn an old and established business model on its head.
B00E0MCYPS|3.0|Nice that it allows you to jump right into a game and begin playing.  Graphics are pretty good and it takes a little time getting a feel for the handling.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The story grasp you from the beginning but then lost all the logic and common sense. Absolutely HATE the ending!!!!
B0015DROBO|4.0|Impressive in scope, though sometimes I felt the characters faces were hidden as not much description was given to the main protagonists.  Had made up my mind not to like the series but then watched the Swedish version of the MIllennium Edition after my 88 year old father in law recommended enthusiastically.  Excellent. Different.  Very well done.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|What a great movie. The actors are top notch, the story a real tear jerker and the special effects totally believable.  Glad I bought it.
B0083Z614S|4.0|A very great book. It has a very magical feeling and inspiring. I recommend it to anyone at any age.
B00BVYNSLC|3.0|Lacks great production, Has an interesting story line. A bit too made for TV. Too much of the lead female although she is very good at creating multiple personalities... she just doesn't seem exactly right physically or in the right age range for all of the characters
B00EL8JCGU|1.0|The movie was boring and extremely anticlimactic. Woopty doo hoo, they all go live in Canada, what a happy ending for all the Hollywood douchebags. The only reason this was made into a movie is because someone has a famous daddy.
B005HED11Y|5.0|Great to watch the series in color,  I realized that many of the star treks I watched as a kid was on a black and white TV then to see the remastered version was stunning at times, great story telling.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this show, just watched the 2nd and 3rd  Seasons for the 2nd time.  Was disappointed though when watching the 3rd season,  there were several glitches while watching. The video would stop for several minutes or more, sometimes starting back up where it had left off, and other times starting back at the beginning.  Also at times the picture on the video would be hazy or garbled, for a better word.  But  I love the show, and  Can't wait for season four!!
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Love his rendition of old favorites.  Boz is constantly evolving.  Very mellow and relaxing for the listener, good mood music.
B009EA3JDM|4.0|this book was great, i finished it in less than a day because i couldn't put it down but was disappointed at the end which i did not expect! i wont spoil it for those who have not read it but i think the ending was not a good idea. still recommend it though.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Another great season of Downton Abbey!  I managed to watch Season 2 & 3 in two days.  Great cast and story line.
0316228532|4.0|Although I am a big fan of Rowling's Harry Potter books, I was in no rush to read this due to my ever-growing reading wish list. I picked it up as a book on CD from the library and started listening to it in the car driving to and from work. My commute is short and after a couple of days I was so hooked that getting a part of a chapter a day was not going to cut it and I wasn't willing just to drive around town aimlessly to listen to more of the story, so I picked up a copy in order to read it faster.<br /><br />I was surprised to hear that this book originally did not receive very good reviews from critics. There is not a lot charm and wonder in this story - it is very real and examines people's true, and generally petty, motives. In fact it is so real in it's characterizations that it could be a true story. The best part of the book is how perfectly Rowling inter-meshes the lives of her characters, and how completely she fills out their lives and motivations for us lucky readers to view. She is such a master at capturing motivation, habit, and emotion that her book's characters truly come alive to the reader.<br /><br />I found this book to be fascinating because the character who dies in the first few pages in order to create &#34;the casual vacancy&#34; on the parish council remains a huge part of the book, yet we never get inside his head the way we get to with the other characters. He is a catalyst and we learn about him only through the thoughts and actions of others. J. K. Rowling is nothing less than brilliant as a writer.
B00AC8ZJ6K|5.0|Nice bringing characters to life. I could have gone without all the useless dialog, but the back end of the movie was awesome.
B00933JF74|4.0|This is an adorable and highly addictive game. I would have given this 5 stars but I can't move buildings after they are placed.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I love John Greens work! It's easy to understand and the way he describes things is just so perfect. You can feel the emotions and see what he wants you to see in your head without rambling descriptions.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I had already read all of the Reacher series about two years ago when a neighbor loaned us his copies. I bought this Kindle edition so I could go back and revisit his books. There was lots of thing I had forgotten about, and it was just as good the second time.
B003JHKORK|5.0|Best movie Saga ever made!!!!!!!!in the history of ever watch the movie at least six times a day and still does not get old.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I bought this Kindle book so that I could read it again since first reading it 2 or 3 years ago. Just as good the second time!! All of the Reacher books are pure suspense and unbelievable action.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|was sent out the day I ordered it, arrived the next day and we watched it that night. was an incredible story line . I loved it
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Couldn't put the book down. Easy read and enjoyable. I especially liked the ending, and didn't expect it.  Looking forward to reading more by this author.
B000JMKOI2|5.0|Charles Bukowski's novel Factotum is:<br /><br />Honest, brutal and very funny<br /><br />A true classic<br /><br />Should have read this a long time ago
B0068AWQQ2|4.0|Ok, I'm not gonna lie. I am seriously considering buying this movie just so I can see David Tennant's arse in leather pants.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|I love this song so much,  Lady Gaga @ her very best!!<br /><br />Made me want to dance all night and day
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I enjoyed the historical account of Jesus, his followers, and the social and political events of the time.  Whether your religious or not you will find this an interesting and provocative account of Jesus as a social activist of his time.
B00782O7IY|5.0|It doesn't matter that it's in black and white or that it's silent. This was a wonderful film that took my breath away.
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|Highly stylized video post production. Visually absolutely show this show. Saw it in Paris. The grain effect is only in the'Girl Gone Wild' part at the beginning of the show. Captures the live feeling really well.<br />Madonna's live shows are just the best!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|calculator plus is a free app that works very well on my kindle fire.  It's easy to use and easy to read.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is an awesome read I love this series. I can't wait to see what the writer comes up with next
B004WGGQPQ|1.0|I downloaded and installed this app.  It promptly disabled my wireless access and the keyboard.  Even after rebooting the Kindle Fire I could not use the keyboard or reconnect to my wifi signal.  I uninstalled it and everything went back to normal.  So, no, I cannot recommend this thing unless you want a seriously crippled Kindle Fire.
B00EQUP3Q6|2.0|I like two songs: \\"Copy of a\\" and \\"Came Back Haunted\\". The rest aren't that great. This is the first NIN album I've ever found to be disappointing. While I like Trent's move toward electronica, most of these songs just don't blend well, and the percussion leans towards \\"minimal\\". I found some of the harmonies to not be very \\"harmonic\\". Some of the songs would be much better with some of the effects removed and/or simplified. There are some tracks that sound like smashed together pieces of different songs (All Time Low, most notably).<br /><br />All that said, I love Trent and will always support him 100%. I bought the entire album just for that reason. As a fellow musician, I respect his work and the effort put forth on this album. My criticisms are aimed more towards feedback than complaining.<br /><br />For the fans: as a recommendation for new music, check out a guy named DidUct. Some of his tracks are on SC and YT. You'll have to dig around online for more tracks, but it's worth it. He has a Trent-vibe that many NIN fans could appreciate.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|wonderful, scary<br />well written and wonderful actors, If this is representative of our government, and I think it is, I am worried.
B0053O89IS|5.0|I am a Bones addict so obviously I love it! I was so happy to finally see them be together. Even though they wrote the pregnancy in because Emily was pregnant in real life, it was good timing! I was sad when and how the season ended. But it definitely made me want more.
B00AUA67GQ|1.0|The menu which is supposed to pop up at the bottom, doesn't.  This makes it very cumbersome to maneuver. Input is fine.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|My son loves the movie Marvel's Avengers.  He loves when hulk turns green and starts to smash everything around. pl
B009FZFONO|5.0|Great story with fantastic graphics!  The writing and pacing on the show is incredible. The cast is outstanding. Best dramatic series on TV.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I want more. Great characters, storyline, dialog, and I love Donna, and love/hate Lewis Litt.<br />I could do with a re-cast of Rachel Zane, but she'll do.
B006S086AM|3.0|Fairly predictable, couple of twists. Entertained by the SNL cast members who are in it. Not a bad little chick flick.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Very neat game. Very very neat. I love this game.<br />I would definitely recommend this game to my family alot.
B008LXZFH6|5.0|AND I............ WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU RON BURGUNDY!  Absolutely one of my favorite movies!  Crazy laughs... can't wait for the sequel!
B00008WT5J|5.0|Great album. I love AC DC. This is the soundtrack from Stephen King's Maximun Overdrive. Mind candy, mental masturbation, wow.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I absolutely loved watching this show. I really enjoy the characters. The way they are well developed through out the season and are generally interesting people. The show is really relaxing to watch.
0062183613|5.0|An excellent book that not only entertains and educates but, for a sincere and mindful audience, also transforms. Humans have an in built moral compass. This compass, however, is surrounded by influences that often require contemplation and struggle to determine true north. In times of such struggle it is tempting and easy to be swayed by external markers. If truth is indeed a priority, one must seek to explore within and then have the will to carry it out or have the judiciousness to drop it, on occasion, for an altruistic misgiving.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Love pinterest.  No socializing required, just like a large bulletin board with pictures of inspiration.  I could stay on it all day.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This movie was great. Great script, interesting cinematography, fun & entertaining actors...and the whole magic message/concept was intriguing. Fantastic cast, though. It's the sort of movie which likes to keep you guessing.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|He was so excited to download on his ipad. He read the rest of the series in paperback at school and we didn't even know.<br /><br />I am so glad that this is available for him electronically.
B005EJNAK4|4.0|I like the concept of surrogates.. cool story line, but Bruce didn't appear to be the die hard Bruce we know about. He was a little lame in this movie.  Worth watching though.  I liked it.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I love pinterest and normally have no issues using it on my mac but the app for my kindle is constantly nonresponsive and makes me force close or closes on its own.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|...through those eyes of his lends credence to the Zombie-apocalypse genre in a way I didn't expect. I'm not a critic so I wouldn't know how to elaborate. The special effects are superb. Continuity is solid but the realism of one man safely arriving, exploring and escaping so many geographical locations when entire armies are collapsing around him kind of suspends the suspension of disbelief. But That didn't stop me for cheering the guy on.to its clever and uplifting conclusion that leaves things wide open for a sequel

0141439610|4.0|Growing up, I'd never heard of Wilkie Collins. I was only exposed to him through various book blogs about a year ago, and decided to give him a try this fall. There are many things I enjoyed about \\"The Woman in White\\", a few which bemused me, and there is one statement I have to make about this publication of the novel itself.<br /><br />For some reason which I can't really understand, I thought \\"The Woman in White\\" was a ghost story. Maybe it's the dark cover combined with the title. Perhaps it is the classification of a Gothic horror story. Whatever the reason, I was surprised to find that there are no ghosts in this tale. There are, however, many mysteries to be solved.<br /><br />The tale revolves around a drawing teacher named Walter Hartright. When walking to his house in London one night, he is stopped by a strange woman wearing white. While agitated, she seems to be harmless and has a fear of a baronet somewhere in the city. Walter helps her, and it is only after doing so, he learns that she has escaped from a lunatic asylum. The following day, he travels to Cumberland, to tutor a young woman named Laura Fairlie.<br /><br />Walter quickly befriends Laura's half-sister, Marian Halcombe, and falls in love with his pupil. On her father's deathbed, she promised to marry a man more than twice her age, named Sir Percival Glyde. Eager to respect her father's last wishes, she does not want to break off the engagement herself, but confides in her fiancé that her heart belongs to another. With Walter, at Marian's urging, back in London, Sir Percival, decides to marry her anyway, not knowing who the man in question is, and takes her on honeymoon to Italy.<br /><br />The action then picks up six months later, as told by Marian, who is living with the newlyweds at Glyde's estate in Hampshire. Joining them are Laura's estranged aunt, Eleanor, and her husband, a mysteriously charming, yet somehow dangerous, man named Count Fosco. Eleanor's marriage to Fosco caused a riftin the family that has resulted in Laura being the sole heiress of her father's vast fortune; his sister will only receive a payout if Laura dies first. And, according to the terms of the marriage contract, the rest of Laura's money will go to her husband.<br /><br />In Hampshire, Sir Percival's personality changes. He is domineering, abusive, and a far cry from the patient suitor who wed the young bride. Around the same time, the mysterious woman in white - a young girl named Anne Catherick, who bears an uncanny resemblance to Laura - starts showing up on the property. Sir Percival is obsessed with catching her and putting her back in the asylum that he committed her to in the first place. But why is she there? What are the knight and the count plotting? Does it have to do with Laura's money? Or are there more sinister intentions at work?<br /><br />The story is told the way a court case is tried; that is, various individuals narrate the proceedings, each sticking to the part he or she had a direct role in. Despite the huge pitfall this could have caused, it was refreshing, especially for a book published over 150 years ago. Each narrator has a unique voice, and some are decidedly funny. Laura's invalid uncle, Frederick, in particular has a decidedly amusing account of events, despite his being a rude character. And, just when you think you have the mystery pegged, Collins draws out another knot to foil your thoughts.<br /><br />Victorian literature is certainly something to behold, and it is obvious in this book that Wilkie Collins and Charles Dickens were friends, though I'd venture to say Collins is the stronger of the two writers. Both are incredibly verbose; like many of their contemporaries, they will never say in one sentence what could stretch out to three pages. However, Collins has a knack for painting more vivid pictures of his characters, particularly the women in his stories. Marian is nearly a contemporary heroine, despite her seemingly-sarcastic references to the weakness of her sex.<br /><br />A final note on this publication of the book: while Penguin Classics are wonderful for academics, they can be a bit clunky for the casual reader. I don't mind the notes with references in the back (and find them very informative), but the seemingly endless introductions and post-scripts are a bit much. In this case, the book was checked out from my local library, so I was limited in my choice. But if I were buying it, I would probably go with another edition.<br /><br />Overall, \\"The Woman in White\\" was a delightful read, and I am looking to more from Wilkie Collins. It's great to see something that could have gone horribly wrong - a Gothic mystery set in Victorian England - work out seamlessly. Sure, it's a bit awkward at times, but overall it does well.
B00AEBBA0Y|5.0|This is a good adventure film with good humor and casting. I am sorry they have not produced more movies from the book series.<br />The DVD arrived when promised and in good condition.
B005BGBPBG|5.0|I enjoy a good romantic comedy. This had it all. Loved it. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes romantic comedies.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|This film gives children and young teens everything they want in a movie.<br />The good guy, who saves the day and the bad guys who pay the consequences.<br />The film is well acted and directed.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|This is very helpfull to setup my tablet.  I find most of the apps I need.  I dont know enough to use it fully but so far works for me
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book seems to present the age old question of &#34;did the husband do it, or didn't he?&#34;  And even at that, it unfolds in a very readable and creative way by going back and forth from present day to chapters from the wife's diary.  BUT WAIT!!!  About 50% into the book, the reader realizes that this is not the question at all!  At this point you will turn the pages faster than you can process the information.  Creepy.
B008DBF5Z8|5.0|This things works much better than I thought it would! For the price it was well worth the purchase. Buy it; you won't regret the money you spend.
B00F35BV64|5.0|loved it. lots of nods to the original series. these young actors have the right stuff to keep the franchise alive.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|Amazing how well this series holds up over time.  The remastering is excellent.  It's fun to see stars who are well known now performing when they were young.
B000MTPAHW|5.0|Just get it, you can't go wrong with an amazing american instant classic. Has the best chase scenes ever and great views of SF.
B008602KQI|5.0|Its great to watch Hunger Games on Amazon Instant Video. It comes with caption (different kind of caption of my choice that I can read better)... rate 5 stars but I would say rate 10 stars. For those who join Prime membership, I watch it free. its cool.
0060989157|5.0|If you want the dirt on Motley Crue, this is the definitive account.  In depth background on all the band members, including their childhood, which helps explain their behavior as adults.  I especially enjoyed the parts on Mick Mars, as he was the most elusive and lesser-known member of Motley Crue. I highly recommend this book for Motley Crue fans and/or heavy metal music fans.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|I had never seen this movie from beginning to end. It is a must see. Great story. If you have never see Casablanca you will be amazed at the many contributions this film has made to to the greater body of film works.
B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|I originally bought this movie for my kids 4 years ago while we lived in Japan. They LOVED it! so much so they disc got too sctratched to play. I searched everywhere for a new Ponyo, no luck. I was so happy to find this disc, it came in so fast, works perfectly. Thanks, the kids (and I) love it!
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|More believable characters and better effects than the original. This was an enjoyable watch it once SciFi action movie. I wouldn't buy it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Is just as good as IBooks and I can get some books for free or at a very low price.
B0072NWKEC|5.0|The book is very well written, with more twists and turns than a corkscrew. Highly recommend this for a &#34;summer read&#34;.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Although I really like the TV series, this is better. Longmire's relationships are much deeper and richer and more complex in the book then they are in the TV series. Henry Bear is a stronger presence in the book. In fact everyone is far stronger in the book and there is a love interest (Vonnie) in the book.
B0018CWEYY|4.0|Lost will go down as one of the best ever TV series.<br />Miss it terribly.<br />I heard Heroes is somewhat as good
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Aren't we all not exactly who we want to be?  a mystery to ourselves?  hoping to mend our breaks with others? change ourselves?  We are all Harold Fry.  I highly recommend this story of transformations -- gradual, poignant, painful.  It's simply a wonderful story, a down-to-earth inspiration.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|This was truly a good movie with an outstanding case. McConaughey did some of his best acting and the two young boys in the movie were outstanding.  A good story, a true look at life, a plausible ending.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|This backpack has been on many flights with me since I got it 4 months ago. My Apple MacBook Pro (the bigger one) fits with no problem. It fits under the seat on the plane with no problem. Plus I can fit a pair of shoes and extra clothes for longer trips all at the same time. Extra pocket with the laptop compartment for wires and pointers. Super efficient and comfortable to wear.<br /><br />I highly recommend it!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|If you use the sound version, you get the correct pronounciation of all the names. Really great to listen to!!
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|David Tennant does a masterful job as the lead investigator, all othe roles well written and acted. Intriguing twists in each episode.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game is a lot fun. The puzzles range from easy to difficult and are good ways to past the time.
B000FBJF78|4.0|Third book in the series, the characters continue to develop.  The land is described so vividly, it too seems like a character.  The cases are intriguing.  Just a good series.
B00004TRD8|5.0|This is one of the best movies that Arnold has ever done while he has been acting and I'd personally recommend this movie to anyone.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I like that the Star Trek movies aren't just about one character. It's worth buying for your collection. Get it on bluray if you can.
B00000FZ1V|5.0|If you like the Ghostbusters movies then you'll want this for you and the entire family that enjoys a comedy.
1451695195|4.0|Would have enjoyed a little more on the afterlife, & a little less about this life. Great book though, and I eould definitely read more from this author on the same subject.
B00EPQQ2PW|5.0|This is an excellent album. I listened to it 4 times today and yesterday! I bet a concert would be amazing!
B007HACDLK|5.0|1. I'm sad for Vince Flynn. My heart is broken for his family. But I am grateful to have had the chance to have a preview of Vince's amazing, imaginative, political, extraordinary, creative mind by reading each of his works of arts. Starting with Term Limits which introduced us to some of the key players in the Mitch Rapp series.  My prayers are with his family.<br /><br />With that being said...<br /><br />2. Whew! This was an explosive, in your face, knock you on your a$$, sucker punch, twisted political, backstabbing of the worst kind read! Just fantastic!! This is my 2nd favorite of the the Mitch Rapp series and once you read this you will understand why this became so popular. Just a fantastic entertaining political rollercostal read! I have such a hero warship crush on Mitch Rapp, he's by far my favorite fictional American Hero!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is both challenging and relaxing. The soundtrack is soothing as well. I can't seem to put it down! I highly recommend it; it's a great value.
B00DSTBMMU|5.0|As a fan of Sheryl Crow since her first album was released, I am thrilled to share the news that Sheryl delivers one of her best albums ever. I know that Ms. Crow and the press are labeling this as her \\"country\\" album. To me, it's an album worthy of being her sophomore CD as she delivers impressive songwriting and well crafted, meaningful songs from start to finish. To be honest, I have felt her most recent albums felt \\"just called in\\" (sorry, Sheryl... as I do love your work so very much) but this album delivers beyond-expectations.<br /><br />When I first learned that she was doing an \\"country\\" album, I felt that this was Sheryl's way of regrouping and going back to the proverbial \\"basics\\": which she did to a point, however she really knocked this one out of the ballpark with literally every song....strong. Of course, Sheryl is such a student of music, that she definitely did not disappoint with the \\"country\\" content dealing with songs about heart breakin', drinkin' and lovin' - to name a few common stereotypes of this respective genre. However, when Sheryl goes this route, she still maintains her principles of well-crafted songs that will become timeless classics. Another notable observance that I feel compelled to share is... her voice feels even STRONGER than any album she has ever created. Maybe she's been workin' out the vocal chords.<br /><br />The Grammy folks will prove they are idiots if this Country Album is not worthy of being nominated for next year's awards show. Just my two cents.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|I have to say I like john mayer but it was something if I heard it on the radio I enjoyed it but it wasn't anything I reached for - this CD is on repeat in the car and at home. Some tracks on here I can not get enough of Dear Marie, Paper Doll, Who You Love, I WIll Be Found... everyone I play it for says who is this?? it always surprises  them, we all agree this one is a serious winner! He sounds relaxed, happy and his guitar work is brilliant. looking forward to seeing him perform live at the hollywood bowl!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I played this game on my friends tablet aswell as the dress up games and salon games I have a lot of fun games beacause of her so that's awesome but one thing I don't like is that when I try it gets to75% then wont go past and I cant play so hopefully this update helps.  by the way if you like pop music and country get I heart radio its free and I love it also intact I'm listening to it now I hope this reveiw helps you bye!; )
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is good. It's a little funny. I would recommend it. My granddad got this game first. Then me. I like it.
B0040I09RM|3.0|For lack of anything better to watch, it keeps me from channel surfing.  Not sure if I will finish the season.

B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is not only life changing, wonderfully written, extremely futuristic for being written in the 70's, but the movie is also about to come out. I can guarantee you, that if you pick this book up, or start to read it on your kindle or whatever, you wont sleep for 3 days because you won't wanna put it down. DO NOT go see this movie without reading this book. I implore you... For those of you who don't know, this was written by Orson Scott Card. He's in my top 20 favorite authors of all time (I love to read, so that's actually a very short list of favorites). Not to mention, I named my son Orson. Not ONLY because of how this author has changed my life, but because it was a family name 100 years ago, and more reasons that have nothing to do with this book. If you have never read this book, you need to. If you have read this book, but haven't read it within the last year, then you need to read it again. And for those of you who don't know of Orson Scott Card as an author, I recommend googling him, and reading every single solitary word this man has ever published..... Go do it. Why are you still reading this review? Go!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very entertaining....finished the whole book in a day on a 12 hour drive home from the beach.  I will be reading her other books!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is cool and so fun you play as Dave to win minion of the year it's so cool great for eveyone.!!!!!!!!!!!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Good game to play for a few minutes each day. If you enjoy sim games you'll like this. I've been playing a few months and have gotten by without having to purchase anything with real money.
140006922X|5.0|All the people who complained about this book really didn't look at the bibliography and see how he used those in his work. And, his religion has nothing to do with it. The Myth that Christians latch onto a character Decades later who was a Jew is still weird. Since, Jesus is Jewish not Christian. I.E all the Saints in Catholic Church were taken from awesome Pagan religions.<br />So, you need to be able to have a mind to divide two things to compartmentalize then you are a bad student even Theology Student students need to that the only ones I have seen not able or actually want to try are evangelical Christians. My Mother a Jehovah Witness and she enjoyed the book and JW's is how Religious people should be stay out of region keep their Religious belief to themselves try to share with others but don't lobby and try to change laws to get there was. Just image if Jehovah Witness were in charge of your health insurance and other things. That's what evangelical Christians are doing and other Christian groups. Just think that. Jehovah witness run business no you can't go vote that day sorry wont let you have any holiday off and will take you to court for it. That's what white republican Michele Bachmann's are trying to do Paul Ryan's forcing their beliefs on you George W Bush did it. Sad it's ridiculous separate the two.
B001DDBCV4|5.0|This was a gift for a family member, she was very excited to receive this and loved it very much.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Cool idea..but it doesn't do anything different. I mean there are multiple products out there that people already have that do the same thing. Your PlayStation Xbox smart TV.. all do the same thing and its right there. You don't have to sync anything or use WiFi. Like I said cool idea but until I can stream my phone activity (web browsing, game play, apps) its going in the junk drawer
B002ZG98ZA|5.0|This was a gift for a family member and she was very excited to receive this, she really enjoys the series.
B000XUBC5E|4.0|Predictably suspenseful. You know something is going to happen but you're not sure what. And you are never disappointed with Coben.
B0098VXE50|5.0|This was an exciting adventure!  It's fun for the whole family, that's what we enjoy, something for every one to watch together.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Totally addicted. Nasty charachters with hardly an ounce of human kindness.  Bad guys too handsome to hate hate.  Yummy and delicious.
B004TTZHBK|4.0|I like this app because it gives you simple ways to prepare some fast meals. Shame that there are only so few of them...
B00136JQMI|5.0|If you are a fan of Miles Davis, then there is nothing to not like.  He was the greatest for a reason, this album reminds you of why.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it the best game money could buy. The coolest thing is in the new update it has stars in the sky at night. I would say go for it if you were looking to buy minecraft. The best game ever. I love the game it is so fun and creative anything could happen. You would love the game. So get that game you would diffently not regret getting that game.
B0040GUIAC|5.0|No surprises because Ms. Whitney was a super star and her singing is always super.  I loved the movie and the soundtrack even more so.  If you live White, like the movie you will enjoy the soundtrack.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Finally received the Chromecast yesterday after a lengthy wait.  Installation could not have been easier - I used a Nexus 7 tablet and the process took about 3 minutes.  The 3 supported apps work fine, and I believe that the functionality of the device has outstanding potential for improvement. 4 stars now, 5 when a reasonable library of content becomes available.
B008Y768XO|5.0|I had to watch it since I an Akita.  It is a very touching movie.  Have a tissue or two on hand just in case.  :-)
B00ENBS4GO|5.0|The strange confluence between the brutality of ancient Rome and the brutality of our time and the American consciousness (which refuses to recognize that we are precisely the same sort of evil empire which will go down in history for its bloody, sexuality exploitative and cruel nature) makes this series compelling to a lot of viewers.  The mostly true story (I don't believe Julius Gaius Caesar ever got within a hundred yards of Spartacus -- maybe he saw him in the arena) is compelling because anyone fighting against oppression is compelling.  The dialog which seems to be based on a literal translation of Latin is unusual and helps transport us back in time.  The sexuality is astoundingly raw but there are clearly depictions of sexual love although I can't really tell the difference from the way the scenes are shot.<br /><br />I hate to love this series because of the sheer brutality of it and the subconscious message: hey its okay to be rapacious in every way and let me show you dozens of people who were for good and not so good reasons.<br /><br />The CGI is excellent or maybe I am just getting used to accepting what is obviously a simulation.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it I love horses period still game is awesome once you get the hang of this game it's so much fun and cool to interact with the horses.
B00CTT9646|2.0|This is a review of the of the Blue Ray bonus options as well as the special STARFLEET PHASER limited edition gift set.<br /><br />My biggest critique of the Blue Ray and what really ticks me off is that this does have the downloadable content through UltraViolet services - but on the card in like size 4 font - it states that you can only use the code ONE TIME to get EITHER the UV download (which is a streaming service) or the DIGITAL COPY... if I wasnt' so eager to watch this movie again, I would have read that and gone with the Digital Copy for my iTunes and the rest of my devices - not happy about this - Paramount sucks.<br /><br />My second biggest critique is I spent $80 on this set and I expected that the STARFLEET PHASER I paid some $40-$50 dollars for would be pretty damn cool - it is about $4 dollars worth of metal plated stuff. It is totally bent and crooked and it is 3 pieces of plastic glued together. It does have some heft to it and weight, but I feel I totally got ripped off and for that, I give this the 2 stars it deserves.  Poor quality, poor product for such a great franchise.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Just finished reading this true life story and found it very refreshing and entertaining.  The characters in the story are brought to life  and relate to each other in an unexpected ways.  The message I got from this story was that no matter where we come from or who we are, we are really all the same. The surprise for me was how much Piper who came from a rich background and was cast into a world of people she would never have otherwise encountered, was inspired by her prison mates and became friends and an inspiration to them.  The author obviously gained tremendous insight from her experience and does a great job of painting a picture of life in a womens' prison.  I watched the Netflix version of this story and it was good but somewhat different than the book.  The netflix version emphasized the prison lesbian lifestyle of the main characters in a big way, and the book had some references to that subject, but nothing like the hollywood version.  The book is a great read!!
B002VL2PTU|5.0|I enjoyed this film. I like Michael Jackson's music. I wanted to see what his tour would of looked like.

B008ER9QKG|5.0|These DVDs convey the exciting drama of the Lepage production with very good camera work and Wagner's superb music with fine 5-channel sound.  Recommended to all opera lovers and any who wish to get familiar with the RING.

B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|I like this game. at first I kept seeing the game and decided to download it and glad that I did. its fun and very challenging. you really have to observe and study it to know the correct move to make challenging. love it cant stop playing it as I reach different levels
B00B7Y0206|5.0|...granted you've already found a way to play YouTube video's on your Kindle first.Go onto YouTube or Google search how to do it. You'll have to download the EZ file app loader then Adobe flash, then unzip it. Once you've got it working , you'll see why this app works. I couldn't get most of any of the youtube videos to play in HD before and now I can see them all as they're supposed to. That alone is worth it. Yes it has some ads in the free version but they're not really intrusive. I went ahead and played the $1.99 because it's allowed me finally to watch all the videos in HD. Which is exactly what I was waiting for.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|The book is a &#34;how to&#34; book so has a lot of good ideas and suggestions for publishing a book for Kindle, as well as some other good ideas when publishing any document.
0316286850|3.0|This is good for a general idea of make up, not super instructional. Its a good book to start of with and the pictures are awesome.
B006ZPJWBM|5.0|Love this album and the quest singers made it even better. Tony goes on and on !!! He has filled the gap of saloon singers of the past.
B000I0XLYO|5.0|cracks me up and i think it is a true documentary ; ) I've noticed a lot of people have adopted the pucker lip  magnum look when taking selfies
B00EYN3HTA|5.0|'Peter, Enchantment and Stardust - The Poems' is a superb compliment to the children's story 'Peter: A Darkened Fairytale', which is a fantastic dark fairytale for all ages.<br /><br />The best thing about this book is it works great as a stand-alone but even better if you have read the first book. Again, in the second book, the descriptive and imaginative words from this author are something not to be missed.<br /><br />You can't help but feel like you are pulled into O'Brien's magical world of dragons, elves and so many other strange creatures.<br /><br />It is a fun, light-hearted and sometimes dark collection of words.
B000I8ERVM|5.0|The story is clear, the script is good. The story and film are paced well. The actors do a fantastic and believable job in their character, and the film feeds your fears and curiosity just enough, rattles you, and then pulls back. It's not a \\"jump-scare or gore flick\\".  This is a true drama, with respectable thrills and great storyline. Kudos! (Lori)
B00F6N4GGK|5.0|Teenage author Alex Goodwin has written a funny and thoughtful first book.<br /><br />`Problem Cousin' is a series of skits features the antics of Bob Bobinson and his best pal Billy Boogendoodle. They shop for pickled goat's feet, fight roaches, re-join first grade for a day, meet a `banana witch,' hang out with the eponymous Billy-Bob, go on a disastrous mini vacation, endure a strange cold and chase a Xmas tree down the side of a mountain.<br /><br />The author inserts himself into the narrative with the occasional direct address to the reader, a sort of running commentary on the action that is done sparingly enough to not be bothersome.<br /><br />Overall, the writing is mature and even handed. One might expect crude toilet jokes and other juvenile sort of diversions but the author wisely avoids this kind of humor and successfully finds ways to make the reader smile and occasionally laugh out loud through story and character, from the bizarre situations and how these characters react.<br /><br />Probably the most impressive quality of the book is the general professionalism of the presentation. I didn't find a single typo and the book doesn't feel padded. If Alex Goodwin continues with this level of quality publishing, I predict a rosy future for him on Amazon.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|Arrived and is exactly as pictured.  Love having my kindle protected which is all I wanted. I would recommend this product.
B00F6NKFQK|5.0|If you haven't read Oleg Medvedkov \\"Let's Conquer Paris\\" is a great place to start. The author of the delightful [[ASIN:B0089H5YPC Dragon Who Loved Water Lilies and Other Funny Stories, The (Lunch Break Funnies, Humor Book Series)]] and my personal favorite [[ASIN:B00856387I How to Prevent Unicorns from Stealing Your Car and Other Funny Stories. (Lunch Break Funnies, Humor Book Series)]] has written another fabulous collection of humorous short stories showcasing his rare wit and remarkable facility with language.<br /><br />Oleg's mind is a repository for European culture and history and filtered through his remarkable imagination comes this series of original and hilarious takes on everything from a Minotaur complaining about the darkness of his labyrinth to Attila the Hun in the titular story explaining to his blog readers and Twitter followers why he wants to invade the French capital. There's also a hilarious look at The Fall of Troy, a press conference in Ancient Greece with Medusa-slayer Perseus (\\"My PR people told you before, I will NOT show you the head of the Medusa Gorgon.\\"), a laugh-out-loud domestic scene on Mount Olympus with Zeus and Hera and many other genius vignettes that will turn your notion of mythology on its head and leave you crying with laughter and wanting more.<br /><br />A great addition to the Oleg Medvedkov oeuvre, \\"Let's Conquer Paris\\" is recommended for lovers of smart witty short stories everywhere.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|I like it a lot, just sometimes I wish the hints were not that many coins. But yes, it is very fun and make u think.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|Excellent DVD plus digital copy combo!!My daughter watches the video on her ipad when we are on the plane or at the supermarker.
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|Perfect! Have it above door from garage. Great for seeing to unlock door. When I go into the garage I have immediate light,<br />without turning on the light. Wiush it stayed on longer
B00CWS3IFM|5.0|I bought this for a gift but she said she loved it. She is  fan of Nicholas Sparks and has all his books.
B007HACDLK|5.0|A very good read for the series recommend highly can't wait for the next one of the series  must read the other of the series
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It held my interest and I read it very quickly. I will definitely read more from this author.
B00DNO3DS6|5.0|I remember seeing this when was released. After watching again through prime I new that I had seen the little girl as a grown up actress but did not realize that she is the star in HBO's True Blood series? I new ihad seen those eyes and bow shaped lips recently.<br />She had a talent for accents even at that young age.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am 12 years old and just read this book and i think it is a great sequel to the first. It introduces so many new characters and i couldn't put the book down. The end is also very shocking. My friends and i are racing through the serious , and after reading this book and not being able to stop reading i know i am going to win
B005XUC398|5.0|Kevin Spacey and the rest of the cast did a fine job. A very entertaining movie.<br />I will watch it again
B005544TRQ|5.0|If you are considering watching this series, clear your schedule for the next few days. The series is addictive. Loved it! Also, if you have any interest in fashion, the costume designer is a genius.
B00CM7FLZ8|5.0|My child loves this gams. Different levels that's challenging.  I would say this was a great purchase for my child.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I got this for my 7 and a half year old daughter who is a horse fanatic, she loves it as soon as she comes home for school she asks for my kindle fire so she can play this game.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love this app. I have the full version and I wonder how I ever slept without it. I do wish there were more whale or even dolphin sounds but I'm sure those are coming
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I got this for my 7 and a half year old daughter who is a horse fanatic, she loves it as soon as she comes home for school she asks for my kindle fire so she can play this game.
B00BI745AA|1.0|Lame and overrated film. To artsy fartsy. Bad singing and bad acting. Ultimate chick-flick. Even the computer animated background is amateurish. Hated it.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|Makes much easear to organize the files in Kindle. It also may substitute some other apps, for photos, and others. I would recommend it for anyone.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Smart and simple way to turn a regular HD tv into a smart TV.<br /><br />The chrome cast is simple in its functionality... Just plug it into an open HDMI port, plug in the included adapter to a power outlet, and you now have the capability to use your smart phone as a remote control to play Netflix and YouTube content on your TV. Simple and straightforward.<br /><br />To be honest, there is actually a small, one time setup routine you do have to go thru to register the device on your network, but after that, it's smooth sailing. If you want to play a video off YouTube, just press the cast button, and if the tv is off, it will turn on and switch to the correct Tv input and you're off to the races.<br /><br />I only have two complaints about an otherwise fantastic product.<br />The first is that it doesn't allow you to play content from your computer...yet. Apparently, this feature will be coming later this year.<br />The second issue is that it sometimes over heats if left plugged in for long periods without use. This has happened 4 times over the last 3 or 4 weeks, so now I tend to unplug it overnight.<br /><br />Other than that,I can't recommend it enough. My sister saw it in action and immediately ordered one for herself.<br /><br />Totally worth it.
1609611543|5.0|This is a informative and life changing for me.  While not a celiac my brother has been trying to convince me for years our family has a problem with wheat.  Now I now why and it is true.  I feel so much better and encourage anyone who has questions to allow the book to challenge the way you have done things in the past... looking forward to a healthier future.
0553801473|3.0|its just okay! there,s lots of places that this would have been much much better and epic! main problem is the lead characters are getting killed of before they can show their true mettle. this fifth book seems a little rushed!it seems the story has a ways more to go and good stories should,nt be rushed. its  good reading and i like it but i was expecting  more!
B003Y5H5FG|3.0|Not even as good as the original.  I did not think Colin Farrell was vampire material. Will stick with the classic.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app !!! After trying several other calculator apps, I am thrilled to have found this one. Easy to use, reliable, nice layout. And free!! What's not to like??
B000I5SY5U|2.0|Was hoping it would be closer to the stage production.  Instead, it was just a boring old story with little stage entertainment.
B0024CEY36|5.0|Should be required reading. Ken Follett is superb as usual.  Five stars. I would give it six if I could.
B00A285OOW|5.0|As usual Gregory spins a tale which is completely consistent with likely thoughts, feelings and motivations and events of late 15th century England.
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|I played this game using skips on some of the mini games, I think I was in a bit of a rush. I did however enjoy it and will continue to recommend G5 games. The price is more than their competitors charge for similar quality games, that is my largest issue with this developer. Release more soon :) Please
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Fun and addicting. A good alternative to the Bejeweled PC game. Different game types and graphics are good. Perfect for killing time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This games is so sups fun get it will love it it is the best it is a way 4 all those horse lover whose parents won't let them have a horse it gives the opportunity to have a horse
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|I saw this in 3D at the movies but even without 3D it is stunning. Even if you're not a Cirque fan, this will take your breath away!
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Works well... Sometimes a bit figidy though.  Overall a great keyboard. Could improve the symbol tab by offering all symbols without a long press. But that's really no issue.  Just finding stuff to fill 20 words.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|I love love love air hockey and this game is fantastic, I'm addicted!! You can change the table look, and even play in the dark with the neon setting. For 2 players, it's really fun, and just playing alone, there are 4 levels from easy to insane. It's easy to use with a finger or stylus and is really mimicking the original table game from the arcade. I'm not one to buy games, but this was well worth the purchase!!!
B009AJD5E0|3.0|The world of Prometheus is mysterious and haunting. It's worth the ride. But the characters—scientists, supposedly—behave like such impossible amateurs that it's hard to empathize. Or, worse, suspend disbelief.
B00ENTDDGW|5.0|True to the Air Hockey arcade game, but Glow HockeyPro is better!! Even worth the 99cents for a 2-player version! Plays well, easy to use, the ability to play in the dark is cool!
B00631VJIC|4.0|i enjoy listening to this as i really enjoy sons of anarchy. i thought there could have been more songs on it as there are so many good songs in the episodes. Katey Segal is excellant
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I've been looking for a simple cover for my Kindle Fire for a year. The other covers seem heavy, bulky and too expensive. plus the leather covers are a bit restrictive on the face and interfere with swiping from the edges. This is the perfect cover: Thin, lightweight, not bulky, slides right in to my purse, easy to keep clean, easy to hold, no bells or whistles. Unlike the other covers, this does not cover the face edge of the kindle, rather it frames the sides like a picture frame, so no swiping interference! There's a strap to hold the cover closed and the cover itself folds to hold the Kindle upright (for watching videos or whatever). Of course you don't get the color selection of the fancier covers, but who cares! If your just looking a simple Kindle cover without breaking the bank, and don't want to put a lot of effort into finding one, THIS IS YOUR COVER! I am very pleased with this!
B005544TRQ|5.0|I liked being a lawyer without being a lawyer !! Casting is great and so is wardrobe! The show goes to both ends of the spectrum of reality. I can see a little bit of myself in all of the female characters. Great show!
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|The plots are a little too neatly bowed up, but the acting is good and there is a tendency for a nice twist.
B008PQ8XZK|3.0|Seemed like it would be more interesting when I heard about it. It was recommended by my aunt who loved it!  I couldn't say I hate it, but I will be glad to finish it!
0374214913|2.0|Our book club members had a blast discussing the book, so it turned out to be a delightful book on which to throw our laughter and our brilliant comments.  The author would have had a terrific time listening to our finding our &#34;good&#34; parts.  Mine was the glow in the dark cover of the book, so everyone dashed into the darkened bathroom to check it out.  The name 'penumbra&#34; brought out a discussion of the meaning, etc.  Actually, we have great fun with the books we don't especially care for, i.e., this one.  Remember, if we don't like a book, we will have the best and most enjoyable discussion.  So the author should put a feather in his cap that he brought great enjoyment to our group....not while our reading the book, but the discussion after..
B00DW39B2K|4.0|De Niro and Travolta give a good performance in this killer tale. Truly awesome plot allied with tons of intrigue.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game. It is very addicting. It's very challenging but you do have to get a lot of coins to upgrade. I would highly recommend this game.
B00ESY6TKY|3.0|This Gatsby version did not come up to my expectations based upon past versions.  There were many fine things about it as the film technique and design work really evoked the period for me.  However, I found it slow and plodding in places and that made it difficult to stay interested and engaged in the movie.  I also couldn't help feeling the lead role was miscast.  In short, what i was up for seeing turned out to be a snooze-fest for me.  I also now understand why it wasn't released last Chistmas as last  summer and fall's previews and advertising had announced.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Although I liked this book, I liked it the least of the three books.  Well be interesting how the movie will be.
B00E978FGQ|4.0|Who doesn't like magic?  Wonderful fun and action with a superb cast that basically grabs your attention and doesn't let go until the surprise conclusion.  Not billed as a &#34;who done it&#34; , it is largely just that keeping you guessing throughout the movie as to everyone motivation and depth of involvement .
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Wonderful story at an interesting time in British History. Great acting, heart warming characters and so very enjoyable to watch.
B00EJY051C|4.0|The movie is nostalgic and engaging with its on point period feel.  It's displays a definite bias though in favor of Miss Lovelace's history, evoking much sympathy for her plight as an abused victim of her husband and the porn industry.  The acting is superb and the characters  reflected excellent casting, with the possible exception of the Hugh Hefner character, which for me was the weakest point in the movie.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I read this book as a thoroughly enjoyable allegory, joining the great tradition of Gulliver's Travel and CS Lewis.  It was well written and captured me from the moment I started until I finished a few hours later.  I have no idea if the author meant it as an allegory or not since I have not read any reviews of it.  To me, it presented an immediate and compelling sense of the boy's world with  the possibility of a loftier view.  I wondered at one point if the author was trying to capitalize on the fantasy  success of the Harry Potter extravaganza, but this book was more than fantasy and certainly more than good vs evil.  It had aspects that ran much deeper and were not so pat.  A book that I borrowed from the library, but I might have to buy it in order to read it again.  This book did what I feel every book and every movie should do for me - it made me think, and feel, and it stayed with me long after I finished it.
B00821OX98|4.0|So far its pretty good. I like how the show story line develops although it is a bit slow at the start. Excited to see the rest of the season.
0143113100|5.0|This book outlines the ability of the brain to grow and change even well into old age.  Read it and you will understand why senior moments are a matter of choice .... your choice.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I first picked up Enders game when a friend suggested I read it. I recall going through the first two pages and setting it aside. A few months down the road, while at an airport, I decided to give it a go and 4 days later I finished it. For sci-fi fans this book if fulfilling. I love the depiction of human nature in this book; the fear of what we don't understand. This is a must-read.<br /><br />A warning though, this is NOT a children's book. It is somewhat graphic even though the protagonist is a child. I am going to read more of the books in the series.<br /><br />N.b. I do hope the movie lives up to this book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got this app when l was 8, and it is still my favorite and l play it every day
B0011EU0NG|5.0|My 3.75 year old grandson loves the movie Cars and its main character Lightening McQueen. He absolutely lived this movie and talks about it in detail. His parents are shopping for a new car and his request is for Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|What can I say? It is a simple, basic calculator that works. Nothing special, but functional. It beats doing long division on paper, not that anyone is taught math that way anymore!
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Knowing it could not compare to the original, I watched it on the recommendation of another.  The colors were vibrant and it was entertaining but not to the point of ever wanting to watch it again.  The &#34;good&#34; flying monkey sidekick was annoying and the addition of the little china doll girl was sappy.  Guess those are some of the reasons it didn't last long in theaters.<br />I wouldn't say don't watch it, but  don't expect to be wowed...
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|Amazon's rental for some movies is too short!!!!!!!!<br /><br />We live in a busy world and sometimes you just can't finish a movie in one sitting.  What I saw of the movie I liked.  Since I didn't have access to it for longer than 24 hrs, I only got half way through it.<br /><br />In short, I'd probably give the movie a good rating if I could have seen all of it.
B00008GKEG|4.0|This was a nice look at the life of the Beatles.  Even though they were together such a short time, their influence is still felt today.  After watching the anthology I got the feeling that they were very close, almost too close.  I think that if they could have done solo projects while still recording as Beatles, then maybe they would have lasted longer.  This product is a must own for all Beatle fans.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|This app is fun and easy to play with. It took a bit for my 3 & 4 year old boys to figure everything out but now they love to play and ask for it constantly!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|watched online.  didn't think I'd like it.  don't know why.  remakes are usually disappointing. I grew up on the original series and feared the worst I guess.  wow!  loved it. great flick.  I thought the casting was great, effects and script not over the top, and I liked the twists others didn't care for (gotta watch it).  wish I'd have seen it in the theater now.  going to rent Into Darkness right now.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I started this series after downloading the omnibus.  The reviews sounded good so had to give it a go.  Amazing story!  I really felt drawn to Juliettes character and finished the story quickly.
B007T7MIR0|5.0|I was pretty worried  since  my Kindle Fire HD was getting a bit useless because it was  so hard to open documents... After downloading this app, I was able to access documents even those from Google drive! Keep it up! :)
B007EECSFA|4.0|Book has interesting premise.  Remember well some of the scenes of WW2.  Good development of characters and very<br />well written.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Good good good good great book this stupid they're making me write a review lots of sex good read good read
B00447L4KA|2.0|Love this movie, but it's defective.  Something is wrong with the DVD. It freezes and skips on certain scenes. Disappointed
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|If you like Hootie and the Blowfish then you'll recognize Darius' awesome voice.  Love his music either rock or country.
B008JIWNYG|4.0|The story and the art were great, but it did not provide a new slate like many other new 52 titles.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I'm still exploring this CD -- w/ my niece and we love it.  I thought Speak Now was awesome and this CD is great too, she's such a talented writer and I love her voice.
1439152799|4.0|I'm not sure I can explain how much I truly enjoyed reading this book without selling it short. It took me a very long time to read, not only because school started and I've been busy working, but also because Kate Morton's prose is so beautiful and extravagant that I treated every sentence like a bite of hot fudge sundae, spending extra time savoring and digesting. The story starts off rather slowly, with the entrance of Edie, the narrator, divulging into her relationship with her mother, Meredith, and setting the stage of the Blythe sisters, who undoubtedly steal the show. Set half in flashbacks and half in present tense, the life stories of Juniper, Saffie, Percy, Edie, Meredith, and even the castle itself are captivating and intriguing. The mystery of Edie trying to unveil the sisters' closely guarded secrets of their famous father's past and their own loves and losses kept me at the edge of my seat to see how she used what she learned of the sisters to understand her own mother's upbringing as a London evacuee at Milderhurst Castle during WWII. This beautiful tale is one that I know I will be reading over and over again!.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|You can compare him to Dave Matthews but Phillip has a sound all his own.  Very unique and love the words too.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|This game is not for the young.  there are no directions and it is hard to figure out.  The price was right though.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|Tom Cruise is definitely cashing in on any work he can possibly get before he goes over-the-hill with his looks.  This is another example.  Mediocre and un-surprising, this sci-fi adventure story uses so many cliched plot devices it boggles the mind.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My daughter wanted this free game.  She plays it often and shows me all the different type of pets she has.  It keeps her busy when she is bored. She loves it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Absolutely amazing. Heart felt and funny, you don't forget it. It changes how you see life...what life looks like from the perspective of those who are sick
1451696191|5.0|She loves the book,.  She watched the movie and decided to read the book which she though was better.  The book is always better.
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|I love the art of the deal, and this show is great at revealing that art . The character Jessica is beautiful and smart .
B0049J3QNG|5.0|Finally decided to watch this over the summer and it was great. I miss being a kid again. It's definitely a must-watch for kiddos and adult kiddos!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is the best game on kindle (but minecraft is better) I told my friend about it and love it to (+ she gave it a five star and she has a ipad)I had unlocked minion beach!!!!! hope you like
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book. It's like I was there with the characters and I felt what they felt. Great job, John Green!
B00BJNHACS|5.0|This fast pace racing game is really fun and you should get it! But beware the chopper on some levels! Having fun with it!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I read this entire series in a 36 hour span.  I couldn't get enough and can't wait for the fourth book to come out.<br />It may seem a bit like the gray series, but it is a good read.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A thoroughly engrossing, quite unpredictable, and heartfelt novel.  I enjoyed reading this book immensely; found all of the characters to be quite fleshed out (as if we all know someone with the same types of personalities.  Read this book;you won't regret it!
B00004VWA7|1.0|I couldn't do it.  I became interested in<br />Jaco P. through Joni Mitchell albums.  His<br />Weather Report and solo c.d.'s are<br />unrelatable to me.  Sorry!  Someone<br />may really love this.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Love this game! Fun and addicting. Challenging but not enough where you get frustrated and quit playing. Can't wait for more levels!
B000002AGE|2.0|I have a distant memory of this album from many<br />years ago.  It isn't how I remembered it.  Someone<br />will really love this, but it's not me.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|One of the best racing games for Android devices. Once you get the hang of it it's pretty cool. If you press the pause button you can change the music based on the track. There's lots of cars to choose from including Lamborghini, Porsche, Bugati, Corvette, Audi, and lots of other awesome kinds of cars. If you're looking for a racing game I would highly recommend this for you. This game is AWESOME!!!<br />Oh yeah, it's also available for Apple on Game Center. =) YOLO!
0385495323|4.0|Pretty interesting book. It hasn't bored me yet and there are a lot of neat details/facts. You don't need to be well versed in Crypto to enjoy this book.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|Witty, gritty with great character development. Lots of fun with plenty of drama. A great show enjoyed by the whole crew.
B00CS65JS2|4.0|High quality.  Long been a fan. Good Studio work, It works for my at the gym, working in my cubical, and on the road on my bike.
B003XNTTYY|5.0|Another fantastic book. Looking forward to no.3. The complex characters interwoven in a complex story is well written and a highly recommended read.
B0019X3ZZY|2.0|just because im back eric 9/0 dont believe da hipe nah ahh ahh ah nah. that was my cal back to my holaback girl she aint no but she be
B00EL8JCGU|4.0|I started this movie expecting it to be pretty bad but i was pleasantly surprised. I read the original and thought it was a great book but based on the trailers for the movie, i didn't think it would be anything like the book and I was right. If you watch the movie expecting it to follow the book, you will be very disappointed. That being said, it was a pretty good movie if you don't associate it with the book. Some people are complaining that its a zombie movie but there are no gory scenes. Sure, its light on people being eviscerated but I think it makes it easier to watch for a large number of people. I've watched my share of gore-fests but not all movies with \\"zombies\\" have to be that way. As for the story, i didn't have any real problems with it. There were a few things they could've done to make the story better and some dialogue they could've improved but there was nothing too bad. Most of the acting was good and the effects were pretty good as well.<br /><br />This is the most important part though. Its just a movie. Its supposed to be for entertainment, and I think the movie did just fine in that respect. So just relax, watch the movie, and try not to overanalyze everything.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|it was a good game but I would like it better if you guys would make it raiser to get the daily tokens instead of making us pass the fifteenth locations
B005MMY9A8|3.0|This movie is even sillier - if that's possible - than most of the other films in the &#34;Avengers&#34; category.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Only one device needed. So saves time searching for calculator.<br />Only one device needing batteries or being recharged . Easy to use
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is amazing. I don't read much but this book made it hard to walk away from. I can picture every scene and feel like I am living the book. I didn't want the book to end.
B0058VW36U|5.0|like the title is  Its Better than you would think i LOVE it you should really get it i mean you don't have to but i would recomend it a BILLION times
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I am disappointed in the ending of this one. It just dropped off too quickly. I did enjoy the story line though.
B000WYCF6Q|4.0|I had already bought one of these on another occasion, and I came out very good so I thought of buying another
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a good game to play when you want to just sit and relax.  It doesn't require to much thinking.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am surprised at how much I like it. It helps me understand some old traditions in my home state of Virginia.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|this game is so addicting I played it deep in the night and there is a 98% chance you'll never stop playing it
B000GUJHIA|4.0|Everyone has said what can be said here but I would add my 10 cents that this should be required reading for policy makers, not just in Europe itself but in the US.  You may not like Judt's conclusions but his argument is forcefully made and thorough in its factual support and deserves consideration if not necessarily acceptance.  An added advantage, it is an excellent read; I found his chapters on the collapse of Communism and of the wars in the former Yugoslavia to be tours de force.  If I give this four stars rather than five it's only because five stars in my opinion is reserved for the superstars of literature.
B000003337|5.0|If you like to listen to loud music, such as rock,<br />Exciting guitar is a must,<br />This one had a bit rock guitarist born
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|Nothing in the blurbs prepared me for a fantasy novel.  I found it disquieting and unpleasant.  One of these days i'll overcome the compulsion to finish any book started...this book will help.<br />Alan
B004FRX0MY|5.0|love it! i just got it! and so far it works great. but i dont think it has let me get all my songs that i d boought on amazon.
B00CTSDDVO|2.0|Whoever decided to divide the extras up between different versions of the same disc being sold at different retailers only ended up causing fan frustration.<br /><br />The commentary is only on iTunes, while the 5-10 minutes features are divided up between Target, Best Buy and the Amazon exclusive \\"Phaser\\" packaging.  Best Buy's extras aren't even on the disc, they're all online.  And are deleted are scenes on any of these releases?  Nope.<br /><br />Also, I purchased the 3D disc and was totally disappointed that the IMAX \\"expanded\\" footage wasn't restored.  Those were some great scenes to see in the theater!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|My daughter recommended this book to me.  This book covered the very real events that happen tragically to a section of our society that is very rarely covered in literature.  For those who may experience this or may know classmates that go through this they hopefully will be the friend who does not begin to drift away out of not knowing how to react in the face of terminal  or near terminal  illness.  This book validates the feelings for any adolescent  or family member in this situation.  It makes you stop and realize how precious life is.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Love Minions (the characters).  The creators of Minions hit it on the nose.  The game has fair repeat playability, nice changes in scenery and a good set of challenges to keep the player involved.  The game is responsive to touch ques.  Excellent for young to old (like me).  Never let the child inside die.  Enjoy.
B000JO9JHW|1.0|Didn't realize this would be so bloody and filled with horror....not my kind of show.  Even my husband didn't like it.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I like the way this app works as an alarm clock, but I wish that it would sound something when the timer is finished.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|You must read all books in succession but its definitely worth the page number. I'm going to read them all!
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|I had fun playing with this app, but my lack of artistic abilities keeps me from utilizing it to the fullest.
B009LDCZDC|1.0|I love this show;  the plotlines and acting are superb!  The  picture quality of these discs are good; the problem is that whoever put these discs together should be fired!  I put these discs into my Bluray and press the button to play and nothing happens for what seems an eternity!!  There's no loading screen, so you just keep pressing buttons, thinking nothing happened!  Then when it finally does start playing, I get commercials that I can't skip!  I buy these discs, so I don't have to watch commercials!!  Also, where's my digital copy??  All of the other shows (True Blood, Game of Thrones, etc.)  I buy come with both digital copies and intelligently designed functions on their discs, such as loading screens and easily accessible root menus.  Most of them also have extra features, like commentaries, etc.  These are just bare bones, like I bought some cheap DVD!  Get into the 21st century, disc designers!!
B005LAIIN0|4.0|This movie IS NOT THE BOOK, (very, very good read it), but don't let that deter you from enjoying it.  The zombies move too fast, the infection is too \\"instant.\\"  But  this film is way excellent in its own right.  Everyone in it is wonderful.  Brad Pitt is beyond awesome!  This is an  A List film based on a C list version of an A list book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great Show!!! They use Clean story lines.... They have created a very Dynamic and Interesting plot.... Very creative to look at the same issues from both the family and the staff...
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is one of the most helpful apps to let you know just exactly how much time you have left on the life of the battery. I especially like the Way it displays the time left in the tray at the bottom.
B0030BYWHS|5.0|A great album, particularly on vinyl. Somber/melancholy/etc. Deserves more words but, alas, I don't have more to provide at this time.
B00EMJD6TC|5.0|I read World War Z twice before in book form, and wondered how the broad, &#34;after the fact&#34; interview idea could be reduced to accommodate the movie format...the answere is, stunningly well !!! Marc Forster, of whom I have been a fan since his beautiful film &#34;Stay&#34;, crafts the story around a central character who is given the task of figuring out how to fight back against a very scary and unrelenting enemy. Brad Pitt sells it big time, and the action is nonstop, but maintains a sense of purpose throuout the movie. The unrated version is like a roller coaster ride with a 4 minute climb to the top, and a 2 hour, &#34;hold on for dear life&#34; plummet to the end...I highly recommend it !!
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|liked the slow motion scenes.it looked great in hi def also. i have watched it 3 or 4 times more.
B00CL68QVQ|1.0|We watched it... But I couldn't enjoy it because NONE of the characters were remotely likable. Bradley Cooper is nice to look at, but...
B0011UJMK2|4.0|I liked this book.  The plot is pretty straight forward.  In the famine ravaged Soviet Union, the government decries that there is no such thing as serial killers.  The problem is that there is.  The old war hero is tapped to investigate the death of a child much to his dismay.  Unfortunately this death is the work of a horrible serial killer.  The rest of the story is for you to figure out.  This is very reminiscent of real like serial killer Andre Chikitilo.  I am not sure if he is the basis for this work but it parallels his life rather closely.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|It is not often you have to pause a movie but we had to several times in order ot to miss anything.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I have always been interested in learning more about the hermit Kingdom of the DPRK.  If you want to know how bad a human life can be, you must read this book.  The main character in this book is the only known human being to be born in and subsequently successfully escape from one of North Korea's hard labor camp.  In these camps, humans lose their humanity. Reading this will make you feel like the main character is simply a lower life form going through the process of life.  It is a harrowing journey and a good book.
B00EEN7CAK|2.0|This movie was disappointing it moved at snail pace and did not hold anybodies attention. I was very disappointed.Certainly a rental not a to own.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|I really enjoyed this. It was my first time using the Amazon Prime with my Iphone. Loved it!<br />caper film, romance, bullets.. something for all
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|Very enjoyable adventure game. Different type of story line. Not a ton of HO games,but good mini puzzles. I bought the full game and am not a bit sorry. Playing on a Kindle Fire HD and the game is playing over smoothly. Thanks G5 for this great game.
B0023ZLI42|5.0|This is a must have book for anyone who really wants to grasp the musical theory as it applies to guitar playing. The book does not use the traditional approach to musical theory training nor do I believe it is a good book to learn music theory as it relates to other musical instruments. However, because of the unique tuning of the guitar, (1-E, 2-B, 3-G, 4-D, 5-A, 6-E) this book is fantastic for beginners and intermediate level guitar players of all genres. In particular, learning and committing to memory the CAGED system will be worth your while as all other cords and scales are derivatives of these five basic forms. That been said. I strongly suggest you buy this book and keep it around you whenever you are practicing your guitar playing.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|The thing I love the most about North and South is that the characters are so real.  They're like ordinary people.  This is definitely a family favorite.  BBC sure comes out with great stuff! The story and acting is quality.  I think this film teaches values that people have lost over the years.  I would definitely recommend this show for family enjoyment.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|I enjoyed the movie and all the special features.  It is comedic and pinky makes sure to break the 4th wall.  there are even cute derpy pictures for the credits
B005PK57IK|5.0|I have gotten hooked on this show.  I could easily watch several episodes in a row it I didnt limit  myself to one per night.  Amazon just included season 4 with Prime now that season 5 should be starting.  Well written and produced
1476734941|4.0|I saw the documentary on PBS on this doctor/writer and was intrigued.  Not long after emplementing the practice of intermittent fasting, I quickly lost 10 pounds!  It's just a little uncomfortable to begin but you do get used to fasting.  I recently had a blood test while being on this program a mere 6 weeks and I was amazed and pleased at my new healthy blood numbers!
0395389496|5.0|Love this book, have read it for years to my kids and now my grandkids love it also.<br />Has a great message for those ages of children questioning Santa Claus
B00973902K|4.0|My daughter wanted this one, so I downloaded it and it is good.  She plays it all the time on her MP3 player
B00785P2QC|4.0|I'd lke this better if it showed how much each building cost instead of just having to wing it. also, posting to fb is annoying. When I want people to know what I'm doing, I tell them. When I want them to play I call them.
B00EQNYOYU|4.0|1. \\"The Eater of Dreams\\"  0:52 eat this.....<br />2. \\"Copy of A\\"  5:23 makes sense...copy copy...kinda weird but good<br />3. \\"Came Back Haunted\\"  5:17 the hit, growing on me ...the end of it come back ha ha unted?...not sure about this......ahhh<br />4. \\"Find My Way\\"  5:16 5 Stars...great song BEST..BEST SONG HERE FOLKS!!!<br />5. \\"All Time Low\\"  6:18 4 plus stars..great beat EXPLICT.....finally TRENT...getting soft???<br />6. \\"Disappointed\\"  5:44 yes it kinda is okay..maybe disappointed a little<br />7. \\"Everything\\"  3:20 very different..Is that Lenny Kravitz?

B009XIXVU6|5.0|The way this author weaves a story is a wonderful reading experience.  Each character is as complex as the next and each life experience is excruciatingly sad yet overcomes all odds.  The experience of reading this book echoes in my psyche for days.
0307719774|3.0|I think this is a great idea. My observation is that the questions are pretty light weight; I was looking for prompts that would make me think.  Also, be aware, this is a very small volume, (although thick), the writing area is extremely limited.<br /><br />Good gift for a girl in high school.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|It's pretty cool. I wish the game had more hints though. I'm the kind who needs a lot of help.
B002KGEORM|5.0|Love this show. Signed up for Prime just so I could go through and watch every season from the beginning.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think that you should make a free version for people that don't want to spend the money on getting the app but it is a great app
B00800WIK2|1.0|I don't know how they say this works with the iPhone 5.<br />It certainly does NOT!<br />The iPhone 5 is too tall for this device and has the new smaller jack on the bottom of it.<br />This device has the older bigger jack like my iPhone 4 did.<br />Again don't buy this if you have an iPhone 5.<br />You'll be returning it like I am...
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|In some ways I like Chris Eckelson's Doctor better than David Tennant's. Please don't get me wrong I like David Tennant's doctor but I would have liked to have seen this doctor grow over at least a couple of seasons. Still it was an excellent kick start to a series reboot
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This movie is now one of my favorite two Star Trek movies. Both of my favorites are the two new movies and I have been a fan since 1967! ;) I am very happy with the movie, but not so happy with Amazon since I have yet to receive my digital copy.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I received my ChromeCast earlier this week and with great excitement unwrapped it right away.  Setup was very easy, simply plus it into the HDMI port and in my case I used a USB port for power.  When I tried to configure it from my PC it failed the first time, but I told it to try again without changing anything and it worked no problem at all.  Trying out the supported apps worked great, but the reason I bought it was to stream Amazon Prime movies to a TV that doesn't have an Internet or WiFi connection.  Unfortunately this is where the bad news starts.  While I can Cast from a Chrome browser in general, Amazon Prime uses Silverlight which appears is not supported yet.  When I cast the tab I see everything on the tab except the video itself.  Hopefully Amazon will support casting directly, both to simply allow me to watch Amazon Movies on the ChromeCast but also because direct support will perform better than streaming through the PC.<br /><br />Edit...<br />Great advice from a reply to my original post.  Uninstalling Silverlight from the PC forces Amazon Prime to use Flash and that will Cast to the TV.  Still looking forward to native ChromeCast support for better resolution and performance.
B0081JPTCQ|3.0|This was good to use for some things. I ecspecially liked being able to write in ur own handwriting and the highlighter pen. There want enough templates though and it would be awesome if u could make ur own template cause that would solve the problem plus make so many more options. It also wouldn't let me download pics even though i got the app u needed to do it. Plus when I tried to put in a shape from their selection after a while i couldnt change the size and when i tried to it was just a text box. This app was free when I got it so Its worth downloading cause its free but u should never pay for this app
B007TNS6JI|3.0|Good game for burning some time, a bit repetitive but what isn't these days. Standard linear advancement, simplistic combat, meaningless reward system etc.
B001DL14HI|5.0|One of their best albums in years, if you like Master of Puppets you will like this album!!! Buy it!
B00ATPVA78|4.0|Graphics are great. Rather tedious dialogue panels. It is the hunt for useful objects and the puzzles that make this a fun game.
B009E3EYS8|5.0|They finally released a full show without forcing me to get their concerts through other means in NYC. You can find everything in NYC!<br />This concert proves they still show their might and its too bad they had to break up because of someone's alcohol problem. When the Levee breaks 2005 New Orleans, mama you better run. There ain't no denying...
B005K17RU0|3.0|The screens are way too busy to be useful; they are cluttered and monochromatic to be easily read. The maps are pretty standard.  The Accuweather videos are a nice touch, however.
B002IVLH60|3.0|not like the early 90's stuff but I'm a true fan. Hope to see them at Barclay's Center Brooklyn, NY
B00EY8A6BC|2.0|This movie was ok. It was a bit of a hard sell with all the magic that frankly was not believable. I think the idea behind this film was great. However the execution lacked conviction.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|THIS is a typical great Reacher Novel. Once again Lee Child never disappoints us.<br />Good read, hard to put down.
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|If noise, intense action and violent behavior are what you envision for entertainment, this is your movie. Terminator here we come. If you’re aware scientific study has discovered even chimps know bad behavior from good and in their form of “society” will ostracize those with bad behavior, you’re unlikely to find entertainment with any redeeming value in this film. “Star Trek Into Darkness” is truly “dark”.<br /><br />Even the cool headed, thinking Spock expresses the worst of human traits; an ability to be narrow minded enough to act only on what stimulates our most primitive instincts. Uncontrolled lust, greed and violence as the easy solution to achieve whatever we want. This film is anti Gene Roddenberry; television screenwriter, producer and futurist; the visionary of Star Trek nearly a half century ago.<br /><br />What’s wrong?<br />“Into Darkness” has all the earmarks of making a fast buck for those who can profit from sales; beginning with a pathetically poor job of linking the present storyline and script to former Star Trek programs. It’s a cheap shot to mirror-image snippets of old Star Trek TV episodes or moves. It’s cheap to use former program’s music to make a connection instead of reflecting the original intent to utilize media to show what can be the best in humanity instead of the worst.<br /><br />Captain Kirk violating the “Prime Directive” because it suits him (intentionally interfering in a society); having no connection to an urgent United Federation of Planets crisis or their council. Spock pummeling an opponent after they are down and no longer an imminent threat; Kirk ignoring the advice of his primary staff because it suits his personal purpose and Spock brought to emotion over a colleague because they saved his life “a week ago”; not because of a bond that developed over years of close association, gained respect and friendship; all represent abandonment of the intended Star Trek heritage Gene Rodenberryenvisioned.<br /><br />It’s not the first abandonment of that heritage, but by far the most blatant effort to do nothing more than cash in on the general public. Star Trek wasn’t intended to be a 007 style action series. It made an attempt in a TV environment chock full of “entertain the average general public mentality of a 6-year old” via primitive sets, marginal acting and second-rate scripts to instead utilize TV’s media-domination for a positive cultural outcome. It recognized the ability of media to be a positive cultural influence through storytelling and became “Star Trek” because of an effort to reflect an improving human society.<br /><br />I’m not commenting about a film to preach good and evil, but I do recognize junk from uplifting, exciting entertainment. Star Trek originally gathered momentum because we all are instinctively aware of the difficult struggle humanity engages in to make progress beyond our more primitive relatives. It’s an epic story that should be told over and over. Star Trek programming has often attempted to reflect this epic uplifting, exciting story. This film doesn’t cut it. It’s an unfulfilling story with junk distractions based on cheap noise, intense action and violence. In addition to promoting anti-social traits, it implies that not putting dangerous sociopaths on trial is their just fate. Instead, preserve them so they can again be given the gift of life to wreak havoc on future generations. Or, we might someday need genius psychopaths to rescue humankind from extinction.<br /><br />Specifically, in the vernacular of the film I say, “Dark This”.

0525478817|5.0|When I first started this book, I was unable to put it down, not because it had an exhilarating plot like The Hunger Games, but because John Green gives us characters that we are immediately attached to, and we fall in love with their sarcastic and melancholy life. A great story and I highly recommend it to any young adult reader.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Gillian Flynn excels in depicting flawed, even terrifying characters from inside.  They are not black and white caricatures, but complex, messy, contradictory, and very real and memorable.  Very worth reading.

My husband died in 1977 and someone told me about Life After Life by Raymond Moody and Elizabeth Kuebler Ross's books which I read and got a lot of comfort.  Both of these authors are mentioned in this book.  I have also read 90 Minutes in Heaven and Heaven is for Real.  I was drawn to this book because of his scientific background.  I have always had a strong faith but this book just cemented it for me.

B00F6NKFQK|5.0|\\"Let's Conquer Paris\\" by Oleg Medvedkov is a delightful collection of funny stories that sparkle with wit, intelligence, and a keen ability to see the bizarre in everyday life that few writers have. Oleg Medvedkov is one of those rare writers.<br /><br />It was the Roman poet Ovid who created minotaur, a creature that's \\"part man and part bull,\\" and placed him at the center of the Cretan Labyrinth. But it took Oleg Medvedkov's wild sense humor to give this mythical creature a desire to exercise and a need for more matches. Of course, that makes sense. It must be lonely and dark in that labyrinth! And if that's not enough, the famed minotaur becomes a tour guide for visitors to Greece. You'll have to read the story to find out how that job opportunity worked out for him.<br /><br />Oleg knows how to play with language and does it exceptionally well. The readers may not think twice about a common expression \\"to sit on laurels\\" until Oleg questions the whole idea of sitting \\"on vegetation.\\" Suddenly, that common expression is not so solemn and dignified anymore. In Oleg's book, the concept of \\"disconnecting the Internet connection\\" involves garden shears, popular limericks become goulash recipes, and paramour and paramount get mixed up in a hilarious way.<br /><br />I've learned quite a few things about Greek history from this book, too, such as that the fall of Troy was partially caused by a malfunctioning can of beans combined with the act of petting \\"a giant horsey,\\" that one of the chief concerns of Zeus were high drowning rates in Greece, that Romans tweeted in Latin, and that Goddess Athena was a marketing genius. No wonder olive oil from Greece is still popular today. It all make sense now, at least in the context of the bizarre, fascinating, and fun world that Oleg has created for his readers.<br /><br />But it's not all Greek in this book. We have giant squirrels as part of a complicated plan to revise history, the Large Hadron Collider that gets filled with cabernet during a wild party hosted by the French President, body parts that undergo complicated transactions to make use of the quantum physics principles, and a Jeopardy Game that involves tiny ninjas bearing sage advice.<br /><br />Every page of this entertaining and intelligent book is filled with fun, wit, and wild experiences that only Oleg can create. Highly recommended.abernet during a wild party hosted by the French President, body parts that undergo complicated transactions to make use of the quantum physics principles, and a Jeopardy Game that involves tiny ninjas bearing sage advice.<br /><br />Every page of this entertaining and intelligent book is filled with fun, wit, and wild experiences that only Oleg can create.

B009KUWWW0|4.0|This book like most of Follett,s book make you think and remember a vast amount of characters. The intermingling of facts and fiction brings to life the middle ages and the struggle of getting most things done.  Plan to read his next book, The Pillars of the Earth.

Have not unlocked the full version ...yet??? $4.99 seems a bit steep. I will see after I play the full free trial.
B0089LOMJC|3.0|I followed The Who for years, and really didn't know much about Pete Townshend. His writing is ok and I got through the book. I guess I'm not supposed to review his life and his beliefs but I didn't come away thinking he's a great guy. He didn't win me over in his book writing. Sometimes questions are better left unanswered.

B00B0X4PIO|3.0|I have had gone through the previous books of Hussaini and liked them however this one somewhat could not come up to the expectations bar he put for himself. There have been extra and somewhat boring characters in novel. The language and word used for picturization of events and characters are repetetive - squinting and sqattering are used quite often and to some extent unnecessarily. I hope to read a better one from Hussaini next time!

0812550706|3.0|I've met this author. He's a very nice man. I love his historical fiction. I hope Wives of Isreal gets published soon. That's the title of the book Mr. Card told me would follow Rachel and Leah and that was in 2005.<br />In the meantime I figured I'd better read this book, since Mr. Card told us at the 2005 signing that Hollywood had come calling to make it into a movie which is finally set to be released in November 2013 according to IMDB. No rush, right?<br />Should make a very interesting movie and come in under budget since 99% of the book occurs indoors or on video screens. I hope Asa Butterfield can play a convincing character who is clearly suffering a Messiah complex.<br />As for my impression of the book I agree with another review that a good story doesn't have to rely on content or fancy writing. I also agree that Card's lack of any strong female characters brings my rating down to just three stars but I don't read much sci-fi.<br />The biggest disappointment was the ending. We get to what is supposed to be the climax, the big payoff, the reason every male in the 21st century would be lost without their X-box and...it was all happening in real time. Game Over. We won. Here's your prize money, Ender, have a great life. The groans you hear in the movie theatre will have nothing to do with gay rights. I find myself not even caring and am left with no incentive to read any sequels that follow and I'm in no rush to see the movie. The book has such a build-up to the climax. I was looking forward to a big human vs. alien dogfight in space but I guess Card didn't want to pay royalties to George Lucas.
B004KA9UX4|5.0|I found this book to be a great self learning guide through the subject matter.  I think I'm a better musician because of the new understanding I've gained from this text.  Levine doesn't skip out on any detail.  I can understand why it's so popular.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|Great human/animal interest story.  It's gratifying to read how the human spirit prevails and how the animal spirit opens up to love and companion ship - both of which creates healing and deep love in both.  It also helps the story that &#34;Bob&#34; is a very unusual cat!

0446310786|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is a timeless classic that everyone should read once in their lives. As we grow older, the ideas and issues discussed in To Kill a Mockingbird are still occuring today. We are constantly faced with injustice- and as human beings, we must face the injustice and overcome it. The novel shows students that ignoring injustice and having prejudice toward others is not ideal. Rather, fighting for justice and knowing the good in others is important.<br />The beautiful, innocent nature of the novel brings out a positivity we know is hidden within ourselves.

B00F6N4GGK|5.0|Here we have a book written by a thirteen year old. Before you click away, read a little further--the value of this book is not in the novelty of being written by a middle-schooler. It's in what he wrote.<br /><br />\\"Problem Cousin and Other Funny Stories\\" by Alex Goodwin is a collection of humorous stories. Granted, the first story, \\"The Grocery Store,\\" does smack a little of \\"Spongebob,\\" but as you read on to the later pieces, you realize that this young man has a strong grasp not only on a written word, but on that rare quality of writing prose that makes people laugh. If you think it's easy, try it yourself. Also, a note to any writers who'll happen to read this book: This is how the dialog should be written. There's nothing extra, and it's always clear who is speaking. As a book critic, I suffer needlessly with the exact opposite on a daily basis; get with the program people.<br /><br />The book follows (mis-) adventures of Billy and Bob. Sometimes Bob's titular cousin, Billy-Bob is also on the scene. \\"The Bosses,\\" who are mysterious employers of Billy's, and who prefer to communicate with our two heroes remotely, also make an appearance periodically. Out of one-off characters, I think my favorite is Dark Citrus, \\"a tangerine that was half-demonic and half-epic.\\"<br /><br />The writing style is easy and compact. Sometimes, the \\"narrator\\" makes an appearance, mostly to make fun of some of writing clich&eacute;s:<br /><br />\\"Just as the two thought all hope was lost, a miracle happened. No, just kidding. He-he, I got your hopes up. Back to the story.\\"<br /><br />...Or:<br /><br />\\"Hey, I don't want to hear any negative comments on this. I wanted to have a happy ending for once.\\"<br /><br />This book made me laugh many times as I was reading it. And I mean \\"laugh,\\" not just smirk in my usual condescending way. Considering that there were only a few other books that I've read this year that did the same, I would say it makes for the price of admission, despite a few rough edges. So, after you finished installing a doggy door for your imaginary pets and fishing out bills, pipebombs, and death threats from your junk mail, give this book a read. Recommended.h edges.

B00F6N4GGK|5.0|Problem Cousin and Other Funny Stories is the debut book by Alex Goodwin, a 13-year-old! And he's done a great job! I wish I'd started writing books at thirteen, instead of whatever I was doing at the time (it was a long time ago). And that's my point, you don't need to be a teenager to enjoy these amusing stories. He got many hearty laughs from me and I smiled through the whole book. Problem Cousin is good medicine for any stress that is distracting you.<br /><br />Goodwin's bio says he is a writer with a passion for getting some laughs and it shows. The book is funny and as any writer knows, getting humor off the page is hard, much more difficult than getting tears. Everyone should read this book because it'll make you feel better. It will do what it's meant to do . . . amuse you, but don't be surprised if you are also inspired the accomplishment of a 13-year-old.<br /><br />The two main characters (not counting the clever narrator) Bob Bobinson and Billy Boogendoodle are a couple of goofballs and I hope we get to read more of their \\"adventures\\" in a sequel. Speaking of adventures, the author \\"feels like he might be a little too young to go and take on the world.\\" Maybe, but he's made a fine start with this book.<br /><br />This is a fast and easy read. This author (did I mention he's thirteen!) has a bright future. And, as he says, \\"Since I'm tired of writing for today, I'm just going to say that they lived happily for a few days.\\"

B00F6NKFQK|5.0|There is a line at the very beginning of the book, \\"When you exclude the improbable, whatever is left, is not as hilarious,\\" but it's not true. Let's Conquer Paris and Other Funny Stories by Oleg Medvedkov is filled with so much off beat humor, sly observations, absurd stories and just plain funny stuff that no matter how you slice it, there is plenty of \\"hilarious!\\" Let's Conquer Paris is the second book I've read from this author and it makes you wish you could get invited to a party where he would also be a guest. There are at least five earlier books in the Lunch Break Funnies, Humor Book series, but they can be enjoyed in any order and one without the other.<br /><br />The stories within this collection play like inside jokes with one another. \\"Time Machine,\\" is worth the whole book - it starts - \\"I'll be the first to admit-mistakes were made. When we found the time machine, we all thought it would be awesome. The things we could do. Even Frankie \\"Five Fingers\\" was on board, if I remember. His exact phrase was \\"Fellers, I want to push dis button. Can I?\\" Good times. Now let's trace back the timeline and see what went wrong.\\"<br />This collection gets its title from<br />one of my favorite stories in the book and I hope this quote isn't a spoiler but it keeps making me laugh, \\"If any of you tweeps have other ideas on why we should take Paris, please keep them to yourselves. I like things to be simple.\\"<br /><br />The thing that makes Medvedkov's books so addicting is how quirky and unusual the stories are. I've never read anything quite like his style. Parts of it remind me of something out of MAD Magazine, blended with Monty Python, but smarter, wittier and a bit more askew. It's great fun! And in the middle of the laughs, one discovers actual characters who aren't as simple as they may first appear. \\"Seriously, a guy with horns gets no respect.\\" With those wonderful characters and all the humor, I wasn't surprised to find satire and thought provoking depth, because, as I said, I've read Medvedkov's work before. Now, I'm going to pick up another book from his Lunch Break Funnies, Humor Book series, because as I noted earlier, they are addicting.<br />5-starscause, as I said, I've read Medvedkov's work before.

B00ESY7QXI|4.0|The visuals and cinematography are typically Baz Luhrmann, with the almost cartoonish feeling of a fable.  Dicaprio's interpretation of the title character was great, and the narrative by Toby Maguire as Nick Calloway was excellent.

B00EY8BRGU|5.0|My 11 year old son and I agree on something and that is that this movie is good old fashioned fun. I know the magic tricks are overblown a bit but this is a movie concerning magicians, not a documentary about magic. Well acted and with visuals that are incredible. If you are looking to be entertained this is a solid choice. At the end of the movie you'll be cheering for the characters. Have some fun!

B004YW4L5K|5.0|I have known about Neil GAiman for a long time, and I have tried to read the comic book Sandman more than once, but it didn't grab me right off.  Then, I heard him on an interview on The Nerdist Podcast, where he talked about writing an episode of Dr Who, which I had also JUST gotten into at the time.  I watched the episode, and it instantly became one of my favorites.  \\"The only water in the forest is the river\\"!  Whether he wrote that, or they put that in to foreshadow future events, it doesn't matter, because it was still amazing.<br /><br />What was I talking about?<br /><br />Oh yeah, so I heard the interview, and he was great, and funny, and interesting.  So I thought I would give one of his books a shot.  It just so happened that American Gods was on sale for $2.99 at that time, so I gave it a shot.<br /><br />It is the story of Shadow, and the role that he plays in the role of the war of the Old Gods vs the New Gods.  Having been released early from jail because his wife was killed, he doesn't have any purpose in life anymore, so when a man named Wednesday offers him a job to help him fight a war, he takes it.  From there, they go across the country, recruiting the Old Gods into their war against the upstart New Gods.<br /><br />This book is amazing.  It takes you from one end of the country to another, stopping in out of the way places that are fascinating to read about.  Gaiman can really paint a picture of locations, which is helpful, because the whole crux of the book centers around traveling across America.  He paints a great picture.<br /><br />I love stories with a twist, and this one has three or four major ones.  I won't spoil any of them (because I'm not a jerk), but the one that has to do with the elephant is one of the best twists I have seen in a long time.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anybody that really likes fantasy, or has any interest in theology or American history, or fairy tales, or road trips.  Basically I would recommend it to anyone that likes books, and good things.t to anyone that likes books, and good things.

Not sure what the problem is or why...but I'm reluctant to try to order again.  Amazon had it &#34;off&#34; the buy list for awhile...maybe the problem is solved now.  As a note, It WOULD play on my computer, but not on my Blue-ray, 3-D, very new DVD player...no explanation for that difference. The War in the Pacific series plays perfectly...and appears to be from the same supplier.  Just saying all this as a word of caution...

B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I love anything Star Trek, and this was no exception.  This was a clever, well made movie.  Their choice of actor for Khan really threw me.  He looked like a graduate from a prep school in England.  Oh, he was very evil alright....absolutely wicked to the bottom of his feet.  Someone with brilliant blue eyes like his is not going to be named Khan Noonien Singh though.<br /><br />Of course we all think of the original Khan in Star Trek, but just the name begs for a different appearance.  Wasn't Genghis Khan a Mongolian?  Isn't the name Singh Asian Indian?  Could we have have had someone who had more of that look?  Or would it be politically incorrect these days so you have to have someone that looks like they would model Burberry coats?
B00BEIYOHC|5.0|First of all, let me just say that The Conjuring, Insidious, and Insidious Chapter 2 are all very effective and well-done horror movies. James Wan is on a roll, and honestly, so is Patrick Wilson because he is the common denominator in all 3 of these movies. Quite frankly, in my opinion, it is thanks to these movies that have successfully breathed life back into the horror genre. This is refreshing after sitting around for the last decade and a half watching campy, slasher, gory, and extremely bloody so-called scary movies that have left me nothing but disappointed and anything but scared. I was wondering when Hollywood was going to realize that tons of blood splatter is just like any other over-used effect; there's nothing really that special about it. I'm not sitting on the edge of my seat wondering what's going to happen next if I can already expect a masked killer, a home invasion, tons of teen sex and drug use, contraptions of torture, or a documentary-style horror film that looks like someone just grabbed a video camera, took it into a dark backyard or the woods, cut on the night-vision, and relied on heavy breathing and running away from unseen forces to move the audience. All of that is lazy, mundane, and it shows lack of creativity as well as originality. I am sick to death of that crap. As a horror movie buff, I thought it was virtually impossible to make a scary movie these days, or at least try to make a movie that pushes the envelope a little bit...dare to be different if you will! I know there isn't much that many of us can say we haven't seen before, but how it's executed is what's important in my book.<br /><br />This movie starts right at the end of the first one (smart move). The audience is thrust right back into the evil that is STILL following the Lamberts from the first film (another smart move). If you want to keep me interested in something; please don't ignore the film's predecessors just to make money. Those films still have merit, and havelaid the foundation for what comes next. Anyway, it's clear that there's still a murder to be solved (another smart move), and there's something seriously off about Josh. The film also includes more interaction with the Lambert children this time around. The dead spirits are more aggressive, so it's clear they aren't there to mess around.<br /><br />This movie also didn't drag around for the first 40 minutes like the first film did. However, what I loved most about this movie is that it answers all your questions about the previous film (gigantic smart move). Nothing from the first movie is what it seems. I'm so glad this movie didn't start off with an entirely different entity before they expounded on what the first one was in its entirety. I wanted to know the story. I had already figured out the ending from the first film that some overlooked because they were so focused on the music and the look of the red-faced demon. The fact of the matter is that the target never was the little boy; the target was the dad all along. The child was just being held hostage and used to lure the dad back into the Further so the dead spirit that almost had him while he was a child could successfully take his body which was originally intended. The boy was the bait. Don't get me wrong, the red-faced demon with the hooves was going to take the boy's body too; he just wasn't the primary focus. Red face was just ensuring Dalton stayed out long enough to be possessed as well. I don't think some people got that; it was a win/win situation for both entities who wished to live again. Knowing that, it all makes perfect sense.<br /><br />I don't want to give too much of this movie away, but you will be surprised to see what this thing is that has been following Josh since his childhood which just shows how tenacious and persistent these entities can be. It also gives you more insight into how deep Josh's gift of astral projection really runs. Josh and Dalton's out-of-body experiences play an interesting role in this movie, and adds something a little different into the mix instead of a typical family battling the paranormal. I appreciate that! Dalton proves to be quite useful and clever in this one, and he handles his gift like a seasoned pro. I had to mention Ty Simpkins because he did great in both films.<br /><br />This movie is just like The Conjuring in the sense that there is something for everybody and it plays on your worst fears:<br />Afraid of the closet...check!<br />Afraid of the dark...check!<br />Afraid of the things that go bump in the night...check!<br />Afraid of ghosts, possession, and dead demonic spirits...check!<br />Afraid of harm coming to your children...check!<br />Afraid of being a prisoner in your own body and your home...check!<br /><br />My suggestion is that you have to see this movie at least once.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Could not tear myself away once I started Season 1. Can't wait for Season 4 to start .Counting the days .
B00003CX8N|5.0|One of my favorites movies and Anne Bancroft is fenomenal actress , a simple story with so much to think of,
B005D9MUWY|2.0|I don't like it because it asks for too much information in the agreement, it's not necessary at all in my opinion
B0047WJ12K|5.0|Excellent movie, riveting. A must see, again and again. A great movie to add to your collection.A good supporting cast.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the characters but it left me wanting more from Christian's point of view. I got a little confused during the end when the story would jump around though, but maybe it is this Kindle AP. Look forward to the next chapter.
B001D5F3US|5.0|This is a great compilation cd.  I purchased it for my wife who loves Van's music as much as I do.  The list of songs is good especially since his career has spanned so many decades with so many hits and great songs.  A must have for a serious music collection. My cat Sammy gave it a 4 paws up and she is a very discerning audiophile!
B009GX69RK|5.0|This show is continuously smart, funny and all around fun. I look forward to watching it every week! Love it!
B005723JSQ|2.0|I wish I would have never started reading this book. It's silly in the most unfunny way. It's written to appeal to women who still believe the end to their fairy tales must include a man.<br /><br />It's vastly predictable - almost condescendingly so. About half way through I began to feel as though my intelligence and womanhood were being trod upon. I would be less critical of this book only if it turned out to have been written by a misogynistic man, rather than a successful female writer. Disappointing.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|I've never been a fan of Tom Cruise but the man can act. Oblivion is a good example of that. It started amazing: the plot is fresh, new, innovative, nothing we've seen before. I was extremely thankful for the novelty factor. The visuals are highly engaging and well done. The pacing is just right. Not too slow, but it also doesn't jump right in without any information on the background.<br />I won't discuss the plot because others have done that already. Let's just say, it's worth buying the DVD. I know I'll watch it again in the near future, not least because the acting was outstanding and the twists were nothing I expected.<br />What I didn't like was the ending. It was too...much. I won't say what it is so I won't spoil it for those who haven't watched the movie but I wish the directors/producers/writers didn't go overboard with it because it could have been a five-star movie.<br />Still enjoyable though and a solid three stars.
B001974DG0|5.0|I loves this book when I was in High School now my daughter read it for a book report and couldn't put it down.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book was one of the best I have read lately, it kept me making time so that I could read it.
B0090SI4LU|5.0|I have read everything Stephanie Meyer and find when her characters are brought to the screen that it enhances what I have read.  It is certainly a new twist on ideas.  It is unique in that there is right and wrong and reason and cooperation.  Not just good and bad or wright and wrong but maybe a meeting go the minds in a new way.  I do hope you read the book first.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|As a huge fan of the series, season 10 did not disappoint. One of the few DVDs I purchase faithfully.
B00BOXZAJ8|5.0|This is certainly a star crossed love story told in the most unusual was.  Loved the actors and the whole crazy idea of this movie.  Who would have the courage to attempt this?  And you find yourself hoping and cheering them on.

B001XUIBNO|5.0|One of the best. Jack Nicholson is wonderfully dry. Faye Dunaway is great. Can't see this one only once. Wow
B00A7W29BE|5.0|This app has proven itself to be extremely useful and helped me in quite a few situations. Scans are clear and the UI is simple to use. Picked it up when it was FAOTD but it's definitely worth the price and a must-have.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Okay..it took me nearly two hours to get the hang of what was happening. And yes, I am going to buy the dvd and watch over and over till I understand all (rather like Matrix).  In a nutshell...we are all connected, and the past/future and present are all connected. What we have done in the past influences the now, that will predict the future.<br /><br />Once I understood that, it all made sense. But I do need to watch again to get all the nuances. This is a thinking film, like Matrix. Not a shoot them up and walk away. This will stay w you.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Original, well written, and very well acted, &#34;Suits&#34; is one of my favorite shows ever. I can see why it is very popular.

B00BRUYQFC|5.0|GREAT ALBUM.... Always been a huge fan of JT... Love all the cool mellow but at the same time up beat sounds of the songs. Pusher Girl, Tunnel Vision, and Mirrors are my favorites. All in all it's a great album.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|Especially during part two! Cannot wait to see the movie. Enjoy books that have me thinking about them even when the book is waiting to be picked up and read more.
B003VDZK8K|4.0|A7X doin what they do. They have moved from metalcore to hard rock almost seemlessly. Their musicianship is always spot on and lyrics and vocals bold enough to back it up. Hooray good music!
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|Okay, as you can tell by the title I don't care much for Tom Cruise. However, he either took acting lessons or Morgan Freeman helped him out. This is an excellent movie that surprised me! I'm not going to spoil it, but I am going to say that there are parts of this movie that will have you saying &#34;no way!&#34;<br /><br />The acting is superb, the story is refreshing, and the action will leave you excited.
B008602KQI|5.0|A beginning to a great series of movies.  I loved the books and can't wait for the second movie to come out!
B008469DGY|5.0|Addictive, can't stop playing! Very fun and challenging. May have to stop playing real golf! These guys need to make a baseball game too!
B00EPL4PBK|5.0|There have been a lot of concerns regarding if this album is truly in the Acenged Sevenfold style.  I feel this album is the inevitable maturing of A7X's style.  There are quite a few songs that bridge the gap between Nightmare and Hail to the King. Overall,  I think this is a great album and represents the maturing sound of Avenged Sevenfold.

0307730700|5.0|\\"As a rule, we don't endorse books or movies or anything regarding the command where I work--and Adam Brown worked--but as the author writes in Fearless, `you have to know the rules, so you know when to bend or break them.' This is one of those times.  Read this book. Period. It succeeds where all the others have failed.\\"  --Anonymous SEAL Team SIX Operator<br /><br />FearlessIf you have any lingering interest in the modern military and how it wages war, it is hard to ignore an endorsement like that. And of course SEAL Team Six is now well-known as the group who finally got Osama Bin Laden, an event that happens after this book's narrative arc. Yet Fearless is so much more than a military book; it is a story about redemption, sacrifice, heroism, and ultimately faith and its power to endure. The strongest compliment I can give this book is to say that Adam Brown's life, what he overcame and what he willingly did, is something that will haunt me for some time.<br /><br />Author Eric Blehm resists the urge to start Adam's story where so many other Navy Seal books have begun- at BUD/S (Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL). He starts at the true beginning, with a boy from Hot Springs, Arkansas. A boy, who we learn right from the start, was fearless, much to his parents' dismay. From family stories about needing to cut the legs off of his crib so that when he inevitably escaped, the fall wouldn't be so hard, to leaping off of his parent's roof as a kid, or out of a moving car and off of a bridge in high school, we are left with no doubt that Adam was one of those rare adrenaline junkies who constantly push themselves and those around them. But Adam was more than just a dare devil, he was also the boy who would stand up to bullies who outweighed him by fifty pounds, and who would ask the developmentally-delayed girl to dance at the prom when he thought she looked lonely. It is hard not to like him and wish you had known him then.<br /><br />As entertaining and endearing as reading about Adam's childhood exploits is, the real drama of Fearless begins after his high school graduation. It is at this point that his life takes a drastic turn for the worse. While most of his high school friends go off to college, Adam only lasts one semester, and in that short time really loses his way. Alcohol, marijuana and a sense of pointless drifting lead him to eventually take up residence in the crack houses on the edge of town. Blehm does such a great job making you like Adam throughout those first few chapters that this portion of the book is hard to read. You find yourself alternately feeling bad for him, then wanting to strangle him for what he is doing to himself and to his family.<br /><br />However, it is from this place of ultimate depravity that Adam Brown's life finds its purpose. Through friends who just won't give up, parents who apply tough love, even though it nearly rips them apart to do so, to a local pastor who shows him a way out, Adam finds himself going from a jail cell to a place that offers his last chance at hope: Teen Challenge. This Christian faith-based program provides drug and alcohol rehabilitation services to people of all ages completely free of charge. (Full disclosure: this is my family's primary charity, and I have seen what kind of changes this program can produce. Suffice to say this only added to the book's appeal for me.)<br /><br />While Adam's struggles with addiction will continue for many years, this was his turning point. Soon after graduating from Teen Challenge he meets the woman who will become his wife and decides what he wants to do with his life. From this point on his life is directed by his faith and his desire to become a Navy SEAL. At this point we get the more traditional part of a SEAL story. We vicariously go through BUD/S, sniper school and eventually United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group, or DEVGRU. This last is a group whose activities are not commented on by the government, andis more generally known by its older name, SEAL Team Six- a name that should be familiar to anyone following the news over the past couple years.<br /><br />As Adam travels up through the various levels of the Special Forces world, his rise is met with one obstacle after another. I won't ruin the story by giving details here, but based on the interviews Blehm does with Adam's former teammates, Adam gained more respect and admiration than just about anyone by overcoming what was thrown in his path. But this is not just a gung-ho, can-do soldier. The reader sees Adam grow into a humble, self-effacing, and deeply religious man. He becomes know as much for his effort to provide shoes for hundreds of poor Afghan children as he does for his classified black ops missions where he defied death countless times. His fellow soldiers admire him not only for his ability to rise to the absolute heights of the Special Forces, but for his ability to remain a devoted husband and father while so many others struggle to hold on to family life while doing the kind of work that they do. He was a warrior who would drop into the middle of hell in the black of night, and smile, because under his body armor he had on the superman underwear his kids gave him for Christmas- underwear that would be with him until the end.<br /><br />The full title of this book is Fearless: The UndauntedCourage and Ultimate Sacrifice of Navy SEAL Team SIX Operator Adam Brown, and with this we know how the story will end. Knowing somehow makes it all the more poignant to read. Adam would be about my age, his kids just about the same as mine, and it was hard not to personalize some of the intense scenes that occur toward the end of this book. I think the best way to summarize Adam Brown is to share a quote from one of his favorite books, and one that was with him on his last op, Tender Warrior:<br /><br />\\"A warrior is one who possesses high moral standards and holds to high principles. He is willing to live by them, stand for them, spend himself in them, and, if necessary, die for them.\\"<br /><br />At his funeral one of his teammates shared this quote saying, \\"Adam was the rarest and truest of warriors in that he combined fierce and unwavering resolve on the battlefield with a deep and genuine compassion off of it.\\"<br /><br />This, I think, is a fitting legacy.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|It still haunts me after a week of completing the book. What truly happens to the lives of those tried for crimes, whether or not they are guilty?  The depth of thought this book provokes goes beyond, beneath and above the actual storyline. It creates a consciousness of the rippling effect crime and punishment places on society as a whole. Powerful messages whether or not intended by the author.

B0033H7VI6|4.0|I have a decent selection of survival knives incl. several Busse. I saw a destruction video of a similar Schrade on Youtube by KnifeTests. It did fairly well, but it is not in the Busse/Swap Rat league but thats OK as it costs a fraction. The knife comes so-so sharp out of the box. It now has a decently sharp edge (as in easily cuts copy paper) after using the Work Sharp (highly recommended). I am not crazy about how the knife feels in hand. My hands are not huge but I have sausage fingers. The handle still has ample space (as in giants please apply :-) so that it does not give you that &#34;I am one with the knife&#34; feeling.
B00DB624GS|5.0|First I will say that this version IS an improvement on the 80's CD that my dad owns, the instruments sound warmer and less trebly than the older version. There is still some hiss if you listen very close, so this may have something to do with the master tapes. Regardless, the album stands out for its songs...<br /><br />Danny Kirwan joined Fleetwood Mac about a year before this album was released and his presence is felt immediately on the opening track, Coming Your Way. He has a great voice and displays some nice licks at the end of the song over a gothic sounding backdrop. Closing My Eyes is an introspective Green number where he is actually reflecting on people rejecting his religious views at the time; I have an article where he discusses this song. For the longest time I thought it was about a girl but it is actually about God. After the somber and well crafted Closing My Eyes comes Fighting for Madge, where we get as close to the live Mac as possible. Green just blazes on both of the Madge jams and I love how the instrumentals come and go through the entire album.<br /><br />Underway is a smooth Green instrumental that transitions into One Sunny Day, which rocks like a Led Zep or Cream song and Although the Sun is Shining is a haunting example of Kirwan's talent for chord writing. Rattlesnake Shake has one of Green's iconic guitar riffs. He also displays his excellent six string bass skills, overdubbed and panned to the right trading licks with his guitar. Without You is Kirwan's best blues number and shows what an influence Green had on the younger guitarist. Searching for Madge is probably my favorite song, I just love Green's licks on this track and you can hear the influence he had on Santana towards the end of the song. Let's not forget the rocking rhythm section! Brilliant. Before the Beginning is a close second favorite. Green overdubbed some more six string bass that responds nicely to his guitar solo. Green was the king of minor key blues.<br /><br />Oh Well, what can you say? It has one of the greatest riffs ever and Kirwan takes a solo sounding like a big band horn section! Part 2 is very well formulated and Jeremy Spencer makes his only appearance on piano. Green's Spanish guitar solo has his trademark great touch. The Green Manalishi is fabulous, I just wish they mixed Green's medieval sounding guitar solo during the outro up so it popped more, but that's not what he wanted I guess. World in Harmony is delicate and it's nice to finally have the original version.<br /><br />I love the production on this album, Green and co. (including Martin Birch, engineer) had a field day exploiting the stereo spectrum. It's a shame Green quit when he did, their planned live album would have rocked so hard and surely brought them notoriety in the States. According to his brother, Green told his dad that he said all he had to say. Kirwan certainly doesn't get enough credit keeping the band afloat and writing some great songs on the next three albums (Please re-master those too) If you become a fan of him he produced some nice solo material: Second Chapter is charming and well orchestrated while Midnight in San Juan has a more live feel and it's a wonder he didn't put a band together to tour. It features great songs like Windy Autumn Day and Rolling Hills.<br /><br />If you're a fan of British pop and/or British blues this album is a must have!>Oh Well, what can you say? It has one of the greatest riffs ever and Kirwan takes a solo sounding like a big band horn section! Part 2 is very well formulated and Jeremy Spencer makes his only appearance on piano. Green's Spanish guitar solo has his trademark great touch. The Green Manalishi is fabulous, I just wish they mixed Green's medieval sounding guitar solo during the outro up so it popped more, but that's not what he wanted I guess.

B00915G6MG|5.0|Enjoyed watching the episodes and then went back and rewatched the ones with audio commentary enabled. Found the commentary on the episode Seek especially interesting.
B00006J9OT|5.0|I Have listened to this disc countless times. I love all the arrangements on these jazz standards. Krall and company put on a damn good show. Enjoy!
B000SEIK2S|2.0|The idea that military technology might advance so far that civilizations could be in a perpetual, yet sustainable, state of war was memorably explored in &#34;The Forever War.&#34; This book, without being as good as that classic, is another twist on the theme, the twist being old people conduct the war. They are given a new body that lasts 10 years, then they are retired, or enlist again. Why old people? Seems like they are the only ones who empathize with human colonists living in far flung places, because they remember the idea of a united humanity. The book is written in a breezy, cliche-ridden, style. There are some interesting sci-fi ideas, lightly worn, such as ships that move by fitting between universes and that can only be detected by tachyons. The book is a pleasant summer read, and like summer reads, easily forgettable.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I highly recommend this book. The inner dialogues of the characters were a work of art. I read this followed by The Silent Wife  (which is acclaimed as this year's Gone Girl) and liked The Husband's Secret better. Silent Wife was good as well, but not as compelling. You won't be disappointed. I will never think of Tupperware in the same way again!!!
1885167776|5.0|[[ASIN:1885167776 The ONE Thing: The Surprisingly Simple Truth Behind Extraordinary Results]]<br /><br />This book resonated with me from the first page.  It is really something we should all know intuitively - deep in our heart of hearts.  That when we get focused  on our ONE THING - results can happen.<br /><br />I have shared this book with my team and I believe it is going to have incredible results.  AMAZING book.  Read it twice!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am completely hooked on this game.  It is easy to learn and I hard to put down.  I learned in less the a minute and have just been working to improve since then,
B004J4WN0I|4.0|I liked this novel because the main character is a little different from the standard wizards, werewolves, and vampires that have flooded the genre. Atticus is a druid who is thousands of years old and Hearne brings him to life by adding many historical details as well as creating a cast of interesting and fun secondary characters for him to interact with.
B000TCEU4Q|3.0|This was a replacement throttle quadrant unit as the old unit black throttle slide was causing &#34;jitters&#34;, presumably because the variable resistor was wearing out.<br /><br />The new unit is fine in that regard but, unfortunately, introduces a new problem - at the idle position the black throttle lever sometimes activates the &#34;reverse&#34; switch. I live with the defect because it was just too much nuisance returning the part for yet another replacement.<br /><br />Saitek manufacturing QC probably needs to be tightened up.
B005HEPS6A|5.0|Star Trek is a great show, even for people who are not &#34;Trekkies.&#34; Funny moment, poignant moments, very good TV.
B004GJYROG|5.0|3rd generation for grandson. Loves it, and for old school movie...glad he likes it. Good family entertainment. Recommend to purchase.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Love this app!  I'm not usually a fan of this type of game (temple run) but the course changes are so random that each and every time is like a fresh game.  It's easy to learn.  It offers bonus multipliers with better armor suits, thus increasing your score exponentially.  It may ask you to make purchases with real money, but the game plays just as well without spending cash.  I haven't paid a dime and I've unlocked about 1/4 of the many armor suits offered...after a week of playing!  If you're a fan of the movie, the character, or Temple Run...GET THIS GAME!!!
B0017P520U|1.0|Did not get to finish it due to it failing to load several times. Very slow, despite the fact that i was using high speed internet. Quality was decent bu not really the best that it could have been. Only got past 25 minutes before it failed again
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Using this application was easy and that's very good for me. It worked well from the very first time out. Even someone with little experience with these types of devices will have a pleasant experience.
B00C2IPB70|4.0|Great a d intriguing story with killer special effects. Looks great in a y high definition system. For the price the steel book was just an added bonus as it cost no more than a regular DVD.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|First of all, as with any app you download read the permissions and download size and if you like it download it and if not find another. Permissions are a bit overboard but the app itself works great. I use it to take notes in class. Create different notebooks for each class. I also downloaded skitch and use it with this app to take graphic notes which I highly recommend.<br /><br />Secondly, it's great that the app backs up your notes and can b  shared easily.<br /><br />I'd recommend it.
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|It's just as cheesy as the original but that's part of what makes it good. It cracks me up to see the new judge Fred try and keep a permanent scowl like Stallone has naturally when he's trying to act tough. The new actors face must have been burying tryinng to keep that up
B004R13U6Y|4.0|Great way  to organize and annotate pdfs. Lots of annotation and note writing options. Also has a great feature of reading to you.<br /><br />Docked one star because the page turns very easily and although it turns with a &quot;real page-like&quot; animation, I could easily do without it.
B00C5R8364|5.0|Forsyth is my favorite author along with Daniel Silva.  Starting with the Jackal, Dogs of War and others, his work is always full of intrigue, action and good outcomes.  Always well done.
B00EDK283A|4.0|One would think with a title like Black is the Colour it meant they were going heavier, but not so. More piano & strings and less guitar & drums, some of it almost qualifies as pop / new age.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|We liked this because the information is clear and there is a sentence given with the word.  Easy to use for children.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Amazing animation. Extremely funny story lines. Great for my 2-year-old and I to watch together. We have probably watched these episodes 10+ times.
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|I found where angles cry challenging and interesting.  looking forward to playing the sequal.  this is the type of game playing.
B00DHSK3RM|3.0|Why would Amazon have the levels guide and not the game?  I love the game and thought that is what I was getting  Even called about the game and it is not available for the Kindle Fire
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Nexus 7 works perfectly with this.  Windows needs to turn off virtual networks.  If you have Hyper-V or Oracle Virtual Box, Chromecast won't work, even though the diagnostics says it is.  At this time, Youtube and Netflix are the ones support chromecast.  I ordered early enough to get three month Netflix coupon with it.  Chromecast SDK is available only for Linux and Apple but not for Windows.  Google somehow does not have good programmers for Windows.  Google, don't ignore Windows!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very addicting. Much better than temple run. I can't put it down. Though the upgrades could be cheaper
B000MG1ZG0|5.0|I had the album &#34;Waiting For The Sun&#34; years ago and this CD is amazing. All the old tunes with many I've never heard. Love all of them.
B003W0BYQ4|4.0|Some Campy parts, but cool. Scene with Ricky and Dean singing together was priceless. Crotchety ole Stumpy and hard as nails John Wayne make for a predictable, but entertaining movie.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a pretty fun game. I like how it gives quests so that it's not just a boring search-&-find game
B009ZQJ1G4|5.0|I was a little weary of the fact it was rated R But it is not really for anything But BLOOD Gore ... most 13 year olds have seen this and more in their video games , and the cinematography was Great (If your Unsure check it out on IMDB under parental, it's accurate. So Watching this again sometime
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I think younger readers would enjoy it, but I continued reading the series and am waiting for Book 8 to appear'
B00ENYUFYU|5.0|Really it was exactly as promised.  Some excitement, some drama, a bit of introspection.  Predictable?  So what?  Sit back and enjoy the show.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I can now keep my Kindle Fire pristine and not worry about scratches on the screen.  It's so versatile in use and works perfectly.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This was an excellent follow up to book one. I will be starting book three right away. Can't wait to find out what's next
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I loved it because it holds so much wisdom and because the lands and characters are truly alive and substantial.  There are no constant repetitive explanations to remind me of earlier story events.  It flows strongly toward where you  wish to follow.  Waiting, waiting, for Day  3.
0061743526|5.0|A classic in anniversary dress.  I have and always will love &#34;To Kill a Mockingbird.&#34;  It's a National Treasure with messages for today.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I cant belive that I never have heard about this book before, now that I have read it, the world will never be the same again.
B00821OX98|4.0|Very good acting and writing great story super good entertainment. I want more of it, want to watch more seasons.
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|do not look to find the Downward Spiral Part II here. this album is closer to the feel of the live album, And All That Could Have Been. The single, Came Back Haunted is structurally similar to Bite the Hand that Feeds. For me, the high point of the album is ironically titled \\"All Time Low.\\" This is the closest track you are going to find to \\"Closer\\", not pun intended. This album is more of a journey than Year Zero and The Slip.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Just got my chromecast, and almost thought I got a bad dongle because all I could see was a black screen and 4 colored dots. I took the dongle out of the HDMI port, and hit the button 3 times then held the button for 30 seconds. Plugged the dongle back in, and now I have the setup screen.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|This movie stole my heart. I was wanting to watch for so long and finally found the time. This move will break your heart with sadness and joy all at once.  I highly recommend everyone to see this movie.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I saw this movie 2 or 3 times in the theater.  Very well written,  a lot less lens flare, and a good tie in to the earlier movies.  If you are a die hard canon Trek fan and didn't like Star Trek (2009), then you won't like this one.  However, please don't go on to Amazon and give it a bad rating simply because you are stuck in the past.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I absolutely loved the author's first book, Kite Runner, and found myself unable to put it down. But this book had so many story lines that I became frustrated. Although the author's writing is excellent, the book would have been much better without the minor character side stories. These stories began and ended abruptly and did not add value to the book.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|This is my first wired lavalier mic and I must say that I am very happy.  I've only used it a couple times, but I was extremely happy with the results.  If you are currently using the on-board camera microphones, spend the money and get this.  You won't be sorry.  It is a night and day difference.<br /><br />One more thing, check your gain setting if it doesn't seem to be working right.  Canon camcorders ( I have the HF-G20) have their gains on auto which tends to over power everything.  Put it on manual and adjust it properly and you will get great sound.<br /><br />Here is a link to a video I made using this microphone.  If you have buzzing problems, make sure you adjust your gain manually.<br /><br />[...]
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Great concept but to progress with a lot of the game you either have to wait for winning of cash or buy cash.  The only other issue is too many disasters per day that you have to take care of or your people die.
B000001BZT|4.0|Steve Earle had two well received and critically acclaimed country albums under his belt, but he had been saying all along that he didn't consider himself a country singer. Being a big lefty liberal wasn't endearing him to the staid conservatism of the Music Row establishment. With these worlds colliding, Earle went all in for his third album, 1988's \\"Copperhead Road.\\" MCA Nashville and MCA Los Angeles were so befuddled by it that they resurrected the old UNI Records imprint to try and find a bridge between the two worlds. And for his part, Earle hit a park on \\"Copperhead Road\\" that took him almost a decade to recover from.<br /><br />The album is, at its absolute best, a perfect ahead of its time blend of rockin' with the new country crew that Earle was initially batched in with. Rock as hard as he wanted to, but he couldn't escape that southern drawl and many of the lyrical tropes of the genre. At the same time, the guitars, drums and overall sound were closer to John Mellencamp than George Strait. The epic title song is all but a Mellencamp record with a tougher lyrical punch; a story about a moonshiner's son who comes back from Vietnam with a bag of pot plants and post traumatic stress disorder. With that kind of content, it's no wonder that the Suits in Nashville didn't know what the fox to do with him. The same with the unknown soldier who is angry about how his Grandfather came home a hero, but he's disabled, standing alone on a runway in San Diego and \\"there's nobody here, maybe know body knows\\" (in \\"Johnny Come Lately\\").<br /><br />Earle could still do convincing country, like the gunslinger's lament \\"Devil's Right Hand\\" and the pedal steel ballad \\"Once You Love.\\" All the same, Earle had reached a crossroads, personally and musically. \\"Copperhead Road\\" remains his commercial apex and is among his best albums, but his decline into addiction and his overall distrust of the music industry left him stranded until 1995 and \\"Train a'Comin'.\\" But for the sheer raw power of a battle waged and won, Steve Earle's \\"Copperhead Road\\" remains a must listen.power of a battle waged and won, Steve Earle's \\"Copperhead Road\\" remains a must listen.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|This book is DEFINITELY a 5 star book. I can't wait to read the next book! If you don't read this series then your missing out! Ally Condie writes books amazingly, other books I have read aren't half as good.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Thought it was going to be a chick flick when I started watching with my wife, but got hooked, had a good blend for everyone, history, war, drama
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Finally watched Season Two...just as compelling as the first!  It's addictive.  Once you start watching you can't stop. On to Season Three!
B000FC130E|5.0|A great way to spend a rainy Saturday! A very imaginative, fun story with well developed characters. I enjoyed it.
B000MD9UJC|4.0|This works out well to breath new life into a old Mini Mag.<br /><br />You loose the ability to focus the beam but, it's worth the trade off for battery life and bulb reliability for me.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I went in to this movie with pretty high expectations, and I was not disappointed. Everybody was spot on with their roles, and they actually had Superman DO SOMETHING!!! In all the other movies, Superman pretty much just stared the bad guy's down until they gave up. Not the case at all in this one I'm happy to say!
0316019984|5.0|I ordered this book for my 4  year old grandson's birthday, based on a review left on Amazon's site.  It has become his favorite book.  The special &#34;pop-up&#34; effects are top quality, and the additional smaller pop-ups in the corners of the pages, just added to the story behind his favorite Superheros!!!  The Batman &#34;light-up&#34; was amazing!!  I have passed along the great savings on this book, to everyone who is pleasantly surprised when they look at it.
B009CWWFD2|4.0|This author does not disappoint.  I have read several of his books an always enjoyed a good book that moves right along and entertains me.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|This is a wonderful book that gives the reader a feeling of being there with the author and his companion.  Uplifting!
B001VLXNO2|4.0|Like this author and have read a number of his books.  I know when I select one of his books I'm in for a good read.
B00B7FOQCK|4.0|I haven't even used this hub yet.  Form factor is small and pleasant to the eyes.  I'm in the middle of rearranging some external drives, wdtv's and gig switches to maximize throughput.
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|First and foremost: Benedict Cumberbatch saves this movie. If he wasn't the villain, I question its success. His tone, speed, and delivery just perfected the villain role. It was like Sherlock in a Star Trek movie.<br /><br />This Star Trek has more action than the 1st, jumps right into the action. Great scenes all around. Great shots of the ship, great music cues.<br /><br />I'm keeping this short as it is pretty easy to spoil scenes in this movie, and the scenes (even when spoiled) are still golden.<br /><br />The reason this is 4-stars instead of 5 is because the film has a few \\"buy why\\" moments. The Honest Trailer series did one of Star Trek Into Darkness and they were pretty spot-on.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Yeah. This is so easy.  Really easy. So simple and kinda stupid. Its really simple. Ok. Its getting harder now. Harder to stop playing this stupid<br />simple game.
B005PK56TA|4.0|For mature audiences, not for young children.  Supernatural forces in a beautiful old house keeps anyone who dies there as ghosts. And there are lots of them. Each episode of season 1 is an intriquiging suspenseful tale involving a Psychiatrist and his family who  recently bought and reside the house.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|does what It Says And More. Love The Blemish Tool. Pure Awesomeness. Has Lots Of Other Tools, frames, Etc. The Best I've Seen So Far.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ. SO GOOD IT MADE ME CRY A COUPLE TIMES<br />AGAIN, LOVED IT
B000FCK8ZK|4.0|I have to admit that I'm a fan of the show which lead me to try the first in the series. Though similar, there are very different. That can be a good thing. Unlike the adaptations of Charlene Harris' Sookie Stackhouse series, I think it was good that the show (Dexter) ventured off to create their own voice. I think that was a wise decision as other shows like True Blood and The Walking Dead tried to keep their story lines very close to the original novels and then radically changed all of the sudden after two seasons. Regardless, this review is about the book. I breezed though this book and was glad of the surprises that laid ahead. I don't want to spoil it for new readers but this book, though it starts off almost exactly like the television series, veers off into its own making it a unique entity. I look forward to the next book in the series as I now want to find out what the original storyline Lindsey wrote for Dexter and clan. Good stuff! I would say read this book and be surprised that it's not at all what you thought it would be.
B00AHG9KYE|3.0|Of al the books this is my least favorite. Though I liked the book, the author could have worked the plot line more thoroughly. I was disappointed by the outcome of the Monolith and it's creators. Something we believed to be benevolent was actually not...<br /><br />Overall, I liked the book but not my favorite. 2001 has that one.
B00ET47USI|5.0|One of my favorites! Play it every day at least once. Have to admit it's very addictive. Have pretty good win/loss ratio.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|Yeah I got some clear videos but it kept asking for my google account then wouldn't load. Wasn't worth it to me.  I downloaded this on my kindle fire.
B008KYOCA2|3.0|First off, there are many good aspects of the Jorge calender.  I like looking at the monthly perspective as it allows you to see the larger and smaller aspects of upcoming activities. You can import various holidays as well as the weather forecasts.. It does not work properly for defining timelines for events.  There are no easy ways to copy events which may repeat themselves each week but take on a different start/stop time. Synching with any outside calender is difficult if not impossible.
B002U5HKZ6|4.0|Well written window into the Indian culture of caste system. Revealing portrayal of the slums, which tho ostensibly illegal, are allowed because they serve more than one social tier, and the self-governing of its members. If you're fascinated by other cultures, or just by the Indian culture, this comes recommended.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, Katness is such an inspiration. This book had me laughing and weeping at times. Must read!
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|I wanted an easy, fun read, and heard good things about this book. Unfortunately, it was unbearably stupid. It was obvious, uninteresting, and unsatisfying. Finishing it was one of the greatest and most disappointing efforts of my life. I kept thinking some unexpected plot twist was around the corner, but alas, the narrative thread turned out to be as uninspired as the characters. I'm completely fatigued by the trite story of an intelligent woman becoming totally vapid after falling in love with a handsome, dominating man. 50 Shades of Grey (which would actually seem like a parody of itself if not for the horrific prose) actually did it better than this book.
B003G4W49C|5.0|That was rad. Truly grasping while in attempt to grasp the life of Ender and his fellow geniuses. Loved it.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Each day I grow closer to God,  however, I  struggle with the &#34; reality&#34; of science and day to day worldly life. This scientist perspective and insightful tour of heaven on such a personal level gave me (and I'm sure will others) comfort that life does not end with death.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is one of the best games I have ever played! I hope other people play this game as well and love it too.
0061537969|5.0|In a very easy language, it is the perfect way to imagine all the things a dog feels and thinks about his owners. It shows us humans, how to love and give  oneself whithout complications as dogs only do! It has a beautiful end!
1609611543|5.0|Always ate wheat was addicted to bread all my life! Lost twenty pounds just following the book. Great information has helped my skin clear up too!
B00942Y4IY|5.0|I love Stargate the movie and series. Watching the movie gave me a better understanding of the series. A good watch.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Gameplay is amazing and the world is amazing .it deserves five stars and u can't beat that it is free !!!!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|It's super fun and I'm so glad if found it! I can't stop playing, I'm addicted! But it would be even better if you could do 1v1
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Game is well designed. Great graphics and extremely challenging . Very enjoyable game. Also enjoy bits of history prior to each level
B003G4W49C|4.0|This is an easy, interesting read.  As a mother, it pulls at the heart strings of sadness, yet shows the resilience, creativity and endless possibilities of a young mind.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Truly additive game.  Every time I log into the game, I cannot seem to stop to do anything else.  It is worth the time to download.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Great, easy to use, daughter loves it, great app for free ! her friends and even her brothers get a kick out of it
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|Asphalt 8 rock's it's a fun game. It could run a little faster. But over all it IS a very competitive game
0143038419|5.0|Thought of reading a Novel after 15 years. Gone through a divorce at 44. And a heart break which is not giving up its pain. What could have been more perfect then this. If you want to enjoy the book just read it and live with it. Follow Liz as you are part of her. Enjoy the journey instead of being a critique of how self indulgent the author is. I love this self indulgent Liz and her truthfulness. Take you imagination to a higher level, feel and live the journey even if it is not yours and you will find something which will guide you.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is an awesome app!!! I recommend this app!! If u love minions like I do than this app is for u !!! ;)
B00ET47USI|4.0|it is a game that gets you thinkimg about what  you are after. helps you to keep mind on suibjectat hand.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Aside from the annoying ads, this game is something that's nice to have when you don't feel like reading or doing serious stuff like puzzles.
B003H4I4JU|3.0|I read it to keep my teenager company, and I have to admit, it grabbed my attention! The plot carries you along. And it wrestles with lots of interesting questions about anthropology, imperialism and 'speciesism.'  It is short of being a really great book though, because of various logical flaws and implausibilities. Still, it's a fun read.
B00B4804KS|5.0|It's Crazy. It jus t gets better and better everytime I watch it. I had to get rid of the older copy cuz now I only find myself watchin 3d films. Very glad I was able to grabb this at a good cost.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I enjoy playing the game. It is hard to expand without paying for all the extras.  It is a decent time killer.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|I really think this is a great workout program it shows you how to do everything and you can also do it at your own pace, or a higher pace. Love it.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|One that stands up to the original series.  Bears repeat watching.  One movie I was sure I wouldn't like, but ended up liking very much.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Safe Haven is probably one of the best books I have read. It has suspense, romance, and makes you think. A very good book
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best app in th  whole word. It is ok that you have to spend money, because I  is totally worth it!!!!!!
B00CTSDDVO|3.0|The special effects are well done if a bit pointless, and the acting is generally engaging. But there's nothing original or interesting here.<br /><br />Look, we're already saddled with characters who we've now known for close to 50 years. We know none of them is ever going to die or be in any real danger. That's a pretty big eight ball to be behind in trying to develop stories for what's essentially a space western. So why compound the problem by reintroducing guest characters from earlier Star Trek fare? Do we really need to see Khan in this movie as the evil protagonist? Couldn't they come up with something or somebody else? You know, something NEW?<br /><br />And the basic crew of the USS Enterprise are morphing into superheroes. The fight sequence between Spock and Khan is absolutely cartoonish and ridiculous. Funny how a character who has spent the better part of 4 decades searching to get in touch with his humanity has jumped the shark to become The Mighty Thor.<br /><br />Worst is the scene that mirrors the death of Spock from Star Trek II, here inverted to having Kirk die while Spock lives. We're even treated to Spock yelling \\"Kh-a-a-n,\\" this time, rather than Kirk. Is this supposed to be high camp? Of course, Kirk is brought back from the dead after Spock beats the crap out of Khan and they derive a life-giving serum from Khan's blood. McCoy says it's their only hope...but, wait a sec...aren't Khan's 76 cohorts lying in suspended animation canisters in the Enterprise? Don't they all have the same genetically enhanced blood as Khan? Er, I think we missed something obvious here - why not take the elevator down to the storage area and draw some blood from one of Khan's sleeping buds, rather than chasing him around San Francisco, jumping like Spiderman from flying car to flying car?<br /><br />I'll bet you a nickel the Borg show up in the next Star Trek movie.<br /><br />Funny how the original TV series and its various spinoffs had no problem coming up with new enemies, dangers and challenges, and on a weekly basis. Where did Khan, the Borg, tribbles and the rest originally come from? From a CREATIVE mind, that's where. Yet the best these movies can seem to do is to recycle villains and situations from the TV series over and over again. The very first Star Trek movie basically took the plot of the \\"Nomad\\" TV episode and turned it into \\"Ve-jer.\\" The first remake in the JJ Abrams series took the story from the movie \\"ST Nemesis\\" and switched the hatred of a Romulan outlaw to be directed at Spock, rather than Picard. And now, Khan returns. Why?<br /><br />Hard to recommend this as anything but a low-level diversion.w enemies, dangers and challenges, and on a weekly basis.

B004XUMMFE|5.0|great show.  Fox made another mistake when they cancelled this show.  is there any way to correct such an error/
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great app. There are fun challenges every week that keep you hooked and wanting more. A must have!
B0043RSK3K|3.0|Still reading.  A lot of historical parallels to be considered.<br />I read awhile and then pick it up again later.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|When I started watching it I was positive she was in shock and eventually would file the divorce. Now, after only 5 or 6 episodes, you don't really know what she's thinking or even how she's feeling. You can see she's clearly upset, but what she will do is a mistery. And that's what keeps yougoing. Well, that and the background stories are good as are her firm principles.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Great adventure movie. Fun to sit and watch withe the entire family. Reminds me of when I was a kid.
B008MM9630|4.0|its a great game but you have to wait or use diamonds. if you don't have diamonds you buy them with real money. or wait and earn them.
B00DVXVMT6|5.0|Through the years Chimaira have lost and gotten members returned. Even though most of the original group is gone, this album still deserves as much praise as The Infection. Show how much you love their earth shattering riffs and Mark Hunter's defiant growling on their latest triumph!
B0013TTLDE|1.0|I was deeply disappointed in this book. I have been raised in a house that is in fact in Riverton and I am extremely baffled by the suspense, romance, and action that is said to have taken place here. As far as I am concerned, Riverton is a slow paced town that has never seen the slightest glimpse of action in its existence. Romance is only legendary here and the only thing that keeps this town on the map is the corner gas station that sells semi-fresh donuts on Monday afternoons. This book has portrayed the town as appealing and mysterious, but, it's quite the opposite. I would be desirous to meet anyone who has found romance or action in Riverton and to know where I can find it myself. I have lived in the town for eighteen years and know only a fraction of the people. Most are very reserved and stay inside because of the scorching heat of the summers and the bitter cold of the winters. The town is most undesirable. I have been to the so called lake that is mentioned in the book on several occasions and have found it to be nothing but a swampy puddle. It does not meet the mysterious description of the book and is far from intriguing. If you are looking for a place to live that is romantic and mysterious, Riverton is not the place for you. However, if reading a book with no truth to it sounds appealing to you, I would highly recommend House at Riverton
081297381X|5.0|This is one of those books you must read and then you can worry about reading reviews. It will totally change your perspective on statistics, odds, and probability both in life as well as the stock market. There are a lot of great analogies and quotes that I use after reading this book.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I just started season 2 and it's wonderful.  I am so happy I made the decision to buy all 3 seasons.  Looking forward to Season 4<br />coming on the TV soon!  The acting is superb!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I have not started on this season yet but I know it will be as wonderful and Season 1 & 2.  Love all of what I've seen so far!
B002E0JL4A|5.0|Just because one person has differing views on how patients should be treated does not make him wrong even if it is bucking the time honored system. This covers all aspects of following your dream.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|After seeing the stage production numerous times, I was amazed at the acting, singing, and how emotionally I was moved by this movie. I continue to watch it as each time i hear new aspects. Marvelous.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Slow start however once the story got going I couldn't put the books down<br /><br />Definitely will recommend these books to friends
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|It is sad that Vince Flynn died, but Lee Child's Jack Reacher is an excellent replacement for Mitch Rappp if you like righteous violence.  Jack is a free lancer in the style of John MacDonald's Travis McGee rather than a hired gun like Mitch, but the intrigue and hard core action is fun to read.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|This movie is great and Fluttershy is the best!  If you haven't watched it, do it because it is very much so worth it
B004U8VX2M|5.0|I really like it. Downtown abbey is a favorite and am enjoying this one as much. I am a fan of English series  and appreciate being able to have them streamed to my kindle fire.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Hey, this game is cool but just my apinyon (Can't spell XD) Dragon story's also a cool game go check it out!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This is a must see!  We watched it 2x's just so we could see the big picture and figure out the plot. The dialogue about deception is very powerful and moving.
B000FCKL6G|5.0|Before reading &#34;Who says Elephants Can't Dance&#34; I knew little about IBM's turnaround and even less about Louis Gerstner. Overall I found the book revealing and certainly entertaining. Gerstner's leadership style proved to be just what IBM needed at exactly the right time. I would recommend the book to anyone interested in the business of IBM.
B000X2H8G4|5.0|the  wild  birds  we  have  around here  come  in  better  when  using  this  item.  Love  hearing  bird  sounds.  I  used  it  for  my  tv  too.  so  when  its  late  at  night  I  can  tune  down  my  tv  and  enjoy  all  the  sounds  I  miss.
B009NY43NY|5.0|It was good to see how the series would end up.  These have been a fun set sorry to have it end.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This is the best fps game ever I'm level 18 now it's a perfect time waster when your bored I prefer this game to be downloaded ps my blitz brigade name is boombot
1781162646|5.0|I have read this book before, can't remember how long ago but I liked it much better this time than last time.  It really isn't a typical King book but it is a sweet story.  Even brought a tear at the end.  The last review I wrote said that I wanted the real Stephen King to return & I do!!! He is the best writer ever because of his talent for developing the characters so you care about them - all of them.  Some you love, like or hate as the situation calls for.  But, you know them & that is one of his greatest gifts to us, besides giving us great stories.  He does give us wonderful stories - creepy & weird with a very warped sense of humor.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Very good unpredictable plot, with a lot of twists and turns, I've watch it at movie theatre and couldn't wait for release date on Blueray.....I preordered on Amazon got the discs on sameday of release date....just as Amazon promised
B00B4ELMU8|5.0|I've used their maintainers for years, but had to jury rig my own extension cords because they did not have one; now they do.
0307950654|2.0|It's actually annoying that P.D. James should pilfer one of one's favourite books just so she can get a detective novel out of it.  At least Emma Tennant's sequel bore some relation to Jane Austin's book.  James's writing completely overlooks Austin's wit, playful lampooning of her characters, and frivolity.  Instead we are told Lydia hates Elizabeth, how much Darcy loves Elizabeth (please illustrate this rather than merely telling us it) and Mr Collins and Mrs Bennett don't even get a look in.  Maybe not a bad idea given that Mr Bennett does and bears no resemblance to Austin's amusing portrayal.  Next time, Miss James, come up with your own book.  One is left with the uneasy premonition that she has her eye on Northanger Abbey next.
B00DXP7L88|1.0|Like in Six Feet Under, Michael C. Hall overstayed his welcome.  Both series should have stopped two seasons earlier.  6 & 7 were, in parts, excrutiatingly bad.  You realise you shouldn't have persevered with the purchase when in moments of orchestrated terror, you can no longer stop yawning.  The writing was, in parts, execrable, the plot did not strain but snapped credibility.  Not wishing to spoil the denouement, the Captain does not have CCTV installed in her property, Dexter drugs and kidnaps victims, who know he is after them, in broad daylight.  An able poisoner fails to poison properly, etc.  Stop watching now if you wish to say you enjoyed the show.
B003PJ6UHA|5.0|This book was definitely very eye opening for me. I had never seriously considered the author's theory but he makes a very persuasive case. Although the theory may seem a bit strange at first, it makes complete sense by the end of the book.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I like this controller because it's sleek, it works, and its a huge improvement over my beaten-up, abused and button missing controller I used to own. Don't worry I didn't sell it! The price could be lower, but its fine.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|My first book by this author and my first time writing a review. I was caught off guard. What I thought would be a simple book turned out to be an extremely thought provoking book. I felt like I knew the characters by the time the story got interesting and the events that occurred after that had me going &#34;Wow&#34;. Well done Ms. Moriaty.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|If you haven't read this book and you want an amazing adventure, read this! The movie is great too, but the book is so much better!
0440217563|5.0|I have not started to read this book yet. I'm still reading book 2 but love it. I finished book 1 , the Outlander. I fell in love with all the characters which prompted me to continue with the series. They're addictive reading.
B009PNQUXO|5.0|u sod have tiler on it to ognise ur youtube and have you youtube aconet for u to sing in
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love it kids love it  get game too keep employees on there toes my 3 5 &amp; 6 yr olds just love it !
B009ME47H2|4.0|This is a fun little app to use for leaving your kids messages or if your a big kid good for reminders have fun with it!
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Creatively executed, a delight to watch. Kept me glued to the screen. Lots of twists and turns to keep you guessing.
B00CT2P6VA|4.0|Quell is a quiet reflective game that's good for your mind.  I'm not crazy about some of the new elements though, but maybe it's just me.
B0081336FO|5.0|I enjoyed the programs.  It was fun to watch the relationship of the characters.  Although in the final episode, I found it unbelievable that a computer expert was not brought in for the court case.  Be that as it may, it was a joy.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|This is one is those easy to learn, fun to play, slowly gets trickier and trickier games but is calming and challenging every step of the way!<br /><br />The simple game mechanic of just drawing a line to affect the flow of the sugar is all you have to learn to play this game.  But soon you build basic strategies for where and when to draw the lines and it just gets more and more interesting...while the calming times of the background music make it an extremely pleasant diversion to play.
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|This is a gravity-based game with an unusual concept. It is definitely worth downloading as the FAOTD. I don't know that I like it enough to think it worth paying for, but others might. It took me a while to figure out how to draw the lines to direct the sugar flow - I kept drawing the line directly from the spout at first - which blocks the flow. Once I did figure it out, it's pretty interesting. Looking at the screenshots in the App Store also helps. It gets quite challenging pretty soon. You not only have to figure out how to get the sugar to flow into the different cups, you have to time everything exactly right and draw the lines in the right places and as smoothly as possible. I am at around Level 12 and enjoying it so far, but if it gets too difficult for me to figure out after multiple tries, I'll probably lose interest. I don't think they provide any hints or solutions.<br /><br />For the reviewer who put down other reviewers for complaining that there's no eraser - there isn't an eraser in GAME mode, only in SANDBOX (free play) mode. In game mode, you're stuck with whatever lines you draw until you start over.<br /><br />**** WARNING - SPOILER ALERT *** HINT FOLLOWS SO STOP READING IF YOU DON'T WANT ANY HINTS *****************************************************<br /><br />At first I was completely baffled about how to get sugar to flow through the color filters and into the cups when the filters are BELOW the cups (without the reverse gravity). Then I realized that the sugar that falls to the floor will eventually reappear at the top and start falling from the ceiling. (Same thing happens in reverse when the reverse-gravity button is on).
B006LXQID8|5.0|I haven't enjoy a foreign more.  Audrey Tautou is wonderful as Amelie, and I promise that if you speak french or can read, (subtitles) this movie will be two hours well spent.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|really? I just updated it and it took away endor and death star 2. what the heck? very very dissapointed
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Dumb but I enjoyed it that is why I gave it 4 stars. Others may see it differently, and give it more or less.
B000FC146C|5.0|I first read this book in the 80's I think, about 30 yrs before moving to Australia, I loved it then and decided to read it again this year after living in Australia for 4 years, so bought it for my Kindle. (I never saw the TV version as I am usually disappointed by them after I have read the book). The story through 3 generations is engrossing, real, and full of heartwarming interactions and harsh realities. The characters become real and you care what happens to them. There are twists you might not expect that make it an emotional read. It is also an accurate, sensitive and sympathetic portrayal of life in Australia during this time period. Having now lived in or visited many of the places in the book it is even more real for me. I heartily recommend it to any one who enjoys 'generational saga' type books with a strong grounding in historical reality.
B004A8ZWW4|3.0|&#34;Real Steel&#34; isn't particularly original or challenging stuff.  But it makes for great Saturday-afternoon viewing.  I usually prefer my science fiction with more meat on its bones, but despite including a lot of cliches ripped from sports movies, father-son bonding stories and underdog dramas, this one definitely wins out almost entirely on the basis of having its heart in the right place.  Plus, the special effects for the robots are pretty amazing.
B0038P80CO|2.0|The movie was not well written. I was disappointed by the whole script. Sometimes the movie gets boring. The concept of pandorum could have been explored further.
B004S5C91Q|5.0|the story told from the point of view of a five year old boy was so interesting. makes you think about how kids see our world, the good and the bad
B004GJDQT8|5.0|This app is a MUST for anyone that is a regular Amazon.com shopper or a member of Amazon Prime. Simpple, straight forward and convenient.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so fun. You would definitely want to get this game if you love animals and horses too
1451696191|5.0|Okay so this has become my favorite book. It is written in such an interesting way and it just captured my heart. I highly recommend reading this book it's just amazing!
B0053B347M|1.0|So I received this item with a break in the soft gel that makes up the strip over the led lights. The break is right next to the led so it affects the distribution of light in that area. Having said that this strip isn't very bright to begin with. I have my monitor about two or three inches from the wall and it just isn't enough to provide a good bias lighting solution. I do not believe another strip(s) would help. I'm off to look for another solution.
B001NLKWLW|1.0|No bad language, easy reading and just loved it.  Wonderful book to read before bed at night for happy dreams.
0792839749|3.0|Had to have this in my collection. I watched it when I was little and remember being scared of the guy with the big green nose. Price was great and the movie quality was even better!
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|why must the birds be angry? it gives the child a negative feeling....try eating worms instead of hurting each other
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Great game! Beautiful music the boards are very beautiful also. I love this game. I like to play it! A+++
B003P2WO5E|4.0|Bit slow in the beginning, but the setup is worth it and Sanderson delivers, giving us sympathetic characters and multiple thrilling storylines. A fine start to whet the appetites of the readers.
B00AOQ8GJ2|5.0|I don't understand why they don't make more movies like this.  I really wish they would.  It was so good.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My boys love the game.  Great color and action.  Basically, it's a minion temple run.  If you like minions, you'll love the game.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Another great novel by Lee Child.  I never get enough Jack Reacher.  Always a suspenseful story and always a good read.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|Great and challenging puzzle game.  So good I had to come back to rate  it.  Got it for free, but it is well worth $0.99
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I am not done with the book yet, but it is definitely interesting to experiment with thyself! Also this book helps over-thinking individuals change thought patterns.
B0088QQ0CU|5.0|I love when a book puts my brain to work. Kiyosaki did it again. The second best after rich's dad.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I thought it was better then the original. they showed more then just bad guys shooting each other up (like kids playing and homeless on the street
0786888628|5.0|As above. Enjoyed his writing and accounts and descriptions of the military people and their battles. Especially incisive looks at Mao, and MacArthur.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Excellent.  Can hardly wait for the third book,  The book was well worth the purchase price. Very entertaining and informative.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I have never played this game before, but now I play it a lot.  Once in a while I can't tap on a tile, but overall works great.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|It is one of the most challenging games I have found in a long time. I really like the different forms the puzzles take i.e. morphs, pairs etc. I think this game is great too in that you don't have to play with other people. They said free and so far it is.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I just keep reading and finishing this book again and again. I feel this is like having a good friend telling you small secrets to have it right.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I like this game, I like the challenge of breeding the dragons to get the different types, I'm a farmer and this is a fun crop to raise.
B001E3BHE0|5.0|One of the best books of the 20th century.  Gave this one as a gift.  Do yourself a favor and read it.
B0055D3EFU|5.0|It was refreshing to see a horror movie with a plot again.  Scary and interesting.  It had a classic movie feel to it.
B00F35BV64|4.0|As good as the last prequel, James T Kirk, the legend in the making. J J has done it again!
B007RFBOEW|5.0|Amazing! Always Loved This Movie As A Kid And Still Do!!! ~:)~ Wish They Would Have Made A Sequel ~:)~
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I was enjoying this game very much til it told me I had to update then I lost all the progress I had done with the game and it took me back to the beginning of the game then my friends visited and evidently they visited my original park  so now I have to start from scratch
B004S5FW1U|4.0|An enjoyable and easy read. I would be interested in reading more books by this author. I would recommend this book to my friends.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|True to the series, this movie is ultra-violent with a dash of humor. I loved it and will probably watch it again
B00AYB1CDO|4.0|Beautiful images of landscape, people from different cultures. Seems like shot mostly in asia, africa, south america. No location information or narrative, just visual experience. Still entertaining and pleasure to watch.
B004UIOUHC|5.0|I highly recommend this software for tablets and browsing the net.  I was having trouble with the 'Silk' browser that I was using,<br />and the native one was awful also. This Opera browser did the trick, and it syncs well with my android phone also.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|I like truely love Ms. M .....but this song opened my eyes to Ms. Gaga .....she can really sing and this song is my jam.I workout to this song.
B003I55BIA|5.0|This book deals with the very real problem of gangs in a way that lets you see the struggle so many young people have to deal with. It's not always a choice and its not always the &#34;bad&#34; kids that really need to be watched. Rich or poor people put on a mask to protect who they are and those they care about. This book covers so many issues but keeps them real. A good read for teens on up. It's nice to find a book that has a strong leading male who's proud of his Mexican heritage and dealing with what life has given him the best way he thinks he can.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My 9 and 4 yr old love to play this game.  They seem to enjoy it.  It does have cool graphics.
B00CWIMY3O|5.0|The Hannibal television series is the best show I have EVER seen on network TV.  It is artistic and compelling and just SO COOL. The acting is wonderful, especially Hugh Dancy and Mads Mikkelsen (although everyone is great).  I hope it gets the audience it deserves so it can run the full planned 4 seasons.<br /><br />Having said that, though, I sure hope if it DOES become popular, that the producers and writers stop it at the end of those planned 4 seasons and not try to milk it.  That would be a disaster.
B004RKXW0E|5.0|Growing up i saw toy story 1 and 2. Now here comes 3 and youre thinking oh god, are they going to ruin it? Nope! Still a great movie, the picture quality and animation is still great today. Not a lot to say on this one, If you liked toy story 1 and 2, watch this.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app has been pretty accurate so far. Not really understanding this whole points thing but I like the weather part.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I would highly recommend this series.  It is family friendly.  It has an excellent cast of characters and each episode is entertaining.  I stumbled across this series on Amazon Prime and now I am hooked.  The series does a wonderful job of character development, but it is far from slow or boring.  Try it out and see what you think!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|maps swords armorial magic potions and much more. graphics are great and its none stop action. 4 charicters to choose from as well. this game rocks
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is amazing. Filled with love pain and heartache. I recommend reading this book. Definitely worth your time to read.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|It was good! Just did not like the ending. Hopefully the next one is better and not as long! Not bad, but not great!
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|I have downloaded this several times and it will not work on my Kindle Fire  have to. get that  iTUNES. and I can't even<br />get it.  Thank you very much!!!!
