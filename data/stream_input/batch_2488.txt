B0078X2LKY|5.0|Very nice and funny<br />Really good for a book about monster s I would like to read another one like books with Grover in them
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I loved this story because it tried, and succeeded, I think, to take a real problem from manned space exploration and explore the ramifications. How could a lone man survive on Mars and be rescued?<br />Sure, there was probably some dubious science/starting conditions in there somewhere, but they don't jump out at the reader as being 'arranged' or improbable.<br />The story could have dragged on and on through drudgery and detail, but the author made sure it didn't. It was exciting and engaging and there were some nice twists to it.
B00BHMEALA|5.0|And they really string you out with the tension all the way to the end...  hard on the nerves but definitely brain candy.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This is the best app that I have seen for fractions. It's faster than using my scientific calculator. The UI is simple to use, which is great! It will give the fraction answer and the decimal equivalent in parentheses above it. Great for when you need to convert but not great for when you need to show their work. Awesome app. I got it for the FAOTD but it is worth the 99&cent;.
B005SEYOXW|5.0|Firefly speaks for itself. Space cowboy with a twist. Nathan Fillion is just amazing. The rest of the crew is just as amazing!
B00992CF6W|4.0|6.2 was suppose to come out a few days ago. But hopefully its this Friday. Last day of school for me... If it doesn't come out then I'm gonna lower the rate. Mojang. PC is too updated. Give it a rest and work on this... If you keep on Updating the PC all the time then You guys have to do extra work on that block... OR blocks. This update must come now because I'm dissapointed about how long updates come. PLEASE DO THIS UPDATE THIS FRIDAY OR I WILL COME AND PRESS THAT UPDATE BUTTON. HAVE A NICE DAY... Also don't rush it its gonna look crappy.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|I like it when my expectations are beat by a movie that I thought I knew all about.  This one grabs you during the opening credits and never lets you go.  Great casting, lots of twists and some very subtle performances from the bad guys gave this a veritable BBC feel.  It will go in my movie cabinet right next to Reds as a rainy saturday afternoon treasure.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Despite having access to all of the GoT episodes on HBO Go, I still buy the Blu-ray seasons as soon as they are released. The bonus materials add so much depth to the world and as a fan of the book series it's nice to see respect paid to the rich backstory that George R.R. Martin has created and that many fans of the tv show are missing out on.
1419701533|5.0|Excellent set of books, very entertaining, great price as well.  My son has read each book in the series twice so far.  Must see the movies as well, very entertaining
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great story, easy read. Life's screwed up, but you have to look for the positives and be grateful. Learn to forgive others and even yourself. That's what this story is all about. The only problem I had was the narrator at times seemed to view the world as a child would, as if they were experiencing things for the first time and not as a 35 year old would. On the other hand, I've never been through what the narrator had been through, so I could not say if the author was or was not spot on with the narrator's point of view.  Just my point of view, however it does not take away from such an excellent story and book.  I would definitely recommend this book. Must read!!!
1907523588|2.0|To the Lighthouse is an immortal work of fiction. For some readers it is the most beautiful novel ever written. This edition, however, you should avoid. There are numerous terrible typographical errors. Whole phrases are left out. Also the way the paragraphs are set out on the page are distressing. Woolf's style makes every parenthesis-mark matter, and the more white space on the page (within reason) the better. In this edition everything is jammed together as efficiently as possible. To me it was painful.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I've always wanted to know what goes through the mind of an egomaniacal playboy--except I didn't plan on falling in love with him in one day. Having never actually been inside the mind of any playboy, egotistical or otherwise, I hope they all think just like Drew Evans. And if they're all like Drew, those playboys are hot, rich, successful, give hilarious advice to women, and insight into the mind of men. It takes some seriously funny writing for me to actually laugh out loud while I'm reading alone, but Emma Chase made me not only laugh aloud but have to stop what I was reading to re-read what I didn't believe I just read. Tangled is panty-dropping, outrageously funny, and overwhelmingly lovely. I finished it in nearly one sitting because I had to know more of Drew and Kate and their tit-for-tat, anti-romance story. Tangled is not a must-read; it's a drop-everything-except-your-spare-batteries and read.
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|This is okay for a rainy day, when you can't get off the couch.  Not the best, but watchable if you're not too fussy.  I would not watch it again, but since I am addicted to Amazon Instant Videos, I usually try anything.
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|As a huge fan of the stage version of Les Miserables I was very excited to have this recording. The songs are great, the new orchestrations sound fantastic, and although Russell Crowe doesn't come close to Philip Quast's defining rendition of Javert, he does bring a real intensity to the role.<br /><br />Despite the quality of this recording I was disappointed to see how many songs were left out. Granted this is the &#34;highlights&#34; album so it was understandable, yet some of the included songs have verses missing that remove the drama from the number (most notably Fantine's verse in &#34;At the End of the Day.&#34;)<br /><br />I would recommend this album if you're a casual listener who just wants some of the songs. If you want a more complete experience the &#34;Deluxe Edition&#34; is now available. However, that also has missing verses and incomplete songs.
0385340567|5.0|I understand this book is, \\"widely considered to be the weakest in the series.\\" I couldn't agree less. This was the first Jack Reacher novel I read and I loved it. I liked it so much, I decided to read the whole collection.

B006LSZECO|5.0|After reading the first couple of chapters of this book I was contemplating not finishing it.  But I was on vacation and figured I should keep reading and I'm glad I did.  The twists in the book were really good.  Definitely one I recommend to others!
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Hay, Lloyd from Charlotte NC.  Being that the series was shot in Charlotte was exciteing as the cast had been shopping at HT were I work part time.  I brought in the cover of the BR DVD and many signed it for me.  The best part for me was seeing Damien Lewis shopping for groceries in one of the early episodes.  Now thats the Damien I have come to know.  Hay Damien!
1617751588|5.0|The book is a lot of fun and the art is great. I was fortunate to get it shortly before Simon Tofield made an appearance at the L.A. Festival of Books so I was able to get it signed to give away as a present. It was a huge hit. If you watch the Simon's Cat shorts online or know someone who's crazy for cats this book is for you!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am completely in love with this book. I fell in love with Christian just as Anastasia did, and shared her constant questions!

B0064TVQ5E|4.0|this app is fun! I haven't explored it much, but being able to choose more variety of levels and backgrounds, etc. would be the only suggestion I have here!
0470913029|3.0|I got this book from the library; my brother-in-law has been swept up in the Paleo religion.<br /><br />You'll do fine with this book.  I prefer to read Gary Taubes \\"Why We Get Fat\\" [[ASIN:0307474259 Why We Get Fat: And What to Do About It]] -- it is more readable and doesn't require revolutionary fervor.
0143034901|3.0|When I discover a great book by a hitherto unknown author, generally the first thing I do after finishing it is look to see what else this person might have written. Sometimes that great book will be part of a larger body of work that includes stories just as good or better. Younger readers accustomed to fingertip search engines might not understand this, but back in caveman days, rounding up books by a favorite obscure author took on the thrill of the hunt. Obsessive book lovers explored far-off neglected corners of libraries and excavated through burial mounds of dusty, dog-eared paperbacks at used bookstores. They dug tirelessly through castoffs in cardboard boxes at flea markets or paid ridiculous prices at collector conventions. And when they were successful in tracking down that rare, desired title, they'd gloat at their like-minded friendly rivals, crowing, \\"I got there first.\\"<br /><br />Carlos Ruiz Zafon understands that kind of drive, and his international best-seller \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" takes it to a pathological degree.<br /><br />In postwar Barcelona, 10-year-old Daniel Sempere is taken by his father, a dealer in rare tomes, to the ancient Cemetery of Forgotten Books:<br /><br />\\"When a library disappears, or a bookshop closes down, when a book is consigned to oblivion, those of us who know this place, its guardians, make sure that it gets here. In this place, books no longer remembered by anyone, books that are lost in time, live forever, waiting for the day when they will reach a new reader's hands.\\"<br /><br />An interesting idea in theory, but did you drop by Borders once the shelves had been picked clean in the Going-out-of-Business sales? I imagine a real-life Cemetery of Forgotten Books would be stocked with Where's Waldo and Garfield Treasuries. But Zafon envisions a magical repository filled to the rafters with books that were unfairly forgotten, that people would actually want to read. Daniel's father sends him into the shelves to pick one special book to take home with him, like adopting a puppy from the pound. Daniel is drawn to a book titled (not \\"entitled,\\" people, please!) \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\"  by Julian Carax.<br /><br />\\"Under the warm light cast by the reading lamp, I was plunged into a new world of images and sensations, peopled by characters who seemed as real to me as my room. Page after page I let the spell of the story and its world take me over, until the breath of dawn touched my window and my tired eyes slid over the last page.\\"<br /><br />Immediately, Daniel wants more Carax and takes his find to Don Gustavo Barcelo, one of his father's colleagues in rare books. In Barcelo's blind niece, Clara, Daniel finds a fellow fan, an expert on Carax and a boy's first love. Carax's fate is shrouded in mystery and rumor, his novels scarce. Clara tells Daniel of another superfan -- \\"a strange story about someone who went around libraries and bookshops looking for works by Julian Carax. If he found any, he would buy them, steal them, or get them by some other means, after which he immediately set fire to them.\\"<br /><br />During the summer days, Daniel reads to Clara from \\"The Shadow of the Wind.\\" At night they are stalked by a silhouette with glowing eyes and a limp (of course), a devilish specter straight from the pages of their favorite book. Daniel's love for Clara goes unrequited, and his father warns him to leave her alone, but love makes the doofus hard-headed.<br /><br />As a teenager, Daniel finally meets the sinister stranger face to ... well, I'll let you read it. The man (\\"I realized he didn't smell of tobacco, but of burned paper. Good paper, the sort used for books.\\") is determined to have Daniel's copy of \\"The Shadow of the Wind,\\" through \\"fair means\\" preferably but not necessarily. \\"Julian Carax is my specialty.\\" Daniel runs to warn Clara of the possible danger and discovers her under the \\"sweat-glazed buttocks\\" of a lover closer to her age. His boyhood crush ... crushed, Daniel finds some refuge in the friendship of a gregarious wino named Fermin. Daniel recruits Fermin to work in his father's bookshop and provide unfortunate comic relief.<br /><br />To protect his precious copy of \\"The Shadow of the Wind,\\" Daniel returns it to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books. Then he and Fermin launch an investigation into the unhappy, truncated life of Julian Carax. They are dogged by fascist police and haunted by the book-burner, who calls himself Lain Coubert -- \\"a name he borrows from the last novel by Julian Carax -- who, to cap it all, is none other than the Prince of Darkness.\\"<br /><br />All the critical comparisons of Zafon's \\"Shadow\\" to Marquez and Borges serve only to raise suspicions that critics haven't read Marquez or Borges.

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Great show! The bonus features on the Blu-ray set are fantastic and really give you a detailed look into how the vast world of &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; is brought to life.
B00A2FSSHK|1.0|After re-booting the Roku and continuing with the same problem, I logged in on my laptop, thinking - worse case- I would connect the laptop to the TV with HDMI cable. Nope, Amazon said we couldn't watch it on two devices. Therefore, we couldn't watch it on one. Whatever. So much for family movie night: angry! $3.99 and family night wasted until Amazon makes it right, which will probably require hours of my time on hold.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|An outstanding movie!  I would recommend this movie for all ages.  Great prelude to the Lord of the Rings trilogy.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This story was very engaging in its premise for the power of love, the possible repercussions of time travel, as well as the eventualities of having such power.  Such decisions are far beyond even Stephen King's attempt at story telling.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I never seen the actual show till it was recommended now I'm hooked on it. You should def watch this.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I felt immersed in the places & times by the wonderful use of detail. Character development was amazing. A great read!

B009LDD5E0|2.0|Here in the UK I have just watched an episode of glee,series 4 I believe it was episode 18<br />It was the episode where Becky apparently got hold of Sues's gun that she had apparently taken into school which in itself is ludicrous.<br /><br />Considering the scenes of total uproar and heartbreak that we have seen on the tv of late of morons going into schools and shooting and killing many children, I think this episode was extremely inappropriate and it should never have been aired.<br />I enjoy watching Glee with my daughter,well I have up to now but it made me extremely angry,the powers that be should have been so insensitive as to what has been happening of late, and of course what happened in Dunblane all those years ago.<br />Because it happened does not mean to say that  it should be shown in a tv programme as happening there.<br />I understand that the episode is part of a series,but I firmly believe that it was totally unacceptable to air it.<br />My heart went out to families that have lost children and relatives in these shootings<br />It was all I could do to watch it and I have not been personally affected,what about the people that were?

B00BFUUMO8|3.0|I absolutely love the freedom of arranging your park. This game really is a lot of fun and there's always something for you to do. However, a huge percentage of the items you'll want to acquire can't be bought with coins, which you can earn fee, but are only able to be purchased with dollars - and lots of them. Since dollars accumulate VERY slowly, you can either write these items off altogether or pay out $45 for one dinosaur! I'm extremely disappointed in this element of the game and am sure that it will be the annoyance that causes me to stop playing soon. I want more decorations, buildings, and dinosaurs for coins!! Also, the aquatic level is a distraction since it uses the same coin bank as the island level and pays out very little for completing missions. At least do away with the bouncing exclamation point... I don't want to feel harassed about it. Overall a fantastic game, but one of the most expensive I've come by if you  want to have the good stuff.  For that reason they lose 2 stars from me. Get it together guys... we want the stuff!
B009GQ57ES|5.0|If you don't have this album, you need to buy it. It is hands down the best album I have heard all year. Themes range from very real and dark to very uplifting and joyous. Macklemore is the man.

B008N9AAQ4|5.0|Stunning, thought provoking visuals from around the world accompanied by music that blends well with the scenes. There are a couple of scenes that some may find disturbing, like my wife, of slaughter houses. One scene that I was asking myself &#34;how the *H* does this fit in with the rest&#34;, a guy smearing clay over his face and head. Absolutely weird and didn't fit in, the director should have tossed it in the bin. Other than that, a totally enjoyable experience. The audio and video quality are as good as you can get, short of the new 4k format coming out soon. I highly recommend for those who like seeing life from around the world, as well as some nature.
B0025UHKNS|1.0|Ordered the watch for my husband and he found it very hard to use.  The bezel sometimes would not react to his touch and other times would over react.

B007FEFLTO|4.0|I am interested in this book because it brings us back in history and reminds us how different the populations reacted to the time of war and how people were treated. Sections in the book allow us to follow the settlement of families in different countriesandhow they survived.

B00CW665VI|5.0|I didn't know how I would feel about a book all from a man's point of view but I was so surprised!  I laughed so hard reading this book.  I fell in love with Drew and I loved Kate just as much.  This is a must read!
B00BN2NQFU|3.0|When I first saw this advertised I expected something amazing. James Cameron and Cirque Du Soleil what more could you ask for? Well plot wise there is not much of a story. Yes I have seen Cirque Du Soleil live and thought this would carry over on video. It does not transfer so well
B0043URV5U|5.0|The price was very right & the service great.  I highly recommend this seller......never realized Bob had so many wonderful hits....a delight to reall rock out to!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was so amazing, I almost cried when I finished it. It was truly a masterpiece. It has everything building up on top of one another, and that can be hard to do!!!! Percy and Annabeth are back, along with new characters that add life and pizzaz to the story, and the plot was beautiful to read. I purposely read it really slowly (which is rare) just so it would last longer. Get this book, and you won't regret it at all. If you like mythology or fantasy, or both, you will Love this book.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I am a fan of the original movies and series.  I like TNG, but I love the reboot that Abrams started in 2009.  The new actors are completely believable as the original Enterprise crew and I love that we get to see them when they're younger.<br /><br />This movie has everything you want in Star Trek:<br /><br />-Humor: some great comedy moments between Spock, Kirk, and McCoy. And the actors keep all of the mannerisms we associate with these characters made famous by the original actors.<br /><br />-A little romance: yes, Uhura and Spock are still dating.<br /><br />-Lots and lots of action, but not mindless action.  Every scene in this movie has a purpose<br /><br />-A nice twist at the end, but I think it added to the character development. (and no I won't spoil it.)<br /><br />-You really get to see the relationship between Kirk and Spock grow.<br /><br />Another thing I love about this movie is we see Kirk develop into the captain we are familiar with, and was made famous by William Shatner.  Kirk is still new to the captain's chair and is a bit reckless, which gets him into trouble with Starfleet.  However, when sent on a secret mission he soon finds that he has been pulled into a web of lies and deceit.  In order to save his crew and a bunch of innocent people, Kirk soon learns what it truly means to be captain of a ship--something Pike had been trying to teach him--and he discovers how much he is willing to sacrifice to save his crew.<br /><br />So, don't believe the negative reviews.  This is a great movie and has everything you want in a Star Trek film.  It moves right along--not a single boring moment. And it ties a lot of holes that were left by the original series and movies--as in you see the character develop into the ones we love, but it also brings us right up to their five year mission, which is where the series began anyway.<br /><br />Go to it. You'll be glad you did.

B0041LG08U|4.0|Really Enjoying this watch, my first automatic.  Keeps very good time, I have not noticed it drifting after two weeks.  Very handsome, and 42mm face was not too big for my small wrists.  Overall very pleased with the watch itself, however the band is a weakness.<br /><br />I had the watch randomly fall off while walking, because a pin in the band came loose, and it was not one that was touched when it was adjusted to my wrist.  I have heard of other Seiko's having similar quality issues with the band.  A bit disappointed because the fall scratched the watch, luckily not the face, but still unacceptable.  Will be replacing the band, but as a timepiece very good!

B0014JLYS8|1.0|I work in a restaurant and was recommended by all of my co-workers to get a pair of bistro crocs. I had even tried on several pairs and liked how comfortable they were, and noticed that they were surprisingly slip-resistant in both water and oil. I bought this pair of crocs and was immediately disappointed at the lack of slip-resistance. They were even more prone to slipping than normal tennis shoes. I noticed that these were made in Mexico and that the others I had tried on were made in China, which seemed to be made out of a more spongy material. This seemed to be the only difference in the two, but turned out to be a very important one. Don't buy these if you are looking for a non-slip shoe. Stick to the Mario Batali!!
B009T8XBBO|5.0|I've loved this game for a long time on the pc, so I was very glad to see it as the FAOtD. The only downside is it's hard to see on a smaller screen. But still, a very fun game!

0765325950|4.0|I love this series.  You have to love it to read so many books.  I love the characters.  I miss them and I'm sad that there will be no more stories about them.  I wish I had the ability to write another story using them.  The only things I seem able to write are books on sports, memoirs of my life, and opinions.  I can't write fiction, wish I could.<br /><br />I had a big problem with this book, and I didn't see it mentioned in the reviews I read here.  It was major for me.  There were way too many cliffhangers followed by a change of subject.  It annoyed me a lot.  Many chapters ended with one of our beloved characters in a real pickle, and then the chapter ended and the author cut away to someone else.  I found it gimmicky and the work of a hack writer.  In other respects the writing was much better.  But this manipulative treatment of the reader really did annoy me.<br /><br />Our hero suddenly is attacked by a bad guy, the blade is at his throat, and .... and .... end of chapter, switch to somebody else, make the reader fret about it, unable to avoid turning more pages, until the reader actually forgets what happened to the poor character, and then we find out that it's all ok, nothing to worry about, our hero survived.  Come on now, that is not good literature.<br /><br />If you sit down and analyze the way the story ends, you may have problems with it.  What happened to the Dark One?  What did Rand do?  How was the whole conflict resolved?  If you think about it, you might just end up with \\"Hey, wait a minute, is that it?\\"  The fact is, we are given a resolution to the problems.  Do we really need to analyze that resolution and see if it is satisfying?  Problem solved, move on?<br /><br />Are we okay with Rand and his three wives and how that was left unresolved?  I'm not.  I would have preferred a resolution to that.<br /><br />In general I don't want to let these people go.  I want more of them.  I care about them.  Bring them back.  I really wish I could write about them.  I wish I had talent to be a novelist.ite about them.  I wish I had talent to be a novelist.

1935251740|5.0|I'm a little surprised to see such a variance in ratings for this, but I suspect it may be more from people resisting some of the ideas instead of simply enjoying the discussion. Robert Lanza is obviously very talented and smart, and he is a great person to learn more about - so take the time to expose yourself to all of the work he has published, including other books/articles and his website/twitter feed. I enjoyed this book mainly because it was a great way to open my mind to alternative thoughts and theories about reality and our experience of life. I never approach material like this with any preconceived notions - I just love to see what great thinkers have to say and I try to stay open-minded about things that may seem \\"out there\\" to others. He mixes science with some personal stories as he explains his theories, and you can tell he relishes his role of challenging the establishment (mainly the physics community as a whole) while he does this. I enjoyed every page and I look forward to keeping up with the future works from a true maverick of thought like Dr. Lanza.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|It's a very nice calculator to have when you're on a rush to do craft designs...how much material needed on certain projects and many other uses. I do recommend...I do have to eeliminate from my cell and reinstall on my kindle because my android doesn't  carry much memory...otherwise it would have been great on my cell also. Thanks! It was free today.u

B000063WDH|4.0|As a big fan of The Black Keys, this album is very good.  In an era of terrible music being produced everyday, The Black Keys are a breath of fresh air!
B00CEB5QU2|5.0|I purchased this over an iUSB adapter that sells for about $40 more. And this has more features! You connect up to 3 devices to this via wifi. I connected an iPhone5, iPad 2nd Gen, and Samsung Note 8 to it at the same time. I had originally posted you did not have internet out when connected to the device, but you can bridge an internet wifi through the device so while your phone or tablet are connected to it, you still have data/internet.<br /><br />I streamed three different videos to each device with no lag from a thumbdrive I had plugged into the Kingston mobile wireless device. You have to download an App from the iTunes or GooglePlay stores to use this. But then you have options of transferring files, streaming video or music, or moving photos around. Just as a test I killed the hotspot while streaming, and to my surprise my videos kept playing for about another 30 seconds. So it has some nice buffering to prevent lag. The nice thing about this device is you can stream USB devices, or SD Cards. My next test is to try a USB hub or multi USB cable and see if I can use multiple USB devices with this. Oh, and one other little tidbit.. This acts as a USB charger also!! Yeah, you can charge from this. I charged my iphone5 from it as well. So its a great little device and the price is right. You can't go wrong! I also own a Seagate GoFlex Satellite which is similiar except it only streams items copied directly to its hard drive.<br />Bottom Line --- > This is a winner!!!
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|Exceptional writing transfers to the small screen adeptly. New glimpses into the world of Hannibal and Will Graham lend new depth and texture to an already magnificent archetype for the genre. In this case, more does indeed tend to be better, as the story travels ever closer to the details we already know and love. There is a growing trend of increased graphic violence on television, and Hannibal may have taken the vanguard in this respect. If you are susceptible to shocking imagery, then this is probably your cup of tea, but make no mistake, the gore is not there to mask poor writing or story lines, rather it is the seasoning that brings to life this amazing thirteen course meal. Bon appetit!
B000CDIOYO|5.0|i was at first taken back by the modernist staging, so unlike the usual baroque church<br />setting. but then changed my idea. the stark white multi-platform arrangement<br />provides a striking contrast with the visuals of all the performers. the up-close<br />face-only focus occasionally throughout enhances appreciation of the vocalists'<br />virtuoso performances (as in the exquisite rendition of the contralto solo<br />\\"buss und reu\\" with its contrasting sudden movement from  tragic to joyful<br />as julia hamari's subtle facial expressions reflect the delightful instrumental<br />for the words \\"dass die tropfen meiner zaheren/angenehme spezerei\\" and<br />the soprano-contralto \\"so ist mein jesu nun gefangen\\" with the remarkable<br />double profiles of helen donath and ms. hamari.) finally the huge white cross<br />suspended over all (the only explicitly religious image throughout) illustrates<br />the lutheran doctrine of the cross as salvation for the repentant sinner as<br />in the johannespassion, \\"heilt, ihr angefochtnen seelen - wohin - nach golgotha).

B00C1BUYX4|3.0|Speilberg once again colors history to meet his own agendas.  While the actors were very good I found the historical content  of this movie lacking. The sole reason for the Civil War and even major reason for the Civil War wasn't slavery. Speilberg's narrow views really could be adjusted to be historically correct .
1592537251|5.0|Lots a great drawings and comments by the artist. Specialized to use urban sketchers which is fine. Niche book comes to mind. The artists make it look so easy and getting the perspective, composition and color right is anything but easy. There's a lot of hard work in this book! Looking forward to book two. My goal is to get into an edition, maybe book three!
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|This book was just as good if not better than the last one. Can't wait for House of Hades. Riordan always leaves us hanging (this time literately)!

B004MC8CA2|1.0|I've been using this app for my smart phone for over 1 year and enjoyed it immensely.  However, when I attempted to sync my smart phone account/profile to the kindle app, it repeatable gives me an error message related to my email account.  The error is not accurate as I verified my information numerous times.  Therefore, I've been unable to enjoy this app on the larger screen of my kindle since it will not correctly sync.  Perhaps a bug fix is in order?
B00005JN8Z|5.0|I have been watching this movie ever since I was a child.  I met Deborah Kerr in person twice.  What a lady!
0385474547|5.0|I read this book while writing a paper for a friend and I did like it except for the end part where the main act committed suicide. The book does give a lot of insight in traditional life in Western Africa and the introduction of Christianity and the presence of the White man in their midst.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It is Better than going to the website on my kindle. It is a lot faster and syncs alot better
B00AJLHUA8|4.0|Sinister is one interestingly scary movie. It keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire movie, even when you it the second time.
B0043GAZYS|4.0|For every old school video game lover, this movie is for you.  Very creative film for teen love story...with video game themes.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It's nice to access FB on my Kindle Fire rather than my smart phone since the display is larger.  However, similar to the smart phone app, it is limited in it's capabilities when interacting with wall posts.  You still need to share posts/links via computer.
B00BMTX2QM|5.0|This album is the funeral of the one of a kind Cathedral. I've been into this band since first seeing the video Ride on headbangers ball, way back in 93. Cathedral come full circle back to where they began. This is dark, depressing, funeral doom, with just the right amount of cathredal weirdness thrown in. This album is a slow burner. It takes a few listens to sink in and it truly has the aura of being the last of its kind. What a way for this band to go out. Lee dorian stated that he hates happy endings. Cathedral are really a band that you either get or you dont. I haven't seen much of a middle ground. For those of you new to Cathedral, they have an extensive back catalogue. Im going to enjoy the walk down The Last Spire for the forseeable future.
B00CJVZB5W|5.0|his tunes  just keep getting better with age....keep humming till I am able to remember the words. I have a weakness for a guy with a raspy voice.
B005LAII08|5.0|Just another wonderful movie for kids and adults. They all have a wonderful story. I don't remember how many times we have watched it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|As all his books, simply compelling! Riveting, Impossible to put down for very long, makes you feel as you are in the story itself.
B00008O31H|4.0|The Black Keys are definitely one of the best bands performing today.  Their combination of rock and blues has been very good!
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Better than expected.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes Joe.  My husband has not stopped playing it since his Birthday.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is a very well put together  game with very few flaws. It has not crashed  on me but maybe twice. It is a great way to pass the time as well as possibly learn something about dinosaurs.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I have played this game for years and still enjoy it. the games keep the mind sharp and with the touch screen it helps with dexterity.

B00COHAUD4|4.0|I'm not the right person to ask because my wife made me watch it. She loved Mama, it was good for a horror movie but I never chose to watch them on my own.

B003ODIZL6|1.0|.<br /><br />Good<br />Stuff here. I find it annoying/ you are required to review something before you have even gotten to use it.
B008Y1YJZY|5.0|I loved it as much as my granddaughter. We have watched it 5 or 6 times already and will watch it again with her
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|This is the best 3D blu-ray of the 12 I now own.  The effect is outstanding on my Samsung 46&#34; TV -- better than what I experienced in the theater when the movie was first released.  I'm having difficulty waiting for the second half to come out.  I may save the theater ticket money and just wait for the blu-ray.  It is that good.

B00CCZ4BFQ|4.0|It was awesome to hear that Tom still sounds fairly the same! Really nice to have a new CD from him! Great music!
B008QE9VJI|5.0|I love everyone of his movies. I am so happy to watch it over and over. The cast is wonderful
B00CL50KDY|5.0|Great movie, with a great twist on the old zombie story line. Yes the zombie's still eat people, but you get to hear their view of being a zombie.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|Seems these days, I buy an album and end up really only listening to two or three songs from it. Not so with this album--I listen to every song regularly. First album I've felt compelled to write a response to. If you like cello music, I don't know how you couldn't love this.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Been looking for another good series to watch and this one is just what I was hoping for. Can't stop watching it...
B0063M22QO|3.0|It is good if you are a beginner wanting to try Mah Jong. It would be better of it had a scoring system.
630233683X|5.0|Never received movie from the seller. But, I have seen the movie before and it is a great movie. Worth the price and worth the watch. Hope to own it myself soon.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|I only watch two shows on TV, Dexter and the few episodes of Sherlock Holmes (British version) so maybe my exposure to shows is minimal, but I love Dexter.  This season has been great, though there are a few things I think could have been done better.  Without any spoilers, I think they are rotating some characters through this season much more than previous seasons.  They introduce what seem to be longer-term characters and suddenly the characters stop being a part of the story.<br /><br />The other glaring issue is that I am not as convinced about some of the methods being used to hide Dexter's secret life from the authorities.  The Miami Metro police seem to solve really tough crimes in the show but bumble any time they get something that could expose Dexter because of some simple little diversion that was used.<br /><br />In a similar vein, the side story with Quinn is also a bit tough to believe that he would get away with his dealings.<br /><br />Despite a few complaints (which I could come up with for every season and every other show on TV), I still love this show and season 7 doesn't disappoint.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|One of my favorite shows of all time. Just wish there were more episodes. Still doesn't get old, can watch it anytime.
B007STXHTM|4.0|I found it is sold $10.00 less on the official go pro website after I received it.  I should have ordered it directly.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I like the game but think the level of dificulty might be discouraging to some. A begginers level would really raise my oppinion.<br /><br />Recommended for players that have experience in playing Mah Jong and love a challenge.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My students very much enjoyed this book. It was made more interesting by reading it on the PC and therefore being able to show students how to use this type of electronic resource.
B00111WSNO|5.0|This is a very cool presented set of discs, and the songs sounds great. It contains the whole metal opera story and has lots of photos and information about Tobias Samet and his group.
B009GX7IRA|3.0|The final episode was not very intriguing.  The writing is a bit stale.  Do we all need a break?  How many times can McGee and Abby trace someone through cell phones and computers?
B00BIVN82M|4.0|Best CD he has done in a while.  The selection of songs and the orchestration of the songs was great.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Getting the weapon control to work as you want it to, takes some practice.<br />Overall a good Dongeon crawl.<br />Very good graphics.
B00AK0X5VQ|3.0|If you want to drop your kindle because you fell asleep, This is absolutely the game for you.  The graphics are very pretty and nicely done but watching a bubble drift agonizingly slow across the universe is up to you.  I rate it a 3 star just because it is visually soothing.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Could not put it down.  Had unexpected twists all the way thru.  A lot more realism in the courtroom scenes than most.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Every woman should read this book, whether you are working or not.  I am recommending it to all my friends and family.
B000ZM1MG4|4.0|Enjoyed the movie - that's why I purchased the DVD.  Wish there was a little more in the extras section.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|it takes too much time to play......it is not really child friendly. and  it got boring quickly. I am glad it was a free app.
B006C1DH92|5.0|My son and I can set and play for hours together. Its some nice father son time. Also a great time killer if your just ever bored.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Exciting with great entertainment value, plays a little loosely with the facts. A good look back at a part of history I had forgotten.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Such a great courageous story!! I really enjoyed reading this book. Hard to understand at first, as it is written from a child's view. Once you get into it, it's easy to understand though.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Play this constantly! Bring on more levels please! Love the graphics and sound. Some levels fun & easy and some will make you crazy! Highly recommended
B002U3CCF6|3.0|The book is good, it reads nicely, and the story is good. Nevertheless I read first Gone Girl from the same author and I thought it was an amazing book, the way it's written, they way it takes you through the story, the story itself. So, If I compare both books, this one is not as good as the other one. Maybe it's because this one was written first, I don't know, the book is good but to the same level as the other one.<br />What I cannot deny is that the author knows how to write.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Although sometimes it was tedious to read, it was worth it and more.  The struggles of these characters are still going on today and our understanding is just as limited.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I love it! Quick and easy to use. Customize able and looks beautiful! Performs way better than any other keyboard I have ever used.
1426209584|5.0|Great coffee table-sized book with beautiful pictures of the various birds of paradise.  It is much more than a picture book though and provides details on habitat, diet, geneology and much more.  A must have book for bird lovers.
B001P1MZNI|5.0|This is Sinatra at his best.  The energy and charisma radiate through the music and the banter.  The Count Basie Orchestra is phenomenal, their electric energy and razor sharp precision illustrate the clearly superior difference between music made by human beings playing actual instruments in a live space to computers generating electronic noises trough speakers.  The biggest surprise of this album is the sound quality, it sounds like a modern recording and that's what makes this a real gem.  There are old recordings from the Beatles, the Who and The Rolling Stones that don't have 1/4 the fidelity that this one does, so buy it now.
B000H5U832|5.0|I have never seen this movie so when it arrived so quickly I was happy to open the securely wrapped package and watch the clear picture of this amazing movie with my son.  This is his new favorite Disney movie.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I ordered this book and thought it seemed like a familiar story and went in to my study and found the hard cover!!<br /><br />I finished it anyway as it is REALLY good!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love to play this game....the bright screens are very colorful....while playing  i get excited....it's exciting!!!!!!!!!!it's not just a game for the kids......
B001K3KK0Q|3.0|I liked it better in 1974. After seeing the new version in 3D, this one was kind of boring. yawn.
0439813786|4.0|I've read this book several times, and each time I read it, it gets better. The use of pictures and text makes you feel like your read/watching a movie (which is ironic because that's a big part of the book). This book is about a young boy named Hugo Cabret who loses his father in a fire. His drunken uncle took care of him for a short period of time, but died because of alcohol related problems. Hugo now lives all alone in the train station where he tends to the clocks. He faces the notorious station inspector, who has been trying to catch him, and a bookworm-like girl who might reveal his secret. I recommend this book to anyone who loves a good mystery.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|We played for a little while, all directions need to be read to get the &#34;next steps&#34;. Seemed pretty boring, waiting for things to grow. Didn't play very long.
B0063GORYU|5.0|and I'm a Spider junkie!  I discovered it in the late 90's; 15 years averaging AT LEAST 5 games per, I'd say around 25K games, almost all on four suits.<br /><br />So the first app I found and loaded on my new KFHD was this one.  It was far from perfect, and there's that annoying ad screen, but mostly ok.  Since then, new Spider apps have proliferated.  I've sampled some, but none were any better.<br /><br />(Pet peeve: many card game developers seem to think it's a great idea to show just one, big suit symbol on the card faces. Guess it's easier to see the suit, but I hate it!  With traditional faces, you can read the number of the card based on the symbol pattern, even using peripheral vision.  That's more important in Spider, even if you have to take a closer glance to check the suit.  Anyway, the new upgrade on this app gives you either option - very nice!)<br /><br />Anyway, I came back here for some reason, and saw that they were offering a free update to the app. I'm not going into much detail as I'm late for work, and I want to get a few more games in, but these folks have been busy!  They've polished this thing into an absolute jewel of an app.  I warn you, best to keep away! If you're the addictive type, you may end up wasting a ridiculous chunk of your short time on earth playing Spider!<br /><br />Edit:  Yeah, there's still an ad screen.  But even that has more variety, and - like the rest of the upgraded site - it just has a silky smooth feel it lacked previously.<br /><br />There are also some nice new settings.  One I haven't tried yet is the \\"winning deal\\".  I assume it means that, if you select that option, it won't deal you a game that can't be won.  How cool is that?  Tough algorithm to write, I bet.  But I guess, based on some reviews I've seen, that unwinnable games can be frustrating for newer players, and so the devs addressed it.<br /><br />One of the few negatives of Spider is that there is an element of luck, and it does require some educated guesswork.  Maybe next time they'll provide an optional deal to eliminate that too!ed guesswork.  Maybe next time they'll provide an optional deal to eliminate that too!
1612183956|4.0|This is the 2nd book I've read by Crouch, the first being Abandoned.  I didn't review that one but should have; it too was very good.  So here I am reviewing Pines.  It's a good sci-fy/mystery novel...I'm actually not sure what genre it fits best, but whatever the case, it's well written.<br /><br />As in Abandon, Crouch does a great job with the setting descriptions.  Abandon was surperbly described as Old West ghost town, and this in an isolated community, someplace. I will leave it at that for fear of spoiling it.<br /><br />His characters are well written, some more thoroughly then others.  The book felt a bit long, but not too bad. Some reviewers felt the ending was open ended.  I didn't see it that way.  Its meant to be a series and he has clearly set it up for more, which is fine by me.  Its that good.  It does have the feel of a Twilight Zone episode, and on that note I suggest you read past what appears to be the end.  There is and Epilogue.<br /><br />This one is similar in style to a Michael Crichton novel, so if you liked the excellent work of the late Mr. C., you should enjoy this one.  Bascially, I really like Crouch's writing style and will try a few more of his.<br /><br />I definitely recommend it.
B008FC4WA4|3.0|This short really made me think about the other side of news stories, but left me wanting to know more about the end of the story. I always enjoy Nick Hornby s writing.
0783230079|4.0|I saw this movie several years ago and it came to mind recently so I bought it.  It's a good, clean movie.  I'm glad I own it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is one fabulous app.  Even though I am a sheet rat at heart, it's almost pleasant to wake up to this alarm.  Being able to choose from my own music to be my alarm is such a cool feature.  Thanks for a great app.
B00BEIN9VO|5.0|I bought this for my best friend for her birthday and needless to say, she loves it. it was the best purchase made this so far.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is very simple but lots of fun and very addictive. It really helps pass the time when i have some down time.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|I really enjoyed this challenging game, I did not want to put it down, I play for hours until my Kindle battery said charge me, re-charge and continue playing, now I will go back and play again on the advanced levels.

B008602KQI|5.0|This film is full of excitement and adventure.the protagonist, Catness Everdeen, makes for a brave, love able, rebellious character. She and her friends take on the dismall conditions of Americas future with courage and a new, brighter future! It was well acted and beautiful direction.  This is not a film for small children but should be viewed by EVERYONE!!!!!!!
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|This was a great movie. I'm not a big fan of Tom Cruise, but he sure did good in this film!
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this challenging game, each level of the Tree of Life is mystical and very enjoyable, this is a great game and is alot like Jewel Quest.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Get it because it is the best books ever written in the history of the whole wide world and universe
B005LAII4E|1.0|I really liked the first G.I. Joe movie and have been waiting for the sequel for some time. What a disappointment! I will not ruin it for those who have not seen it. My recommendation is if you want to see the movie, wait for it on Netflicks and save yourself some money.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing story! Can't wait to read the rest. Suzanne did a fabulous job. You will be truly captivated by Katniss' story.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Too long for me.  It could have been two books, but was as good as any of the others.<br />I think I liked this book best because of all the major events.
B008I3R2VG|3.0|After all of the 5 Star ratings and rave reviews, I felt a little let down. I don't think that this album was terrible, but not nearly as good as their previous albums.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|The Alchemist is an accomplishment of the sort that any person can be touched by deep within their heart. The story of Santiago's journey to discover himself and his true purpose reaches deep into the philosophies that have piqued human beings for millenniums. In under 200 pages, Mr Coelho puts forth a humble, objective, undeniably well argued theory on the intricacies and meaning of life itself. Religion is not discussed in this book of a practice of certainty, or as the end all of theory, rather it plays a role as the facilitator between human beings and the soul, the ambiguous connection that all things in creation share.<br /><br />Christians, Muslims, atheists, spiritualists and absolutely everyone in between can learn something from the simple yet profound characters in this book.
B0009K7ESW|5.0|These are a great series of short films in which Yo-Yo Ma collaborates with different kinds of artists to make work to the 6 Bach Cello Suites.  My favorite has to be # 5, a collaboration with a famous Kabuki artist.  And #2 with the Mark Morris Dance Group is not to be missed either.  Great for any fan of Bach, Yo-Yo Ma, or great artistic collaborations!
B004DNWPY4|3.0|&#34;Live below your means&#34; - normally it is &#34;within your means&#34;, but this book proves why below is better. Its mainly statistical, with some examples of how wealth is accrued at different levels. Surprisingly boring, but straight and frank.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|In some ways this is easier to use then on on my laptop. Great to do a quick check.<br />Y
B009FOBMBI|4.0|Music is one part there and one part here and one part jazz.  These guys are like the new or the old, depending on how you go.
1451695195|5.0|Enjoyed this. I take the view no one has to agree with EVERYTHING, and I truly enjoyed he took the time to explain the depth of his illness and all of it. Just loved it
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Every track is a winner. It's uplifting and fun and great music to drive to! This is band is new to the scene (this is their first album) and I look forward to more music from them!
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|Cirque du Soleil fans will rave about this release. It is parts of many previous shows and highlights the wonderful circus acts of old done to the innovative design and music of Cirque Du Soleil's creative staff. Great movie and good for the collector of Cirque shows.
B004TI1WME|5.0|We enjoyed using this app. The size of the keys is great.Love that you can see the tape while you are working.
B000XR4OC0|5.0|I LOVE TOMS! Currently I have 5 pairs. None of them have any damage and I've had one pair for 7 months. They are true to size, except for the crochets. If you are buying crochets order a 1/2 size smaller. LOVE THEM!
B004LROUNG|5.0|I enjoyed this story and also how the guy seemed to find himself and his path by the end of the story.
B0097PW7H8|5.0|I really like this product cause it gives you options to save power so now Mr. Me can have more time.
B003YBUSMW|2.0|Would not recommend.Not responsive but on the plus side the paddle shifters are not to bad but everything else seemed cheaply made and plastic. I got this because the thrustmaster I wanted for my xbox did not work with the Xbox. That wheel felt alot better and looked better it was just better.Sadly it was for pc and I have an xbox. So if you really really dislike your controller then spend a little money to get  fanatec wheel
B0088P2A7A|3.0|This does not work as well as Silk. You do not not get as much information and the layout is not as good either.
B00AQKEPMI|4.0|I don't normally like cartoon like movies. However, this is one that EVERYONE should get! This is a 3D collection must! Also the kids will love it!<br />Shipped fast. But was slightly slow on the shipping side!<br />Overall worth the price. But I will have to give this less than 5 stars due to shipping.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I love her take on violin, and her love of music shows in her performance.<br />watch her you-tube videos, she's great!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I've had this app for a month now and I love it! It lets you know how long you have to do different activities.it's definitely a must have for kindle fire.
1593080409|5.0|My sister got this for Christmas, she loves getting books for Christmas and I was able to give her 5 for the price of 1.
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|I saw the movie in 3D and checked out the pre-releases.  So now Disney is only selling the 3D version and one has to pay extra to include the 2D disc!!!  Really.  I haven't seen anyone else do this?  Every other 3D movie has included the 2D version.  So, it appears Disney is the pioneer of this fiasco.  Shame on Disney.  I will not buy this product until they come out w/the 'normal' version like everyone else sells.  A lot of the movies now are available at this price as UV also, and Disney doesn't offer that either.  Really, if this continues, I might just drop Disney products altogether.  Pathetic.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game totally rocked. About a quarter way through the game you have a choice of paying money or coins to keep playing, but YOU HAVE TO KEEP PLAYING! This game is addicting and so much fun to play. However I do not recommend playing this in the dark because it can get creepy! Over all I completely love this game and can't wait for the second one!:)
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Ever since I started to play it I couldn't put it down this game is beautiful and very good storyline keeps you wanting more. It looks wonderful and works perfect on my kindle fire hd. I would recommend this game to anyone you have to buy it and play it. Well worth the money.
B000XUBF3I|5.0|This book has changed my life. I no longer look at doing chores as a painful obligation, but as an opportunity to bless my family. Just the outlook I needed and has helped me keep our home clean and a happy place to be.
B000TGCR38|5.0|Loved the movie.  Have been to the region so it was nice to see a movie set in the location.
B00632HWOG|4.0|This is working fine so far on my Kindle Fire.  No frills, just good access to my email account.  All I need.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|My husband is a weather around the world nut.  He checks the weather every day in Nevada, California, Arizona, Comiso, Italy and who knows where else.  If it keeps him happy, OK!
B00C7JAAH0|4.0|Another great album by lady antebellum. If you enjoy their previous albums you won't be disappointed. Great music for road trips.
B009MYARIK|4.0|I was waiting for a new book from her. It was not as good as her other books, I could see the ending happening. But a good read, not one I couldn't put down though.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Like an idiot, I bought the first book by itself thinking that I didn't want to shell out all of the money for the trilogy if I'm not gonna like it!  My advice: BY THE TRILOGY- Save the money!!!  I can't wait for the movie!  It's like a modern day fairy tale (for adults only - OF COURSE)!  LOVE IT!
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|A president tries to cover up a scandal to preserve her legacy.  For every move, however, CTU has a countermove.  Season 8 is like a chess game with bullets, bombs, and other nonstop action.  We see Jack go to extremes never seen before--just when it looked like he might get to have a normal life for a while!
B0034CNSFU|5.0|This Jimi Hendrix album is the best of his hits collection in one cd. To listen is to remember The best of your &#34;flower child&#34; days :-)
B002ZG997M|5.0|I loved the movie, it's definitely worth every penny. A nice addition to any action /drama collection.<br />Thanks for reading
B007SGM084|5.0|I read all three books.  It's like a modern day fairy tale (for adults only - OF COURSE)! I loved it!
B003ZJ70W4|4.0|Sex And The City 2 was just that... 'second' to the first.  It's nearly impossible to match or exceed the initial movie.  Sequels usually fall on the sword using cliche' lines along with dropping flat on story lines within the movie.  (What the heck happened to Smith Jerrod?!?  One is led to believe that he will be far more prominent in the movie than he was...  just kind of 'disappeared' after initally seen.  ...awkward.)  Anyway... the movie Does give a few really good laughs, and does pull at the reality of life for [us] gracefully aging women as well as depicts sadly accurately life for women in the mideast.  (You can Own New York High Fashion... but you cannot Show New York High Fashion.)  The move was well worth the $5 I paid for it!  Grab some fresh popcorn and a beverage and just lose yourself in the fun of the movie!  Great way to pass the time on a rainy day!
B000003TAR|1.0|Did you know? The band originally considered giving this album the title \\"Verse Chorus Verse.\\" For the sake of truth in advertising, they should have stuck with it.
B004ZMWUCU|2.0|Was disappointed as I thought the book was written for a young teen audience.  In my view the story line was weak and so easy to figure out, it did not hold my interest.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I've read all three books and want more!  Can't wait for the movie!  Modern day fairy tale (for adults only - OF COURSE)!
B0089EHWQE|3.0|A boring book. You knew ahead of time<br />what was going to happen. It played out like<br />a fantasy story.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I've read this years ago and now my daughter recently gave it a read and enjoyed it just as much as I did. A bit of hard science. But since there was no romance in it we took a star off.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Sad but it must be read. No, you do not get a choice. This book is to romance stories as Oliver Cromwell is to kings. They perform the same duty but one is remembered more than the other. This book shall not fear oblivion, as it is entwined with the world with no true definition to a category. Not love, disease, or life book. It is simply, I suppose, the true book of the side effects of dying.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I can't wait for the movie!  It's like a modern day fairy tale (for adults only - OF COURSE)!  LOVE IT!
1439152802|3.0|very long & drawn out  and slow  It got a little boring in some spots<br />could have gotten to the ending a little sooner
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Awesome message! Can't wait to see everyone when I pass beyond this reality. Living fearlessly, yay! Thanks for sharing your story Anita!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This is a sweet story - no murders, no explosions - just a tale about characters you come to care about, and who you root for to have a happy ending. Highly recommended!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Great app that gives the player the opportunity to problem-solve and learn a bit. Great for the kids with awesome graphics.
193700788X|1.0|This is the first time I have been so disappointed in a book I actually cried when I finished. So much build up and such a let down.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|This book has got to be in the top five for me when it comes to sci-fi. It's story keeps moving at a good pace and is enjoyable to watch it unfold. It has Lots to offer interesting story arc and story building but beyond that it is the story of a man in a new life in an inhospitable universe with the hint of finding true love again. It's a must read for any one who likes the movie starship troopers and military movies because it has that type of vibe but it is so much more. I recommend highly.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I have been reading this series since about 1995 and love it. My only complaint with the last book is the poor epilouge. With as much time that is spent describing what people are wearing in this series, is it too much to ask what happens in the years following the Last Battle? I know most of you are going to make noises about \\"it leaves things up to the reader's imagination\\" and such but why not stop after the first book or two and \\"imagine\\" the next eleven or so books yourself? It's just damned frustrating is all I'm saying. So that is my gripe, I got it off my chest and I do feel better now. Thanks for taking the time to read this review.
B00B7ERH04|4.0|Ok this app is pretty cool I mean it's the only camcorder app that's free on Amazon BUT,the app also does this,ERROR  COULDN'T RESET CAMERA,that is why it's 4 stars but I would recommend it for most kindle fire HD user's!
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I have been searching for DAYS for a calendar app I would love. Many were ugly, cluttered, too simple, too complicated, or just plain didn't work. I decided to buckle down and give Jorte a try since it's free (though I paid for a few apps already), and I am SO glad I did!<br /><br />It is simple to use, customizable with colors (it includes some visually pleasing pre-set color styles, like yellows, pinks, etc.), you can set how you want the calendar squares to look, you can add cute 'icons' (they're a lot like stickers!) to your events, and if you set anything as 'important' it will list it off to the side or at the bottom for reference for that month. I use a Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34; tablet and it looks nice... AND it can do portrait/landscape views automatically. I can look at the calendar how I want, which is so nice.<br /><br />The notification works, which is also nice. I tested it last night. You do need to explore the little buttons and menus and toy around with settings to get things just how you'd like with the various aspects of the calendar. But the audible 'alarm' works, and when I turned on my Kindle Fire, a window was open that listed my event. It looks like there's space to list multiple things in case you miss more than one alarm. I don't know if it sends notifications to your actual task bar up at the top though (for Kindle Fire users).<br /><br />Anyway, the best part is there seems to be a cloud for this calendar, which I haven't tried yet, though I signed up for it a little bit ago. It's done through your PC, and it's on a website. To people that say they cannot sync their calendar, you need to go into the app's settings and enable the cloud with your log in, and if you are trying to use Google, apparently you can reset your Kindle by shutting it down and rebooting and you can set up your google calendar. I'm not sure about that. But syncing with Google is not this app's fault. MOST calendars have that issue with Kindle Fire users that have theirKF user account not set to their google account.<br /><br />In short, I love this app. I wish people would give it the time it deserves. I am very, very happy with it!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Really, the only thing wrong with this game is that it ends. It's so good I was a little upset when I saw the ending screen. It gets everything right: story, graphics, puzzles, scope, use of tablet features (multi-touch, accelerometer, etc.).<br /><br />Like most escape games, even though here you're trying to get into something rather than out, you're thrown in with a minimum of explanation. The story reveals itself slowly over the course of the game through little notes left behind by your predecessor. A short tutorial explains the basic mechanics of the game, which if you're accustomed to point and click games in your web browser, are surprisingly immersive and intuitive. But after that, you're left to your own devices (hints are available in-game if you need them) and, with the exception of one puzzle, free to explore at your own pace. You can save at any time, assuming you can pull yourself away long enough to sleep or work or whatever else you're neglecting to play this game.<br /><br />The puzzles themselves run the gamut of laughably obvious to downright devious. All of them are logical and fair and, at worst, might involve a little digging around to find the right clue or piece. A couple even use the accelerometer, requiring you to tilt your tablet around until pieces fall into place, a solution which isn't easy to come by if you're lying back in bed playing.<br /><br />For this to be this studio's first effort is impressive. An update with additional levels is scheduled for sometime this summer, with a full sequel coming this fall, and you can bet I'll pick up both without a moment's hesitation.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is easy to understand to use and is more accurate than network news. It also keeps hazard warnings for our remote area...living in a tsunami area this is a feature we needed.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|It is fun and quick. I think this is enough. and is all you will get! or do not ask me to rate your products!
0060899220|5.0|I really enjoy Anthony Bourdain and this book is just a little bit more insight into the debauchery of the young chefs and cocky up and comers.
B0074JOCIG|5.0|Just buy it and hold it as a treasure of life... This was so amazing! I can't say enough. Just buy it!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A very cool game, definitely five stars. I really enjoyed playing The Room, and wanted to see more after finishing the first three levels. I will be eagerly looking for the next installment of The Room.
B006M4F67A|4.0|It is challenging!That's it. yee-badeebadeeba thats all folks. Yaba dabba doo! Any thing else is superfluous and ridiculous- GOT IT?
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I've been waiting for a fraction app ever since i got a smartphone, however this one exceeded my expectations due to its simplicity. Best calculation app ever I would have given it more stars if I could.
B002XHN776|5.0|I liked &#34;A Beautiful Lie&#34;.  &#34;The Kill&#34; and &#34;Battle Of One&#34; are very good.  I gave &#34;This Is War&#34; a quick listen when it came out but for some reason did not get very excited.  A month ago I gave this one several listens over Spotify and fell in love with it!  It is solid from start to finish (at least thru track 10).  It is a good mix of originality, energy, talent, and just plain good music.  Night Of The Hunger, Kings And Queens, This Is War, Hurricane and Closer To The Edge are all very good songs.  I highly recommend this to anybody that likes &#34;alternative rock with a synth edge&#34; music.
B002MTTZ5I|2.0|These guys are a cross between the musicianship of Van Halen, Judas Priest, and def leppard  with the look of Poison & montley Crue. You combine all those elements and you could get the coolest great sounding band thats able to put all those attributes together. Unforntunately these guys totally sold out to taking the easy way out by becoming a hair band gimmick with crude lyrics throughout the whole album. I mean common, i can understand 3 songs that are like that but, the entire album sounds like a porno.<br />I think SP have the talent to create great music (Michael Starr has a great rock voice that can emulate any artist, and Satchel can cover and Rock/Metal song as well) but,  This is as good as they'll get with this gimmick and quite frankly when listening to both their albums (Feel the steel and Balls out) the constant cursing and description of sexual acts gets dull. I mean they got a few musically catchy songs here that stand out because of the musicianship such as Asian hooker, Eatin aint Cheatin, Community Property, and Party all day but the rest arent that good and the crude lyrics deflates the whole album which take away from these songs.<br /> Best analogy here between steel panther and regular bands is comparing a porno to a mainstream film.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|Just wanted some games so I could enjoy my kindle Fire. I have had a hard time hard time figuring it out.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|Watched the show as a child and Loved it. Was glad to see the return of the Doctor. Good, Clean, Wholesome Family entertainment
B0063IH60K|4.0|This solitaire app is a good as any I have seen out there and you can't beat the price.  Happy to have it.
B008745B32|3.0|I felt the book was long and really boring. I couldn't get into the storyline at all with this book.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This was a great buy!  I read the entire series and loved it!  $5.00 for three books you can't beat that!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Awesome game. I had played it on facebook and it is just as fun on the kindle. I would recommend it to anyone who likes hidden object games.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I found Building Your Book for Kindle informative, easy to understand and follow, it is very helpful in getting started.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|excellent show<br /><br />fun to watch, entertaining.  if you lawyer shows and a little extra relationship drama, this is the show for you
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|its an awesome game but the only problem is that there no tilt options and the fuel keeps running out even.wen we stop.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The Room was a great game to play... didn't last as long as I had hoped... but very intriguing kept my mind constantly thinking... loved it can't wait for more rooms to come.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|If u like puzzle games you will love this app. it is a good way to pass the time. Love it!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|The first  time  I read it wasn't great. I think I skipped ahead to get to the good parts and then I felt cheated. I just finished it a second time and read every word. Loved it. So glad I read it a second time. I'm ready for the third book!
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|What's the deal with meaningless titles? They annoy me. The title has no more to do with the movie than it could have to many movies. Like The Empire Strikes Back could have been called Into Darkness, and it would have held more meaning to the actual movie than this one. I get that it sounds cool, but, seriously, the title (of anything) ought to relate to the thing that's being titled in more than some vague way.<br /><br />Past that, though, the movie was pretty awesome. Abrams  knows how to bring the action and keep you tense and on the edge of your seat. And, hey, there was no red matter, this time, so double plus good. Without giving anything away, I loved best the role reversal of Spock and Kirk. That was pretty awesome.<br /><br />I have only two negatives (other than the title) at this point:<br />1. I do not want to see \\"old Spock\\" pop up in every movie as their tiny \\"god in a box.\\" I get that the fans love seeing Nimoy (I do; I get it), but, from a story perspective, it's gonna get old if they always contact him when they're in trouble.<br />2. As much as I love Simon Pegg and love Simon Pegg as Scotty, he is the one character that doesn't quite feel right. he has moments where he feels like Scotty but, most of the time, the character seems off target. I don't blame this on Pegg, as he has no control over the writers having him do things that are not \\"Scottyish.\\"<br /><br />Speaking of the characters, I still love Karl Urban the most. Man, he could be DeForest Kelley. I swear, I can't tell the difference; he's just like watching the original Bones at work. And they gave him the line! Well, not the line but a the line: \\"I'm a doctor not a...\\" It was awesome.<br /><br />Zachary Quinto comes in a close second to Urban on pulling off the channeling of the original character. Of course, he has had the privilege of actually working with Nimoy, so he wouldn't have an excuse to not be able to pull it off.<br /><br />And, well, then there's Benedict Cumberbatch whowas a perfect match to the rest of the cast. Mostly, it's the voice. But he seems to be able to play any kind of role he wants to play (see War Horse and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy to understand what I mean by that).<br /><br />And that's really about all I can say about the movie without giving stuff away, and I don't want to do that. As someone who is not really a Star Trek fan, I loved the movie. I do know that there are Trek fans out there that don't like what Abrams is doing, but, really, I'm not quite sure I get that, because he's really captured the heart of the original series with how closely they've managed to get the characters to their originals. It's actually enough that it makes me want to go back and watch those old episodes, and how much more successful can you be than that?<br /><br />Tribble!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is very helpful me. I like knowing how much power I have left.I like the app and would recommend it to my friends.

B003CBVU30|5.0|I can't believe I never seen this movie before. This was a very funny comedy. They played their part perfectly.
1451695195|2.0|This book is interesting and compelling, but poorly written. It's too short and brief, and some of the concepts and ideas are glossed over too quickly. When reading this book, you feel like the author rushed to get it written, and suddenly it ends!
1439170916|5.0|You would think that this would be unreadable, but it is quite the opposite.  Dr. Mukherjee writes in a clear, lively, unpretentious way, and tells the story of one of the roads towards a cure for cancer.  He won the Pulitzer for this book and I think it is well-deserved.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the costumes and the stories.  Cannot wait for season 4 to be available.  Great series.  Totally addicated tot hisi series.
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|A bit big. Would of liked an actual air photo. Works great though. Versatile for many location and great illumination

It keeps you interested and on the edge of your seat the whole movie<br />I have seen this movie 4 times and enjoy it every time......I also loved the other two Bourne movies. I wish he had made a 4th Bourne movie.....I would watch it as much also. .

B007URVZJ6|4.0|Clear and informative.  A welcome guide and full of options for  writers ready to  publish their work.  Easy to read.
B0006V6TMG|5.0|This one is great. It has the participation by the audience that makes you think you are there.When I listen to it in my car the music always makes me happy and perks me up while I'm driving around.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this puzzle and can not wait for the next room. Definitely worth the time to play. Good for anyone who likes manipulation games.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Fascinating plot lines....superb acting all around...I suppose this early-20th century time period was the last hurrah<br />for old-style British aristocracy.  Very likeable family, despite that!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|So addictive I can put the game down is so fun I love it. It's a bored persons dream. If the televisionis I will not even watch the television.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|My wife and daughter cry every time they watch this movie.  My daughter knows all the words to the song.  Not as good as the broadway play but close.
B005OK725M|4.0|If you are a fan of revenge action flicks this is a good one.  You know the main actress from Pirates of the Carr and Star Trek

B0060MYM7O|5.0|Watched the series on the tube and it wash great, had to have it. So much to see that you miss on broadcast. Good video quality and would recommend if you enjoyed the series.
B00CATSONE|5.0|A get to the point , edge of your seat book about geniuse. Refers to new scientific data, that us average iq, can dare to dream and achieve like the greats we admire. Good research done for this book.<br />Not a book that is all about Tesla, who was an amazing man and Edison is not the great guy we may think, with the help of J.P Morgan.
0670014893|3.0|From the time le Carre wrote \\"Call for the Dead\\" in 1961 he has played the theme of moral ambiguity: good men stepping into the quagmire of murky morality in their fight against evil, resulting often in the death of innocent, naive ideologues.  He chronicled the challenges against western civilization for the last five decades, delving into current events that raise moral conundrums, and the decline of British influence in the post-war decades as the UK devolved into another inconsequential European country in \\"Our Kind of Traitor,\\" le Carre's last book.<br /><br />In \\"A Delicate Truth,\\" le Carre examines the delicate fragility of democracy, the delicate concepts of personal freedoms and equity that underlay the foundations of democracy.  The author peers through the looking glass and asks the question: are the great democracies of western civilization sliding towards the same corruption of third world, developing countries, corruption in which leaders pursue power and greed with no concerns for moral ambiguity, as long as they avoid personal consequences.<br /><br />Le Carre explores the potential conflicts and entanglements of the modern military and secret service use of contracting traditional services far beyond anything Eisenhower envisioned in his: beware the power of the military-industrial complex.  Toby Bell is a young, rapidly rising, mid-level officer in the Foreign Service, a Private Secretary to the overly ambitious Quinn, Assistant Director of the Foreign Office.  Quinn launches into a secretive operation, but keeps Toby completely isolated from the action, although he suspects an illegal operation.  But his mentors tell him to stay out of the way to protect his career.  The story begins with Toby breaking the law in an amateur attempt to expose Quinn.<br /><br />The story progresses into a study of political ambition, solipsism and personal greed, clashing with career professionals concerned with duty, all in an operation gone awry.  But it is the subsequent cover-up to protect political ambitions and ensure continued access to lucrative government contracts that gradually shows the fragility of democracies.  The cracks in the fabric of government begin to widen as one friend in a bureau contacts another bureau to call in favors, rules are broken for the insiders, and the Secrets Act (it's top secret, you don't need to know the reason) is used to cover-up failure or criticism.<br /><br />Le Carre is now 81, an old die-hard liberal from the sixties, and his writing is aging.  But he crafts a story with both right-wing Americans and left-wing Englishmen, an equal opportunity of hubris and greed.  While the story concentrates on the role and potential for corruption in contracting traditional military and intelligence roles, the story evokes the feeling of the country's slide into the third world, a feeling of the political system of a Russia or China, one that appears to protect its citizens but God help the man who crosses someone in power, someone who doesn't want to surrender their power or access to lucre in a world where morality is relative and subject to one's definition.  The attempts of government bureaucrats to use their power as well as the threat of violence to intimidate naïve interlopers, mixed with ambition, greed and failed plans, can easily slide into third-world corruption, a realistic take on \\"1984.\\"  Intimidation by a manipulated governmental agency, such as the IRS and FBI in our case, corrupts the purpose of those agencies and becomes the same tactics used by Russia and China to silence its citizenry.<br /><br />Occasionally the story reads like a slightly improved John Grisham.  Le Carre's style of storytelling is much less complex and subtle in \\"A Delicate Truth\\" in comparison to his better works, \\"Spy,\\" \\"Tinker,\\" or \\"Honourable Schoolboy,\\" and the prose seems less perfect, but he still captures the feeling that an old hand is sitting at the table telling the story while sipping gin likeMarlow in the \\"Heart of Darkness,\\" with the conversational clipped sentences and fragments laced with British slang and Foreign Office jargon that younger writers today poorly imitate.  Even in old age, le Carre can weave a good tale to contemplate.

B00A8ECU24|5.0|I have been a fan of my little pony since I was a child so I love this game. I play everyday
B00821OX98|2.0|Very predictable.  It follows the same direction as several other sci fi shows.  Actually it seemed to follow the same script in terms of the bad guys.  I stopped after 3 episodes.
B006R1T40I|5.0|I have been a Bonnie Raitt fan since 1973, I listened to my only 8 track tape &#34;Give It Up&#34; from Denver Co to San Jose California and back again.  I love this cd as much as the first time I heard her. While distinctive, her music is never too much the same, she keeps growing as an artist.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|What a powerful and moving book. So much more poignant now that Chris Kyle was murdered by someone he was trying to help. His description of war is vivid, but I'm sure doesn't even begin to fully portray the reality of it for us sitting at home on our comfy sofas. I really liked the sections by his wife - it was good to have the homefront perspective. Thank God for men and women like Chris Kyle.
0385738781|3.0|The story was pretty good but the writing was poor. I would recommend this to middle school students but not high school.
B008P9M614|5.0|Packaging was good. A tight column of each season's discs. No slop, good colors, flawless discs. All played first time. Great storyline, some fantastic writing, thoroughly researched material, always a surprise ending. Great characters deliver convincing performances consistently. Caution: don't judge other series by this one. You might be disappointed by other shows. This series was that good.
B006JP11HQ|5.0|This book was outstanding. It is a shame more people don't read it. It is very educational. Milton Friedman is probably one of my favorite writers, along with Thomas Sowell. I would recommend this book to everyone.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|Pink has identified some of the best of the past sales training I have been through, and thrown out the worst of those. Sincerity, empathy, caring, asking questions to get to the real problem, being a giver/not a taker, and always putting the other person first. Also some great references. Great author and practices what he preaches.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Had a good time reading this without any real mental calisthenics. Would recommend this to others. Especially like the detail and characterization without getting too involved in minutia.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|I have read this book several times and I wish the movie had gone into some detail about why she enters a convent.  There is one mention very late in the film by her father that her sweetheart had never married. This is confusing to people who have not read the book because they don't know who or what he is referring to. I think this beginning scene of why she enters the convent was in the movie originally then was cut for some reason. The movie is probably the most detailed story of exactly what a young woman went through in order to become a nun in the early 30s. It is gripping and Ms Hepburn is wonderful in her portrayal of this conflicted young girl who becomes a conflicted woman. I enjoy it every time I look at it and I'm sure I'll look at it many more times. I had it on VHS which is in faded condition now so I'm ordering the DVD and look forward to the greater depth of color. Later:  I'm happy to report that this film is beautifully restored and the DVD is lovely.

B0093LINVK|4.0|I installed the Linux Mint system and it turns up in less than 10 seconds. I use it as a hotspot to be a network gateway and a multimedia server. It works very well. No complains so far.
0062059963|5.0|This is another entertaining book, very well written and with a captivating plot that will keep your attention till the last page. The story is based on a classical love triangle, with the young lady being the attention of a prince (Maxon) in one hand and a castle guard (Aspen) in the other hand. This book starts with the initial group of thirty five being trimmed down to six. Kiera is so good describing the environment and her characters, that you fell like you are in the story, following every step of our heroine and her two loves. This book brings battles with rebels and more intrigues and discussions among the remaining ladies. The only bad thing is that the story still does not finish here. There will be a sequel and we will have to wait for that to see what America will do and how she will guide her heart.<br />Although this book is classified as a novel for young adults, I am sure it will please even those not that young anymore. I would recommend this book to any reader that wants to be entertained for some hours (It took me around twelve hours to read the whole book) with a very well written book by Kiera Cass. My younger daughter bought the electronic version of this book from Amazon.com for her kindle but this time I was also expecting it very much to continue savoring this wonderful story.
B005H9B44A|5.0|The next SUPERSTAR actor is definitely CHRIS HEMSWORTH.  He is gorgeous and is awesome in his portrayal of characters whether it be THOR, or The Huntsman in Snow White and the Huntsman.  I look forward to many more movies with this up and coming Star!!
B002UHSDUK|5.0|I really can't think of anything I dislike about this greatest hits. It's a fine collection of the Foo Fighters best songs.  And thank you Amazon for adding, &#34;Have a Cigar&#34; at the end.  The Foo Fighters do a great job with Pink Floyd.
030758836X|1.0|I wish I wouldn't have wasted my time reading this book. The ending is absolutely terrible, and I feel as if the author simply just gave up. It makes me wonder whether Flynn was just as insane herself as was Amy. I'm am warning you, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS BOOK. Its a great plot, but it is a terrible, revolting, unrealistic, and disappointing ending. Shame on you, Gillian Flynn.

B00004Y6NU|5.0|originally released in 1982, this is unquestionably DS's best album! with the rest of the world turning away from '70s progressive rock, mark knoffler finally felt the urge to visit the genre in his own unique way.  he said he was inspired to write 'telegraph road' after seeing a road sign in the u.s.  apparently, it was a real street name, and just the street sign led his mind to picture the entire history of the town....from the first trailblazer exploring the uncharted forest to a town's growing in prosperity to a town's erosion into 'has-been urban squalor'....it's all spelled out in sparse but brilliant lyrics spread across forlorn music that opens the album with mellow synth, piano with bass and guitar coming in just in time to produce ambiance.  the sparse lyrics are sprinkled between great instrumental breaks featuring piano and electric guitar, maintaining a melancholy mood and splashing the right mix of hard-hitting rock in the mix....and the 4.5-minute guitar solo at the end of the song (which builds in intensity) helps to make this a dire straits masterpiece!  'private investigations' features a melancholy acoustic guitar and brings mike mainieri from jazz group steps ahead into the mix on vibes.  again, sparse but brilliant lyrics evoke a mood of sadness at a situation (possibly an unpleasant love affair) that needs to be worked out......and the song's extended instrumental passage at the end, built on what knoffler calls 'a heartbeat rhythm'...simple backround with inventive overlays of electric guitar, piano, vibes strewn about in a brilliant fashion that continues the sad mood while accenting the band's ability to experiment in the progressive genre.  I think the term 'industrial disease' was becoming en vogue at the time, and mark wanted to toy playfully with the concept in lyrics.  the result was a wonderful light-hearted song.  sure, this is the least impressive song on the album, which is why it was the only radio hit.  still, the lyrics are clever....but being spoken over a simple 4/4 beat gave the tune a 'bad rap' because rap was just starting its popularity at the time....and though any believer in music as an art form hates rap (as I do), this tune got a 'bum rap' by critics because of its spoken lyrics.  sure, the song doesn't really stand alone as a hit-worthy tune....but when kept in the context as being part of this great album, it fits quite well.  the title tune has an acoustic-guitar-and-vibes sad & melancholy mood, with the sparse lyrics a depressing revelation of a girl the singer loves (a girl with issues that occur in too many girls nowadays).  the acoustic guitar and mainieri's vibes as solo leads add to the mood and excellence of the album.  the closing tune 'it never rains' seems to continue the same theme of the same troubled girl...and it maintains that forlorn mood with well-thought-out, caring and very telling lyrics and it ends with a long, gorgeous, hard-hitting, rocking electric guitar solo that show's knoffler's impressive guitar prowess.  it is a fantastic way to end a great album!  music, lyrics, and the experimenting with prog-rock made for an exquisite listening experience!  simply put, if you're only going to own one dire straits album in your life, this should be the one!er....but being spoken over a simple 4/4 beat gave the tune a 'bad rap' because rap was just starting its popularity at the time....and though any believer in music as an art form hates rap (as I do), this tune got a 'bum rap' by critics because of its spoken lyrics.  sure, the song doesn't really stand alone as a hit-worthy tune....but when kept in the context as being part of this great album, it fits quite well.  the title tune has an acoustic-guitar-and-vibes sad & melancholy mood, with the sparse lyrics a depressing revelation of a girl the singer loves (a girl with issues that occur in too many girls nowadays).  the acoustic guitar and mainieri's vibes as solo leads add to the mood and excellence of the album.  the closing tune 'it never rains' seems to continue the same theme of the same troubled girl...and it maintains that forlorn mood with well-thought-out, caring and very telling lyrics and it ends with a long, gorgeous, hard-hitting, rocking electric guitar solo that show's knoffler's impressive guitar prowess.  it is a fantastic way to end a great album!  music, lyrics, and the experimenting with prog-rock made for an exquisite listening experience!  simply put, if you're only going to own one dire straits album in your life, this should be the one!

B00BOX0K0M|5.0|This really makes videos/pictures that much clearer.  It certainly allows shots more directly in the sun to be less affected and gives the viewer the ability to see more contrast throughout said shot.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|It's Judd Apatow so it's good. He's climbing up the target market age group ladder. Of course it's the same people you see in Judd Apatow movies doing the same type of jokes for a slightly altered story of \\"real people\\" than he normally does which we all know means he's doing exactly the same thing he always does. I enjoyed it and I don't like myself for it because he has sucked too much money out of me by this time in my life. It's time for Judd, yes, I am allowed to refer to him by his first name by now. It's time for Judd to pick a prodigy and get out of the way. His movies are entertaining but I am getting used to them and I am starting to get sick of it. Just like with Adam Sandler movies I am starting to realize that they are gimmicky, getting me no-where in life and its time for a new guy. Cash in Judd.<br /><br />P.S. I can't remember the ending. I just remember a lot of screaming, an \\"awe\\" moment and then me feeling bad in the morning like I took too much of a drug the night before.
B00000JPH6|4.0|I got this movie because I have been steadily collecting Jim Henson material, though pretty much exclusively Muppet movies/shows. This is definitely not a Muppet movie, which much creepier and darker characters and a less light-hearted plot line.  Most of the puppets and the scenery are quite spectacular, though I thought the main character puppets left something to be desired. It doesn't rank as high as many of the Muppet movies in terms of being watchable over and over again, but I would certainly recommend it for any fans of Jim Henson or for those seeking a family-friendly movie that is not overly cheesy, shallow, or simple.
B00CTT9646|1.0|After relaunching the Enterprise at full-warp speed back in 2009 with 'STAR TREK,'  JJ Abrams tragically manages to crash and burn with STAR TREK: INTO DARKNESS.  A disjointed and unintentionally comical sequel on virtually all levels, INTO DARKNESS starts with Kirk and Bones leaping off a cliff, and just keeps on plummeting.  After ending 2009's 'TREK' with the new Enterprise crew ready to undertake its 5 Year mission into vast uncharted galaxies, INTO DARKNESS puts it all to to a dead stop.  Opening with Kirk botching one absurdly staged mission, he promptly looses the captain's chair of the Enterprise and is demoted.  Against this is set the emergence of villain John Harrison, a rogue Starfleet Agent (The 'huge spoiler' that everyone and their dead grandmother knows about by now).  Harrison is played with often absurd and even unintentionally hilarious intensity by Benedict Cumberbatch.<br /><br />Cumbertatch's performance may boarder on camp at times, but his acts of terrorism against the Earth are anything but.  Visual Effects work by houses such as ILM and Pixomondo are shockingly somber when Harrison carries out the bombing of a high security Starfleet Archive in England, attacks Starfleed Headquarters in San Francisco, and in the film's climax, rams a massive Starship into the city itself.  This intermix of disturbing realism within a Star Trek film rife with accidental humor, 'trek' logic absurdity, juvenile love spat dialogue, an over-the-top Kirk/Spock tear-jerker fest, and other misfires could be construed to have led to the film's Post 9/11 Veterans dedication as an 'apology.'  Nothing could be further from the truth.  JJ Abrams is a passionate supporter of The Mission Continues, a nonprofit group that serves as a framework for US Military Veterans to do community service work when they return home from serving our Country.<br /><br />If only Abrams had been more passionate about Star Trek this time around.  As the plot unravels, so does the film.  Savvy moviegoers see every plot development coming minutes before the shocked Enterprise crew does.  Of particular regret is the sacrifice Abrams makes in screen time with virtually every character except Kirk and Spock.  Abrams give each classic character his or her unique introduction in his original 2009 TREK, and gave them all unique purposes in the film's narrative and interactions with each other.  Not this time around.  Expect Bones, Scotty, Uhura, Sulu and Chekov only to pop up only when they're needed for comic, medical, engineering, annoying romantic, navigational, or Klingon translation relief.  We're talking scenes such as one in which Kirk whips out his Communicator aboard the Enterprise - which is stuck inside the Nuetral Zone, in Klingon space -  and talks to Scotty, who is back on Earth, sitting in a San Francisco bar, drowning his sorrows in booze.<br /><br />By now the Tribble's out of the bag on just who Benedict Cumberbatch's character really is, and what the second half of the plot is really about - or more accurately, what it's really 'remaking.'  How does it all end?  With a Tribble, a chase, and Kirk waking up in bed happy to see Gandalf, Sam, Legolas, Pippin, Merry...............oops, I mean Spock, Bones, Uhura, Scotty, Sulu and Chekov, surrounding his bed, happy he's alive.  You have to see it to believe it.  At least Abrams stole only 1 of \\"Return of the King's\\" 23 endings.
B009POCG0Y|1.0|this movie is so bad I had to watch it all the way through to see if it could get worse and it did with the ending. I am still laughing cause I was dumb enough to pay money for it!

B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Watch out! Jennifer Lawrence is on her way to becoming the next Angelina Jolie. This movie proves that she is versatile and will not be typecast. I look forward to seeing her in future films. It was a great movie, although at first when I read that Bradley Cooper was institutionalized, I thought it meant prison. But they both did an astounding job.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is User friendly. I like the hints feature and the auto-complete feature too. It's very engaging and addicting.

B00B5HQKNI|4.0|they did some pretty weird screenwriting and if you were expecting this film to be a continuation of the plot line from 'quantum of solace'... uh yea, its not. not even close.<br /><br />its more like the writer's jumped a loooong time into the future (from quantum of solace) and bond is kind of an old dude now.<br /><br />which is weird cause even with the scruff he sports for most of this movie, daniel craig just doesn't look that old.<br /><br />but whatever, if you can get over the fact that daniel craig is now and 'old bond' instead of 'brand kicking new bond'-- its awesome.
B00CL68BK2|2.0|Good acting with a great cast for a mediocre story and plot line. Another example what a good PR campaign can do for you.

B004NOH9LC|4.0|This movie is 100% predictable BUT that doesn't matter. It just. Feels. So. Good. Every little bit of it is so darn uplifting-- without being overly cheesy (for the most part) that you'll probably watch it, like it and, I predict, see it playing on TV a bazillion times over the next decade and still watch it and still like it.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I love this CD it is one of her best ones yet. I really like the music. Definitely would buy again.
1416955070|5.0|i have to  say, that as a 36 yo woman, i wasn't sure i was going to get into this book. boy was i wrong!! i loved it, and have eagerly bought the followup books. i had initially intended to buy book 2 on amazon, as i had already got book one, through my own error, i bought book 1 again. i was prepared to send this back to amazon, but those nice ppl told me it was on them!! i got to keep the book and was given full refund too.. sweet:)
0812993845|4.0|I read some of the negative reviews, and at first I agreed with them. I had a hard time getting into the book at first, and I found the sisters unsympathetic in a way. There was no reason to empathize or sympathize with them--they had successful dream jobs, and were apparently so beautiful that they could hook up with any man at any time. A lot of time was spent establishing that they were rather, if not promiscuous exactly, then able to be overcome with lust very easily. The single mom character even carried around condoms in her purse and used them with a near stranger. The other sister, like Samantha on \\"SATC,\\" had to hide her sex toys from the maid. While I don't expect Sophie Kinsella heroines to be like Beverly Lewis heroines (Amish virgins, that is), this seemed excessive and unnecessary to some extent. I was ready to agree with the others that this was a disappointment.<br /><br />Once the main part of the book started (and it took a while), I realized something, though: this is not supposed to be a romantic comedy like \\"When Harry Met Sally\\" but a silly British sex farce like \\"Are You Being Served?\\" And like that show, while it is somewhat farfetched and stupid, it is also very, very funny in parts. As I read on, I realized something else: as the characters personalities developed, it became very touching as well. It reminded me a little of a Christmas movie like \\"Elf\\"--very slapsticky until the end where it gets more sentimental.<br /><br />So do I recommend this book? Well, if you're looking for a serious work of women's fiction about starting over, etc., then no. Stick to Luanne Rice or Elin Hildebrand. But if you want a truly funny but somewhat naughty book with a little tearjerking at the end, I can't recommend it enough. Believe me, if I compare something to \\"Elf\\" or \\"Are You Being Served?\\", it is high praise.
B000O14VAU|3.0|I mean really... I gotta believe Kate Beckinsale was straight coated in baby powder the entire time this was being filmed in order to be running around in that latex.<br /><br />At least they give her platforms instead of heels or else I would have to make this a 2 star rating out of sympathy pain.

B002G1K82Q|5.0|I loved the flow of this Musical. The songs were perfomed so naturally they didn't interupt the story line but aided the story. Never before have i seen a musical that has managed to pull off the transitions between acting and singing without being disjointed.

B007TKT2SK|5.0|. Easy to use.Great job love it. Good calc.. really good. Does everything in fractions and keeps in fractions. Nice. Very nice.
B00BUADSMQ|2.0|Is this movie truly in an aspect ratio of 1:85:1 as shown here!? (I have not seen it yet).  All of the other films in this series have an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 or 2.40:1.  I have all of the other films in the series but if this one really is in 1.85:1 I am not interested.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I know it is a suspense but twists and turns did not add up for me.  It took too long to get to the point.
B001QKSWOE|3.0|I enjoy her &#34;number&#34; storries better...they can't be beat!  I also don't care for the ones she co-writes with other  authors..she's much better &#34;solo&#34;!
B00AJLHUA8|4.0|The plot seemed original.<br />There were parts I didn't understand.<br />I like Ethan Hawke, he is a great actor at anything in stars in
B000FBJFSC|5.0|I know this is Frank McCourt's first book, but I read Teacher Man first.  As a teacher, I enjoyed it immensely.  I had to learn more about Mr. McCourt.  This book was heartbreaking, in the fact that people actually lived in such poverty.  It is eye opening, and makes one realize how precious life is.
B00BLGXL3U|3.0|I love Phillip Seymor Hoffman and I'm always intrigued by Joaquin Phoenix but the story was just lacking and sometimes just painful... Did I really watch the whole thing?

It was long, I kept waiting for something to happen...

0525948023|5.0|Simplicity.  Tolle's works ring true with uncommon common sense.  The words, though informative by nature, bring the reader into a state of heightened awareness- disengaging the thinking mind while tapping into a far greater intelligence whose unity is unmistakable.  From this foundation the author continues to light the way for us to see our true purpose in its simplicity... and let go of the monstrous mind-made creations which have been blocking the way for eons.  Highly recommended.

B00B2166BS|5.0|I really like the idea of a pogo connector. it pops exactly into place with no need to wiggle or push. One side of the connector is flat, and the other side is concave. The concave goes on the screen side. Depending on your choice of case you may not need to remove it to charge.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game had very good graphics, and great, mysterious storyline that didn't get boring, and fun puzzles that made you think. They offered clues that would help without giving the answer away. It was  kinda short, by  it is very worth it!!!I hope they have a sequel!!!
B004DLPXAO|3.0|The new update has me so flustered that sometimes I wish there was some real competition. One of my favorite features is gone... You used to be able to tap the screen and see what chapter you were in, this was important to me because that it doesn't sync at all anymore for me, especially when you have already read it once. I use an app for listening to my kindle when I drive so when I switch back and forth I can't even see what chapter I'm in so it would be quicker to find my spot. This is very aggravating.

B000FA5STS|5.0|The author cooks up a riviting tale with major twists and surprises.  Lots of bad guys--so many you start to wonder if the hero might end up being on the wrong side.  This is an older Baldacci novel that makes it clear he was destined for literary greatness.  If you haven't read it, correct that oversight right away.

0439023513|1.0|Truth be told, I am not a big fiction reader, but I am a lover of good stories, as most people are, and this is not one of them. Sigh.<br />The way this \\"war\\" was written was so calculated and methodical and even dull. When they talked about propos, I  like I was watching the filming of a lame TV show. Not realistic. At all.<br />I devoured the first two books on the edge of my seat in a matter of days. With this one, I begrudgingly finished it in a few weeks. Katniss' character lost her \\"fire\\" and spirit that her fans fell in love with in the first two books as she descended into a depressed megalomaniac. The action scenes were not moving in the least. At times they were confusing and sloppy. I didnt realize some of her people had even died until she referred back to it later in the book--Finnick and then Prim. The ending was also not at all what I expected. I thought the face off between Katniss and Snow would be a little more dramatic. Peeta lost his allure with his memory implants. everything that was awesome about the first two was watered down, merky or degraded in the third book. Basically, I just wish it could be totally rewritten. I think if they are going to make a movie, something will have to be done to make this watchable. HBO could flip this thing like they did with True Blood and it could be great.

B00BT0ZDF2|5.0|Okay, let me start by saying that you will either get this film or you won't. I accept all negative reviews for movies I like, but not this one. Take a second and hear me out. Those who give this movie one star, or say nonsense like \\"It has no plot\\" or \\"It's terrible\\" Probably just don't get it. To them, it has no plot because honestly, they just can't wrap their heads around the deep and highly intricate plot and message this movie has. This movie is filled with an incredible plot that intertwines around 6 different stories that are actually one story. You might think like the other naysayers \\"Oh man this movie is horrible. It just jumps around\\" Actually, the so called \\"random jumping around\\" is actually planned perfectly. If you're smart enough, you can begin to see that it all makes sense. That the movies headline really has meaning \\"Everything is connected.\\" Whether you like the amazing messages this movie gives or not, you have to appreciate the incredible editing and thought that went into this piece of art. The cinematography was also masterful. Not to mention the acting, script, and music. You MUST watch this movie with a very open mind. And your mind must be ready to pay close attention. If you're one of those people that says \\"Gotta go get a drink, you don't have to pause it\\" Well you, better not miss a single minute because if you do you could become lost quickly. I'm telling you, this movie is a masterpiece. It has incredible life changing messages and I can say without a doubt, it has become my favorite film of all time.<br /><br />Be ready to experience a plethora of feeling and emotions. This movie left me in the theater just sitting there. Everyone in the theater that I was in, just sat there. When the credits started and the soft piano theme came in, nobody moved. Nobody turned their heads, and nobody said a thing for a minute. No movie has ever left me in such confusion or in such loss. Even though I wasn't sure how to feel, I knew that this movie was revolutionary. It has changed me forever, and has inspired many thoughts and endless hours of late night discussion about the universe and life. It made me feel as one with the world and universe. It made me question past lives, future lives, and soul mates...if it is real. But this movie is just incredible in so many ways. Like I said, those that hate it, simply just can't understand the extreme depth of this movie. The plot is VERY intricate, but it makes sense. The movie does have meaning...lots of it. It's not just about reincarnation, or soul mates. It's about life...and the universe itself. Cloud Atlas is a true masterpiece and unfortunately, many people in the world just couldn't handle it or just didn't get it.was revolutionary.

125000098X|2.0|I am a bookaholic.  I readily admit it here and elsewhere.  I own more books in my home both read and unread than I can ever begin and finish and more books now downloaded on my I PAD that I expect it to explode one day.  And now that I am getting on in years, I feel as though time isn't on my side and there are way too many books I want to read before my end.<br /><br />With the above paragraph in mind, I do wonder why I bothered reading the lastest entry into the Clifton trilogy, Best Kept Secrets by Jeffrey Archer.  And all together I wonder why Archer, the author of some wondrful books like Kane and Abel, The Prodigal Daughter and As the Crow Flies, bothered to write another book in this series with another 2 books to be published in the future before the trilogy is completed. I really did look forward to the first book, Only Time Will Tell and moderately enjoyed that title.  Then I read The Sins of the Father and thought it was going downhill but then reread both books in order to read Best Kept Secrets.  And agin the books continued to slide even further downhill.<br /><br />Because so many other reviewers provided a synopsis of this latest nook and the other two I won't go after the details.  It is enough to say that the author who focused mainly on Harry Clifton in the first book and then Harry and Emma in the second book,<br />now concentrated on the Clifton's son Sebastian.  And I iamgine that the next book will focus on another some or daughter and then succeeding generations.  But I must admit that I am already tired of these two families and wish that Archer would retrun to writing stand along books whcih would remind me of his previous novels.<br /><br />I know that series have become all the rage what with the popularity of the Twilight series, Robert Langdon thrillers, Alex Cross mysteries and Myron Bolitar books.  But in order for a series to engage me, each book must be different and the<br />characters must become endearing to me.  Niether of these are evident in Archers's series and I wonder if I will even bother to contiue with the next book when it is published.e are evident in Archers's series and I wonder if I will even bother to contiue with the next book when it is published.
B007EE4XKI|4.0|I acquired this off the daily deals, along with its sequels, and I'm not sorry I did so. While the plot is not stunning, it's characterization is thorough, particularly in its portrayal of Noonien Soong, Data`s creator. The middle portion of the novel is entirely in Noonien`s first-person, present-tense perspective, a difficult feat that is pulled off effectively. It`s a fairly easy, engaging, and relatively short read, perfect for your Trekkie down time. Can't wait to get started on the sequels!
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|This is a truly brilliant show and it raises the bar for all other sci fi/drama/action shows out there. Incredible cast, smart and witty writing. Addictive!
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Just a very good adventure into another world.  All of the characters are rich and complex, which is important in such a long work -- some have real wit, while others truly struggle with clear speak...it feels right.  The action is clear and exciting, and the supernatural elements are tempered at this early stage, so they don't over-flavor the plot or characters.  This is not a &#34;Hobbit&#34; world, and were there no supernatural elements, it would be as fine a world.  But that there is just a bit &#34;extra&#34; under the story, makes it feel just that much more engrained naturally, and therefore believable.  I enjoyed it completely.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this book. The story is told from Enzo, the dog's, perspective. It is funny, heart breaking, and yet life affirming. I laughed and cried while reading this book. I am not into \\"dog\\" stories or \\"car racing\\" and this story held my attention as I read it in the space of two days. Seriously, this dog really has a way of describing scenes and life itself that are so funny and at times, so very sad. I highly recommend this book especially if you are looking for something a bit different. And keep the hanky close.

B000FA675C|5.0|I loved this book. It's entertaining, interesting, intriguing, and very well written. I had no problem with all the twists and turns since I read the beginning of the book and understood it to be FICTION...

B000GFLKF8|5.0|Why did I \\"have' to like it ?? Because despite being directed by a patent race-baiter, Spike Lee, the movie is outstanding. When even  the Wall Street Journal praises it, then it has to be good. The whole premise of the story, with its twists and turns, keeps you on the edge of your seat. The movie is superbly crafted and flawlessly executed right down to the closing credits use of a catchy Indian pop song. The acting is first class, which is no surprise given its stellar cast. Naturally Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, William Defoe, and Christopher Plummer stand out. But everyone else, even down to the smallest roles, give it their all. The camera work does a great job of using New York's financial district architecture to set the back drop for the movie. This is an easy 5 Stars.<br />P.S. I recently bought a BlueRay player and this was the first DVD I purchased for it.

B000SEHJGQ|3.0|Charles Bukowski was no doubt a talented writer and poet, but this allegedly autobiographical story shows exactly why he lived the life of addicted excess and wretchedness that he did. If we're products of our backgrounds, then his was terrible, and produced a terrible guy, talent notwithstanding. I was tempted to give this two stars, I disliked it so thoroughly, but it is honest and well written, and raw.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|I happened to catch guitar player Bonamassa's acoustic event on PBS and was blown away.  He and his US/ international group played with enthusiasm, clarity, lyricism, and guts.  Tons of guitars littered the stage, one of his group played honky-tonk piano and accordian [yes, that too].  The audience seemed to be familiar with his work so the synergy between artist and listeners brought out really fine music.  A little blues, a little rock, a lot thoughtful and great fun.  Recommend this CD highly and if you purchase the DVD of the event, so much the better.  I haven't stopped playing the darn thing and it doesn't grow old.

We have also started our own personal challenges among the family for who can get the highest score, run the farthest, get the most coins etc. It is also a wonderful incentive to get the kids to do their chores. First one with their job list done gets to use the kindle first to play and gets 3 gems. The second person has to wait, for an hour and only gets one gem. ( if their jobs are done correctly)<br /> My only problem is I can't seem to find the new update, my friend just got it on her ipod, new obstacles etc, but I can't find it for the kindle.

193700788X|1.0|Sookie Stakehouse novels were my \\"go to\\" summer read for folding back while sunning on the beach or flicking through on my e-reader while waiting for appointments, dinner to cook,  guests to arrive. I would use those precious moments to lose myself in a fantastic world filled with lusty characters with devilish motives. It has been divine! But over the past several novels this sweet escapism has been mired with a lack of narrative continuity, in consistent character development and rushed storytelling - culminating into this finale which will literally sink your heart!<br /><br />No surprises are evident in this rushed conclusion to the Sookie Stakehouse saga.  It ends just as we all expected - or feared - with a startling lack of imagination and character development. Instead, we find a very defeated Sookie Stakehouse who is simply resigned to accept the easy way out.  I found this shift from head-strong, passionate heroine to exasperated protagonist abrupt and disconcerting given the journey we've all been on with Sookie over the last 10 books. Sookie isn't the only one who has lost her passion. Harris clearly did as well!<br /><br />As a fan, you'll need to read this book to complete the series - but you won't necessarily enjoy it. The quality of the storytelling in this series has always been unreliable and the past 2 books were less than fulfilling - so perhaps this is the perfect conclusion. After all, this is a vampire and not a zombie tale. Let's put a stake in it and move on - at least, that is the attitude the author seemed to take.<br /><br />I am literally mourning for Sookie and this AMAZING world created by Charlaine Harris. My only consolation is HBO - hopefully, Alan Ball still has a little passion left for this series!<br /><br />My advice - get through it as quickly as possible to say that you've read it, immediately cleanse your imagination palate with another novel and wait for the season premiere of True Blood.

193700788X|3.0|I purchase the first Sookie Stackhouse mystery when it was a book club selection.  A mind-reading waitress, no way!<br />I have preordered the novels and watched HBO's series (not true to the novels BTW), and found the other novels to be 4 and 5 stars.  The final novel was a 3 (C) at best.  I know all the characters needed to be mentioned, and their lives/ events needed to have closure.  . .  However, I was extremely disappointed.  I don't wish to give away any of the plot, let's suffice to say, the characterization and the magic that made reading this series such a delight to read, was definitely NOT present.

147674355X|5.0|Going into Hopeless, I didn't think it would be as deep and emotional as it really was, and I think that's what I loved about it. That aspect sets Hopeless apart from all the others nowadays that share the same plot line. As I read, I connected deeply with the characters and even though I knew what was going to happen, seeing it all play out brought up powerful emotions. Colleen created such a great story about two long-lost friends with troubled pasts who learn to heal and come to terms with their issues together, all while falling in love in the purest of ways.<br /><br />Sky is an interesting and fun character. I loved the banter and interactions between her and Holder. You could tell they clicked easily and the attraction was sizzling right from the start. I really liked all of the characters, actually. Six and Breckin, Sky's best friends, were hilarious and great sources of lightness and humor in an otherwise serious and emotional read. When you learn exactly why Sky seems to be so numb to everything, it really breaks your heart. Sky's past is pretty crazy, all things considered, and as the story unravels, I got a lot more than I expected, which is pretty amazing because it just made me love this story more. I swear, when I read glimpses of her past and what really happened to her, it stirred some serious emotions in me and I was riveted.<br /><br />Hopeless will have you feeling a ton of emotions and get you seriously invested in these memorable characters. It will surprise you with its gripping tale of family, love, and trust and have you glued to the pages until the bittersweet end. I loved the way Colleen told the story, too, inserting bits of the character's past as Sky & Holder's relationship develops, so that the reader can learn and discover things as the characters do and get a better understanding of exactly what they went through. Hopeless was very well-written and I would highly recommend this to all readers.

B002LC8HF0|2.0|I am a huge Wheel of Time fan, and picked up this series because I was impressed with the way Brandon was able to pick up and finish Robert Jordan's books and do it so well. I really enjoyed the first and second book, although the second book was a tad bit depressing. The third book was just 730 pages of depressing. Every time you turned around something bad was happening. I slugged through it all to find out the end - which was good, but again - only 10 pages or so! I read enough depressing things by opening up a news website!  So, while the writing was good, I was disappointed by the amount of darkness.

B00BT0ZDF2|4.0|This is an inspiring, beautiful and profound film. Much of it between the lines, much allegorical and yet it grabbed me with its immediacy, with its...  poetry. What matters in life? Can we find inner resources to stand for truth against the overwhelming powers of obliteration? The film says that becoming sentient is hard work, that we need to be grateful for every scrap of awareness and love coming our way in the eternal recurrence of cause and effect.<br /><br />This is a work of a masterful director and involves first-rate casting.<br /><br />Some may see a problem with this film in that it takes excessive liberties with the original text. Key elements of the narrative are not only changed but inverted. The darkness (but also the brilliant humor) of the original are subverted into a typical Hollywood ending. I understand why the Wachowskis felt compelled to do it yet still...  this does say something about contemporary film making financed by the big studios.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this series, I was a little confused with the first episode starting off a few months after season 2 ended, thought maybe I missed some episodes. It explains the story line as the episodes continue and it was an awesome season!!!
B0007XT87G|5.0|Having been a fan of Porcupine Tree for sometime and enjoyed the progression of Wilsons song writing ability and lyrical content growth, Deadwing is just amazing. What a ride.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|After seeing the movie about Rediguez, and being intriqued because I live in southeast Michigan, I purchased this album as well as Coming from Reality. Rodriguez's work is really amazing.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|I thought this was a nice popcorn action packed gangster flick with some pretty good actors in the lead roles. Emma Stone was way under used and same with Sean Penn because I think he could have been more sadistic at his role. Plot is pretty cut and dry with just a team of cops that dont play by the rules take on a big crime boss. You've seen all of this before and the movie is very predictable but for some reason I don't care maybe because it looks pretty while doing it because the way this movie is shot looks fantastic. Very good action scenes and pretty good acting save this everyday gangster copy from dying. I recommend it fully just for the action at least.
B006C1DH92|4.0|This game is essentially a branded version of Fruit Ninja. It adds sounds, backgrounds, blades and some other elements drawn from the Dreamworks movie, but they're not intrusive. I also has a &#34;bandito&#34; mode which is a challenge mode with a series of challenges of escalating difficulty (I still cannot deal with the giant bomb when it shows up.) I play on a Droid Razr Maxx, so I have a decent screen, but it's smaller than the tablet screens, which makes some of the challenges more difficult. Overall a pretty good game, especially for free (which is what I paid).
B000WOXQDM|5.0|This is no doubt from the 1990s<br />it's a great cd that stood the test of time & I got it on sale
B001TCHDPS|5.0|After watching the movie about Rodriguez, and living in southeast Michigan, I was intrigues by his story and purchased this album as well as Cold Facts. Rodriguez's music is really amazing.
B00BLRXDTQ|4.0|Before he did the Lethal Weapon series, Mel Gibson was Mad Max! In a near future after a nuclear war, Australian civilization crumbles! Biker gangs become a threat and Main Force Patrol battles them from a ruined halls of justice! By the sequels, Max wonders out into the waste land becoming a road warrior for hire! The first two films are great, the final film is watchable!  I didn't buy this particular set! Bought Mad Max & The Road Warrior before Mad Max Beyond Thunder Dome was even avaliable on blu ray! My copy of The Road Warrior says Mad Max 2 on screen!
B0059XTUVI|1.0|What a disappointing movie of a great heroine of our time.  This depicted Margaret Thatcher more of bumbling lady in the later stages of dementia, than the great leader she was.  I have my suspicions of the motives of this production, but it is a shame to give a story of such a courageous leader and the great impacts she had on the world, in such a mediocre story.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|There was some humor and a fairly predictable ending.  If the first chapter doesn't grab you the rest of the book doesn't get any better.
B001EN71CW|5.0|It's Fillion, Whedon, Tudyk, and the rest of an amazing cast.  Of course it's amazing.  This show should have had the chance at a long term run.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I've been looking for a game that would keep me busy for awhile, I found it in The Room. I really like this game.
B000MKD9P6|5.0|Visually beautiful, funny, dramatic and a great story.  Acting was wonderful.  This was the second time I watched it and I'd gladly see it again.
B00867GKIK|5.0|blu-ray and 3d really enhance your movie viewing experience.the picture and 3d are simply amazing..there is soo much more definition in the picture..
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Martin has created a large, complex world that I originally enjoyed very much.  Unfortunately, it seems like he is just trying to take the record for longest series to go nowhere.  I was very much surprised that in this very large volume, his story did not move along as much as it should.  He just introduced more and more characters into this already vast world that do not help the story at all.  At this point, I feel as though I need some sort of database that I can refer to just to keep the characters straight.  I've read all five books now and I was really hoping that this one would tie the story up.  But, no, it wasn't to be and now I am going to have to wait another year or two just to see if the next 800 pages give me any closure.  I think I will give him one more book and if it does the same thing, I will give up on this one.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Iron man is the best movie ever..... AND NOW ITS A GAME!!!!! Awesome game. Awesome theme. Awesome suits. Awesome iron man.
B007EC27QM|5.0|It works great, I am very happy with it! I have been using it for a few weeks and have had no problems with it.
B006H5120E|5.0|I had the old vhs and what an amazing improvement going to 3d blu-ray. the picture quality is amazing and the 3d also...
0062213423|5.0|My daughter read it and put it in her treasure chest. I keep telling her they are not the Beetles or Elvis but hey I am not 14. LOL!
141694737X|3.0|My toddler likes to look at this book -- he likes to open the flaps and name the animals underneath. But I change the text when I read it to him, because it sends a pretty negative message. I'm not usually sensitive to that kind of thing, but this really seems like the wrong way to go about teaching animals. My son loves animals and I don't want him thinking frogs are \\"too jumpy\\" or snakes are \\"too scary\\". Instead of \\"He was too angry, I sent him back\\" we say \\"I love lions! I put him in the backyard!\\" When he learns to actually read I'll probably just get rid of it. Other parents have told me that they change the words when reading it, too. I wouldn't really recommend it -- there are other cute animal books out there. 3 stars because the kid likes it.
B009OYTIXS|3.0|If the pilot of a TV show doesn't blow my skirt up, it makes no sense to keep watching the program (especially if I have to pay to stream it commercial-free).<br /><br />I have so many superior TV programs (new and old) that I want to watch, so that means Arrow gets moved off my list.<br /><br />I did keep an open mind, but the storyline is old and the acting is sub-par at best.  The special effects and music are very good, but I need intellectual stimulation to go with that.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|When ever I am looking for &#34;something&#34;  Google will find it!  Sometimes I find some interesting web sites that I did not know was out there.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This calculator is amazing. It makes doing factions so easy. It number on left side for whole numbers. And on the right it has two sets of numbers. One at the top. And at bottom.
1582701709|5.0|Great Book.  Very inspiring. Very true.<br />Would refer any of my lady friends to this book.<br />Easy reading.  Not too wordy.
B009X012XM|4.0|The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars was the process for standing the device on its edge. Tucking the edge of the cover into the groove can be a bit uncertain at times.
1416550550|5.0|This was a beautifully written book!  I have an adopted child in our family, and he always knew he was adopted.  He never had a problem, because he knew ow much he was loved!  This story shows how important it is to let the child know that he is special and loved!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Started watching due to comment from daughter, and became so involved. Enjoy as much as Closer and it was the best!Enjoy the chemistry of the show between actors. Suspense, and romance. A good combination.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|I first saw that movie on Netflix, but just had to own it in addition!<br />If you enjoy British humor, you have to treat yourself to seeing it!!<br />Meanwhile I watched it several times and still discover new things and laugh without end!<br />I watched it with friends and my dad, and haven't met anybody who didn't love it.<br />A couple of quotes have become running jokes for us.
B009YN2M7S|3.0|Very predictable and overly rambling. I've read this plot a bunch of times. I can't believe they made a movie out of such a thin story.
B008K8VDPU|3.0|I can't seem to get the directions on how to play some tunes.  The piano sound is great, and it looks like a real piano.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|If you want the experience of Grand Theft Auto, this is a must buy!!! Best kindle game ever!! Absolutely a great game 5 stars.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Plot: 5<br />Characters: 4<br />Steam Factor: 5<br />Would I buy in print: YES<br /><br />Tangled is not just a Disney movie folks! Holy pink elephants...this book was smokin'!  Tangled is a new take on romance. Completely told through the male point of view. I just absolutely adored it. Emma Chase has to be a guy. I mean it is THAT good!<br /><br />Drew Evans is a cross between Gideon Cross from BTY and Travis Maddox from BD (without the fighting). An investments executive who has more women than the yellow pages goes from having his choice of females and a place in the sun at work to battling for one heartstoppingly career minded for his very sanity. This hated horn dog gets mentally neutered. One look and the player is out of the game.<br /><br />Kate Brooks is just a perfect foil for Drew. Gorgeous, driven, and engaged to another man she is the fox that dog wants to hunt. Yet she isn't going down without a fight! I don't know she resisted as long as she did. Drew is a bad boy personified. Rich, dark, and utterly confident in his powers of seduction the man is testosterone in a tie. Kate though had him by the.....nose.<br /><br />Now let it be said that I sincerely hope that Dee-Dee gets her own book. As a supporting character just brace yourself. Her attitude is out there and in your face. She had NO filter and I loved it!<br /><br />My favorite thing about this book is that you just don't read that many books from the here's point of view. Thus as I was reading maniacal laughter burst forth numerous times. Even my hubby came down the hall to find out what was so funny! The many quotes in this book are just genius! Emma Chase tells it like it is from the male mind! It was crass, crude, and utterly creative! I could not have enjoyed it more. I hope it comes out on audio cause truly I would order it in a heartbeat to drive by. I can just see my fellow travelers now staring at me as I guffaw down the highway at 70 mph.<br /><br />Invest in this little gem and I guarantee you will not be sorry!rantee you will not be sorry!
B000XUBFE2|2.0|I didn't find this interesting enough to get beyond the irritating style. Not sure why all the hype. There are certainly better books about this subject/era.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Everything that it promises it does. No complaints been using it for well over a year and I really like it. Would recommend to any one searching for a calculator application for their device.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Great game! The only problem is that you almost have to purchase upgrades to move past a certain point. They also encourage you to speed up the growth process by using &quot;pearls&quot; but they don't tell you how hard the &quot;pearls&quot; are to acquire. So if you get the game, be patient and conserve those. Otherwise, it is beautiful and informative. Quite addicting!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Reminds me of my Mist days. They must do another one. I can't put it down.  Very interesting really fun to try and figure out
0553801473|5.0|I haven't quite finished the book as yet, but I am loving it as much as I loved all the others. The attention to detail as well as the unpredictability of the story has me on the edge of my chair. I am just wondering how long we have to wait for book 6, and from what I understand, book 7 ? Keep up the good work Mr. Martin, you are amazing.
B005ETA5K2|5.0|The wireless is very good the software is easy to install and understand, good reception, I recommend this item.AAA +++
B00992CF6W|4.0|sure it really ducks compared to the other put it adds the reactors core and quartz (the equivalent emerald)  so it is great fun. my number on want. is skins pleeeeeeeeeeeeez
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Great spiritual allegory, in my book. Jody Foster does an excellent job as a zealous scientist, with much pain in her life from her youth, seeking difficult answers with uncompromising candor.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|just like team fortress 2 on the mobile side of stuff though. very fun and addicting. great fps fun for all.
0937381888|5.0|There's not much more that can be said about book. For many home brewers this is the only book they will ever need to craft the sort of beer they enjoy. It serves both as an introduction and as a decent reference manual for those who want to begin making their own beer which, in many ways, is as fun as drinking it. It's like cooking except a bit more impressive to the uninitiated (your friends will be quite happy to hear you have 5 gallons of stout of hefeweizen lying around). There is no doubt that brewing a top notch beer requires a great deal of knowledge and skill, but brewing one that you and your friends will enjoy isn't terribly difficult. If you are brewing from extract a single page on the internet or a pamphlet from a beer kit could serve as a launching point for your first batch, but inevitably you'll want to learn more about the various styles and the techniques needed to make them. Like so many other things, reading can prepare one for brewing, but ultimately it is mastered by doing.
0307341550|5.0|Gillian Flynn had me in a vise from the first chapter up until the last word, anxious for the final reveal, but fearful that the book might be over once it finally happened. I've had some intense experiences with books before, but this was unheard of for me, to just connect with a novel as easily as if it were a friend since childhood.<br /><br />The thing about Sharp Objects is that it manages to juggle so many different sides to the main plot in such a seamless and fluid way I barely noticed it was doing any juggling at all. The writing is always on point, honesty, deceit, and sarcasm in a perfect blend that delivers heartfelt scenes and moments of unparalleled fright.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn's first outing is a dark masterpiece of lascivious mystery, half thriller, half perfection incarnate. Get this one, but only if you can handle the nightmares that will follow you afterwards.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I play this game almost everyday,the only issue I have with this app is the wall coin doesn't work but other than that I get hours of fun from this.
B000FA5TTW|3.0|I had heard that this book was awesome, so I wanted to read it.  The murder happens right in the beginning of the story, and the rest of the book is about the girl who was murdered as she watches her family from heaven.  I got a little bored waiting to see if they'd catch the murderer.  The storyline just didn't hold my interest.  At the very end, it got a little more interesting, but this definitely didn't hold my interest.  I like a book that you can't put down.
B00000J2PH|5.0|One of the greatest singer-songwriter albums of all time.  Every song is great and this sets the standard for all others.  Must-have for any music collection.
067144901X|1.0|Moo, baa, lalala is stupid this garbage is the dumbest story ever, and it was only like 10 pages long. this book is a conspiracy man!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Tunis book left me dying for more, not only that, it made me be thankful for the world I live in
B00B23O96A|5.0|very good music somewhat caribbean flavor, would recommend this product to all Eric Clapton fans , Very good value for money and it came early
1452115567|5.0|Perfect gift for the dog-lover in your life. What this guy got his dog to do is amazing! Very funny!
0060245867|5.0|My daughters are 2 and 5 and we love this book! Along with the others in the If You Give...series. Simple and easy to follow, keeps their attention and cute story. I enjoyed it myself!
B00COHIFQS|3.0|The movie was pretty good until the end and it's not that the ending was bad per se but meh. I won't spoil the story but like any horror these days it's a whole movie of little glimpses of the &#34;ghost/demon/etc&#34; throughout and they're genuinely creepy and then at the end it's revealed on seen head on and everything and doesn't live up to the glimpses. I'm always so disapointed when you spend the movie being creeped out and then they blow it with what the thing actually looks like later on.<br /><br />I will give them the credit though that the ending wasn't what I thought it would be and deliberately used the generic horror predictability to make itself stand out from it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I wanted to catch up on season two and it was so wonderful to have it delivered the same day with Amazon. Able to watch when ever had a free moment.
B00C1BUYX4|1.0|The video never loaded. I've not had that trouble before, not for the entire 24 hours. So I paid $4.99 to rent a movie I never got to watch...
B00CTJ7K1M|5.0|You won't see many reviews of this series getting less than 4 stars. Mine is 5 of course, because it's actually good.<br /><br />Violence - 9/10 While granted some episodes lack enough of it, when it starts it goes in a hurry. By the end of this series' run, Green Arrow might actually get a higher body count than Jack Bauer from 24, because he kills most everyone and I mean almost EVERYONE. One episode alone he killed around 20 guys.<br /><br />Language - 2/10 not much but well placed when said usually.<br /><br />Sexual Content - 3/10 Again, not much and not graphic. A moderate, decent love story.<br /><br />Tone - The series can be decently funny at times but for the most part its dark and very serious.<br /><br />Comparison - Basically its like Dark Knight meets Smallville. And then had a baby named Oliver.<br /><br />Fun note - To those of you that watched the Teen Titans cartoon growing up, that series main bad guy Slade aka Slade Wilson, (the dude with the half mask) is one of the main characters in this show.He lives up to his name.<br /><br />The people that call this show garbage,chick flicky,boring or anything like that haven't watched the entire series. I will admit it does slow down some episodes, but anyone that actually cares for good writing, plot development, action and suspense will love this show. Especially if you're a fan of Smallville.
1936891026|5.0|Inspiring.  Great tool to tame down the &#34;Resistance&#34; in your life, whatever form it takes.<br />To consume a little at a time for greater effect and impact.  Each page is a gem to savour and muse over.
B00005QZWI|5.0|true to the movie, It is like your in the movie at times.  listen to it while studying for exams.  slight crack in case , but was unopened and new inside.  CD was in excellent shape.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|This is excellent. I don't  know what else to say. I really enjoyed his coverage of the late Willie DeVille.
1476715904|5.0|This book is excellent in all aspects. It is original, romantic, realistic...It hooked me from the first page to the last, it is refreshing to read such a book in the new adult category since I was getting tired and bored to read teenager books being a middle age woman looking for romance other than teenagish gigs. It's wonderful to be able to fantasize about being twenty again rather than sixteen. Keep up the good work Colleen. I'm a FAN of yours.
B003B96AOW|5.0|We bought this for our son's birthday. It is super heavy and well built, with many weapon choices. He loves it!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Fun game to play.  Like breeding and taking care of dragons.  But is very slow unless you're willing to buy gems.
B00000JNOJ|5.0|This is good stuff. I witnessed Muddy's performances several times in mid an end career and this is the beginning before he really found himself commercially. Muddy once said, \\"I wrote these blues down in Miss, when i was picking cotton and pulling corn. I came up North and I sold them. I don't know what you think about 'em but I think they're pretty good\\". You will agree
B0087IT8FK|5.0|I had heard a lot about this movie and seen the trailers... Omar Cy is a great dancer and comedian, the music of earth wind and fire adds to the movie. The acting and story line are incredible and the subtitles did not distract from the flow of the movie. i have watched it 3 times already with different friends.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|MLP BRO this is the best game I have ever played and you people should buy it and fellow bronies and pegasisters we are awsome yea
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Super fun game. Well worth the money. Great graphics and the the puzzles were super we'll thought out. Hope to see more from this company.
B0082XJGRK|5.0|marcus 's thoughts have been out for some tme now....read some long time.....and here they are. they are worth reading
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. Amazing book. I love Nicholas sparks and the way he captures his audience, just amazing.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I was sceptically but it is a small download and worked very quick. it takes some getting used to but it very intuitive once you do start using it. just what I needed for my fire.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett did it again...he created compelling characters who are able to bring history to life for the reader.  This series has been extremely enjoyable.  I think they're must-reads for anyone who enjoys both good stories and world history.
B000005KQT|5.0|Muddy Waters announced that Walter had died. I was in an audience when he announced it.<br />LW was apparently a difficult fellow, a rounder, but he was an innovator and an artist.<br />This is good stuff!
B002ZG975Q|5.0|i enjoy this movie for a good price.  Love is never ugly. Great actors too. Favorite part would been when he states to see the really picture of beauty.
B00571F26Y|5.0|My friend suggested I read this book - a long time before I decided to buy it.  After reading and pondering what Davis said I decided to buy the Wheat Belly Cookbook.  It's been 5 weeks since I've gone wheat free.  I've lost 20 pounds, my asthma has improved tremendously and I'm not as tired as I used to be. I've not had a stomach ache since leaving wheat behind and can now eat cheese and other dairy products with no ill effects. If you suffer from asthma, diabeties, arthritis or stomach issues please read &#34;Wheat Belly&#34; and consider changing to wheat free.  You will be glad you did!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|What this man went through, and how he solved his problems was really fascinating. I was cheering him on,each step of the way.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like it. It's not and gun to use. Im glade I  downloaded it. I like using it. I would recommend it.
B000FBFMIO|5.0|I seem to have a thing for stories featuring (a) waifs who start out thinking they have no future and (b) dwarfs who overcome popular belief to show they are much bigger then life.  This has both so I am overjoyed.  I like that the story intersects with some of her other stories too--like this is a particular world and things happen in different places in this world.  So many books make you think that whatever the story is about is the ONLY thing happening in that world.  The only weak point I felt was when the Golden man (whatever) became a metaphysical holy being--I couldn't quite grok that.  Since this series was the first of her writings I'd read, the world was unfamiliar to me; as I read more of her series, that world now feels like I might have lived there in real life almost.
B005UKJX4E|1.0|This movie is basically a national geographic film with some big name stars making a cameo. This movie is impossible to follow, it is trying so hard to be deep that it makes no sense.
B0094MFI52|5.0|I had the hardest time finding this movie in any store.  I was so happy when I found it on instant video.  My son cannot walk away from this one.  It's perfect!
B0084P4BSU|5.0|This book will help you alkalize your body and that will dramatically improve your health and well being.  This book is very well written and illustrated.  It has many great recipits and meal suggestions.  Well worth your time and money if you want to jump start your life!
030758836X|1.0|I couldn't believe it wouldn't get better, but I was really wrong! I will not be likely to read another book by this author.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Love the story of this film and how it weaves present day with the past. Excellent special affects and life lesson storyline.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|A classic! It's a must read for those who love to be on the edge of their seat. It's a book everyone will love
1594204217|5.0|The section on Fire is interesting, some things I learned from Air I can't wait to try, and Water just confirmed some things I have been doing, but the section on Earth was just plain inspireing.
B00BIVN82M|4.0|Love the new CD, I think by the time his 30th album comes out he will have done duets with everyone lol. A little distressed to find out that the Target store version allegedly has 3 more songs. Does not seem fair to penalize fans for NOT buying at Target, there should be a free download of the missing 3 somewhere. His voice and style is pleasing as always. I would love an explanation about the &#34;It's A Beautiful Day&#34; song because it is a break up song. we want to know the story because it is a novel concept.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I have read most of the Nicholas Sparks books, but this one took the cake.  I read the book in less than THREE days!  COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN!!!
B002YVAT72|2.0|I purchased this item with the hopes of converting some vinyl to Digital files and it worked for a short period of time.  Initially I spent at least an hour getting it to work on my Windows 8 Desktop, I was able to successfully import a couple of albums when suddenly the software would no longer work (Constantly losing audio output from the turntable, getting hung up exporting to i-tunes and more.)  After spending hours changing configs on my systems and trying suggestions from the manufacturer with absolutely no success I realized that it isn't worth my time anymore, so off it goes back to Amazon.
B000T46O52|5.0|As a conservative,and as someone who believes that marriage should be between a man and a woman,I still love this movie. I in NO WAY hate homosexuals. I may not agree with their lifestyle,but I would NEVER wish a terrible disease on them,like AIDS. NOBODY deserves that. \\"Philadelphia\\" has some great acting by Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington. They sure put on a great performance in this film. If this movie doesn't tug at your heartstrings(liberal or conservative)...then sorry to say it,but you're a cold hearted person.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|At first, I have to admit, I wasn't too sure about this game app.  Don't get me wrong I LOVE the ice age movies.  It's just that I thought at first glance that this particular game was more suited for younger munchkins.  But, I thought what the heck, I'll give it a shot! I'm so glad I decided to try it because it's one of my most favorite apps!  The game progresses perfectly so I never feel like it's a long wait to level up or buy items from the store.  I also never feel pressure to buy coins or acorns with real money. Another great thing about this game is there isn't pressure to get your friends hooked by making them your neighbors.  You can actually invite other players to be your neighbor.  So you don't have to nag your facebook friends to help you out with your little ice-town.  The developers of this game really did an awesome job putting this app together. I'm super impressed and will be a life long player!
1400032717|4.0|I liked that the writers point of view was from the childs thoughts.  Learned alot about autisim, and what they are going through.<br />Would recommend it.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Great quality. I loved every minute of season 3 downton abbey. I would recommend anyone to watch it.  Can't wait for season 4
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I loved the fact that he is a neuroscientist and looked at his NDE from a scientific view. I will read it again.
B005K17RU0|5.0|very good lots of info eassily managed and accessable<br />all the info one would want to know you won't find better
B006M4F67A|4.0|Downloaded this as a freebie. Really enjoy the application so far, though I might more have welcomed some appropriate music background rather than the ever incessant bell chimes. Overall, a decent app', and will likely try some of the developers other offerings.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Touching story every adolescent should read.  I cannot wait to read this to my kids and discuss with them the importance of being kind.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|I had seen the orginal The Godfather in the cinema, but had never seen the sequels.  This is an outstanding collection.  Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are simply superb.  Beautiful views of Sicily and great music really make this a great movie.
B00BQPEIT2|3.0|Only get free games for my KHD, was able to get this from free coins Amazon gave me (thank you!).  Since I'm a TR1 & TR2 addict, gave this one a shot.  Graphics are  beautiful.  Pretty much same concept as TR games. It's challenging at first because you're unaware of the upcoming obstacles.  I wish there was more to it, though, like more characters to run, and let you choose the power ups during your run.  Didn't meet my expectations, but I'll keep it.  UPDATE:  they added more characters, but, of course, you have to buy them.  No thanks.  I'm figuring out slowly but surely how the power ups and stuff work.  It's an okay game.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I laughed, I cried, it was exciting! The characters played off each other so well, especially Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto!! This is a must see! Saw it in the NYC IMAX which was incredible! Have to see it again! Now I must own!!
B000DWMN2S|3.0|This movie focuses on the main story from the book without any of the distracting cutouts that you find in the actual novel. It is mildly entertaining for an artsy obscure movie.
B008C20TDG|4.0|This book is great. It has great information and food choices. I would absolutely recommend it for anyone looking for a healthy change.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This is a very smart read.  This book gives you a scientific and sometimes mathematical explanation of individuals' habits and social ties.  BUT,  readers are not alienated in any way with how it was presented in the book. In fact, i am still in awe and very much amazed at how habits are presented here.  The sample scenarios, popular figures featured and social events mentioned made it very true, familiar and relatable even for readers who are not so much into science and medical fields like myself.<br /><br />This was the same high I got after reading Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers.  Gotta love this book.
B008N1V11U|3.0|This app is fun butt hard to get the hang of .......if u are not smart at all. It's fun if I were u, I would get it
0142421715|5.0|I received Crossed earlier than I expected which was a plus. I then opened the package and was surprised when I found it in such great condition. I loved the book and I am reading Reached. I borrowed it from a friend who got it from Amazon as well. The quality and price of the book was spectacular. I loved it!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This was a great movie and an even better book.  Your kindle support service makes this process very simple and stress free
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|It was'nt a bad read but the things that happend to the children were very upsetting to me. I am glad it had good ending for the main characters.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is fun, smooth, and awesome it really  keeps me occupied while on long trips and just very exciting
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|charges better then my original charging cord does- arrived one day earlier then expected- what a nice surprise- love it
B000F8O35U|5.0|Adorable and timeless classic.  Loved the Movie as a child and love sharing the movie with my children.  Looking forward to the release of the Blu-ray disk, soon.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is great.  It is really fun and really addictive.  If you have a job don't get it.  If you don't have a job get this game!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This book shows how a person can adapt to changes in their life. Both the good and the bad.  They can learn from every event that takes place.
0316228532|5.0|I found the format of the book consistent with the HP books, in that you had numerous characters organized into families, just as you had the different Hogwarts groups.  I thought the number of characters would be overwhelming, but a few chapters in, and I knew them all by name and character.  I have to say I loved the book and finished it at 4:00 am.  The character's quirks, flaws (some quite serious)and foibles rang so true to me. Who doesn't know the poor girl who married well and tries to over-compensate?  Who doesn't know someone handicapped to some extent by mental illness, and trying so hard to hide it? And how about the married women who are searching for their own identity and also for that spark they feel is missing from their lives?  The teen-agers are as confused, curious, mean-spirited and kind by turns as teen-aged children sometimes tend to be.  I was surprised to learn via this site that the book was supposed to be humorous.  Like most reviewers, I realy didn't see that aspect.  The ending was a surprise.  That's quite a statement for a serious reader to make.  It's a long book, more character study than action, but very rewarding.  I recommend.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A beautiful story to the end. Everything a story should have at its end...bittersweet yet the relief that our loved so loved characters have reached their end and have found a sort of peace...not a too perfect unreal happiness but the only kind one can find after going through what they have. It is not often that a story can move me to tears while also making me smile even laugh but Suzanne Collins has done just that throughout this series. (Kisses three fingers and holds them up.)
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read all but two of Grisham's books.  I enjoyed the development of the story and the ability to tie up all the loose endsin the finale.  It was finished too quickly and did make me think of the Shawshank Redemption.  Iespeciallyenjoyed reading via the Kindle Fire.
B004K8WPUQ|4.0|Rode VideoMic Pro VMP Shotgun Microphone<br />This has nothing to do with the sound which is fine, once you have taped the battery in place with some duct tape because the battery cover is impossible to replace.<br />The awesome suspension system is VERY delicate and all comes apart if you look at it funny.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I have found this game to be one that you would love to play. I would recommend this game to all that loves to play puzzle games.
0375758992|4.0|This hauntingly beautiful and often humorous memoir about the author's Rhodesian childhood perfectly embodies that age-old mantra of our writing teachers, show, don't tell! Fuller's prose \\"shows\\" us a clear, unsentimental picture of Africa in the latter half of the twentieth century. It shows us everything: the striking beauty of the terrain, the landmines, the poverty, the violence, the vestiges of colonial life. She shows us the eccentricities of her parents, farmers whose combination of ethnocentrism and heartfelt humanitarianism are sure to befuddle we 21st century American readers with our predilection for putting people into distinct categories. She shows us this with stunning, evocative prose. And she doesn't tell us things. She doesn't politicize in either direction. She doesn't allow her narrative to be perforated with a million post-colonial caveats, admonitions and qualifications. She tells us neither that her parents were racist nor that they were saints. She doesn't editorialize about the legitimacy of her parents' love for Africa, or the fact that they considered it their rightful home. She simply shows us what her life was like in a way that makes a girl from a suburb of Los Angeles feel as though she were really there.<br /><br />The fact that Alexandra Fuller chooses \\"showing\\" over \\"telling\\" has led some readers to call this book \\"Anti-African\\" and others to call it \\"detached.\\" Readers will take from it what they will, but I found it to be neither of these things. I found a memoir that renders a unique life in a unique time and place, with pathos, humor and eloquence.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I got to see this movie with my wife and she love it as much as I do.  We can't wait to see this movie in our own home. It's a must see even if your not in to Star Trek at all.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Very cute and lol.  Watched with the whole family and everyone could relate! I would definitely recommend watching this movie with your adult children!
B007THA4FI|1.0|The content was of no interest to me, I found myself thinking &#34;I couldn't care less about these people&#34; ! I read approximately one-quarter of the novel closed it and never looked back. What a waste of time and money!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|It is such fun to do all this harvesting! This game is fast paced and there is always something to do.
B00A6HHJ9C|5.0|If you can, buy this CD and play it loud with the lights off!<br />Is really great to know that we still have musicians like Lukather that gives the pleasure to look for new music and to keep buying CD´s.<br />This album is perfect from left to right and you are wasting your time if you like good music and you have not listen this album. Go for it!
B00AF6MF9I|2.0|I enjoy this game whn it works,  but it has several bugs and the company took several days to &quot;respond &quot; to my complaint with a form letter.<br />  Some units can only be purchised with &quot;hearts &quot; which are mainly received by gathering them from allies' bases,  which you can do only once a day. out of the 18 alliez I have 15 of them give me the error &quot;unable to load ally's base &quot; every single tkme I try to go there.<br />  the game allows players to place  bounties on other players. There is no indicator of what potential targets have bounties  placed on them. This is especially  vexxing since there are missions that require you to collect bounties.<br />  There are other similar issues but frankly this game isn't worth the time to list them all.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|it is just like the one on the google play store. I have not notteced any problems.<br />I love it
B000002H48|5.0|We have the old LP, but it the sound quality was no longer great.  We loved getting it on CD.  Most of this music isn't available anywhere else.
B009AMANBA|5.0|If Lincoln wasn't more than dead and buried, I would think he ressurrected in this portrayal of a critical segment of Lincoln's presidency. One feels the tension between the delegates of the north and south and perhaps gains a more clear perspective of the oppositions and challenges facing President Abraham Lincoln as he fights for an end to the Civil War and changes history in freeing the slaves of the American south.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Clean, simple interface!<br />Works perfectly and as expected.<br />Well worth the purchase price.<br />Thanks Amazon and Developer for a great deal.
B005TTEFRG|5.0|I loved Jason Momoa's character from the Stargate Atlantis series, so I thought this woukld be a good movie for him, but for some reason I kept missing it at the theatre.  I had it on my list of DVDs to purchase, but it never rose to the top of the list.  Then....  I got hooked on the Disney series Kickin' It with Leo Howard.<br /><br />That young man is a fantastic Karate champion.  For real.  I think he's a two time world champion.  Anyway, I found out that he played the younger Conan in this movie and did a fantastic job.  So, the movie got put to the top of my list.  Wow.  It's worth the purchase price just to see Leo Howard at the beginning of the movie.  Actually, I think they expanded the beginning of the movie because he did such a fantastic job.  Talk about ability and drive.  This young man has it.<br /><br />After they show Conan grown up and being played by Jason Momoa, it was still a good movie to watch.  The back story of what happened when he was young drives him as a man.  It makes for a great storyline.  The costuming and special effects were excellent and did not disappoint.  Overall I really enjoyed it, but being an admirer or the real life talents and skills of Leo Howard definitely has put this movie in my repeat watch favorite movie list.
B003YNFYCO|5.0|This is the era that I liked best about the Beatles.  There is only one tract that I did not recognize. (In other words, no &#34; fillers&#34;.)  If you like the &#34;early&#34; Beatles, this is a must-have CD.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I don't usually do reviews but, this is one very special artist, if you like Dylan, and i do, you'll love this.<br />Plus you can understand him, as a man and a soul. He is not into promoting himself,<br />So it's our job not to let the world to forget his music. Bravo the \\"Sugarman\\"
B003TOMAPC|1.0|I thought it would be funny but it wasn't. The whole movie had a pacing problem and the writing was &#34;ok&#34;. The action was really harsh and violent. Not good violent like Kill Bill, bad violent, like don't watch this movie. It needed some editing. A lot actually. The acting between the characters seemed awkward and eh it's an old movie. I wouldn't pay for this one. Wait for it to become a freebie if you really want to watch it.

B00005K3OT|4.0|Beautiful love story.<br />I enjoyed this movie very much and I'm sure I will be watching it again and again
0062014536|3.0|If I see the word pinwheel one more time I will flip out. The narration between Lena and her best friend sound like one and the same person.
B000OSDSKM|5.0|This movie plot (an unauthorized take-over of the US Government) is still alive and well today.  A very good movie.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was outstanding!  I've never played anything like it before.  How refreshing.  I can not wait to see more, it makes you feel as if you are apart of it.  Great job!
006197806X|3.0|Too much description...not enough dialogue. I felt the connection between Julian and Lena was weak. They went through a tramatic thing together. I get it. But really? Already she's on the rebound when she's just come to accept that love isn't a disease??
B004NNUZ5K|5.0|This eloquently written book explains concepts and techniques in such a way that enables creative and critical skill building. The sheer weight of information contained within seemed almost overwhelming but I'm glad to have it as I have been growing from strength to strength. No matter how many times I have read it, opening this book to a random page and reading for a couple minutes instantly inspires me to mix.<br />Very grateful for such a thorough text.
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|Do not listen to all the hate and confusion behind this movie. Chances are very high that those who do not understand it are too young to fully grasp it.<br /><br />If you love artistic cinema, this film is your new best friend.<br /><br />Genius.
B001H4NXCK|4.0|I have watched this movie several times and always love it.  It is a really funny movie, you will love it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great story, I wish it would never end. I'm now reading spin offs of this book by other authors just to keep my &#34;silo&#34; high going!
B007EECSFA|5.0|Loved it.  Loved it.  The story (and the truth) unfolded well and was enjoyable to read.  Loved the alternating chapters.
B006H5120E|4.0|The 3D was remarkably well done considering the film wasn't originally filmed in 3D. It was not as amazing as Avatar but awesome nonetheless. One noteworthy scene where the 3D added to the movie was when the water was filling the ship, you could actually see and \\"feel\\" the depth of the water. In many scenes, the sense of depth helped to get you immersed in the room of the ship or note the nuances to the character's face. The only gimmicky use of the 3D was the intentional \\"pop-out\\" of the Blu-ray menu, otherwise, the use of 3D in the Blu-ray version of Titanic was tastefully used to enhance immersion into the movie.
B004JQN4WM|5.0|I love the detail that papo puts into these, they are realistic and adorable. It feels very much alive and I would recommend these for any dino lover, or for children.
0307277674|5.0|don't start if you intend to put it down before you finish...just a warning it is that good trust me !! :)
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I'd never really thought about the world in the light that hazel saw it until i read this book. Thanks for letting me know it's ok to leave love as my only mark. :)
B005LAIHSG|4.0|I bought this film for one reason--Charlize Theron.  I guess that will teach me!  I played this DVD once and then a second time with the hearing impaired dialog turned on.  What a mess!  After viewing this thing twice I went to the computer and looked up some reviews of this film.  I can only agree it is a confusing mess.  When the film starts out a voice over says he is Eric and goes on to describe the prolog to the film.  We never hear the name again.  Turns out Eric is the Huntsman of the title.  But during the film he is never called by his name--just the Huntsman.  Accents come and go during the film, especially during moments of anger or stress.  This is what we have here.  A US-British production of a German fairy tale.  Most if not all the production team is British.  We have an Australian actor mumbling his lines with a British Medieval accent as the lead.  The female lead (Kristen Stewart) has an American accent, though as a little girl has a decidedly British accent.  And Charlize's accent comes and goes with anger and stress, but is fairly strong when not.  One of the minor characters is named Greta a German name, but a British accent.  And that is just the accents.  I would recommend that you switch on the hearing impaired dialog so you can understand what is being said.  Otherwise it can be confusing.  I gave this 4 stars as the more I watch this film the odder and funnier it seems to get.
B0094K1WZE|1.0|I had several people tell me that this mission impossible was noteworthy in that it was better than its siblings. No. In fact, it was the exact same. Same plot, same maniacal bad guy, same alluring sidekick girl, same formulaic suspense. It's fine for MI, but just expect the same thing that you've seen, what, 4 times already?
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|It was a book that makes you look at your own life and ask your...&#34;what would I do?&#34; I couldn't stop reading it even if I wanted to. First book I've ever read by Ms. Picoult and it will defiantly wont be the last.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This is one of the most delightful films I have seen in a long time.  The humor in this film is great.  it concerns Beca (Anna Kendrick) who must go to college for a year and join one club.  She winds up joining an a cappella group called The Bellas an all female group of singers who are in direct competition with the Treblemakers an all male group from the same college.  The rest is pure fun.  The music is outstanding.  The final competition is off the charts.  I recommend this film.  The language is a little rough in places, but not excessive so I would recommend you view this before letting smaller children watch it.
B005PWPUW6|4.0|It´s nice but makes an ugly noise with HD channels, well for the rest, good product for the price paid
0553106635|3.0|Bought this book because I'm doing my first read through of the series. I love the content, but the book itself is rubbish, the binding broke even after I opened it correctly from the center.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I thought the book was definitely better than the movie, but I still liked the movie.  Read before watching the movie
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I enjoyed it - knowing it was the first book of several I read it before seeing the movie - liked having the extra details. I thought it was quite a fast read, but it is geared for a younger audience.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />J
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Another fantastic book from Ken Follett.  The characters were realistic.  Story held my interest from beginning to end.  Was sorry when I reached the end ......wanted more.  I intend to get the second book in this wonderful trilogy.  Truly enjoyable read.
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|I just turned 40 and needed something to watch on my flight to Las Vegas.  Apparently I was laughing so much people around me after the flight were asking what I was watching.  Hilarious!
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I always liked The Eagles music growing up with their awesome line up of talent.I watched this on Showtime three times in the past three days cause it's that awesome.I ordered this here right away cause there are very few bands with this much talent and still going strong today.Every song from Don Henley is an absolute treasure with The Eagles and solo.I love the old footage watching them sing their iconic tunes when they had the long hair seventies look.This gives you so much insight into this band as if you were a member.Glen Frey is an awesome guy and sometimes no nonsense iron hand approach to his band mates seems a little too much but he had to be for the bands growth.I would compare the song writing of Frey/Henley to Lennon/McCartney.My wife and I love every song and it took us back especially I Can't Tell You Why.There is so much to learn from this extensive look into one of the best bands ever.
B000XUBC5E|5.0|This book grabbed my attention and held it from chapter one and continued to the last page.  I am hooked on this author and can't wait to read his other books.  Every page had another surprise, twist and turn.  His writing style is terrific.  I intend to read every Harlan Coben book I can find.  Oh, did you get the idea that I loved this book?  Read it, you won't be sorry.
B002UWH8P6|5.0|Almost all the reviews I have read say they loved or enjoyed this series  .. So of course it was cancelled and some mindless fluff cheaper to produce replaced it so that the main network shows where threatened ..total bs don't u agree?
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have really enjoyed using this bible in church and for studying at home.  It is easy to look up definitions and make notes.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|This game is really fun. It is one of the games that you can just get it out and play a quick game. Play time is 10-20 mins and you can have as many people as you want play it. It is very simple to learn and I have played it with both family and friends.
B009POHHR6|5.0|Amazing what if story that makes you wonder how much would change with all these characters. I highly recommend for superman fans
0805079831|4.0|I found this work really fascinating.<br /><br />There are a number of authors who would counter some of Naomi Klein's claims but I haven't found anyone yet who refutes<br />all of this work.<br /><br />If you work in emergency management it highlights the other forces operating around you that you need to be very aware of.<br /><br />Very engaging read that leaves you wondering about events in the world and how in control you really are.<br /><br />If you travel often the audio also makes very good listening.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I think everyone should read this very inspiring story about this boy named August Pullman it's very powerful I loved it!!!!!!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I love this game but when they came out with dino world the people that were pass level 25 got it for free but the people that weren't have to pay about 250 acorns and that is the only concern for this game that I have.
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|I really liked this album.<br />But I like the artist.<br />Great job Demi!<br />Keep up the good work!<br />Love your music!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It comes in handy and readily available! It's a must for every tablet owner. Perfect for everyday living. I can't live without it.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|very sturdy and love the protection it provides to my Iphone, would definitely buy again or similar product-economically priced for me
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I could not put it down. Even after seeing the movie first, every page was 100% enjoyable. Every word was wonderfully written.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|What an amazing empowering book. I am so glad I read it! Definitely worth it! This is the start to my new life!
B00913DPW2|5.0|Spooky, fun to play, challenging but not impossible. Storyline puts you right in the game. I thoroughly enjoyed this one.
B005LAII62|5.0|I think this movie is great for anyone, it opens the mind, especially when it comes to letting other people know of men and women with the gifts of seeing the deceased, and educating children that's its ok.
B0092S4WLY|3.0|I'm a wuss. If I can't figure out whats going on for too long, I get bored and don't want to play anymore. I like using my brain, but I think that I prefer adventure games or escape games where you can at least go to different rooms and you might find a wrench in room A that you need for room B, etc. When I have to look at the  screen for too long and I just can't figure it out I get frustrated and bored. I guess its just the wrong game for someone with A.D.D. I need to have more going on.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|A sometimes difficult read.  This book isn't one of those la, la, happy-go-lucky books.  It's about being lost at sea with wild animals, but it's also about a spiritual journey.  It's well worth a read.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|It was just like an extended version of Glee. I expected a funnier movie and it just didn't do much for me.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I learn things from this book every day!  For years, I thought I was just weird.  Reading this helped to know that I'm not weird, I just process things differently than my extrovert friends.  It has given me new insight!
B00A77II0U|5.0|Fun, crazy, great graphics. Awesome story and great game play. Absolute hit. Alawar is my go to game company for sure.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I'm not going to write a huge review and I'm not including any spoilers (see other reviews for that), but I agree with everyone else who was disappointed in this ending to the series. I think any fan will be. Maybe I built it up too much in my mind, but it seemed that it was just thrown together to tie up loose ends and be done with it (and I don't think there was any need to bring back some of those old characters). I feel deflated and a bit let-down. The True Blood HBO series has gotten so far away from anything the books were, I was hoping to \\"get back to normal\\" so-to-speak. I think I would have preferred to see Sookie killed-off to end the series instead of this.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I love the concept, but for me, dropbox is a little easier to use. I think if I needed to take a lot of business files with me and I was using it for a professional capacity it would be great, but a little bit too much for what I use it for.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|Concordance, maps, various other topics about the history and meaning of the Word very helpful and rewarding to read and gain insight.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I go no where without my sonic screwdriver. For those annoying days when you have to face down the Daleks or when you have to open a hatch and forgot your key it's just the thing. I haven't actually used the pen part, but the screwdriver part makes a great realistic noise and makes me feel like a madman in a box.
B00CN4C0OK|5.0|In Vain already had proven their mastery of extreme metal through their previous releases, Mantra and The Latter Rain. Ænigma takes it all to a new level. Their pre-release of \\"Against the Grain\\" was a really good preview of what would be coming. In Vain has the ability not just to combine harsh and clean vocals -- that's nothing new. But they combine aggressive, head-banging vocals with some of the most sweeping and beautiful harmonies seamlessly. This is where they excel. Such quality shines all the brighter on tracks like \\"Hymne Til Havet\\" (Hymn to the Sea), which begins with harsh black metal vocals and blends into multi-voice harmonies. The inclusion of guest musicians, including strings and saxophone add intriguing layers. I'm not generally a fan of saxophone as an instrument, but the way it is used -- especially in \\"Culmination of the Ænigma\\" -- is powerful in ways I never anticipated. And naturally, the use of violin and cello are superb. There is nothing on the album that is worth skipping; it's all excellent. So if you're looking for raw aggression with progressive melodies and unparallelled originality, Ænigma is a great choice.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|Absolutely loved this musical.  The encore with past performers and others was very fitting.  Here are six more words, words etc.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|very funny...  looking forward to the sequel... not a fan of musicals but this one was very good...  i would purchase it again
B00CBRADU2|2.0|So predictable...not worth watching...I was really lookig forward to this, so glad we didn't waste the money for the theater.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|great show, cant wait for War of the Damned...  great to see Liam take charge in this role as Spartacus
B000YAA68C|1.0|My wife and I watched the first 20 minutes or so of this movie, based on the overall recommendations given it here.  That was enough. Neither of us liked what we saw or what was portended.  We found it to be a typical modern &#34;romance&#34;--brassy, acidic, and often insulting.  I guess we are too old for this kind of  nonsense.  We'll stick with  older romantic movies that have some class. No thanks, please.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Fun and fast paced...very similar to bejeweled can be very addicting..a game you can play for hours and never tire of
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I gave just 4 stars because of the constant (well, almost) having to shuffle.  The variety of the game is terrific, nice tiles...it's strictly the all the time shuffle that gets to me.  Have been huge fan of mahjong for years, this is first I've encountered that I have to shuffle so often...have I lost my skill???? lol
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is so funny its great for kids i think its a great book i love this book! This book is  amazingly funny
B00BW5K5DO|3.0|Just wasn't what I expected...guess I got to used to more of a challenge from Playrix, and with this I don't get that.  Sorry, but that's just me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so cool every time you mess up its like you can do it again and every time you do that it makes you try try try and every time you try you get better and thats why I love love love and a big love this game when im playing this game im just not setting at home board im doing something and having fun!!!
0143113100|4.0|Very interesting analysis and stories regarding how the brain can change.<br /><br />Certainly gives quite a few perspectives that will change how you think about the function of the brain.<br /><br />Maybe a bit of a long book, I found myself speed reading or hopping through a few sections.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|It is a most enjoyable read.  I have enjoyed all the heat books.  Castle is one heck of a writer.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Well written...but the storyline was boring...wouldn't recommend. I'm surprised it got good reviews.  Probably wouldn't read another one of her books.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|Captain America: The First Avenger is the best non-comedy film of summer 2011. Read: here we have the first and only strong action-laden comic book adaptation of this season, a minor godsend in the midst of heinous sequels, lame comic adaptations, and overblown action epics.<br /><br />I'm not one for jingoistic, rah-rah, \\"My Country Right or Wrong\\" type of American sentiment, so the mere notion of a dude running around in a red, white, and blue get-up slaying bad guys in the name of patriotism is not, on its face, my cup of tea. Add to that my admission that I was not, strictly speaking, an avid comic book reader growing up, and this movie might seem to be rejected just on the basis of my DNA makeup. But damn it, it works - exceedingly well, from the opening frames to the closing credits, which are more creative than the entirety of 2011's other comic-inspired offerings.<br /><br />The film places its emphasis on story and character rather than just roughly recreating the comic lore. And it is, in fact, a bit of a satire on jingoism, playfully mocking the propaganda of the WWII era. Written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (who earlier penned the Chronicles of Narnia films to decidedly less success) and directed by Joe Johnston, arguably the most imaginative film director to tackle a comic book film to date, The First Avenger works on every level. It works as an origin story, an action film, a faithful adaptation of the source material, and a story about a scrawny kid with a big heart who is given an opportunity to make his transform his body into the physical representation of his inner strength, and uses it to carry out justice against a bad-ass super-villain.<br /><br />Chris Evans has long been a safely charming presence in a variety of middling comedies and action pictures, but he finds a way into Steve Rogers, the short-and-skinny kid who soon becomes a genetically-engineered super soldier, that affords him a humanity he has never reached as an actor. Steve/Cap's romantic foil, Peggy Carter, is played by British import Hayley Atwell (The Duchess), who arrives out of virtual anonymity to announce herself as the next great charismatic lead actress. The screenplay wisely allows Peggy more room to contribute to the story rather than just filling her role as \\"The Girl,\\" and her relationship with the titular hero is engaging without ever becoming cloying or playing out to presumed expectations. Also aiding our newly-minted hero is Colonel Chester Phillips, played by Tommy Lee Jones as only he can - with that patented form of grizzled, no-nonsense, wise-cracking charm. And Hugo Weaving, already one of the great portrayers of epic Hollywood villains, crafts another big one as rogue Nazi agent Johann Schmidt, who transforms into Red Skull, the evil Yin to Cap's heroic Yang.<br /><br />Form and style are prominent elements in the film; its sepia-tinged imagery has been a point of discussion ever since the first teaser trailer debuted during the Super Bowl. The play on classic antiquity could easily come off as a trite gag, but Johnston - aided by cinematographer Shelly Johnson - has such a command of this world that the visual element washes over us, drawing us completely into not merely a particular time and place, but to a state of psychic nostalgia. The film takes its time to get to the major action set pieces, but once they arrive, the excitement fuses with the nostalgia to create one of the great comic-to-screen transitions we've ever seen.<br /><br />Few films are perfect, and as fun as Captain America: The First Avenger is, there is one gaping hole near film's end that can only be discussed after a clearly marked SPOILER WARNING. Baked right into the title is that \\"avenger\\" word, carefully placed to telegraph the film's ultimate conclusion, which in all fairness is clever and engaging and true to the gradual path of the comics. Problem is, it is only there to act as a dynamite lead-in for next year's superhero extravaganza, The Avengers. The necessity for immediate cross-breeding among Marvel entities brings the story to an odd halt, one that basically threatens the future of this franchise continuing with this same group of engaging characters - at least without some serious comic book massaging of details and timelines, a massage Marvel Studios is likely more than willing to perform. (End spoilers.)<br /><br />Frustrating ending aside, the film is an absolute blast. Captain America: The First Avenger, against all odds, will endure with Iron Man and Sam Raimi's first two Spider-Man films as one of the best Marvel adaptations ever.
B00A8LYYI0|5.0|best movie tanks by send me to colombia, i am used my collection the best of movie on bluray disc
B005OT2YVA|4.0|Ok let's be honest, most action/adventure movies will never be nominated for (let alone win) the top Oscars. There are always a few exceptions (Heath Ledger, LOTR, etc) but they are few. I don't watch action movies with the idea that they will move me, if anything the trailers of most movies give so much away I usually have an idea of what's going to happen and how it will end. That being said I saw Dark of the Moon at the theater and enjoyed it enough to buy the blu ray. I have to say that it was on par with my expectation of Michael Bay movies: loud, action packed, and lots of explosions. I grew up watching the cartoon so perhaps my view is slightly skewed as I was stoked to see one of my favorite shows brought to life. I didn't care for the 2nd one and I thought the 3rd one was an improvement. Yes Shia LaBeouf is over the top and screaming frequently and Peter Cullen comes off pontificating whenever he speaks, but it's still a good popcorn movie.<br /><br />The video was crisp and clear, the audio sounded excellent through my dated home theater system<br /><br />One thing I'm disappointed about is the lack of special features. I missed that it was only available for the 3D version, so that was irritating. I've seen my share of movies in 3D and I don't personally see the need to own a 3D TV so I'm not wasting money on a 3D version of a movie.
B001EBV0P8|5.0|Most films based off of Stephen King's stories fall far short of what could be done.  However, like its fellow novella &#34;The Body&#34; from &#34;Different Seasons&#34; (the basis for &#34;Stand By Me&#34;), the story of Andy Dufresne and his fellow inmate &#34;Red&#34; Redding has been marvelously adapted to the big screen.<br /><br />Set in the early half of the 20th century, Andy is convicted of killing his wife and her lover, and sent to Shawshank State Penitentiary to serve out consecutive life sentences.  His presence soon becomes felt among the entire population of the prison, both convicts and guards, and how he turns the tables on his captors remains one of the better tales set to paper and film.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I would recommend it, even if you don't enjoy gardening.  It was hard to put down.  You kept believing in the strength Victoria had to succeed.
B0043UB0EI|4.0|Good series to sit and watch popcorn to.  The show is rather crude in language, though, so be warned...and under no circumstances should kids be allowed to watch.
B007REV4YI|4.0|The DVD was a fair value I bought the Bond set and need this one to complete the set. There was no problem with the DVD or the shipping.
B006RXSBS2|5.0|Daniel Day-Lewis steals the show as Bill &#34;The Butcher&#34; Cutting, who wins a battle of opposing gangs in the film's opening scene.  This allows him to rule the Five Points area of NYC; the rest of the movie is set some sixteen years later, after the Butcher has solidified his grasp on the district.  A film of revenge, the movie also touches on the events of the city at the time, including widespread corruption of the voting polls, the harsh treatment of immigrants, and the effect of the Civil War on an area far removed from the fighting.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I was really glad to receive this dvd, as for some reason it was the one I couldn't find anywhere.<br />It completes my set and I am looking forward to season 5 dvd set.<br />I love this show.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I don't normally go for these older period shows but this is a excellent and very engaging show!!  If you want to watch a good show, watch Dowton Abbey!!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Absolutely one of the best books I have ever read along with Rick Riordan's series The Olympians Rick Riordan's did not put Greek Mythology in some boring form he put it in the present tense and gave two points of view of the almighty Gods
B009MYARIK|5.0|Being a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella's work, I was thrilled to read her new book. Thankfully, it was just as good, if not better than her previous titles. One too many times I have gotten hooked on an author, excitedly waiting for their new release, only to be disappointed by it. NOT THIS TIME! I loved this book!
B0015DWLD0|4.0|It is an instructive book, through it we learn a great deal about life and culture in India. The ironical tone of the narrator soothens the harshness of the subject-matter. The plot is simple and uncomplicated.<br /> It is seen and narrated through the eyes of a very naive young man who is at the same time the main character in the novel. His desire to be free and independent is the central factor in the novel.<br />I compare the style to that used by Chinua Achebe in his trilogy &#34;Things Fall Apart&#34;
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I read it in all of about 6 hours over two days. Maybe that sounds impressive, but the whole time I just kept waiting for it to get REALLY good... Maybe that's terrible of me, but she didn't take any hard stands or make any groundbreaking declarations. For the well-versed and politically-current reader, it was all old news.<br /><br />That being said, I will still recommend it to my mother because she's just a little older than Fey so I think she will enjoy this book more than I did.<br /><br />And it's a good start to the much-needed discussion on our society's attitudes towards women. I just wish it had gone a little further...
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I enjoy reading about this topic - life after death.There are no answers just &#34;plenty food for thought&#34; for those who ask themselves what is beyond.  It is written in an informal, engaging style, in a tone typical of someone who has gone through a very traumatic experience.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I loved this movie when I saw it in the theater and wanted the 3D version for home.  I am looking forward to the next one!
B009FZFONO|5.0|I love the Walking Dead.  Each episode has the right amount of drama and character involvement to keep it entertaining and &#34;realistic&#34; with just the right amount of scary,gory action to make it a &#34;cling to your seat&#34; experience!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Fun and addictive and not a game that requires micro transactions. Love it.Old school action good for small breaks and simple for the kids to play. Worth a buck any day.

B00CW665VI|5.0|Brittany's Review: 5 holy s*** are you sure I can't give more Stars!!!<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />\\"Don't put off till tomorrow anyone you could be doing today.\\"<br /><br />I'm convinced I should have been a dude. Seriously. Everything your brother, husband, or boyfriend does that drives you crazy...yup. I do it. I'm messy, love fowl language, my mind is always in the gutter, super competitive, always want to get my way... OK you get the point. Now what does this have to do with Tangled you ask? Only EVERYTHING. This book is literally my book soul mate. Emma Chase amazingly wrote a book that made me laugh like crazy, want to punch Drew AND Kate, all while loving every single word.<br /><br />\\"It makes me want to kiss her and strangle her at the same time. I've never been into S&M. But I'm beginning to see its benefits.\\"<br /><br />What's better than a book that's half Wallbanger and half Beautiful Bastard? A book from a guys POV. Yeah, every little dirty thought on display. Any book that quotes Anchorman, Braveheart, Pretty Women and dishes on The Notebook = Awesome!! This was the book I didn't know I was missing, but now has a nice little spot in my top 10. Yeah. That good.<br /><br />\\"I'm well-groomed, my chin is clean-shaven, and my black hair is slicked back at the sides in a way I've been told makes me look dangerous but professional. My suits are handmade. I wear shoes that cost more than your rent.\\"<br /><br />Everyone, Meet Drew Evans. He has the flu. Or so he thinks. A.K.A. He's in love. Cocky, playboy banker extraordinaire, is in uncharted waters and as the reader you get to enjoy every single second of it. Drew is everything you didn't want to believe a boy is. And honestly, you want to hate him so bad for his crude behavior. But you can't. He's one cocky, lovable bastard.<br /><br />Kate Brooks is the heroine you want in every book. Whiney, weak, are not even in her description. I LOVED her just as much as Drew. She is who every strong women aspires to be. I wanted to high five her, constantly.<br /><br />Add these two characters together, and it's a recipe for disaster, or brilliant, brilliant, hate and sexual tension. And that's exactly what you get in Tangled and Chase brilliantly uncovers the past and the present in the most creative writing I've seen in, years.<br /><br />The book spews Drews personality. Honestly, it felt like I was sitting on the couch next to him while he was telling me his story for the first half. The second half, I felt like I was watching the greatest sales pitch from the audience. I loved the way Drew break the 4th wall and speak to the reader.<br /><br />We read A LOT of books at Fiction and Fashion, and this one stands out the most. It's different, gritty, funny, and well rounded. The only thing Emma Chase can do to make this better, is give me another book. There are plenty of willing men in the amazing supporting cast (along will AMAZINGLY written Females, Alexandra and Mackenzie anyone?!) that I would love to get into their head.<br /><br />And for the record. Emma Chase is my new girl crush. Anyone who can create Drew Evans, deserves to be...worshiped  And (as if I need more!) I just love that she gave me a new insult to throw at people...you Alexandra.cters together, and it's a recipe for disaster, or brilliant, brilliant, hate and sexual tension.

B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This works just like it is made to work. Makes reading PDF easy on my Kindle Fire. I would recommend this for anyone who reads PDF files.
B00A757EFW|5.0|This game was a old time favorite of mines when I was growing up, I love playing this game. The app is just like the game you play in the arcade, download was very easy and quick

B00C2VGAW2|5.0|Do yourself a favor. Stop reading this review and just get your hands on this CD right NOW. Rarely do I feel compelled to rave about something, but this CD requires it of me. I have yet to see The Great Gatsby, but I cannot wait to to see how the music syncs up with the movie and scenes. Baz is simply genius for what he has chosen to include here and do with the soundtrack. Jazz and era appropriate notes are infused into every track in some big or small way, but it has all been flipped on its head and been modernized. As I like to say, Baz has given us some \\"techno jazz!\\". I actually have the deluxe version of this, which includes a couple extra things like a great remix of both Florence and Lana's songs that are defintely worth listening to.<br />The whole CD really flows well and all the songs just complement each other even though they are vastly different. The tone is really the same, even amongst the upbeat and slower songs. It's like the artists all recorded one after another in the same place. There are few missteps, and no real major ones. Themes such as heartache, all comsuming love, destruction, and lavish partying abound. It is one of those CDs that will transport you if you let it.<br />I truly feel the need to include a song by song breakdown, apologies if I include something that's not on the regular disc:<br />* $100 Bill: A hard hitting, swagger filled bumper as an ode to Gatsby. Jay Z doing what he does best: being a boss. 8/10<br />*Together: An intimate, passionate song with a haunting feel. You can just feel the doomed romance pouring from it. 8/10<br />*Back to Black: One of the few missteps present. B and Andre doing their thing, but it comes off as way too lazy and odd. 3/10<br />* Hearts a Mess: Who doesn't love Gotye. A bit of fun instrumentation and the absolute, intense pain that Gotye pours out like a shattered vase of water make this a definite winner. My only complaint is that it plods on a bit much times. 9/10<br />* Where the Wind Blows: A fun throwback tune. One of the more positive songs on the CD. Coco is a good singer too. 7/10<br />* Love is a Drug: Probably the most true to period song on the album. Very boozy nightclub surrounded by gangster's- esque and completely fun. 8/10<br />* Love is Blindness: The rock part of the disc. Jack White's contribution almost feels like a young Johnny Cash, with the same amount of broken heart and woman done me wrong-ness. Again, you can just feel every ounce of pain 9/10<br />* Young and Beautiful: One of my absolute favorites (the orchestral version is amazing..). Lana absolutely paints a great picture of a woman hoping with all her might for everlasting love. 10/10<br />*No Church in the Wild: Kanye filled swagger! Includes some awesome verses and a great \\"wild\\" beat and animal noises. Includes one of my new favorite quotes: When we die the money we can't keep, but we probably spend it all because the pain ain't cheap. Preach it. 10/10<br />* Crazy in Love: Emeli Sande's take on Beyonce's uber hit. A super fun flapper version that might just be better then the original. 7/10<br />* Bang Bang: will.i.am jumps on to give a horn based tune. Most likely the only other misstep, and like Back to Black is just feels a bit lazy and off. 4/10<br />* A Little Party Never Killed Nobody: My other favorite song! My vote for song of the summer... absolute fun with throwback moments and awesome EDM breakdown. Fergie sounds awesome too. Skee ba da bop!!! 10/10 Bringing about the revolution of techno jazz<br />* Over the Love: You can never go wrong with Florence. She infuses her soul and light into everything she sings. Your heart will break with her. 10/10<br />* Into the Past: Some may not like this song, but I adore Nero. If you don't know who they are, go look them up right now.  A breathy, deep tune with an awesome trance-y backdrop. Epic in my book. 10/10<br />* Kill and Run: Sia is another artist the just reeks of pain and loss. Her contribution is beautiful and heartbreaking as well. A bit Bond-like too! 8/10<br /><br />As you can tell, I really liked almost every song but 2, and I still listen to them anyway. The whole CD just WORKS. The Great Gatsby, The Great CD!
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|It's the first game that I have played that as one of its highlights is the ability to punch an egg that turns you into a gnome. It's a 8-bit action platformer game that works perfectly on touchscreens.  It plays like a cross between to Double Dragon and Jetpack Joyride.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|Good movie.  Although I never knew that Spock was so emotional.  I think they should have developed more on the plot line regarding the Romulans
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I maybe wouldn't pay for the physical copy, but the Kindle book price was totally worth it. Another Sanderson gem.
B003UYV08E|5.0|I felt that this movie was easier to follow than the first one. The villains were fun and complicated, but not so complicated we could not understand who they were or what they were trying to do. Robert Downey Jr. was his usual outrageously overly confident self, but that's what makes these things fun: It's comforting to know somebody, if only in a story, can be supremely confident. Having a situation in which everybody knows the identity of a super hero makes for a different angle from the usual super hero story. Pepper is given a stronger part than the first movie, and we love her for her faithfulness and personal integrity. If there was a weakness to this movie, Scarlet Johannson's part could have been bigger. Of course, that might have made the movie too long. This is a really fun movie. Hope there will be many sequels!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have always loved playing this on the computer, and I am so glad I can play it on my Kindle where ever I am.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I had my doubts.  Glad I was wrong!  It actually gets better and better as you go along.  You don't have to buy extra coins.  There are ways to build them back up! I never write reviews but this fun and simple game was worth my time.  Any age will enjoy.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|Really great acting, lot of emotions felt throughout the movie, and really kept me entertained and interested in the characters.
0140544518|5.0|My four kids, ranging in age from 4 to 9, love this book. The wolf's side of the story is humorous and unexpected. I also enjoyed it! :)
B0034G4OYK|4.0|This movie was much better than expected.  We rented it first to see if we wanted to buy this movie or not.  It was pretty unanimous that this was one we wanted in our collection.  Very funny and great 3D visuals.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|I enjoy Alicia Keys music so.  When I moved I lost her CD, so I was extremely excited when I received her CD in the mail again.
B007TKT2SK|3.0|A simple app. Kind of a lack-luster FAOTD, but better than shovelware, which is software that was made with little to no effort by a developer.<br /><br />This is a calculator app specializing in adding, multiplying, dividing, and subtracting fractions. It's UI is a bit confusing and the \\"help\\" may be easily overlooked the first time around.<br /><br />I suggest the developer to reorganize the UI to the landscape screen rotation, making the app rectangular. This will allow for more space on the side, reorganizing the whole number buttons at 3x3 so users can pick up the buttons easily at first.<br /><br />Another addon the developer could include to this great app would perhaps adding a daytime and nightime skin. Daytime, a lightly-colored ui, nighttime, a more dark ui which allows better sight at night. Maybe even some novelty skins.<br /><br />Overall, it's a nice app. I'm not quite sure it deserves the price and large amount of 5-star reviews, but I assure you it does it's job.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|My husband and I thoroughly enjoy this CD. With a mixture of bluesy, a little jazzy and some island mix this collection fits any mood!
B006L9B6TI|4.0|Good.  Interesting and inspiring to know how we should view life and comand what we want.  Very motivating and encouraging.
B00000J2PH|5.0|this would be my favourite cd had it as a record back in the seventies great to be able to play it again
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I enjoy this game. I started keeping it up because my 5 year old step son is an Ice Age fanatic.<br />Some things are un-obtainable with out purchasing acorns, which can get pricey.<br />The social network aspect is unpredictable. I don't really care for the new changes. I am unable to connect to a fb friend who's daughter plays.<br />You get to a point where you can't do a whole lot. Waiting for acorns, slowly building dino world.<br />And it seems my step son isn't as interested in it as I thought he would be.
1451695195|4.0|I enjoyed this book as it made me feel that i will see my late husband again one day. It was easy reading and I had a tough time putting it down. The end chapters made me tear up, as it brings the complete story together. A friend referred me to it and I am glad she did.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|Okay game. kids seem to like it a lot. Its nice once you start to really earn coins, but to do so you have to pay for some bling and get some of the play places, because they earn you the coins. I recommend taking advantage of sales.<br />Game also does not connect in any way to social network. Not that bad, except there are goals that require you to.<br />Also, this game freezes up more than any other game on my kindle hd. That is annoying.<br />I keep it going so the kids can enjoy it when they visit. They are 8 and 5, and love the game.
1451638450|3.0|I am a big fan of the Vorkorsigan books and usually read new books in the series very quickly-- a week or less. This book took me about eight months to finish. It just did not capture my attention nearly as much as the other books. If you are just starting the Vorkorsigan series, you probably don't want to start with this book. I assume that people who are reading this review are somewhat familiar with the series.<br /><br />I really liked the idea of a novel about Miles' \\"idiot\\" cousin Ivan. Ivan has always been sort of a comic sidekick who has made an appearance in many (most?) of the previous novels. This book focused on Ivan's coming to age as he tries to balance many different responsabilities and does not do a very good job of it. But neither does he do an idiotic job of it. As with most of Bujold's books, the writing is light and the story has a sense of humor. It does not take itself too seriously. I liked the use of the two first person narrators-- flipping between Ivan and his \\"alliance,\\" Tej.<br /><br />I like Miles' cameo apperance as well as the participation of Gregor, the Emperor, who has always been one of my favorite characters.<br /><br />I look forward to seeing how the Ivan at the end of this book meets the Miles at the end of [[ASIN:1451637500 Cryoburn (The Vorkosigan Saga)]].<br /><br />Having said, all of that, I just found the story slow and it was hard for me to get involved with it...at least until about halfway. It was well enough written that I was not tempted to put it down, I just did not feel that compelled to read it. I hope that Ms. Bujold can give us another book in the series.
B00BIPORC8|5.0|It's a great show Juliana M. Is amazing on it. This season shows how her character starts doing things for herself but with hesitation.
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|Learning history through visual aids is as good as reading a book. Hope others share my view so long the script is closer to reality and not just fiction
B000FBJFSC|5.0|This memoir is written in the language of the Irish poor and tells a sad, tragic, but all too true story of Ireland and its immigrants and people in the early to middle part of the last century.  What it must have taken to dredge up the misery that the author endured and write about it and, with seeming impartiality, is unfathomable to me.  A gut wrenching story and one that every struggling young person should read.  The odds against Frank McCourt's getting beyond the lanes of Limerick seemed insurmountable but he proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that the will to survive and succeed can conquer just about anything.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game is well beyond a review. It's the epicness of pandemic with tons and tons of levels. Those little goo balls are so much fun. But it gets way harder as it goes on. Lol gonna take a bit to beat and that is awesome by me :)
B0063M22QO|3.0|Limited puzzles. No sense of how well one is completing the puzzles. Finished all puzzles in just a few days.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Welcome back cameos by Mike Franks who acts like Leroy's conscience.  What bait to keep us enthralled till next season.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|I played this at work and numerous people who wouldn't choose something with classical instruments stopped to listen and said they really liked it. This isn't like many albums that have two good cuts and the rest is filler. Every band on this one is enjoyable.
B0096HFOZO|5.0|This is my second time reading a ronald Dahl book. I thought this book is very funny! I would suggest it to kids that enjoy humor. I will continue to read Ronald Dahl.
B00ANVX6DY|5.0|DVD plays properly and all is well. My 4-year-old daughter really enjoys the story and can watch it over and over. Definitely a bonus that it includes and appearance by Cinderella!

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great story, great characters and I can't wait until the next season of this production.  Tea anyone?  VBG  this would be a super addition to the show.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Lincoln is a great movie.  we saw this, and i had to get a copy for my husband as a pn Easter gift.  fast delivery time, great price.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Drew hooked me from the first page. This book is written as his POV. A tale of Drew and Kate and what a story it is...Drew is a \\"playboy\\" that you want to smack at times, but you can't help, but love him. Then he meets Katherine, aka Kate and the wild ride begins.<br /><br />I laughed so hard at the chain of events at the Thanksgiving dinner table, my husband thought I was going nuts! Plain and simple this is just make you a feel good book and I loved it.
B007XIC1GI|5.0|Downright amazing. One of the best books I have read from a musical legend. I would highly recommend others to read it.
B004I744AS|4.0|I like this app because it is easy to use on my kindle fire. I like that it lets you hear how the word is pronounced.  Most free dictionary apps don't do that! :)
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Good game.....worth the money....have played many games....this is one that will keep you wondering....Good graphics and story line...not too weird
0792839730|4.0|I overly enjoyed this cinematic depiction of Operation Market Garden, but the view that it gives of said operation is an unbalanced one.  The British Paras dogged fight for Arhem is covered well, but it is the American forces of the 82nd and 101st Airborne divisions that receive limited coverage: such applies respectively...The 82nd receives a handful of scenes, and the 101st receives a minimal representaion.  It is not that I did not enjoy the many scenes that cover the Paras tremendous fight for Arhem, but I could not not not help to observe the aforementioned imbalance.  One does get a good sense of ethos relative to each nation involved: the British...their undying sense of formality no matter the situation, the Americans...practicality, and aggravation when said is not used, the Germans...a emotional coldness that lends to never underestimating their capabilities.<br />  Nevertheless, one will enjoy this movie.
B005KPL7WK|5.0|I really love this album and listen to it nearly every day, this guy is quite the artist musically.  Best!
B0069JBKHI|5.0|is the best for you to talk and see your child on your mobile phone. Execellent camera and very good sound.
B00AKYRCNY|4.0|My almost-two year old daughter loves this app.  I think it could be enhanced by the addition of more interesting scenery/backgrounds.  Although, it's free so I can't complain.
B005LAIH9A|5.0|Ever since the 1st American Pie,I've been HOOKED. IDK abt the rest of ya'll but I love these \\"crazy kids\\".To say that they remind me of MY own High School/College/Reunion years would say the least. You cannot go wrong with any ONE of the \\"American Pie\\" flix,you REALLY can't. My DVD arrived quikly,was packaged appropriately&arrived in pristine condition. I bought my DVD from the Seller\\"PressPlayConnection\\"(who I've purchased frm b4)&I'm ALWAYS PLEASED with their service,packaging&shipping. I WOULD ABSOLUTELY ADVISE ANYONE TO PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER! Thanx PPC& Thanx Amazon!
1442419814|4.0|I thought Scott Westerfield wrote an amazing story with a very interesting future society. It is a major cliffhanger although it's totally worth it! I cannot wait to read the next books!
B00846F1YW|4.0|I downloaded the game when it was free and did not stop playing until I completed  the storyline. Now I am ready for more. I don't really want to have to buy it though.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My four youngest grandchildren can't.get enough of it! It is a real favorite. They range from eight yrs to three.Great action packed exciting game!
B002TZ3FE2|5.0|This book was an amazing read. We used it at my local college, as one of the elected novels for my Emglish Literature course. At first I was amazed at what I was reading, I felt as if someone had taken a look into my life, and had written a book about it. At 16 years of age I was a very insecure young lady,and I too suffered under the hands of friends. I tried to remove myself from the group which we called, 'The Shades Crew.' Looking back at it, that was such a stupid name...Lol.<br /><br /> Anyhow, everytime I tried to leave the I would do it suddenly, and then would find myself being pulled back into the group again. However, when I read how the protoganist removed herself gradually from them, I tried it and it worked for me.<br /><br />I never looked back, since then I am more assertive, more aggressive, more confident, and filled with tons of self esteem. I now know my worth, and my value as a person. I am now 35 yrs old, and I have never let anyone else treat me badly in the name of friendship.<br /><br />Unfortunatley the cycle continues, and I now see my younger sister struggling with the same issues, and I have now decided to purchase the book for her. Like I said before this book is an amazing read, and maybe life changing for you or someone you know. I give it two thumbs up.[[ASIN:B00513F9Q6 Cat's Eye]]
B00AJER3SE|5.0|These were and still are great action movies. Now they look even better and will last another ten years. I order my blu-ray movie and got them in two days and package in good condition.
B00AAQWMB4|1.0|could not figure out how to play this game,  So hard to understand, Thought it was like Tetris, was not.
1401224792|3.0|Willingham can do better, and the paint style is somewhere else than usual Fables stories, but it is still worth to have it in the Fables collection.<br />Be prepared to see Bigby full naked, so it is definitely not PG below 15 :)
B00005JOFQ|5.0|The film left me Speechless. A profoundly haunting and powerful film. It is worth seeing for the actors alone. Love it or hate it this film will be included in the top 5 gay films of all time for decades to come. Watch it and decide for yourself.
B005HSG3U6|2.0|I thought by the picture that it would be stand so I could watch movies w/out having to hold it...the stand does not work! Struggle to get it to work , but it collapses every time! I could have gotten a nicer case much cheaper, but I liked the idea of the stand. Buy something else!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is great, but come out for it on Windows phones please! This is the best game for free ever
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I think this app is perfect for kids who like to play games with their friends. They have almost everything from on creative mode but it needs more time.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Being a SciFi/Fantasy and action movie fan, I loved the storyline and the characters. I also like that the planet was actually a character too.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|I am not a zombie movie/show fan at all, until I saw this show.  I am hooked!!  The characters are great and the story line keeps you interested.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|I really like how this story played out and fit for the most part in with the other X-men movies, except for X-Men 3 where Xavier is walking as a middle aged man.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|This is all worth the money. I had hours of fun searching for hidden objects. Downloaded it on my Kindle Fire and had no problems.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This is probably Daniel Craig's best Bond. It is also the completion of building his character. Great twists in the storyline.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book was absolutely heartbreaking to read, but I am so glad I did. It is great to hear Jaycee's perspective. Especially in light of the three women kidnapped and help captive for ten years in Ohio.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Every time you click something wrong, it takes you to a page to purchase coins/pearls/etc. for real money, so I have to watch my son CLOSELY to make sure he doesn't purchase any unwanted items...Sort of defeats the purpose in letting him play the game...
B00005S6K8|5.0|This is in my opinion a well-done love story and remember of seeing the original way back when with Bogart.  It''s just as good now.
B000GIXEIG|5.0|I had to have a copy of this after seeing in on Netflix. I'm fascinated with Iceland and also the Beowulf saga
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|If you want to watch this movie, make sure you turn on the captions or you won't understand much of what is being said. Though cinematically excellent, not many will connect to this 3 hour ordeal that makes you beg that something will come finally come together and redeem this confusing waste of time.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|This album takes your imagination on a journey. It is both moving and empowering. I will be purchasing more music from this artist. Enjoy.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|We went and saw this movie in theaters this weekend, and the theater was packed....This is one of the best movies that we have seen this year so far!!! The casting was excellent, writing was great, and the storyline was awesome. Great CGI, we loved everything about this movie, sure it was over 2 hours long, but it did not feel like it at all. This is a must see for any STAR TREK FAN!!! GO SEE IT NOW!!!<br /><br />Christopher Berry
B000EWD1KK|5.0|I was very excited to share this wonderful movie with my 12 year old. She loved it as much as I always have.
B00A8MGLAI|4.0|Alright, in a nutshell this movie is for people with ADD, I kid not.<br />How can a movie pushing three hours in length be ideally suited for people suffering from Attention Deficit Disorder?<br />Well let's see, most scenes are about two to three minutes long and jump back and forth from time lines and characters constantly.<br />As I watched this I realized that I could not get tired of this long movie because there's all these little cliffhangers every couple of minutes leading from one scenario to the next.<br />This movie is long but you might not feel it one bit.<br />As for the story this is all about the metaphysical stuff and as usual when presented this way, the message is somewhat mangled by all the special effects used to pacify those that just don't get it.<br />Like probably everybody whose watched this movie.<br />If anybody knows or thinks they know what the moral of the story is by all means let me know.<br />Now some scenes are just downright breath taking, like the futuristic city and for that I could understand some one buying Cloud Atlas, but another reason is to watch it a few more times to see what may have been missed in the first viewing, as this is a meaty movie to say the least.<br />As for me I'm glad I watched once and will probably need to watch again soon.<br />Oh and the acting as you can probably guess judging by the roster is of course top notch from all involved.<br />Definitely worth checking out.
B00908DDZM|5.0|I am really enjoying this CD by Macklemore & Ryan Lewis.  I would recommend adding it to your music collection.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|If you want a really challenging puzzle app, The Room is for you. It is reminiscent of 100 Floors with the level of difficulty, but The Room provides added elements to the puzzle like the eyepiece that adds another dimension. I cannot wait for an update or a sequel.
B004G7UTXG|3.0|It was a good movie in the end...but was slow getting started.  Good actors, good acting!  Had a good message.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Excellent book I can see how I can see how it became a classic I suggest you read this book.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I loved this - I'm now hooked on the Son's of Anarchy&#34; and will watch the rest of the series!
B000EGF0NW|2.0|Well, we know looney feminist psychiatrists, hippie college professors,sex drugs and rock n roll are not the best therapy,which I'm sure we all knew anyway. There was little if any about what did help. We were left hanging at the end of book when she just decided the druggy life style wasn't the answer, it couldn't have been that easy.I felt robbed and was sorry I spent time and money on the book.<br />She is sarcastic and condescending to friends and family that reached out to help her. I admire the brave souls who tried even if they were clumsy.<br />I'm happy she is now successful and married to someone she loves, but I think the book was unfinished.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|The film created a few diversions from the book's plot early on, but for most part it stayed true to Martel's story line, capturing the voice of Pi with stunning clarity. Ang Lee's artistic liberties, showcasing nature in all of its glory, encapsulated the overall interconnectedness of all life on this planet with broad brush strokes. Overall, LIFE of PI was definitely a great film.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|Wow.  This is a very good release by a talented veteran.  I've been a fan since I was 9 years old (40 years).  So nice to hear someone with a \\"musical\\" voice again.  The arrangements are simply lovely.  Thanks Agnetha!
1426209584|5.0|My daughter is giving this book to me for my birthday (in July).  She's always wondering what to get me and I saw this book.  I glanced at it and saw the paper was nice and sturdy and shiny....It was perfect.  Will let you know after I receive it from her, as to how much I love it.  I love birds, so I'm sure I won't be disappointed.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Lovely book and sad but so fresh and inspiring.  My daughter red it first and invited to read those remarkable piece.
B000PKX2KA|4.0|I am quite impressed with the reception of this fairly inexpensive receiver. I am using it with my notebook and usually am indoors. Even with having several roofs above it I usually can get an accurate location.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I purchased this book after seeing an article about the author in my local paper.  The opening sentence grabbed me and didn't let go until I got to the epilogue at the end.  If you enjoy dystopian future sci-fi then you will probably like this and for the price you can't go wrong.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Lots of details and drama. Dramatically based. Clever events in the arena for the hunger games. I think this is a great book!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|The books are very interesting to read and always keeps you on the edge and one cannot wait to read the next page to see what happens next. I started reading them after I've started watching the TV series I can tell you that it's 10 times better.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Well thought out and perfectly functional! This will definitely help with woodworking needs.  I am so happy to have a tool this useful available!
B009CRJLHU|3.0|Abby and Travis have been the buzz this past year. In the wake of Fifty Shades of Grey, I heard about this title. I was told it was very steamy and a great story. I was not disappointed. Even when I was thoroughly ticked off with the characters, I could not put the book down. There is a lot of angst. Angst can be good. I did worry that Abby and Travis have too much angst. With all the back and forth they had, will they really be able to make it last?<br /><br />\\"I knew the second I met you that there was something about you I needed. Turns out it  wasn't something about you at all. It was just you.\\" ―Travis<br /><br />Read more more reviews at despoinapersephone.blogspot.com
0345535421|4.0|Clash of Kings is much like its predecessor.  It is a raw account of the battles, political intrigues, and personal struggles in a land torn by the claims of five different kings.  The battle scenes unfold in horrifying reality, characters fight to survive amid hostile circumstances, others scheme, betray, and manipulate to serve their own ends.  Who can be trusted, who is what they appear to be?  Martin draws richly complex characters to match his plotlines, which blend layers of intrigue with unexpected developments.  The novel takes on a bit more of the fantasy genre by including sorcery, but still reads primarily like historic fiction.  Knowing that this is just the second part in a seven book series, you wonder what's in store for the different characters on the long road ahead.  The story has already taken a number of unexpected turns.  What more do our favorite characters have yet to endure?  Will they survive or die as surprisingly as Ned?<br /><br />As before, the story is told from the perspective of several characters, each chapter changing to the point of view of a different person.  Early in the book as the plots develop, this can make for tedious reading since we are dealing with nine people.  A compelling story is suddenly interrupted by a switch to something that may be less interesting, bringing the temptation to skip ahead.  In the case of characters with fewer chapters devoted to them, a review of earlier chapters may be necessary to recall their circumstances.  It is possible to read about each character separately, the pace becoming much swifter and the story more easily remembered.  The plot lines concerning Daenerys, Jon Snow, and Arya do not intersect with anyone else's.  Catelyn also stands alone, although she witnesses an important event that others don't know the truth of.  Theon's and Bran's stories merge at pg 663, and Tyrion and Sansa are connected from the beginning by their residence in King's Landing.<br /><br />Coarse language, graphic violence and sex abound.  .  The details Martin chooses to include aren't technically necessary to the story (do we need to know that a man's beard was soaked after he'd pleasured a woman?) and give the novel a grittiness that sets them far apart from fantasies that don't include such details.  Some may say that this makes the story \\"realistic,\\" and they have a point to an extent.  People swear, fight, and have sex, but it is debatable how much detail an author really needs to go into.  Other authors have introduced cruel characters and described torture and sex less graphically while still successfully conveying mood and plot.  Perhaps it is all just a matter of taste.<br /><br />With any promising series, we wonder whether the author can maintain the quality of the opening books over time, or if the growing years bring a decline in writing style and story and character development. Will the author remain true to his original vision or sacrifice it in the name of milking a cash cow or just growing bored with the juggernaut he's created?  We'll see.
B004N6369Y|1.0|Used to love her work; this was repetitive, bland, and didn't even sound like the same author.  I got sick of reading about how much of his life and existance the dad devoted to the hotel; how much the staff loved the daughter; etc.  I don't know exactly what it was that threw me off this one, but I will not be buying her books again, and I will only (perhaps) borrow them from the library for free (digitally).  Very disappointing read.  :(
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|The collection of songs is great and the vocal talent of Blake Shelton is superb.  Great if you like Country Music.

1878424319|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend and since I've read it, I've recommended it to many people who have enjoyed it.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I've tried plenty of calculators but most do regular and even scientific well but fractions are always a pain.  But this one is easy to use and has made fractions easy to deal with.  I bought this for both my daughters to help with school and they are loving how straight forward it is.  It may not be my daily use calculator but when fractions are involved it has become my go to app.  Definitely worth the price.

0385508417|5.0|Most of us can't help avoiding the yearly Christmas frenzy.  Although we dream about coming into the holiday season with calm serenity, invariably we are caught up in the endless sea of parties, Christmas shopping, gift wrapping, and decorating.  What if our dreams for a quiet holiday actually became a reality?<br /><br />That's what happens to Luther and Nora Krank.  After sending their daughter, Blair, off to the Peace Corps, the couple realizes there is no longer the need to put on a big Christmas extravaganza!  They refuse to put up a Christmas tree and theirs is the only house on Hemlock Street without a lighted plastic snowman precariously clinging to the front of their chimney.  This year, there will be no Christmas Eve party at the Krank household, either.  Even buying gifts is put on the back burner.  In place of their typical Christmas traditions, Luther books a Caribbean cruise for his wife and himself.<br />However, the Kranks' plans suddenly go awry when Blair surprises her parents by returning to the states - and with a fianc&eacute; doctor in tow, too!<br /><br />Frantically, Nora Krank attempts to assemble a delicious Christmas dinner out of basically nothing and manages to come up with little better than smoked trout.  Luther pleads with his neighbor to borrow their Christmas tree while they're out of town and nearly slides off the roof attempting to wrestle the plastic Frosty onto his slippery roof.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the true Christmas spirit is revealed when Luther decides to donate the tickets for their Christmas cruise to his neighbor and wife, who is dying of cancer.  Despite their differences, the Kranks' neighbors ban together to help assemble a Christmas Blair will be proud of.<br /><br />We are a part of our traditions and they define us in a thousand tiny ways.  In shedding them, we lose a little of ourselves.  By celebrating and remembering them, however, we achieve everything we ever wanted.
B008F5Y7UQ|1.0|The plot is so contrived and superficial it boggles the mind.  This is one of the worst movies I have seen in years.  Amazon should have paid me $10 to watch it.
B005ZTFPFQ|5.0|Some of the games I played lots of years ago,my husband and grandson now like playing too.I think my fav is still ping pong.
B005WYFLNU|4.0|Got this for my four-year-old fashionista.  She loved it and made great use out of it for several weeks.  Unfortunately, it's hard to keep all the many, many stickers seperated from eachother once they have been used, and it becomes progressively more irritating trying to sort through the jumble of stickers to find little tiny matching shoes and whatnot.  It was a great buy for short-term use, but obviously not the kind of gift thats going to last for generations.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Very intense and complicated at parts. Even thought it is fiction the insight to life in N Korea is incredible.
1402217722|3.0|I love to read romance that is not filled with erotica, and I love historical fiction.  This fit the bill nicely.  While I wouldn't rave about it being one of the best books I ever read, I don't feel like I wasted my time reading it.  It was a pleasant experience.
B00CDCIQX6|5.0|This is one of the most thought provoking movies I have ever seen. After having read the book, I had to have the movie....magnificent! I can understand some people not following the movie because it is difficult if you haven't read the book. I found many differences in the two but as a whole it still got its point across. Any form of entertainment that gets you thinking beyond the norm is a plus in my book. The book and/or movie can be read/watched multiple times and you still will find something new to think about. By all means please see this movie and read the book!
B00BWJARHO|1.0|If you liked the book, don't watch this.<br /><br />Awful, distorted. They went so far as to make up a character whose sole purpose was to make it more violent and play special-effects games. Generally stupid and contrived.<br /><br />I'm saddened that anyone would do this to such a fine book.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Hilarious, romantic, all-out FUN!! Think \\"Wallbanger\\" meets \\"Beautiful Bastard\\". You smiling yet?<br /><br />I was hooked from the first line and smiling wide by the end of the first page. If you are a fan of enemies-to-lovers stories, you will LOVE Tangled! I swear half my book is highlighted. I laughed out loud, grinned till my cheeks ached and just generally loved it<br /><br />The story is about Drew. In real life, Drew is a clean-shaven, well-groomed, expensive suit wearing professional. But, at the start of the story, he's a miserable un-showered, un-shaven heap locked in a messy apartment overflowing with old pizza boxes while claiming to have the flu.<br /><br />Right.<br /><br />What he really has is a bad case of the Break Up. See Real Life Drew was once a player. Why settle for one when there were so many willing ones tripping over themselves to be with him? But he's fallen in love. Finally. Problem is, she's getting married... to someone else. Hence the miserable, moping, un-shaved heap. This is his story.<br /><br />It starts off going back in time to when they first met. Drew meets Kate at a club one night and, despite the flirting, she walks away. When Kate gets hired by his office, it puts him in a frustrating situation because office romances are on his no-no list.<br /><br />We are told the story by Drew. He can be a bit of an jerk but you really just can't help falling for him - he's that lovable. He both narrates the events and breaks the 4th wall by talking directly to us as the reader. It's totally awesome! It's like he's right there telling you the story. There are times when his commentary on what was going on just had me in stitches!<br /><br />And if you like strong heroines, you will LOVE Kate. She is smart, confident, sassy and absolutely determined not to become another notch on Drew's bed post. She has plans, dreams, goals and no time for a playboy.<br /><br />Their banter and `sparring' was just priceless! Tangled was essentially an enemies-to-lovers story about guy falling in love for the first time with a girl who goes toe-to-toe with him on everything. I loved watching them work through their issues. And when Drew finally decides to fight for Kate's heart, the lengths to which he goes are just laugh-out-loud awesome!<br /><br />The book wasn't always funny per say, but the whole mood was light-hearted. The sex was hot, the characters were lovable, the writing was witty and it had a happy ending<br /><br />If you are looking for a FUN read, this is it!!!!emies-to-lovers story about guy falling in love for the first time with a girl who goes toe-to-toe with him on everything.

B00B2PHSIY|4.0|Up top everything looks red if you put the lens on before you start down. I choose to put it on and just hop in so I'm not distracted from my dive safety. After getting in the water I recommend giving your camera a good shake to get the air bubbles out from under the lens. Atom 85' you could see the reds and pinks of the corals where I dove off of the San Diego coast. Hope to try it out off the Channel Islands soon.

A bit of originality, some basic on cognitive sciences et voil&agrave;.<br />Weired that so many people found this a great book uh ?<br />Have a look at Oren Klaff on LinkedIn et  go to the bottom of the page. Look at sup. infos. Is it serious material ?<br />Not yet convinced ? Look for Intersection Capital on the web. Does it sound real ? Very bad material in my opinion.<br />The question is now, can we still trust the customers reviews in Amazon ?

B00068TJM6|5.0|I was surprised this watch got to me very quickly. It was shipped in a very nice box, with a pillow where I can keep my watch at night when I'm not wearing it. There is alot of documentation that came with this, 3 books. 2 of them pretty thick. I work in the desert, and I've had this watch now about 2 months. I love this watch. Very sturdy. It's stood up to a sandstorm, hailstorm, torrential rains, and the heat so far. If I had any complaint at all it would be that the numbers and markings on the dial are very small and hard to read. Even the date is hard to read. It would be nice if the crystal was a bit more convex, to give it a magnifying effect. Perhaps that's just my eyes getting older. The alarm is very quiet, but I don't use that dial for an alarm, I just use it for a second time zone to keep the time at home also. All in all, a very nice watch.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|seen all of the seasons and love it, the actors and actresses are moving and hope that theres more seasons to come.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Best game I have played it a long time !! If you loves puzzle games then thus is the game for you !!!
0316232955|5.0|This was the first time I ordered a book for myself, and I loved it. Its amazing how in just three days I got it, and I was able to enjoy it.
B000FP2OPY|3.0|The first disk (containing the first four episodes) had scratches on it when it arrived. All the other disks are fine, so I'm not sure how that happened, but I am unable to play the first disk at all.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|The offer was great! Bought a few of this. It's worth the efforts :) Do look around for more offers.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|This guy is so incredible. He was beyond his time.  He is in his 60s and his music should be on the radio today.  It is great that Amazon sells his CDs.......
B00CM6ZLG8|4.0|Really really loving this cd. Not even a huge fan of Demi's. This cd is very good from the start to the end. There is only maybe two filler tracks for me other than though they arent bad to listen to either.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Because of the academy award I rented this documentary.  I couldn't believe this guys voice.  I now own both CDs and wish he would be played on the radio.  He must have had the worst promoters in the business.  Besides those that took advantage of him and collected all the money with 0 to Rodriguez.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I really like the way the book is written. Common man verbage, and then his wife chimes in from time to time giving her view point. Good read about a true American hero.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|A really great CD...Sixto Rodriguez should be on the radio now.  He is fantastic.  He needed better representation by when as he should have been as big as Bob Dylan.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|The movie is entertaining from start to finish. Nothing special about the plot, and it's full of stock characters, including mustache twirling villains and damsels in distress. But it is fun to watch. Tom Cruise does a great job as Reacher. He creates a character who is mysterious and open at the same time. I haven't read the books, so I can't compare him to that Reacher. This is a great movie to just kick back and watch. There is a little something for everyone, including lots of action, and Cruise without his shirt. The complaints about Cruise not looking like Reacher in the novels remind me of the complaints made about Sean Connery not looking like Bond in the novels.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|I really enjoyed Cloud Atlas.  some of the negative reviews made me wonder before I watched but I found the whole movie fascinating and I couldn't wait to see what happened in the different story lines.  Highly recommended.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|this game is highly addictive. it has awesome graphics and it fuels yore creativity ... its definitely worth getting and playing if you have free time galore.
B001QC6QRC|5.0|I love being able to watch movies that I watch growing up with my 4 & 5 year old! So much better than the cartoons they have going now!
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I watched this last night and I must say if you like Tom Cruise and you like action this isn't to bad. it was entertaining and it wasn't overkill on shoot them up or blowing up. Overall a thumbs up
B006GWO5NE|1.0|First off, I am not happy that as much money as it costs to buy the Kindle Fire HD, it doesn't come with a charger, which I think is completely ridiculous! And then this cord is sold seperatly from the power port (so in addition to buying the Kindle Fire HD, a holder for the tablet, I then had to purchase a power cord and power outlet--Ouuch!). Amazon really needs to rethink all of this because had I known the power cord wasn't included I might have gone with an Ipad that comes with a lot more..
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I am so addicted to this game .  I can play it for hours. The only downfall is they don't give you enough lives.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Movie was good but very sad. Great acting by both Naomi and McGregor. Would recommend it to all my friends.
B000055ZB8|5.0|Nothing like an old film to really make you appreciate actors and their abilities to actually act unlike many stars today
B00BWJARHO|3.0|I thought this movie was going to be better then it actually was. For me, it moved too slow. I felt the characters were not as convincing as the Lord of The Rings Movies.
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|It was fun to watch again and again. It hasn't gotten old yet and it's a fun twist on old horror movies
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game is really good. The new version was even better with new characters to choose from. I love this game and my kids love it even better.
B0040QYROK|5.0|If you appreciate silent films and have not seen this you are missing out on a truly amazing film.  If you want a film to get you into silent films this is it
B000EHSN9Y|4.0|pro.<br />works good, and is easy to hook up, mac knows whats going on no frustrations with instal<br /><br />con 1.<br />apples kinda dumb not to make the cord longer makes a mess of wires all off to the left, i knew this going into it,<br /><br />OLDER OSX USERS....<br />con 2. only issue i had going into it is if your not fully updated it thinks your monitor is from the same year as your computer, upgrading osx to latest should fix this issue, image for now is similar to the old mac plastic cinema screens, so kind of annoying bc the screen on the lap top is better then the apple cinema display newer and able to support res much higher.
B009EEFTMC|3.0|This is good game for passing time. Good when waiting in Dr office or in line.  The game has nice colors  and designs.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Nice story with likeable characters! It's a nice afternoon at the beach read! I enjoyed it! Give it a try!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game- the only downside is that the gems and extra coins are expensive to buy but you can play the  game for free
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Outstanding calculator with fraction option. This app is worth paying for. Thanks Amazon for the free app.<br />I would recommend it to everyone!
B009NY43NY|4.0|I have enjoyed reading this series & journey but at least I have the next season of True Blood to watch and see where they decide to take her.
B0057RCFQS|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my son who's been a huge Jurassic Park fan from the beginning & he loves it! Lots of great features & behind the scenes clips.
B008220D5K|2.0|This movie had no story line to it. Yes, it had some funny parts but it seemed like the movie would never end. I kept looking at the time to see how much longer it was going to last. There was a lot of use of the \\"F\\" word, references to oral sex, and sexual scenes. Be careful who you watch this movie with because it definitely should NOT be seen by children. This really isn't worth renting even with a free code.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Almost from page 1 I couldn't put this book down. I had to race from page to page to see what happens next. Anyone who loves a good mystery will live this book.
B007TKT2SK|4.0|I like the simple approach to fractions and it seems accurate. I also like the way it shows decimal equivalent. Why does this app have to be 10 meg file size? Complex college calculators are less than a meg in size so something is awry. 1star off for large footprint.
1579129129|5.0|Very interesting photo documentation of the amazing evolution and variety of skulls.<br />Terrific visuals, quality reproductions good reference information. Highly recommended.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It is an awesome. game and realistic graphics. Enjoyed playing it with my dad. Looking forward to more games in the future.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I was undecided which case to order for my new Kindle Fire HD, but since I love red, I decided to get this one. I had in mind a couple things I needed from the case and this had everything I wanted, plus some. It arrived quickly, was packed very well, had simple directions for use. Within a few moments, I had it on the Kindle and was amazed at how simple it opened, stood up and allowed me to read the Kindle in both vertical and horizontal positions. The Kindle doesn't slip when placed at any angle in the case. I highly recommend this sturdy, handsome Marware Vibe case.
B00846REIS|3.0|I agree with another person who reviewed this book when they said it's pretty much 50 Shades of Grey rewritten. It's hard NOT to like this book because I did REALLY love the 50 Shades series...so there's that, but it was so similar it was almost annoying at times. It was a decent read and I will probably read the other books just to see if they all follow the same blue print of the entire 50 Shades series...but I hope to see some originality...we'll see.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I can't believe how much I like this game! It's so simple, but at the same time....it's quite hard. Still,  we love this game, and without a doubt,  give it 5 stars! Definitely try this game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This one is the best of the Hunger Gamess series. I just read it a second time and still think so. On to retreading book 3!
B006M4F67A|5.0|Love this app.  There are so many cool levels that the fun goes on & on! I. have played for days.
B00A8MGIZG|4.0|I did not have the experince of being offended by any of the material. Its not much diffferent than any amount of foul language or violence than any other movie of this rating, quite probably less.  I also did not think it was hard to follow the different flashback and forth's to various lifetimes or storylines.  The BAD? One story line did not fit for me at all, it involved a writer who's brother set him to a nursing home, perhaps it was added for comic relief, however, it seemed like putting an SNL sketch in the middle of the movie.  I never did fully relate to many of the characters. Tom Hanks WAS a character to relate to in the 'most future' world (make sure you enable close captioning to get the most out of these segments as they use a 'future dialect' of English.). It was also quite distracting to use the same Mr. Smith character in the movie that the filmakers used for the Matrix.  He did a good job, but it did seem like a poor choice to use him I guess.  Unfortunately he is a bit cast type as being from the Matrix series.  The 'lifetime' in future Seoul Korea and the other 'future' life are well worth the watch.<br /><br />How would I rate it.  3.5 to 4 stars.  ....It is worth watching and is quite diffferent than most movies that you typically see, I do have to agree with other reviewers in that regard.  I also do like the message of the  I truly think that those who downright hated the movie couldn't follow it cause you DO need the close captions on for so much of this movie, even if you do have good hearing.
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|It was better than I expected considering some of the negative professional reviews.  I look forward to the remaining two films.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I bought this so I could leave a charger plugged in in different rooms. I have a Kindle FireHD, Kindle Touch and a Windows Lumia 900 phone. They all charge with this cord. It was a good buy at $9.99. I bought a different USB charger to plug it into that was cheaper than the Kindle one. It also works fine with this cord and charges everything.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|this is great its just my cousins in the homeless shelter and I gave her a kindle and she wants this app but she doseint have 0.99 and shes really. upset well this is an awesome
B009O2XY12|4.0|I enjoy playing this game a lot.  The only draw back is having to purchase extra bubbles all the time.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|This book has very good story line and a few surprises that I thought would never happen. I am glad the Lannister's get some of that negative occurrences.
1481278738|5.0|I have learned so much from this book that I wouldn't have learned otherwise.  Covers everything in great detail from editing to camera mounting/angles.  It's kind of like a &#34;GoPro for Dummies&#34; book that I always wished would had been published.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|Zen studios continues to provide the most enjoyable digital pinball tables. Star wars is great fun and looks fantastic on my kindle fire HD. I can't figure out how to get it to play with my other Zen tables though,I have to load it separately.great game though,and definitely worth 2 dollars. Thanks Zen studios,can't wait to play more of your tables!
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|Delivery: The DVD case are little damage but DVD are fine. The Movie are best I every saw those movie make me feel reality happen. I believe that movie as real.
0425252868|5.0|This book is nominally about two World War II pilots, one American, the other German.  In reality it is about a German pilot and to a much greater extent the mystique of fighter pilots.  One learns much about these men before, during, and after the war.  This is a most rewarding book.  RWG
B003O86FMW|5.0|Didn't think the first movie was amazing but this book has got me pumped for the second one!! Will read the next . One
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|The Wizard of Oz came on TV once a year when I was a child; it was a very big deal to us. After all these years it was great to finally read the original!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Awesomely interesting good!I was great deal of needle in this book is really be in the app store in this book !I have to yo to delete a game that their is a another part of needle and cous to delete a great deal to delete a great deal of my favorite songs and cous the beetle the bard kindle amazon gift to delete a game in which he lost his job.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|I really hope they continue to bring games of this quality to the kindle.  Its been a lot fun and I would play more.
B003NX75B8|5.0|I love that in every book of John Green, he does this thing where he makes a point and makes you just fall in love with the characters! He's an intellectual and I love him. Definitely worth a read.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|No complaints here! Shipped well & fast from vendor @ a good price. I wanted to add this to my DVD library because I love the Underworld movies and saw them all in the theater. This one in 3D! The movie it's self fills you in on the other movies a bit if you missed them, and shows Selene as a day walking vamp & bad-butt mom. I feel it compliments the series. It came brand new, well shipped and quickly in the mail. I'm pleased with it.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I am sorry to say I did not have a chance to see this movie as yet.  But the movie and case look very nice.  It was sent in a timely manner.
B001HN697M|5.0|No complaints here! I wanted to add this to my DVD library because I love the Underworld movies and saw them all in the theater. The movie it's self fills you in on the background and history or the 'war,' and compliments the series. It came brand new, well shipped and quickly in the mail. I'm pleased.
193700788X|2.0|The only reason I'm glad that I _did_ read the final installment of this series, is because now it's truly over. I can just reread books 1-9 and pretend that's all there is in the Sookie-verse. [It is heartbreaking what is done to Eric and completely contrary to world of the first 9 books!]
B003TTKB5I|5.0|Lets be honest the first few seasons of Grey's Anatomy are the best. When the love affair started and they were struggling interns. Now it is too serious with all those plane crashes. If you want entertainment then watch the first few seasons and stop at that!
B0019N95IK|4.0|I have to admit that when Enterprise first aired in the early 2000s, I didn't watch a single episode. I remember thinking at the time, \\"How awful will this be? Scott Bakula? A prequel? Ugh.\\"<br /><br />My loss. Big time.<br /><br />Because I have Amazon Prime, I'm able to watch all of the Star Trek series free. On a lark, my wife and I started Enterprise.<br /><br />At first, the theme song turned us off. It sounded...well...weird. Out of place. Not in keeping with Star Trek.<br /><br />But it grew on us. We actually like it now.<br /><br />Then there are the characters: Captain Archer, T'Pol, Trip, Malcom, Hoshi, Phlox, and Travis. At first, we thought, what a motley crew. A bunch of odd balls. Just normal people, really. We thought Trip sounded like someone doing a George Bush impression. And we thought T'Pol was hot in her chesty jumpsuits, but hardly a Vulcan as we've come to know them.<br /><br />But they grew on us.<br /><br />Then we started getting into the stories, as clunky and as cheesy as they seemed to be. They grew on us.<br /><br />We watched all four seasons and absolutely fell in love with Star Trek: Enterprise, as it came to be called. We feel closer to these characters than any other Star Trek series. And that's saying a lot. I grew up watching the original series with Kirk, Spock, McCoy, and others. My wife loved Next Gen and thought Picard was a hunk.<br /><br />For whatever reason, we now think Enterprise is our favorite of the Star Treks. I know that sounds nearly blasphemous. But it's true. Enterprise is a truly wonderful series that didn't last long enough. The characters, for all their quirks and human foibles (except for the non-humans, that is) seemed REAL. They seemed to be earnest, and wide-eyed, and sincere. They seemed like nice people. No pretense.<br /><br />Season One gets off to a rocky start. Takes a bit to get into the show. But stick with it.<br /><br />Season Two is our favorite season. That really rocked. Great stories. Nicecharacter development.<br /><br />Season Three is our least favorite season. Way too much about the Xindi. The entire season is one big story arc about something we just couldn't get into. This is why we think the series started to nose dive in the ratings. If you miss an episode or two in Season Three you're lost.<br /><br />Season Four is back to Season Two levels...except for that horrendous last episode. We agree with others: Berman and Braga ought to be flogged for the way they treated Enterprise.<br /><br />The only thing stopped me from buying Enterprise on Blu-ray is the price. This is way overpriced for what it is. If it dips to around $60, we may take the plunge. But we're not paying $75 for six Blu-rays.<br /><br />If you've ever thought of taking a chance on Star Trek: Enterprise, I wholeheartedly recommend you do so. We fell in love with this series. Maybe you will, too.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Well this game is really fun just I keep on losing because of the controls reading my hands incorrectly yay
0140067477|4.0|Fun book and a simple way to explain this highly complex topic. I read this about 10 years ago and liked it a lot. I find world religions interesting and this books puts Taoism into a palatable read.
0156027321|3.0|It's impossible to rate a book you haven't read except to say that I bought it at the recommendation of a friend who said it was an outstanding read.  I'll get around to it in time and I'm sure will enjoy it.
1616551151|5.0|The art is great. The timeline is great. Everything about this book is great. Some people think the timeline is off, but I don't. If you follow the Dragon Age universe, this book is a great side piece to the games and the comics/anime.
B002MZ7VQ2|4.0|Me and dad saw this one at theater. A very good time was had by all. I think that's why I love it. But if u comedy and Rock n' Roll it pretty solid.
0316223239|3.0|Room is the only room Jack knows. He has just turned five and he lives with Ma in Room. Room is an eleven by eleven foot space where Ma has lived for the past seven years since Old Nick kidnapped her. Every night Old Nick comes to Room but Jack is already in Wardrobe being quiet. Old Nick doesn't see Jack and Jack doesn't see Old Nick. Jack does however hear the noises Old Nick makes when he is in the bed with Ma.<br /><br />Jack's whole world is Room and he lives a very structured life there with Ma. He only has Ma, and television, to teach him vocabulary, grammar, everything. He has meal time, study time, exercises, limited television time, art, etc. On Sundays, Old Nick leaves special requests for the week. These special requests consist of food and maybe a small toy or art supply. He has a few books which he likes to read over and over again. The only outside world he knows is Outer Space and what he sees as one dimensional on the television. There are no windows, only the skylight. The door to Room has a keypad for entering and leaving. Jack has no knowledge of what could possibly exist outside of the door. Ma realizes she has to get herself and Jack out of Room and devises a plan.<br /><br />Jack is the narrator of the story and everything is seen through his eyes. The story is based on other news stories of kidnap and recovery. The author addresses the sociological, psychological, and physical issues that captivity play on the victims.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this book !! Everyone should read this ! I love Drew and Katherine ! The story told from the male POV is hilarious! This book sucked me in from the beginning. The chemistry between the two main characters is awesome and their reactions are so funny !! I think I loved this book so much because it was a nice change to have a totally different perspective from a romance novel! I can not wait to see what Emma Chase will bring us in the future !!
1476715904|5.0|I did not expect to like 'Slammed' as much as I did. I definitely did not expect to love it. And there is no way I could have predicted I would love it enough to write my first review of anything on Amazon, ever -- and I've used it religiously for 13 years. I laughed. I cried. And I wish I could read it again for the first time. Forgive me for cutting this short, but I have to go search for Avett Brothers downloads and local poetry slams. Oh, and download the next book while I'm here. One more note, a warning: Do not start this book when you 'only have a few minutes.'
B0014NDXGA|5.0|First off, very easy to use and accurate. If it showed my anything, it was that I was a bad judge of distance, but it has helped my game tremendously and now I am able to select the appropriate club for the shot.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|I love John Grisham. He is a genius writer. I suggest any one who likes mysteries and suspenseful books this is the book for you. I loved it!
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|Bruno Mars does it like it's nothing! His music and lyrics are amazing and I could listen to him all day! It just gets better and better!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Much more convenient than that charging plug that came with it. Stays on my ear well and volume is adequate.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is awesome.<br />Pros: free, easy to learn, variety of vehicles and maps, no need for wifi<br /><br />Cons: none
B008FRFN7A|5.0|This little app was a nice surprise. Downloaded in less than a minute. I was able to choose the settings for the photo I wanted to print from my Samsung Galaxy Skyrocket and send to my HP Photosmart C6180 All-in-One printer. Took just seconds to print a pretty good quality picture. Printer was detected automatically once I switched over from 4G to our network - so from download to print - about two minutes. Great addition to my phone apps and for free this was quite a bargain!
B008JFC6F0|5.0|I am really pleased with the purchase of this album. It's really great especially when i need to drive for long distances. Highly recommended if you like the Beatles (songs like tomorrow never knows...etc) and the Pink Floyd since it's something inbetween but with a modern touch. Worth every penny.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game will surely take up all your time until you have none left. I bought it intending to just see what it was like and play around, and ending up staying on it for three hours straight just building. It challenges the mind and really gives you a way to fill your time. I enjoyed myself immensely while playing this and I highly recommend it for people who like to build and live in a world all your own.
B004LZFWJO|5.0|I love it the CandySwipe.  I do not like that levels are not record and you have start over with you levels each time.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|The only thing is I can't get past level 6, the game won't let me go on. Why is that?
6305511055|5.0|exciting but also had bad volume. redford is always good, i really like faye dunaway thriller with class could i get one with more volume, and less music?
B003VPOXAE|5.0|This is for my daughters school reading. It's a great book, so I'll use this chance to read it again.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|This is a good game. Graphic  r ok n th  game play is good. Th  only thing I dislike is that everything is expensive in game. Whether it's game money or real money it's pricy.
B00AB55BS0|5.0|Having both allows us to watch on various devices around the house. I really like the added features: histories, lands, families, characters, etc.
B005VC4FLW|3.0|Not as funny as I thought it would be, but still a pretty satisfying flick. Carrell and Gosling do well in this!
1401923127|4.0|The `Biology of Belief' written by Bruce H. Lipton, a cell biologist, is a well-researched book. The idea that cells are smarter in performing complex tasks better than we humans consciously do is not a newly acquired fact. When Dr. Lipton got enlightenment, not unlike `Eureka' of Archimedes', when he was working at St. Georges University in Grenada  (where I spent a week few years back), that DNA is a kind of servant of the cells and not the king, the way heart is a servant for all organs but the brain dominates, is dependent on the heart. He puts forth the cell membrane as controlling the activity of the various genes, through formation of second messengers.<br />For non-medical professionals, the first half of the book may sound too scholarly, a little difficult to understand, on the borderline of boredom.<br />Cell membranes react to the environment (`it's environment you stupid'), he stresses, and form, recycle receptors to adapt to the surroundings, sometimes in a harmful way to the whole body, which makes a lot of sense. From there, Dr. Lipton takes us on a journey through evolution, formation of the nervous system and how more than ninety percent of the functions of the body are done through our subconscious.<br />Our beliefs affect our health because our subconscious is where beliefs are rooted and that's where the programming the cellular functions takes place. He has a strong case to improve our health by reaching deep into our subconscious and change our beliefs.<br />He includes a chapter on parenting informing us how early in the life beliefs are formed and what can we do pass on healthy beliefs to our offspring.<br />In the end he gives us a larger picture of the stuff we are made of, touching the subjects of fractal geometry, how we are made in the image of the universe (avoids `image of the God'), the environmental changes and how they affect our behavior and so on.<br />He doesn't elaborate on the practical aspect of how one can reach the subconscious to change one's beliefs. He asks us to attend PSYCH-K workshops, which according to me are expensive.<br />Overall a good book but the chapters feel fragmented lacking in smooth transition from one topic to another.<br />The book opens a new vista, gives us a different perspective from the point of a cell biologist, leads to logical conclusions and above all is entertaining if you are a fan of the body-mind medicine.
B00000G3PA|5.0|A CAPTIVATING PERFORMANCE BY WILLIS AND TYLER AND ALL OF THE &#34;ROUGHNECKS&#34;!!!  MY DISC ARRIVED IN PRISTINE CONDITION AND WILL REMAIN A STAPLE IN MY DVD COLLECTION FOR YEARS TO COME!!!
B007VPLNGW|4.0|Like angry birds but has more obstacles to get through! Pretty easy in the beginning but it get a alot harder as you move forward
6305428042|5.0|FINE FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT!!! MY GODDAUGHTER WOULD WATCH ONLY THIS MOVIE IF I DIDNT INSIST ON A BREAK FROM TIME TO TIME!!!
B007TKT2SK|2.0|I didn't download this app but from the time I saw it I wondered why it even exists. This app encourages serious laziness, what adult can't add fractions? Or do any other operations? They say it saves time. What it's doing is telling people it's ok not to think. How are childrens' brain going to develop if they're letting objects do everything for them? I still gave it two stars cuz in other reviews it seemed like the developer did a good job with the graphics and layout. But still shame!
B004EPYZQC|5.0|THESE MOVIES HAVE BECOME LIKE BRUCE WILLIS MOVIES IN MY WORLD!!!  DOESNT MATTER WHICH STORY LINE THEY COME UP WITH...YOU JUST GOTTA SEE IT!!!!  GOOD TIMES!!!  GREAT CHOICE FOR MOVIE MARATHON NIGHT!!!
B00CDXOXB4|5.0|Great movie that goes right along with the book. It is great and doesn't disappoint. Well worth your viewing time.
0812992784|5.0|The book arrived in very good condition. That aside, I enjoy Rushdie's writing. This is a lengthy book, over 500 pages of non-fiction, yet it makes gripping reading. The fatwa, having to hide under police protection for 10 years, his unconditional love for his children, his very conditional and rocky love for the women in his life - it is all narrated at length with steady courage and wry humor.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|This is a great series on its own but also awesome as the prequel series to the Star Trek universe.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I watched the first two seasons, so needed to purchase to continue the story.  Have very much enjoyed the show definitely recommend.
0385349831|2.0|Each book should stand alone, and I tried to put the life changing experiences in the Alchemist out of my mind while I read Manuscript Found in Accra.<br /><br />The book is mostly comprised of a monologue from one character, preaching to Jerusalem residents just before Crusaders attack the city.  I was unable to shake the mental image of a group of new age seekers gathered around a 'guru' in a Santa Barbara spiritual retreat.  There is wisdom to be gained from such a format, but it's just not for me.<br /><br />There were some apt teachings, such as staying positive and engaged in face of defeat.  Timely because of the recent state of the economy, and applicable to anyone who's is in the process of rebooting their life.  However, the rest simply felt like new age platitudes, and failed to engage me on a deeper level.<br /><br />If you're no longer 'seeking' answers to life's great questions, either because you've found them or you don't care anymore, this is not the book for you.  If you want life changing literature, try Life of Pi or the Alchemist before you consider this book.
0984999302|5.0|My technology company, Lighthouse Technologies, Inc. (http://www.lighthousetechnologies.com) is 13 years old and these ideas are helping us plan new offerings.  I have bought several of these and I highly recommend it to everyone thinking about or already operating a technology-oriented company.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|I enjoyed the British setting and expressions. It took me a while to figure out what was happening which is essential to a good mystery. I would read another novel by Ms. Haynes. I enjoyed her writing style.
0743201140|5.0|This book offers great ideas and great opportunities to learn about ourselves.  I am a firm believer in focusing on our strengths vs. our weaknesses and this book is helping us discover these strengths.
193700788X|2.0|****Spoilers****Spoilers****Spoilers****<br /><br />Looking at the other reviews of this book, I have to agree with a lot of them. I loved Eric & Sookie but understand why they didn't end up together. I think the biggest problem I had was the fact that there was no goodbye between them. That kills me. Their last scene before he leaves for 200 years is him offering Sookie blood when she's in the hospital. That's it!? No goodbye, no \\"I love you, you're an a**hole but I wish you the best\\", no \\"when you come back in 200 years, please don't hit on my future great-great granddaughter (Ha)\\"...nothing. I kept hoping he'd show up before he left so they could say their goodbyes...no such luck. The whole book left me feeling very unsatisfied and...blah. I'm bummed the series, which started out SO good, ended in such a disappointing way.<br />Definately not a book I'll be reading again.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|Lost is awesome another great series done by JJ Abrams he is an amazing writer and I hope that he continues to do more series.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Completely enjoyed these novels. I read at a voracious pace and rarely stop to write a review but this story wouldn't let me zoom by to another book immediately after. This tale requires contemplation... During the read and after. I haven't encounter the like since I discovered the spinward fringe chronicles by Randolph LaLonde.
B009NQXXZ6|5.0|A 1970'S TIME CAPSULE, TO BE SURE, BUT WHEN STREISAND UNCAGES THAT EXTRAORDINARY VOICE AND RIPS INTO SONG, IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THE THRILL YOU GET FROM THE 1ST BIG HILL ON A ROLLERCOASTER. THE FASHION IS FUNNY TO LOOK AT, THE  MUSIC IS THEATER ROCK, BUT STREISAND AND KRISTOFFERSON ARE BOTH VERY SENSUAL AND HAVE THE RIGHT  BALANCE TO GET YOU SUCKED INTO THE LOVE STORY.

B003U51D58|2.0|This season jumped around way too much and was hard to follow.  The ending seemed contrived just to get the series complete.  I kept waiting to get explanations of how and why the island originated, what was the black smoke  and how did it originate or pass on, etc....I was disappointed in the ending, however the series was interesting to watch.  Just wish there was more closure at the end.
0307946711|3.0|Haven't begun yet, thought the book thought might be in much better shape than ordered. Yet still cheap but not in a great shape. There were marks and chocolates marks and spots on the book. And the cover page is half bent (disposed). Its still readable but not very nice touch to the outcome of the glance of it.<br />3/10 for the look of it.<br />More for the contents for the story-line I suppose. (Ps. Seen the movie)
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I picked it up because it was assigned in my son's English class and I found it a page turner.  It is a time travel fantasy built around some authentic vintage photographs set against the backdrop of world war II. A modern teen travels back to the WW II experience of his grandfather.  Well written and great for teens.
B00B78AIV0|4.0|Great read! This novel tells a story about love and survival, through violence, abuse, political unrest, and poverty. This is a tale of the complicated ways we love, and a tale of hope.

B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Why would anyone want to give this film low ratings is beyond me.This was a great film from start to finish.I saw Iron Man 3 and to me it wasn't as good. I would give that movie about 2 1/2 stars but Into Darkness gets 5. Why? It had great action, a good story that flowed, and great dialogue between the Enterprise crew. Not to many movies have a great sequel so I would urge anyone why has not seen it yet to hop on over to theaters and go see it. Cant wait for the Blue Ray.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|Lion king is the best disney movie out. The 3d is amazing.  It was brand new and worked as promised. Very happy with my purchase.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I really enjoyed reading these books early on and the last few books have been lacking quite a bit, but I am absolutely in shock at how this series was ended. This ending was a complete injustice to the world of Sookie Stackhouse and I must have said to my wife 20 times that I cannot believe the series was ended like that. The author should be ashamed of herself for this abysmal piece of work and the lack of closure this book provided. I'm sorry to see these character's world end so poorly. The fans and the characters deserved better than this.<br /><br />Goodbye Sookie, I'll miss reading your crazy adventures!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have always been a Stephen King fan but have not had the chance to do much reading at all for many years.  On a recommendation from my brother, I decided that this was the book I wanted to take on my 5 hour plane ride for vacation.  Although the synopsis is the premise of someone attempting to prevent Oswald from killing Kennedy, there were multiple storylines interwoven throughout.  I was engrossed from the very beginning and would highly recommend this book even if you're not a King fan.  Stephen King knows how to tell a story.
B005VPRET4|5.0|Adds to her lego collections, LOVES Her GIRLIE legos!!!  Now the kids love coming to our house for play dates!.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Wow, this was a really good book.  I liked how honest it felt, a true representation of how it feels to walk in the shoes of someone with mental illness.  The characters are real and imperfect, learning and traveling their own paths. And there was a silver lining, which I appreciate.
B001KVZ6HK|2.0|The problem I have with this movie, is that like all other Marvel movies, it's pure spectacle. It's so in the stratosphere, that it comes off as saying \\"hey look at what we can do\\" as opposed to focusing on Character development and connecting with real life. This is a symptom of the fact that Marvel comics, in my opinion, are vastly inferior to DC  comics. The Dark Knight movies are good, because the source material is realistic and gritty; the movies are actually being true to the source material, which is not lighthearted. Don't get me wrong Avengers is true to the source material; the problem is that the source material itself sucks. Avengers, Iron Man, Thor, Hulk...whatever; I'm sticking with Batman and the new Superman movie looks promising too.<br /><br />PS: if you are a Joss Whedon fan, check out Firefly and Serenity.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Freaking Amazing!!!! This has been the hottest book after reading 50 Shades of Grey. This book has everything your looking for in a hot romance. I absolutely love it, I cannot wait for Entertwined with You!!
B000JIHP88|1.0|Cute and fun design with good options for listening and/or rotating the animals. Unfortunately the mechanical design is awful. Similar to the problem other reviewers have experienced the leafs don't allow for the inner ring to rotate. Now it only plays music and lights up. Poorly made. I don't recommend.
B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely love this game!!!' It is awesome! I also love Temple Run 2....... I highly recommend them both. Have both on my kindle fire and galaxy 3

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Coolest cloud program in the entire collection that I have acquired. It is extremely user friendly, and organizeable.  It is a program that should satisfy \\"everybody\\" and their various needs, whether professional or free,  My extended family uses it appreciatively, all the time.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|I like it but its not worth 4 stars. I had some friends who had this game and they said it was super addictive. its fun but not addictive like p.e. of minecraft. it is very fun though. its also very funny when the car flips over, you can hear the guy's neck cracking/breaking.
B00AB7HESI|2.0|I haven't played it yet but it looks like fun but it won't load so it is making me mad so mad.
B00932A4XE|4.0|For someone who is expecting, I found this movie to be funny, relatable and sincere. I thought the characters were great and pretty likeable.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a great game if you are bored or just want to pass the time! great for long road trips
B0094M2ITG|5.0|I have always loved this movie. Ewan McGregor and Billy Crudup do a fabulous job, and the story is magical.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|As the story continues to unfold through time and travel, the author does not disappoint. There are so many new layers and new story lines the reader just gets carried away, wondering where the next adventure will lead. I highly recommend this series to adventure readers, romance readers and readers looking for a new twist...there is certainly plenty of that! Start at the beginning and read them in order-this is by far the best way to understand all the nuances of the story. Love this series!
B009CF3MEK|3.0|This movie was somewhat melodramatic, but it had its pluses as well. You just can't go wrong with Robert Redford.
B000HZD168|5.0|This is one of my personal favorites of the Star Trek big-screen productions.  It highlighted to a new level the friendship of the main characters and Ricardo Montalban was deliciously evil, reprising his role of &#34;Khan&#34; from the 1960's TV episode, &#34;Space Seed.&#34;
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Interesting game.Anywho, it's a lot of fun. It's great to take your mind off the time when you're in a waiting room.

0895260131|5.0|I have been reading the work of Robert Spencer for last several years and I must say he is one of the fearless scholars who write honestly about Islam and the threat it poses to Western civilization. The population of Islamists is growing in the Western world, and the threat of Islamic terrorism is here and very real.<br /><br />This is very well researched book by a highly respected conservative scholar. Robert Spencer discusses the facts about Islam that most scholars shy away for the fear of being politically incorrect. This book covers plenty of ground with a study of Muhammad, his early life, the making of the Qur'an, the spread of Islam, and Islam's early wars, culminating in the Crusades. Islam has been presented by a few politically correct scholars as \\"a religion of peace\\" mainly to please Islamic population in Western countries. The truth is that it is anything but a peaceful religion. The intolerance to other cultures and other faiths are clearly expressed in Islamic literature, when forgiveness is the principal concept of Christianism<br /><br />The author provides an expos&eacute; of Islam that \\"won't be taught in school\\" or \\"heard on the evening news.\\" He describes the religion vividly and draws our attention to the goal of Islamists; that is to globalize Islam by causing fear and using force. The view that Islam is a religion of peace has been hijacked by a very small minority of liberals and apologists. The author quotes great many number of historical figures critical of Islam, including John Quincy Adams, Winston Churchill and many others. Using facts like the Danish cartoon episode, and the Pope Benedict's speech with quotes calling Muhammad's teachings \\"evil\\" and \\"spread by the sword,\\"  the aftermath of Islamic rampage witnessed across the globe, the author cleverly discusses the facts of Islamic culture in chapters like; \\"Muhammad: Prophet of War\\" and \\"Islam--Spread by the Sword?<br /><br />At the end of the book Robert Spencer warns that if West does not act in a timely manner, it will be too late to win against Islam.  Jihad has already been declared against the Western society. The war on terror can be won if the Western allies in the Muslim world receive support, and these moderates can create an environment in Islamic countries where the ideology of hate is replaced with respect for other faiths and coexistence in peace and harmony.<br /><br />I believe that this book must be made mandatory for all freshman entering the colleges and universities to learn the truth about Islam.<br /><br />1.

B000FA6720|5.0|Words cannot begin to express how beautiful this story is.  After seeing the movie I will never get the image of him standing in the rain out of my head...it's indelible.  How amazing to love that deeply.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I read this book on my Kindle, primarily while nursing my younger daughter, and would often have to put it down because I was laughing so hard I was shaking (including during the section on breastfeeding, which is flipping hilarious). God, I love Tina Fey! I hope she never stops writing.

B007TKT2SK|1.0|I'm sure it is a fine app, but why does it need network socket permission?  Ads? Tracking?<br /><br />Perhaps the author could answer that. thanks.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like look and finds but they get old really quick. this one is set up like an rpg so it keeps your attention longer and its more challenging than I was expecting it to be
B00338QENI|4.0|I was blown away by the science and the ethical lines that are crossed over and over in this story.  This isn’t a light hearted narrative but well worth your time.
0345803485|5.0|absolutely wonderful reading. grabs your attention from the first page then holds it throughout the 3 book series. As people continue to read this series it is not the &#34;nasty&#34; &#34;kinky&#34; book it has been protraied as. It is a very nice love story.
B007TKT2SK|4.0|Does what it says it will, and is simpler to use than most other calculators that handle fractions directly (without having to convert to decimals first).  This app operates beautifully on my 1st gen KFire, smoothly,  and with no glitches or freezes noted.<br /><br />To the one-star reviewer passing commentary on how lazy kids are,  that is not the fault of this app, nor its developers.  Am I capable of performing complex calculations either in my head or on paper?  Sure, most of the time (I wouldn't attempt complex multiple conversions or mean cell resistance times without a good calculator) .  But as an adult,  my time is precious,  and sometimes I just need a quick and accurate answer without running for pen and paper or second-guessing myself because I did it in my head.  School-aged children should not be allowed to use calculators because they are still learning to master arithmetic, but that is surely not the fault of the tool used.  Instead, blame the parents and teachers who are too lazy to insist on any sort of discipline.
B006G4F8OW|5.0|If you are not familiar with Figuart Zero figures then let it be known that the size is not very large, but it still has a great amount of detail and fantastic color. The base is a very cool red color rather than the black ones i am used to. Very Happy with this Film Z version of Luffy.

B009OYTAL8|5.0|Great first series, really hit it's stride about a third of the way into the season with details of the 'Undertaking'. Season finale was quite good.
B005ZCXPP0|3.0|This movie has an 'Indiana Jones' feel to it in a far removed sort of way.  Don't misunderstand, it's no  'Indiana Jones' - not by a long shot, but it does have an interesting take on the back story to Captain America.<br /><br />This movie may be a second-cousin-twice-removed to 'Watchmen'...
030758836X|5.0|After reading the first third of the book, I thought I understood the story.  After reading the second third, I thought I knew the &#34;real&#34; story.  By the end, it was a totally different story.  Interesting if you like mysteries.
B005H9B44A|1.0|Just another attempt to capitalize on a comic book.  No story here.  A bunch of CG and poor acting.<br /><br />I got far enough into the movie to know &#34;It's Hammer Time!&#34;, so I used the special powers of my back button.<br /><br />Amazon needs to take the hammer of Thor and pulverize their digital file of this stinker.

B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Satirical, Emotional and Epic are the only words to describe the new movie Star Trek Into Darkness. I got a chance to visit the Paramount lot for an exclusive screening of this movie, which left me in awe and thrill. Although this movie is a sequel  to the previous Star Trek series, movie goers who are not familiar with the story will understand the plot clearly. The actors portray their characters very well thanks to the director, J.J Abrams. The scenery and set for the futuristic year of 2240 are so vivid and realistic, audience members will forget they are in the year 2013. This movie is also produced for the IMAX 3D, which puts all the explosions and fight scenes in your face.<br /><br />The relationship of all the characters on the iconic Starship Enterprise are deep and meaningful. Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachery Quinto) develop a brotherly love through the struggles they conquer. The Villain, Khan (Benedict Cumberpatch) is a scary two-faced character that will leave the audience guessing his fate until the very end. Not only does the main star achieve his role prefectly, but the co-stars also do an superb job. The writers, Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Damon Lindelof successfully add comedy in the script to bring an emotional roller coaster to the audience.<br /><br />The set ranges from modern skyscrapers to futuristic spaceships. The designers portrayed the theme very well, using many computer generated images to create the year of 2240 in a way that makes it seem so real. The 3D element is an added bonus because it brings the action up close. The beginning scene has lots of running and fighting sequences and yet it is all filmed in such detail that the characters seem like they are going to run off screen.<br /><br />After watching this movie, my passion for Star Trek has been sparked! I rate this movie 5 out of 5 because it balances the comedy and action scenes so well. It has multiple themes taking place but the on-going theme \\"the power of friendship can build you or destroy  you\\" is present throughout. This movie contains a hand-full of violence but is not bloody or graphic. The action sequences, violence and realistic make-up could be scary for younger audience members so, I recommend this for ages 13 to18. This movie has sparked an interest in Star Trek for me and hopefully, it will do the same to you.<br /><br />Reviewed by Patrick N, KIDS FIRST!

B005VMSATA|4.0|This is a &#34;B-movie&#34; for sure and like all such movies they are only enjoyed if you don't take yourself too seriously. Let your hair down and accept this movie for what it is and you will be surprised how much you enjoy it.
B00CVSMLXS|4.0|I have been and remain a fan of the Holmes/Watson sagas for decades now. This entry in the lore is an excellent twist on The Woman and Moriarity being the most important people, other than Watson, in the life of Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />I have watched this entire season with great enjoyment and look forward to more in Season 2. I am really quite intrigued on how we are going to be shown the Reichenbach Falls  in this interpretation of a modern day Holmes.<br /><br />I wasn't quite enamored of Lucy as Dr. Watson until the final 4-5 episodes starting with the one where her friends question her decisions and she commits to the new job/life and ending with her planning and implementing the plan to catch Moriarity.<br /><br />SPOILERS***********<br /><br />Natalie Dormer plays The Woman Irene Adler and the Mastermind to perfection. I hope we see more of her.<br /><br />Watch the show and decide for yourself.

B005H9B44A|4.0|Nice movie, my daughter and I enjoyed it. A little slow in the middle, but well acted and written,  enjoyable as part of the marvel cinematic unverse.
0553386794|5.0|The story was amazingly epic.  It's told in third person narration through several different POVs.  I thought that it was a great way to tell the story because the reader is able to see many different views about each event that takes place.<br /><br />I thought that all the characters were extremely well-developed and very believable.  They were all very entertaining and there weren't any that I disliked.  Every single character had a distinct personality.  There was also a lot of detail put into each family -- the reader really gets a sense of what kind of values each family holds and such things.  The characters were just great.  I was very impressed.<br /><br />The writing was soooo good.  Everything about it was amazing -- the world-building, the character development, every conversation felt natural and fluent, the various different plots were interwoven very well.  Just really, really great writing.  Martin is a fantastic story-teller as well.  Just the scope of the book alone is mind-blowingly epic!<br /><br />I don't think that any other fantasy novels can compare to this one.  It has the perfect blend of reality and fantasy elements.  And I think that anyone would enjoy this book, even if you're not into the fantasy genre.  Highly recommend!!

B000YJ54DU|1.0|If I had Mr. Child's command of the English language I would be able to come up with a better word but the best I can do is 'Ridiculous'. When I was reading this book I kept thinking that there is no way the same author who wrote books 1-11 could write this but I guess he did. The only reason I finished it was because I paid for it. When I did finish it I swore I wouldn't get the next title but eventually I did and was very nappy about it. My advise, skip this one and move on to the next.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I enjoy this game very much ! I love the theme and its great to play when I have down time

B000VT7AUS|4.0|I really enjoy Ms. Krall's music.  this album is very pleasent to listen to.  If you get a chance see her in concert along with buying her albums.
0156027321|5.0|I have already reviewed this item once.hERE are thirteen more words for you to ponder on what you did wrong.
B00CFOGCAG|4.0|Pretty fun to play and addictive :) if you like games where you can make endless chains of combos, this is your game.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|Gave me goosebumps, a minimum requirement for &#34;scary&#34;. The &#34;scary&#34; movies I usually watch don't meet this standard. Watch it and see.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I really enjoy writing that keeps you trying to guess.  I mean, who' ever had writers that come up with the so so secret &#34;the initiative&#34;?  This is a good class &#34;A&#34; entertainment
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|I've never been a country music fan until the TV show Nashville started.  Fell in love with the music and had to get this Volume 1 CD.  \\"Fade Into You\\" is on their second CD.  I will be playing this over and over!
B00CFQMVLS|1.0|I purchased this video and when play back the movie would stop and skip. So deleted and tried to download again, results the same. Amazon need's to check out their servers so as to keep this from happening.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|this is a great game with great controls and GFX. the only thing iI don't like is the cost of health potions.
B008I43DYU|5.0|I was really skeptical at first about buying what appears to be a very basic calculator.  But the more I use it the more I love it.<br /><br />It is a basic calculator if you orient your Kindle vertically.  But if you turn your Kindle horizontally, it becomes a full-featured scientific calculator.  It has all the features you could want.<br /><br />I also like how big the buttons are, making it very easy to use.<br /><br />I highly recommend this program.
B008JIFJ4W|4.0|I purchased the MP3 of this album several months ago, after Passion Pit (via their Facebook page) let their fans know it was available at a very low price for a day...I'm so glad I purchased it! I was immediately struck by the heavy layering of sounds, voices and effects, as well as the plentiful and introspective lyrics. In fact, my first thought was, 'wow, this guy sure does have a lot to say!'. The more I listened, the more this album grew on me, and I think it has enough of a variety to keep all of the songs from sounding too similar. Their sound is very unique and I can pick out a Passion Pit song from anywhere, lol. Great album!!
B008Y73940|3.0|I bought the HD version of this movie.  I had read the book so I was really anxious to see how similar the movie was to the book.  It was a good translation.<br /><br />However there is one big problem.  With the HD version the top part of the movie is always cut off.  So your character looks like a fifth of the actor's head is missing.  This was a big let-down for me.<br /><br />I haven't tried the SD version so I can't say if that would have the same problem.  But all in all I would pick another HD movie instead.
1433502410|5.0|Very nice, came out when I was in seminary. Very helpful for in depth bible study and teaching as well.
6305910189|5.0|I think this is one of the best Star Trek movies ever made in my book of Star Trek Movies. Great story telling and so much more. 5 stars.
B005VPRGB0|5.0|I bought this product for my friend's birthday gift. He likes it. After he finished it, it looks so cool.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I found it interesting and innovative. Nice that they didn't pander to the lowest common denominator. Looking forward to Season 2
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Show is so fun and well done.<br /><br />Great actors, interesting story.<br />Kept watching 1 episode right after another.<br />Definite thumbs up.
B00ATSS73U|5.0|Darlene Zschech is one of my favorite artists anyway because I really enjoy her heart and spirit of worship. This CD was no different. A true blessing!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Would like to see more games  such as ROOM.  Very intriguing & thought-provoking.  If you want a challenge  this should be checked out.  You will not be disappointed.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|This is exactly what I was looking for, plus more.  I needed something to make a quick notations, and this app serves the purpose wonderfully.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|If you've already read  A fall of giants you can't miss this second part. It's a &#34;must&#34;  and a good opportunity to read  and enyoy history in a way only Ken Follet can  do.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|I origionally for my grand children and  found out that I enjoyed it more than they did so instead of giving it as a Christmas gift I kept it at my home as a alternet.
0345525558|1.0|It was depressing. I probably didn't like it because I get so tired of hearing and reading about people that don't help themselves. The flower definitions seemed insignificant. This was the book assigned by my Book Club and we meet tomorrow. I want to read a good mystery or at least something that isn't such a &#34;Downer&#34;. Sorry
B007MDB6L0|4.0|she enjoyed the movie very much only bad thing was that the Disney Chanel had just played it before I gave it to her.  She was kind of nuteral.
193700788X|1.0|This was a major let down after 12 books. The story line and foreshadowing certainly didn't point to this ending. The book was clumsy with the plot dragging  while zigging and zagging to tie up loose ends. In the end, I couldn't identify at all with Sookie. It felt like she settled, which could explain why some readers were ok with it. Too many people settle in. Wish that this heroine hadn't suffered an all-too-common fate.
B009DJB8I2|5.0|I did not buy this for myself but for my thirteen year old son and he said that he just loves it!
B00B9366VO|5.0|Great documentry.Never knew so many rock bands recorded there...I would tell all my friends to see this film and rewatch it over and over.
B003F1WM2K|4.0|Such an inspiring read. I have my own Robert of sorts in my New York life - my gay love of my life whom I spent some time dating and whom I still love deeply. I consider him to be the only one who truly knows me on this earth. Point being -- this book really really spoke to me in a million ways. Thank you Patti Smith.  :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|the book was cool i loved it so many details and lots of action!!!!!! and my favorite<br />book ever ever!!!!
B000BB1MI2|5.0|Excellent video for all ages!  Sure to become a classic with your family. Visual elements are outstanding. Good price, too.
B004WE01YA|5.0|Now I have it in all the different formats. So I can now put it on all my devices. This combo pack is great.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My 3 year old grandchild and I enjoy this game...give it a try!<br /> I think the game is easy but fun. You'll find it is funny too!
B000ETRCMQ|4.0|I had to watch this movie for a class, and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  The performances were believable and stuck with me long after the movie ended.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was great! I loved all three of them and I wish there was a forth. :( I couldn't put the book down!
B008VPC9WS|3.0|PRO'S: This book is good for orientation with the structure of the TOEFL exam.<br /><br />CONS: The downloadable practice test software has major problems. Practice tests are too few as well, so this is not what you need if that's what you're trying look for.
032180354X|1.0|I was new to off camera flash photography and was looking for some good materiel to study. This book, on the surface, seems worthwhile, but with a closer look, I found the book to be a waste of time. All of the photographs seem unplanned, with little consideration or vision. Some of the photographs appear to be amateur shots. As I learned more and more from other sources, I began picking apart the flaws in many of the images.<br />This book only scratched the surface of what modern off camera flashes can do (TTL/E-TTL, and high speed sync for example).<br />Add to that the author seems smug and a little full of himself.<br /><br />It should be mentioned that the author of this book is NOT affiliated with \\"strobist.blogspot.com\\".<br /><br />Not recommended.
B004UID2LC|1.0|DO NOT GET THIS APP!!!!THIS APP HAS A VIRUS OR SOMETHING. AS SOON AS I DOWN LOADED THIS APP IT FROZE MY KINDLE. I HAD TO REPLACE MY KINDLE.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|This is one of the better ones! Scenes aren't too easy and good story line. Played it all the way through and it was plenty long enough for the price. Just wish I didn't have to be forced to purchase the sequel to find the remaining answers to the mystery! Kinda unfair!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Good book. If you haven't read it, your missing out! So far has a great story line. :D :D :D
B0087HT36U|5.0|This game is a blast. I can't count the hours I have spent trying to get all the achievements. So many levels too!!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|cant say anything bad. free is free! moon stage rakes in the points!!  sounds are great. good game.<br />have this app on ipod and now kindle as well.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|This is a laugh outloud movie that anyone in their 40's can relate.  Beware of the language though.  Definetely too much for an older parent or children.
B001NLL93W|5.0|this series is a great read, interesting and draws u into the book,,,enjoyed very much the author is good with backgrounds
1608862801|5.0|I was very impressed with this book. The illustrations are bright and colorful and it was fun to read. I would recommend this to any of my friends.
B0083Z614S|4.0|I purchased this book for my kindle as I has read it in my childhood, and enjoyed it very much, and had either read it to my children or encouraged them to read it.  Now that they were grown and felt they had no use for my hard back copy, I wanted to pass one of my favorite books on to other children. hoping to encourage them to read.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|The app works great on my GS3. Great replacement keyboard. The Flow feature is very simple to use yet powerful.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I like this game It is cool being run man I like to fly the best I get hit by missiles alot
B007URVZJ6|4.0|For a first time Kindle publisher this was very helpful. I am at the point of uploading my first trilogy of short stories and found the guidance extremely user friendly.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|Stiil reading it. Read it now and again....and it's something to concentrate on.  Whew.! thank goodness it's in the English version.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|This is a good app, except it says it's free, and it really isn't. After your 'lives' are up, they want you to buy more. I don't play it, except for when they occasionally give you free lives.
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|I am a fan of the Resident Evil series.  This one, however, was kind of a steamer.  They are all goofy, but &#34;Retribution&#34; is the worst.  The producers of the trailer are to be commended on a masterful job...  They made it seem like this would be a really cool movie with an interesting plot...  Negative!  Let's be honest, folks, it sucks.  If you haven't seen any Resident Evil movies and are thinking about watching this one--don't!  Do yourself a favor and watch the first Resident Evil instead.  Now that's how a good cheesy sci-fi horror flick is done!  (I really dug the sound effects/music by Marilyn Manson.  Not that I give a crap about his music in general, I just thought he enhanced the whole movie by making the atmosphere creepy and really cool). But Retribution?  Naw man, I'd pass.  If you watch every other movie in the series and like them all, THEN watch this one.  Just some friendly advice.  :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is a perfect sci-fi book about the future of America.  It talks about love, action, suspence, drama, and the will to survive.  A will recommend this book to all of my friends
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Star Trek: Into Darkness = Star Trek Into Awsomeness<br /><br />Great story, great Script, great acting, and great suprises!  a must see for anyone who is a fan of startrek or not! Just plain awsome. At a loss for words!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|MODERN COMBAT is an amazing game. For someone who doesn't have a gaming system I really enjoy the experience. It makes me feel like a BAWSS.
B000000H40|5.0|This is a fantastic album from Obituary who gave death metal their own flavour.<br />This album is full of those heavy riffs that dig deeper the more you hear them.<br />Obituary have always had a bit of a doom aspect to their death metal, and this to me makes them unique.<br />A lot of similar bands tryed to out-heavy and out-growl eachother. Obituary just write good songs that happen to<br />be death metal, they don't try to be anyone.<br />Unpretentious, heavy metal.<br />Highlt recommended album.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I would personally recommend this application without hesitation. User friendly and smooth, my worries about all of my pics are over. Killer app.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|Great movie, a little slow in the beginning but once it got going it was amazing.  I was glad I bought it to add to my collection.
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|It's nice to be able to hear that voice and vibe again. This album is classic Boz Scaggs in every sense of the word.Thoughtful, Soulful and Spiritual.Looking forward to the tour stop in Denver.
B003F3NDWG|4.0|I watch this with my sister and we both enjoy it.  I think it's pretty funny, definitely going to keep watching :D
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Magical, mysterious and very romantic.  Hard to categorize and very thought provoking.  Can be read on several levels.  Kudos to Morganstein!
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I really enjoyed the Rosie Project. I loved the fact that Don was constantly revising his list and his life as he got to know Rosie better.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Really fun way to kill some time. I would recommend downloading this one. I will check out some of their other games.
B004LB59VE|1.0|I know this book won prizes, but really ..... the inner workings of a clock? Pointless. I wanted to be entertained, not educated.
0765325950|4.0|After reading FOURTEEN books which were very detail oriented and beautifully descriptive, I found this ending to be lacking.  There were many unanswered questions such as: what strange mark is on one of Elayne's twins?  After such a detail specific story, I don't want to have to guess.
B007QUUJMG|2.0|I don't think the book quite reached the depths it was aiming for. I could sense what Chbosky was trying to say about his characters, but felt he didn't give them that little extra punch to make me really care about their trials and tribulations.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I played Jurassic park operation genesis for the First Gen xbox and i feel like im playing it again :) i would totally love to see more Jurassic park games they are awesome :)
B00AIBZM40|5.0|This movie was on point! Straight-up! This movie was absolutely damn good! Disregard all the negative reviews, trust me. This movie is very entertaining, well written, and will keep you on edge from the word \\"go\\". There are no dry, boring or dull areas in this movie. Hi-def sound,  and Hi-def picture, with stunning top quality CGI effects. A-list acting, great wardrobes,  sets and props. Beautiful Cinematography all throughout this movie. This is a great semi-paranormal-horror movie, and is the perfect Friday night scary movie. I'm  very impressed with this movie. Buy it on Blu-ray.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|it was hard too download .took a long time  but when it came up my 11 yr old liked playing the game
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|you have to get this app its the best app ever its perfect no glitches never gets boring and best of all its free something as awesome as this app should cost 99 cents but the people who made are so FREAKING AWESOME THAT THEY MADE IT FREE GET IT RIGHT NOW YOU NINCOMPOOP YOU SHOULD HAVE STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS REVIEW JUST TO FREAKING DOWNLOAD IT WHAT ARE YOU STILL DOING HERE?!?GOOO!!!!!!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love this game can.t stop play and collecting all of those coins and apples .i am up to 6,000,000 + coins must get more animals
B00B1OWEVC|5.0|There's nothing much to say. Listen to this album on a good equipment and be blasted by all the nice sounds HTDA has to offer.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|fun game my husband and son love this game they compete with each other to see who can get the most points
B003N7GATM|4.0|I'm a huge NiN and HTDA is somewhat different not only because of Mariqueen vocals. I think the structure is different and in a good way. HTDA is not a total departure from NiN but a addition to a body of work in electronic music.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This game/puzzle, whatever it is, is the most addictive headache I've ever enjoyed.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because it's too short. I couldn't stop until I completed the whole puzzle. I'm ready for more.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Absolutely my favorite TV series of all time. Watched it with my kids, 12 and 16, and they loved it as well.  Just met Colin Ferguson in person at the Dallas ComicCon and he is just as his character is in the series . . . genuine, caring, funny, personable.  Just a great guy . . . so wonderful to truly enjoy the actor as much as the character. The series was just as wonderful and great family fun.
145210655X|3.0|At first, I thought this book would be longer and be more like a story. It's actually just a mash-up of things parents have to go through with their children at that age, but with a Star Wars skin and some other nice touches. The drawings look really nice, but it disappointed me a bit. I expected it to follow a story line and see little Luke grow up. However, the sequel, Vader's Little Princess, is more like I wished this book was.
B001DE29SS|4.0|We didn't know much about Charlie Chaplin before seeing this film, but this is a GREAT way to get to know him!  Downey hits every note:  vulnerable, funny, tender, angry, etc.  The cast is full of wonderful actors, but one absolute stand-out is Kevin Kline as Douglas Fairbanks!  Back to Chaplin...we saw how devastating his mother's mental illness was to him and his brother at a young age as well as how terrible it was to have to put her in a home.  It never got any easier for Chaplin to deal with her throughout his life.  He seemed to know early on that he wanted to be nothing but a comedian and was successful, but not well paid, until he came to the USA.  After arriving here, he discovered silent movies being made, and he could be successful in a profession that he loved.  However, his love life was another story until late in life for Chaplin.<br />I don't do this movie justice with my review.  My son and I were both moved by this film.  He said it was absolutely one of the best movies he had ever seen.  I highly suggest you see this movie.
B008FRFN7A|1.0|It won't detect a printer. Every other wireless device I have in my home will but not this one with my Kindle.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My 7 year old daughter is the one who talked me into buying this app. I had all the Angry Birds so I thought &#34;why not?&#34;. After she brought it to me a couple times wanting help, I decided to sit and play a while...VERY COOL!!! It is not like the normal Angry Birds, this game makes the child be creative. They need to build little ships to accomplish the objectives. Very fun.
B006FK7SZ4|1.0|The people on this are mostly people from another country trying to scam you. Maybe 1 in 50 real people.
030758836X|2.0|I don't understand why this is still a best seller.  It was an okay book but not great.  None of the characters are likeable.  The story doesn't make sense in some places and the ending is not satisfying my any means.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I truly loved all 3 books. The first one ended in a way that made me so angry, I just had to read the second. Then of course it got so good, to not read the third was not even for consideration. I would definitley recommend the trilogy.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|After using the free version for a couple of weeks and noticing my frequency of usage I decided this is an app worth owning. ONE of the apps I run daily ONE of my best decisions.
B008ROGQAE|5.0|i first saw the movie when it firts released.  When I saw it available for review on Amazon, I jumped at the chance again.  Yul Brynner was terrific as the robot cowboy. the movie itself was fun to watch again
B00BC24NT4|5.0|When George Smiley retired he was concerned about the loss of freedoms and accountability. LeCarre has recaptured those concerns in an up-to-date setting and again addresses them as they have developed in our current world. Aside from the fact that it is a story well-told, it is a cautionary tale of government and how easily it slips from protecting people to protecting itself from the people.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Easy to score coins. But gets more expensive as you level up. Either way great time killer. Can't wait to unlock other levels.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|QT at his best. Great acting. Fun to watch. Not for kids due to a lot of yhe use for the N word.
0307887898|5.0|I am an agile, scrum, lean developer and I want to be an agile, scrum, lean entrepreneur.  This book brings in all together in a delightfully clear, concise and entertaining read.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I love little games like this that challenge me to think laterally.  Makes an excellent<br />break from work. Would love more.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|If you have themind to figure out mysteries, then this is the game for you! I'm still stuck, but I will get it.
B002UNMWAG|5.0|Who wouldnt love this? even if u are a die hard fan of the first and think the second will be crumbing you are pleasently surprised.
B003KGBIRK|5.0|First of all, I've seen Videodrome on just about every format, from many publishers.<br />Nothing beats this Criterion release. It's simply fantastic.<br />The picture is crisp and the best it's ever looked, the special features are interesting and probably the best the fans have gotten or will ever get. I'm very picky about my Blu Ray collection. However this is easily one of the ones I'll be eager to show off and it's one I'm proud to have in my collection.<br />An amazing disc for an amazing movie. Nothing to complain about here.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|This was great. the head is pretty grusome. the series of course is amazing. we plan to get all the special edditions of this going forward.
