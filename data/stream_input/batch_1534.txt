030758836X|2.0|Ugh- just stayed up fairly late to finish this 'hot' read of the summer- not one really for mysteries, avoid all CSI shows at all costs, but EW raved about this book so I felt, sure, why not? Well... I really didn't feel compassion/likeability to either of the main characters and how the book ended I was like- really? Really!?? If you hated how the Vow ended (did I really just admit I saw that one??) than you will HATE the wrap up of this book- 2 stars for interesting writing style (from both characters perspective) but for the ending- UGG!!
B00280LYIC|5.0|My name is Wendy Siefken, co author of [[ASIN:B0067RJZS8 Kai's Journey (The New World Chronicles)]](I purchased the book) Rick Riordan has found a way to weave history with today and give a kid who is like most other troubled kids a way to put all his pent up energy to use! He is a master story teller who is able to tell a story from more then one point of view and you don't get lost! Rick is amazing in how he introduces us to Percy and his friend Grover in school and how they seem to be just one of the mass of kids in school. Percy Jackson is a must read for anyone from the age of 9 to 109! Anyone who loves a good YA book that has adventure along with a hero anyone can relate to. Awesome book Mr. Riordan!

0812993292|4.0|At first, I labored through this book.  Harold is such an ordinary hero.  It was hard for me to find the spark to find him interesting.  He was so orderly, so appropriate and so unassuming.  But as the book got going after the first third, it was the perfect setup to what Rachel Joyce tried to accomplish.  The characters that she brought into the mix stood out.  I think I liked Dog the most, a simple but joyful pup that loved to fetch stones.  The Eastern European doctor Martina was joyfully direct.  Kate was an interesting character who walks with Harold along the way.  After all the secret revelations are made, what I most liked that I came away with is the sense that every person, whether they are famous or ordinary, wealthy or poor, joyful or skeptical, trustworthy or a thief, have inside them complex lives, filled with joys, dreams and ambitions as wells as sorrows, disappointments and regret.  Harold and his wife Maureen find the courage to communicate.  Harold's pilgrimage leaves you with a smile on your face and a bit of hope that each person can find the best that lies within themselves.  Enjoy!

1935670913|5.0|John Locke has been a top salesman since he was a teenager. When he became a writer, he used his knowledge of sales to develop a system of selling his books with startling success. Rather than hide his secrets, he wrote \\"How I Sold 1 Million eBooks in 5 Months. In it, he tells how he did it in great detail so others can be successful, too.<br /><br />His book has given me perspective that it would have taken me a long time to achieve as a newly published writer. He has given me tools that I can use to sell my book.<br /><br />The normal curve applies to almost everything. Half of anything is below average, and half is above average. Then there are Mensans who are in the 98th percentile in intelligence. When it comes to selling books, I am way down in the bottom half. John Locke is clearly in the 99th percentile. Thanks to him sharing his knowledge with me, I have hopes of climbing above the 50th percentile.
B007P6VM4A|4.0|The Hives made a long shot album when they issued \\"The Black and White Album,\\" expanding their sonic palette and forcing some funk, all while still sounding like no-one else but The Hives. Well, forget all that. \\"Lex Hives\\" ditches the experimentation and cranks the amps on 30 minutes of basic garage/punk crunch. Howlin' Pete and the boys deliver their fifth full length like they didn't miss a day from \\"Veni Vidi Vicious.\\" If you were suspect in any way, the sonic dirtbomb of \\"Come On,\\" which is basically a Ramones-slinging \\"Come on everybody, come on\\" repeated for about 90 seconds, drives that message home.<br /><br />\\"Lex Hives\\" brings back the noise. The lessons of TB&WA that remain are the fact that polish wasn't completely lost on the band; this may be the cleanest loud album you've heard sine \\"Rocket to Russia\\" and the best swipe on the Electric Light Orchestra (when \\"Go Right Ahead\\" takes its hook from \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\") since Randy Newman's \\"Story of a Rock and Roll Band.\\" Also, like so many garage pros, The Hives are modern blues at supersonic speeds. \\"Without The Money\\" drops the speed (but not the volume) for some hardcore wailing. Is your life missing some big dance racket? \\"Lex Hives\\" is the law, the cure and the disco all rolled up in one shiny CD.

B007Y5IAV0|4.0|Harakiri is the third canonical full-length studio album by System Of A Down front-man Serj Tankian as a solo artist (he has released EPs, live output and a collaborative album with Arto Tunçboyac'yan as well however).<br /><br />It was released in the summer of 2012, lasts around 45 minutes and was self-produced by Tankian. The album was written, in an almost Trent Rezonor-like move, by painstakingly assembling new songs out of thousands of samples from his previous albums on an iPad.<br /><br />Some people will hate this album. If you've always disliked Serj's personal politics (or agreed with them but wished he'd keep them out of the music) then lyrics about Occupy Wall Street and corporate corruption are going to be a sore spot. If you seriously disliked some of the musical moves Serj made with his previous album there are parts of that sound still on here, and if you come from a more metal background there is relatively little metal on this album at all. Furthermore, If you've ever said that some artist or other has disappeared up their own backside or became too pretentious, then this is an album that you may want to approach with caution so as to avoid disappointment.<br /><br />If you have heard the album's first single 'Figure It Out' and were very excited by its musical direction, with the chugging and double-kicks, then you may be disappointed to know that it is actually a little out of place on the album, and that there are really only two more tracks that are in any way similar, those being the album's final two tracks. You get some punky, almost Crossover Thrash sections scattered throughout those three tracks, although obviously through the filter of Serj's solo career style.<br /><br />Elsewhere, stylistically, the album as a whole is a bit of a mixed bag. There are throwbacks to his debut album, such as `Butterfly' which is a very melodic rock/metal track, there are songs closer to the style of his more electronic second album Imperfect Harmonies such as `Reality TV' and `Ching Chime' (the latter of which also fills the album's token wacky/silly moments quota) and also the aforementioned small minority of faster heavier tracks. Then there's the track `Occupied Tears' which sort of bridges the gap between all those styles and which is an album highlight.<br /><br />There are touches of eastern sounding music, a lot electronics (particularly percussion) and relatively little straight up piano or guitar sections like there were on his debut. The album has a sort of arty and experimental feel in a way that could be as equally described as impressive or pretentious depending on your point of view on Serj himself or indeed any other slightly progressive artist that doesn't fully jump into the Prog market.<br /><br />If I was being critical of the record I would say that it left a bad first impression and that it felt a little too disjointed and felt more like a compilation or soundtrack album than a proper studio album, although repeat listens<br />do dull this niggling feeling.<br /><br />With all that being said, I just like Serj. I really enjoy his voice, his phrasing, the feel of his finger style on keys/piano. I could live without the wacky part of his repertoire (although there is less of that here than on any other album so far) but it isn't ever enough to put me off him altogether. This album provides a mixture of the disparate styles from his previous work and gives the listener another set of songs with his voice. That is enough for me, but if it doesn't sound like it would be enough for you then I would recommend that you maybe give this one a miss.<br /><br />Overall, long after Serj is dead I can't imagine that this is the album people will hold up on a pedestal and remember him by, it doesn't feel like a classic album and there are quiet a few nit-picky problems with it, but if you are OK with that and aren't demanding a flawless masterpiece then it is still worth a place in your collection or at thevery least, a curiosity listen.very least, a curiosity listen.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Great backpack,love that it's black for wildlife photography and the padded back and shoulder straps make it comfortable to wear.  Enough room for all my gear especially my 120-400mm lens mounted on my camera.Great pack for a great price I would recommend to anyone!

B007V2UGPE|1.0|This was a good game until the shitty update erased my game progress. Now I'm back at the beginning and I certainly am not going to waste my time getting back to where I was in the game just so they can update and lose my progress again. Good job, Glu.  You lost another user.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|Wow... this is a raw and intense novel of love that runs so deep it's almost toxic. Abby and Trav can't not love each other even when it doesn't seem to be right. At times it was too much for them to love each other yet they find their way. I love how McGuire's righting style is so raw and open that you really feel the emotions and the heart in Abby and Trav's dependent relationship. I couldn't put it down. it was such an intense ride. this is one author who is going to blow us away with her future projects.
B00785P2QC|4.0|its a great time waster and. i would recommend it to anybody with some minutes to fill. you can do a lot without spends any real money
B002FGU45I|5.0|This my third pair of Terra Fi's (over the last 10 years). This is an excellent pair of Sandals, they hold up well to various conditions. Local merchants in my area do not carry this style of Teva in their stores for some reason, maybe price point- who knows. In any case these sandals can go from the sand to the street without issue, no need to adjust or change sandals. They are a comfortable pair, that I don't mind wearing all day when I am out running errands or on a road trip, they are simply an excellent alternative to a pair of sneakers.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|When I finished book 1, I started book 2 the next day.  Although I read it through to the end, I hated it.  Ana is an idiot and Christian is just an odd sort to be avoided.  The repetition of smirks, and mouths in hard lines, and Christian's overwhelming gourgeousness is more than one can stand.  I'm not hurrying to get book 3.
B001AR0D4A|5.0|This is one of the most suspenseful, gripping movies I have seen in awhile.  I am a Stephen King fan, but this exceeds expectations. Edge-of-your seat, tense, emotional and wonderful movie!  I highly recommend.

B0050DIWFC|4.0|I have to admit, I wanted more from the ending, but the book was overall a very good read. Even though there are numerous flashbacks, I had no trouble following it and wondering what would happen next.

If you just want more education and how your body works, what to do to change it, and how to feel your best....this is it.<br />I've read other Paleo books (that were a little over my head) and this one was easy to understand, written well, and really gave me excitement to try a Whole30 again (I've only made it to 14 days trying before).<br />Get it and read it....that's that....you won't regret it....
B000U0F7RG|3.0|I absolutely loved this show, and was really excited to be able to watch it anytime I wanted. When I got it, I was living in a city where I barely knew any one, so it was something I was looking forward to doing when I got bored. But I ended up being really disappointed by the quality of the set. It was shipped slightly damaged. It was obvious it was a wholesale deal because someone made too many. The packaging wasn't nearly as nice as other box sets. And about one disk from each season wouldn't work on any DVD player I could find. I would have been better off following the review I'd seen here and buying the set season by season. It was really upsetting when I knew the next episode was one I hadn't seen on tv and when I put the disk in, it wouldn't play. This is probably a repeat of other reviews here, but be warned. Many of these sets are flawed.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Not as in depth as Sim City but fun anyway.  I like that you keep making money even when your game is turned off.  I dont like that the trucks break down and then dont keep making money.
B0060NNYFY|5.0|I will spend little time here extolling the virtues of M. Farmer as a singer/lyricist/producer etc. Those who are familiar with her and her work know them already. Those who are not aware will just have to sample some of her songs (easy enough to do on, for instance, YouTube) and decide for themselves. Suffices to say that Mylene Farmers' style is less in the way of the French traditional (made famous by Edith Piaf or recently, Patricia Kaas) and more of a mixture of euro-disco-techno-pop, but made very much her own by the unique inflections of her voice, her knack for poetry and satire (backed by a remarkable depth of culture), her stunning good looks (and an apparent total lack of inhibition) and, of course, her remarkably resilient collaboration with Laurent Boutonnat (a songwriter), a collaboration that has spanned the better part of the last three decades.<br /><br />Regarding the choice of songs included on this CD, I would only argue against the inclusion of track #3 (F***k Them All) and track #5 (Peut-Etre Toi) which include explicit lyrics. The album could have done just as well without them. Nevertheless, most of the tracks included have topped one chart or another at some point in time, so there are no fillers. My personal favorites are: Du Temps, Avant Que L'Ombre, L'Amor N'Est Rien, Q.I, Crier La Vie, Degeneration, Appelle Mon Numero, C'Est Dans L'Air, Oui Mais... Non, Bleu Noir, and Lonely Lisa. So, there can be no doubt - five stars here.<br /><br />On the technical side, however, I would give the CD a four-star rating. This CD was issued by Polydor/Universal just like some of her older studio albums (e.g. Ainsi Soit Je..., L'Autre) but unlike those (of which I happen to have copies of the original French editions) the remastering job on this CD is not quite as good. Specifically, the tracks do suffer from some light clipping (due to a bit excessive dynamic range compression) and they seem a little top heavy (i.e. the high frequency range near the cut-off feels a little overloaded). My guess would be that they were sourced from DSD (DSD to PCM down-conversion) with anti-aliasing performed by some near brick-wall digital filter. Some of these issues do come out when listening in headphones (CD-player: Onkyo C-7030/Headphone Amp: Matrix M-Stage/Headphones: Audio-Technica ATH-A900) but otherwise the album sounds good when played-back through speakers. In any case, the CD is still light-years ahead (quality-wise) from the mp3 version of the album (available on Amazon and elsewhere). In fact the mp3 tracks have more than likely been derived from the CD, so whatever problems the CD tracks have, the mp3s have... and then some. All-in-all, I would certainly recommend this CD - especially considering that for this material the CD is the only game in town (in terms of recording quality) to which I might add that the CD (shipped) is just a few dollars more than the cost of the album in mp3 format.
030758836X|3.0|I looked for my type of review before reading this book to make sure that I wouldn't run into anything too distasteful. However, I couldn't find one and had heard good things on NPR, so I decided to try it out.<br /><br />The mystery/crime thriller story is very good and the twists and turns as well as attention to detail kept me reading. I finished it in a day and was mostly happy with how I spent my time. The story, in my opinion, deserves 5 stars.<br /><br />However, I gave it 3 stars because I didn't appreciate the large amount of profanity and graphic sexual descriptions that I felt were 85% of the time completely unnecessary to the story. I am an intelligent woman who enjoys a good story, which this was, and am a Christian who doesn't enjoy reading offensive things that were written without purpose and that don't improve or increase comprehension of the story. I'm not saying that characters need to always be great people and say great things. I just don't see the point in further polluting readers' minds for no reason. It's completely possible to detail themes such as infidelity, rape, etc., without graphically describing every step of it (see Alfred Hitchcock). In fact, it takes a lot more effort and skill to do it this way.<br /><br />In summary, this book, to me, was like an exceedingly beautiful person who got dressed up in trashy clothes to go to a job interview. He/she would have been perfect as they were, without the trashy clothes.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I found Downton Abbey on Amazon and one day decided to give it a look. Wow! I was hooked about 10 minutes in to the first episode. Everything about Downton Abbey is superior television - from the great music (you can buy on Amazon), set designs, clothing, filming, and superb acting. Some have compared it to \\"Upstairs Downstairs\\" but the comparison is weak as this is truly a masterpiece. I quickly watched the entire first snd then bought the second season which is capped by \\"Christmas at Downton Abbey\\" which may be the best television show I have ever seen. LOVE IT! Can't wait for season 3 - superb acting and a thrill to watch!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|A lot of my friends have read this book and swears that its the best they have every read. Although my friends will not tell in detail or talk about, what this  book is about (unless you've read it already)they do say that its a must read. Out of curiosity I bought this book and OMG!!! it took me all of 2 days to read the first book, I was so caught up in this book that once I finished book one I quickly purchased book number two and of course book three, I loved it. I have read a lot of books but nothing as mind capturing, suspenseful, intriguing, heart touching or witty as these three books. Bravo!!! to the author of Fifty Shades of Grey and may I say that after reading the first book I didn't think that the next two books would be as good, but to my astonishment, I was wrong. I enjoyed the last book just as much as the first one.<br /><br />  MONEY WELL SPENT!!!!!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Became a fan as a kid over 25 years ago, and this is honestly the first time I felt a new Rush album matched their previous best (Moving Pictures and Power Windows).<br /><br />Hold Your Fire had some great moments, but overall it was sterile and didn't have enough jamming.<br /><br />Presto continued the more mellow trend, which worked better with its more acoustic feel.  Unfortunately, the cheesy vocal arrangements ruined some otherwise fun music.<br /><br />About half of Roll the Bones was excellent... the songs had a certain catchiness that really clicked.<br /><br />Counterparts saw them finally return to their edgier sound with a mostly strong album.  But once again bad lyrics and vocal arrangements dragged down a couple songs.<br /><br />That problem was magnified on Test for Echo, which was a let down (though it had a few noteworthy tracks).  It's a shame because there's some wonderful guitars on this record.<br /><br />Vapor Trails stepped up the song writing again, but the lack of spontaneity and solos from Lifeson, the dreary overall feel, and the horrible production kept it from standing up to their classics.<br /><br />Then we got Snakes and Arrows, and you could tell there was a spark.  Though a few songs were weaker, it was Rush's first album without an outright bad track in over 20 years.  Still, I felt it was a shame that more songs didn't have the energy of Malignant Narcissism and Far Cry.<br /><br />With Clockwork Angels, I got my wish.  It has everything I look for in a Rush album: amazing and energetic drum fills and patterns; soaring, technical, and catchy guitar solos and riffs; intricate and aggressive bass lines; melodic (but not awkward) sing-along vocals; and in-depth writing and lead-rhythm interplay, all tied together with a thematic story (that's Peart's lyrical masterpiece).<br /><br />It combines the best of Rush's new sound (streamlined groove) and old sound (edgy mathrock jamming).<br /><br />The title track and Headlong Flight areas good as it gets while BU2B and The Anarchist go toe to toe with Rush's classics.  Carnies and Caravan are also fantastic.  Just those six songs together are already longer than all of Permanent Waves.<br /><br />The Wreckers is incredibly catchy, and BU2B2 is a nifty little orchestra piece.  Counting those two songs brings it up to over 43 minutes.<br /><br />Rush's \\"pretty\\" songs don't often come off, but The Garden does; it's one of Rush's best ballads.  Counting it brings it up to over 50 minutes.<br /><br />Seven Cities of Gold is next, with a very cool bass intro and odd overall feel.  It doesn't quite click, but it's an interesting tune.  Counting it brings it up to over 57 minutes.<br /><br />The bottom two songs, Wish them Well and Halo Effect, are still worthwhile, though they're nothing special.  Still, even without them we have an album that's over 20 minutes longer than all of Permanent Waves!<br /><br />Clockwork Angles is enjoyable start-finish, but more to the point is that it has over 37 minutes of exceptional songs and over 43 minutes of very strong songs.  I never thought Rush would put out another masterpiece, but they have.  Buy this album.

1609611543|5.0|Heard about this book, read the back cover & it made sense, so I read the book, and started the attempt to go wheat-free for as long as I can beginning July 1st.  Need to lose 50 lbs & have tried weightwatchers online and it works for awhile but I always plateau out after losing 15-20 lbs, and get frustrated and stop keeping track.<br />Anyway, this is my 10th day of being wheat-free and I've lost 4 lbs so far.....goal is 6 lbs in July, another 6 in August, 5-6 in Sept & 5-6 in Oct.  Started at 225 lbs and I'm 5'9\\" male.  Love shredded wheat cereal w/blueberries & almond milk in the morning, wheat toast......subway grinder on wheat bread for lunch, and a burger on a wheat bun with cut potatoes in olive oil (as home-made fries) or brown rice in colder weather.  Also love pizza once or twice a week......these are all my biggest challenges.  Problem was I was always thinking about food, tracking it for weightwatchers, and thought I was eating healthy because of wheat whole grain products, never white bread or rice.  The book makes sense though, and made me mad how I was duped for 30 years into thinking whole grains are healthy, when they've been genetically altered to feed the world cheaply, but instead made a country of obsese people who are always hungry even though they exercise and eat right according to the USDA recommended pyramid.<br />If I can get down to 200 by Thanksgiving, I'll slowly add a couple wheat products over the holidays, see how I feel, and resume this January 1st to hopefully make it to 175-180 lbs by Memorial Day weekend next year.  That would be 50 lbs lost in 10 months, and the lightest I've been in 35 years.  Can I do this?  I'm not hungry anymore, don't feel the urge to snack on popcorn or Cheeze-its at night, and am learning to eat burgers & hot dogs with cheese, onions, tomatoes & no-sugar ketchup and mustard.....but no bun.  My ravenous appetite has mostly disappeared, and I'm not even craving pizza or bread yet.  Hope I make it.  I'll keep you updated.

B005IGVYUG|4.0|I own every album Tom Waits has ever released. In my teen years I listened to Blood Money and immediately become obsessed with all things Tom Waits. My Tom Waits enthusiasm was (and still is) boarder-line idolatry, and considering how unique, gritty, and heart-wrenching Tom's past work is, Bad As Me stands out on its own.<br /><br />A typical Tom Waits album is girdled by a single consistent theme, but Bad As Me is is practically a Tom Waits art show. If you expect this album to have the same feel as his past work, you will be disappointed. Bad As Me is vintage Tom Waits, but this is not necessarily a vintage Tom Waits album; Bad As Me feels like a mixtape.<br /><br />When exploring this album, you will find showcased a spectrum of styles, moods, and sounds that Tom loves to play with ranging from the exhilarating opening Chicago to the melancholy of the ballad Last Leaf.<br /><br />Lyrically, Bad As Me is hit or miss, but mostly hit. The majority of these songs have at least one memorable line, but most of the ballads lack the same poignancy as songs like Coney Island Baby, Green Grass, and Fish and Bird.<br /><br />My favorite track on this album is Hell Broke Luce. This is without a doubt the grittiest, most irreverent, and politically relevant song Tom Waits has ever written and his voice is as brilliant as it's ever been.<br /><br />When I listened to my first Tom Waits album, I considered him to be one of modern music's most gifted songwriters. Nothing has changed. From his 1973 debut album Closing Time to 2011's Bad As Me, Tom Waits has yet to release a single dissatisfying album.

B00005QIPH|5.0|\\"Is This It\\" is one of my favorite CDs of all time. Every song is performed so well; each is absolutely delightful to listen to. Julian Casablancas has a wonderfully unique voice; in male singers, I want the voice to have character, and Julian's definitely does. The Strokes maintain the illusion of carelessness and effortlessness while executing the tracks beautifully. I love their style, and only wish that they had kept it throughout the third and fourth albums, which increasingly tended toward the electronic side of indie rock.

0312360258|1.0|To begin, I must admit that I'm not generally a fan of YA books. Marked reminds me why that is. The main character, Zoey Redbird, is one of the worst characters ever created in recent years. I can imagine how the authors believe they are portraying her: powerful, confident, independent, moral. The stereotypical strong female character. In reality, however, Zoey comes off as irritatingly righteous, whiny, desperate, and melodramatic - with an enormously inflated ego.<br /><br />The plot is cliched in the extreme as well, from Zoey being \\"chosen\\" to her relationship with the HAWTEST most popular boy at school. This relationship causes tension between Zoey and the popular girl, because, of course, the popular girl has the same love interest. And because, of course, the popular girl is a cold-hearted bitch who will stop at nothing to get what she wants. That's not an overdone character at all, is it? The ensuing love triangle is tedious and predictable.<br /><br />Another thing that really bothered me about Zoey: she doesn't shut up about boobs, whether they're her own or other girls'. But she calls them \\"boobies,\\" which makes me question her sanity as well as her maturity, since she's supposedly a 16-year-old. She also uses the word \\"poopy\\" quite frequently, which is cringe-worthy and frankly pitiful. Her vocabulary induces shudders.<br /><br />I was somewhat horrified to discover that Marked was written by a mother who was an English teacher and a daughter who (I think) won poetry contests. That seems to indicate that the standard for writing has taken a steep and rapid downturn. The book's content is incredibly weak, from one-dimensional characters to overdone plot lines. The authors seemed to throw in a gay guy just for diversity's sake, and so that Zoey can continue her pretense of being accepting and benevolent to all. The writing in Marked isn't much better; if this book has any redeeming qualities, I can't think of one. I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone, especially to any teenagers who might falsely believe that this book is well-written or admirable in any way. Marked is a solidly one star YA novel.
B000001EUP|1.0|I gave the Scorps one more chance after the major disappointment of Animal Magnetism, & I'll tell ya, disappointment went to utter disgust, with the music & lyrics going backwards & gettin' more immature than ever, but good for the intended 12-14 yr-old market. I said 'goodbye' to the Scorps then and only listened to Lovedrive & all the ones before....-then awhile later, I heard \\"Rock you like a herd-of-cans\\" on the radio & it only cemented my belief that they sold out to commercialism & the big bucks, with any serious hard-rock songwriting tossed aside--oh, well, at least they got the big bucks! (but not anymore of mine)
0848833031|4.0|As much as Dexter Morgan wields his knife like a paintbrush, Jeff Lindsay (the author) uses sarcasm expertly and beautifully. The tone of this book, the perspective it's written from, is what caused me to enjoy this book so much. I'm not a fan of murder mysteries, but this one drew me in because of the premise, which defies all Hollywood inclinations or desires. Hollywood likes to sugarcoat things, follow a predictable pattern, give the public what it wants. Lindsay refuses to do this, earning vast amounts of respect from me. Although most people would probably want Dexter to fall in love and realize he's capable of having deep emotions, Lindsay doesn't waver in his portrayal of Dexter as passionless and calculating. Despite glimpses into Dexter's psychopathic psyche, he is immensely likable. His sarcasm, his wit, his befuddlement with humans is all very endearing.<br /><br />Dexter's character is a risk, since he doesn't match the Hollywood mold for male protagonists, yet the storyline is not nearly so groundbreaking. I let that slide because of the quality of the characters and the tone, and also because murder mysteries are very \\"multiple choice,\\" as I like to say. Pretty much, the murderer is either going to be A) a main character, B) a minor character, C) a character not yet introduced, or D) none of the above. Knowing that the murderer will be revealed in the end, and that I have another 200 pages of teases and gradually building tension, can get tedious. That would be my main problem with the book, though that is not entirely the fault of the author - more the fault of the genre.<br /><br />Overall, the book was enjoyable as a light read. I don't think I'll be able to read the entire series without getting bored, but I greatly appreciated the freshness and originality of Dexter's character. Who knows, I might have to watch the show sometime.
B00002DE4E|5.0|What can you say about this work of art except take all the 5-star reviews, put 'em all together, & spit it out as a stream of consciousness...definitely one of the very few milestones in the history of recorded music, it stands ALONE and nothing even comes close.....

B000001EUN|2.0|With this one, and especially the next one, Blackout, the music & lyrics surely took a turn for the worst, definitely taking aim at the 12-14 yr old market, with any seriousness tossed aside--any album they did after Lovedrive, in fact, just doesn't hold a candle to their earlier stuff, especially when they went for the big bucks & the commercialism of \\"Rock you like a herd-of-cans\\" (more like a herd of sheep)--sorry, they lost me starting with this one going forward. (forward?)
B007K3JCAE|1.0|This movie has nothing in common with the original Sherlock Holmes except the 1890s London setting and the names of three characters, who are completely mischaracterized.  The competing brilliances of Holmes and his brother Mycroft are completely missing.  Turning Holmes into an accomplished, brawling martial artist is so misplaced that they may as well have cast Dwayne Johnson in the title role.  Idiotic in the extreme.<br /><br />Arthur Conan Doyle would be mortified.

0307742997|4.0|Harry Hole takes his place among the most intriguing detectives on the scene. Unlike the typical serial killer thriller, \\"The Snowman\\" keeps the reader guessing and tosses in a few puzzling turns that kept my interest from start to end. Nesbo writes with clarity and power.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|I really love this trilogy...the first one took a little bit to get into but once you got past all the details in the beginnging it was such a quick entertaining read and the second was just as good if not better than the first! I can't wait for the 3rd book to come out in 2013!
B002ZG997M|4.0|The Book of Eli was not as bad as I expected going in. The movie has a religious message that will turn alot of nonbelievers off, if they cannot get past it. Being somewhat of a neutral person when it comes to religion, I enjoyed the movie as just what it was, a movie. And if it makes you feel any better, one of the Hughes Brothers is an atheist. So if an atheist can direct a film about the power of the Bible, everyone should be able to watch it. Sorry if anyone considers that a spoiler, but yeah. The Book of Eli is a Holy Bible. I was quite impressed to see old Denzel swinging his machete, dagger or whatever the blade was, like a trained assassin. No matter how good I expect him to perform, he always does better. It was also nice to see Gary Oldman return to his roots as the villain after nearly a decade of playing Sirius Black in Harry Potter and Gordan in Batman. Mila Kunis is okay, but I'm not sure if she was exactly right for her role. She looked and sounded so clean and neat, while everyone else around her looked like they were actually in a post-apocalytic world. She wasn't bad though. Overall, The Book of Eli is pretty good. It's definitely worth the price of admission.
B005LAII1C|5.0|\\"Sometimes I think back to that Christmas morning when I was eight years old...I just wish I'd gotten a Teddy Ruxpin!\\" John Bennett (Wahlberg) is a lonely eight year old kid without many friends. For Christmas he gets a teddy bear and wishes he was real. When he wakes up the bear is talking and he finally has a best friend. 20 years later John has been dating Lori (Kunis) for almost four years and things are starting to get serious. The only thing keeping John from taking the next step is his friend Ted. I am a huge \\"Family Guy\\" fan and next to \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" this is the summer movie I was looking forward to the most. I had very high expectations going in and was not disappointed in the least. I think it was actually funnier then I expected. Like most of MacFarlane's humor this movie is so over the top with off the wall references (a whole plot point is devoted to the Flash Gordon TV show from the 70's) and extremely un-pc jokes that you can't help but laugh at. I could go on and on about how funny this movie is but this is something you just have to see for yourself. I highly recommend this and this is the funniest comedy I have seen since \\"Anchorman\\" one that I will buy and watch over and over and over. Overall, an absolute must see movie (unless you offend easy...then avoid this at all costs). I give it an A.
B007ATNHLI|4.0|There is so much positive to say about Men In Black. First of all, I haven't read much of the comic, but I'm inclined to believe that it's perfectly transferred from the pages of the 1990-97 series, to the big screen. This is what comic book movies are supposed to be. They are supposed to have great scripts, with a nice balance of tongue in cheek humor and riveting drama. I mean, they are based on publications of literature. And they wouldn't become movies, unless they were well written. How can screen writers mess up something that was already written out for them? I don't know, but they do it. Another thing that comic book movies should always have is top notch acting. I understand that all movies should have this, but comic book movies need it even more, because they are not taken seriously to start with. Obviously comic book adaptations should have well done action set pieces. Most comics are full of action, so that's a no-brainer. And finally, I think they should have great music. That's just me being me. I love film scores, so that's something I pay attention to. Too much pop music, and not enough orchestra can really turn the audience off. It can be very distracting. Men In Black has all of the above. It's very stylish, and cool.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are a match made in heaven. They are both hilarious when they want to be, but also have the range to be excellent dramatic actors. Also, they both know their way around an action set. An experienced cast makes for a great start. Plus it's a lot of fun. What good is a film of this nature if the fun is sucked out of it? The humor is very good, in my opinion. One scene in particular was so racist and stereotypical, that I couldn't stop laughing. The scene I'm referring to involves a cab driver's religious practices. I'll let those of you who haven't seen this in a while reflect on that. Anyway, MIB is actually hilarious at times. I don't think they ever missed the mark with a joke. Some weren't as laugh-out-loud hysterical as others, but they all worked nonetheless. As for performances, I mentioned Smith and Jones, but the stand out was Vincent D'Onofrio as Edgar/The Bug, or roach, or whatever he was. He was great. It takes a lot of skill to walk and talk like he did, for god knows how many hours. His hard work paid off, and he delivered to us a perfect villain. I cannot say that Director Barry Sonnenfeld has done a lot of work that I really enjoyed. This would have to be his crowning achievement, if you asked me.<br /><br />I sort of enjoyed Wild Wild West, was bitterly disappointed in Men In Black II, haven't seen Get Shorty, don't remember The Adams Family, and don't care to check out any of the television work he's done. So, I cannot give much credit to a less than credible Director. I give all of the credit to the writers, and the cast. Also, the music by Composer Danny Elfman (just about every Tim Burton and Sam Raimi film, The Simpsons, and many more brilliant scores) really accentuates the creepiness of the film, and the fun simultaneously. I loved his score. It was everything I said comic book movie scores should be, and more. In fact, that sums up how I felt about the entire project. Men In Black is everything a comic book movie should be, and more. Save for your extremely required suspension of disbelief, and the occasional cheese, this is an amazing way to spend an hour and a half.as laugh-out-loud hysterical as others, but they all worked nonetheless.

B007RV6X2Y|3.0|\\"Nothing changes unless you make it change.\\" After 20 years in prison for killing his friend Foley (Jackson) is out and is determined to go straight. Less then a day after being released he runs into some old friends and discovers the old life isn't easy to escape from and the only way out is to go back in. I have to start by saying that I have never been a Samual L. Jackson fan. I liked him in \\"Pulp Fiction\\" but he plays that character in every movie that he has done (except \\"Resurrecting The Champ\\"). This movie is no different, although for some of it he is toned down and isn't screaming every line. The movie itself is really not original. Guy gets out of jail and wants to go legit...meets people he used to know...has to pull off one last job...yada yada yada. While the ending of the movie is really good and helps the movie getting to the end is a struggle. Some parts are good while others are pretty boring and tends to drag on. There are really interesting plot points that are brought up and forgot about which makes no sense. The movie isn't all bad though and if you are a Sam Jackson fan you will really enjoy this one. For me the last movie he did \\"Meeting Evil\\" was much better. Overall, not a bad movie but nothing to rush and see. I give it a C+.
B00111L0MY|4.0|Ben Affleck's directoral debut was a magnificently powerful one. This being the beginning of his directoral career is what the title of my short review is referring to. Child abduction and abuse is such a dark and depressing subject, and that is captured very well in this film. Casey Affleck was also great. I'm glad his big brother gave him a shot, instead of starring in it himself. Michelle Monaghan, Ed Harris and none other than Morgan Freeman top off a superb cast that is more than sufficient to make any film fanatic blush. What drives this film just as much as, if not more than, its gritty dark Boston slum setting is the power of choice that is displayed throughout. We watch Casey's charatcer, Patrick make so many tough decisions that shape who he is, and it's really a great journey. This one is not to be missed. Highly recommended.
0385341008|5.0|As a culinary writer who loves to READ about food, I had hoped that this would be a gastronomic romp. It's not-- but that does not diminish the delicious pleasure of a novel-in-letters that evokes an age of civil repartee.<br /><br />The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society IS an utterly disarming story that begins in quaint innocence-- in post-war England when the nation's stiff upper lip was turning back into a shy smile.<br /><br />Despite the idyllic setting on the isle of Guernsey, the book presents vignettes of serious, though largely unknown, history-- tribulations and indignities related by vivid characters as they recall the years of Nazi occupation.<br /><br />Like A Guide to the Birds of East Africa and 84, Charing Cross Road, this is a novel for those who cherish colloquialisms, finely turned phrases, and above all, the cultivation of affection and tolerance through letter-writing.<br /><br />It's chamber music, not a brass band, but it shines no less brightly for its subtleties.

B000NQRE0K|5.0|Say what you want about Mel, but we all say dumb offensive things from time to time. He just happens to do it more oftne than others. Okay, maybe I'm making excuses for him, but that doesn't change the most important fact that Braveheart is everything its title promises. It's brave, and it has heart. I bought this movie as a blind buy, hoping it would fill the void that Ridley Scott's Robin Hood left in my soul, or heart, or wherever people say that void is. Anyway, I also went in expecting Mel Gibson to completely butcher his accent. I'm happy to say that I was surprised on both front. Mel Gibson was amazing as William Wallace, the famous Scotsman who lead his people to fight in a bloody revolution against the King of England who unfairly took over his land around the early 13th Century. I won't pretend to know a thing about history, beyond the propaganda I was taught in school growing up. So, I went into this with a blank slate.<br /><br />I have to say, I'm quite interested in learning a bit more about Wallace and the events that the film are based on. Mel Gibson also directed Braveheart, for which I believe he won the Oscar for Best Director, along with the film winning Best Picture, Best Cinematography (and rightfully so, because it was gorgeous, especially in high def), Best Sound Editing and Best Makeup. That epic blue battle makeup will forever be burned into my memory whenever I hear Mel's name. I really enjoyed the epicness of the film. Large scale, gruesome battles always help me sleep soundly. The love story that motivated Wallace to go on his freedom \\"rampage\\", I'll call it because he basically slaughters hundreds of men for a woman. Reminds me of Wolverine, but that's beside the point.<br /><br />As far as the Blu-ray transfer goes, it's certainly a gorgeous one. The picture quality is amazingly clear, and accurate to its source. Paramount's Sapphire Series rarely delivers anything less, and when it does, they tend to respond to fan outcry (see the Gladiator reissue). Colors and textures are perfectly presented. The audio is top noth as well, very atmospheric. When I say it's atmospheric I mean that the sharp contrasts between epic battles on the hilsides and in villages, and the quiet subtle moments of dialogue is ever apparent when listening to the lostless soundtrack on this disc. Both the picture and audio quality do their parts in adding to the immersive effect this film has. Beneath its rugged masculine hetero manliness, there's a beautiful delicate tale to be heard. I highly recommend it.diator reissue). Colors and textures are perfectly presented. The audio is top noth as well, very atmospheric.

B004L3AQFG|4.0|My god, I will never go hiking for as long as I live, I swear. Danny Boyle is a master at his craft, creating an unimaginely scary situation for our main character Aron Ralston. I cannot believe this was based on a true story. It's amazing what people are capable of in dire times. I never quite felt clausterphobic, but this movie put me on edge quite a few times. I have to admit, I was kind of scared to see it after reading about that person that vomitted and fainted at the premiere. But I knew I would see it anyway. James Franco is a great actor. I really see a long future ahead of him. Why he took time to do daytime tv is beyond me. I respect him going back to school, as long as he continues to put out this kind of work. Great performance in 127 Hours. There is one of the most disturbing scenes I have ever seen in film, so be warned. And its only so disturbing because we grow to love the character. Definitely see it.

B0054PSY2W|4.0|The Coen Brothers have to be in my top five, as far as favorite filmmakers go. They're incredibly creative, witty, and abstract. While \\"O Brother Where Art Thou?\\" may not be Joel and Ethan's best, the film certainly has more than enough redeeming qualities to be a pretty enjoyable one. Humor was a constant all the way through, although it was often more subtle than I expected it to be. It took me no time at all to pick up on the parallels between 'O Brother' and Homer's \\"The Odyssey\\", and going into my second viewing knowing this film was based on that made it even more aparent. The story follows three guys through 1930's Mississippi on a mission to find a burried treasure, that turns out to be more than they expected.<br /><br />George Clooney, John Tuturro and Tim Nelson play Everett, Pete and Delmar. This goes without saying, but George Clooney was fantastic. I've been hearing people say he's overrated a bit too often lately. I call bullshit. He's one of the wittiest, and gives some of the greatest soft-spoken perfoamces that I've seen. Maybe watching this film right after The Descendants allowed me to appreciate his abilities even more. Tim Blake was pretty good as dimwitted Delmar, and I often felt bad for Tuturro's Pete. I especially liked John Goodman's appearance, despite how short it was. There are always memorable moments in the Coen Brothers' films, and O Brother Where Art Thou does not disappoint. It has quite a few memorable moments, and this is the only film I can think of that'll make you both laugh and feel bad for cows at the same time. I recomment it.
B003Y5H5HO|4.0|I never imagined that the tough badass character of  Lisbeth Salander from TGWTDT  in the American version of the film was played by none other than the angelic looking  face Rooney Mara.  Her transformation is astounding and she made that role her own.  I haven't read the books and I am still debating if I will or not, but  I did enjoy the film a lot, especially Rooney Mara's acting. I haven't seen the Swedish version yet but  judging from the  online comments I've read the film ( American version) was not so well received in Europe. It seems a lot of Europeans are angered by the emotional attachment portrayed in the film between Lisbeth and Daniel Craig's character.  This is one of the aspects that I liked about the film, the attachment she develops for Daniel Craig's character shows that underneath that harsh exterior and despite the very hard life this girl has had to endure she is not as mentally \\"impaired\\"  as they claim  her to be and it's beyond me how some people say Mara's character was \\"fluffed\\" up  in the  American version.  It shows that she is vulnerable and most of all it shows that she is human and is still able to care for people despite all the odds and tribulations life has given her.  Rachel McAdams, Jennifer Aniston, Amanda Seyfried and the likes of them are truly bad actresses IMO that never reach beyond the silly melodrama that are Hollywood \\"romantic\\" comedies.  Mara proved in this film that she has range and  is able to transform herself for  any role. I can only hope she doesn't get type cast or worst begins to work in stupid mindless Hollywood movies. Only two scenes keep me from loving this film, the scene in the office with her disgusting pig of a  \\"guardian\\" and the very disturbing rape scene. Aside from those scenes I enjoyed the movie.
B004IFYMYI|5.0|The first time I watched and reviewed Taxi Driver, I didn't like it so much. I think I may have given it a 4/10, or something. Fastforward to today, the release day of the 35th Anniversary Blu-ray, and viola. I bought it, knowing how much I didn't like it before. I was willing to pay money for something I knew I didn't like, just to give it a second shot. So anyway, I rewatched it, and I actually got much more out of it the second time. Admittedly, I'll need to watch it again a third time (with Director Marty Scorsese and Writer Paul Schrader's 1986 Criterion Commentary) to fully understand what happened in Travis Bickle's (played to perfection by one of film history's greatest assets, Robert De Niro) mind. I mean, we all have our good times, and bad. Everybody has issues, and many people hate the scum that can be found on inner city streets late at night. Not many let it bother them so much that they go damn near insane and kill people. I know I'll catch a little flack for this statement because these films are held in such contrasting regards, but this story reminded me of Kick-Ass (or vice versa). A guy gets fed up, and fights crime, etc. So I will need to watch it a third time to fully grasp it, but even so, I recognize quality when I see it. This film deserves to be considered one of the greatest American works of art. Hats off to Scorsese, De Niro, Bernard Herrmann for the magnificent score, and most of all the scribe who penned the screenplay, Paul Schrader. My score may seem a bit low for all the praise I'm giving this film, but keep in mind that I didn't like it when I first saw it, so that score is quite a leap. Highly Recommended!

B004HO6I4W|3.0|Rio has some great music, superb animation by Blue Sky, a fantastically talented cast turning in some excellent voiceover work, and even an intriguing story. It's guranteed to entertain the hell out of little kids, and definitely some adults. But, like most Blue Sky animated films, it just doesn't hold a candle to the likes of Pixar, or even DreamWorks (although it certainly tops their weaker films). I thought animation studios were done with the immature humor after seeing Up, Wall-E, and How To Train Your Dragon garner both critical acclaim, as well as Box Office success. Unfortunately, we still have to put up with characters like Will.i.am and Jamie Foxx's. Don't get me wrong. Those guys did a great job at delivering their lines. It's the lines themselves that I have a problem with.<br /><br />You can see in one of the trailers when Will.i.am's character (a red and black bird) does a little rap, and....I don't quite know why, but it sort of rubbed me the wrong way. I just thought to myself, \\"You guys actually wrote that thinking it was good? And you got paid to?\\" Maybe we just need better writers for kids' movies. Maybe producers need to take notes from Pixar, and stop approving them. Besides my gripes, this is still a decent movie. I was never bored while watching it, but I cannot ignore the cringe-worthy moments. If you can, more power to you. I recommend it for the sheer pageantry of it all, but with caution that it's more on the level of Ice Age (another Blue Sky film, that despite its praise, I did not like), and nowhere near Toy Story 3, How To Train Your Dragon, or even the moderately great, but most often just \\"good\\" Tangled and Despicable Me.

B005LAIH3G|4.0|It's a shame the fate this film suffered at the hands of the terrible marketing team Disney hired for this mo allowed to cut the trailers together, and the incredibly bland, generically boring title they decided to go with. Why they chose \\"John Carter\\" over the original novel's title \\"A Princess of Mars\\", or even the original film title they were planning to go with, \\"John Carter of Mars\\" is beyond me. This is the definition of one you have to see it for yourself, because audience interest never piqued for it, and critical reception was fairly split. It truly is a great movie, in my opinion. The pros far outweigh the cons. Biggest flaws were that some stuff, primarily dialogue, was a bit cliche and corny. The story itself has been done and done again. A soldier travels to a distant land, joins the natives, and helps them defeat an overwhelming enemy. That plot should not, and honestly cannot, be held against this film due to the simple fact that the novel is a hundred years old, and was probably one of the pioneers of that story template. Simplified is a perfect way to describe the script, but not too simple. It's depth is more than sufficient. The characters are unique and delightful. Woola is adorable, despite his ugly appearance.<br /><br />I have to say I was quite surprised and happy to see Bryan Cranston in his brief part. Some of the lead performances may be a little stiff, per se, mainly Taylor Kitsch and Lynn Collins. They have their high points, but overall, I felt they were a tad stiff. Taylor Kitsch, although I don't feel sorry for him if studios invested too much in him as a leading man, I have to say I am a little sorry that he had two major studio blockbuster flops within a span of three months. Lynn Collins is a beauty though, so in a way I can forgive her hiccups. Willem Dafoe and Thomas Hayden Church were great in their voiceover roles. Mark Strong played Mark Strong, or in other words, another intimidatingly intellectual villain. The Blu-ray is a nice, if slightly lacking, package. The extras are scarce, but the transfer is top notch. There is a director's commentary, which tends to be my favorite feature, and a short historical doc, on top of a few other minor things. Overall, it was satisfyingly action packed (in a story-driven way), funny at times, and it should make for one hell of a blockbuster if the marketing doesn't damn it. I recommend it.<br /><br />Note: I cannot currently watch the 3D disc, but I reviewed the 3D combo pack because that's the edition that I bought (for the digital copy).nice, if slightly lacking, package.

1439192812|5.0|Dawkins does an amazing job of showing how reality is MUCH more magical and amazing than fiction.  I learned a lot from this book and lost a lot of sleep.  It's a shame that so many angry Christians have to spam all his wonderful books with fallacious 1-star reviews...
0345803485|1.0|This has got to be one of the most poorly written books I have ever read.  After only about twenty pages, my eyes started to glaze over and I started to yawn.  I am sorry to say that there is nothing I find the least bit erotic or compelling or intriguing about this story or these two characters.  For me they have no depth, little humanity and seem more like cardboard cutouts than real people.  I simply could not relate to them or to their relationship.  I did not feel any intensity of emotion from either of them nor did I have any idea what attracted them to each other, and, worse, I found the sex scenes to be almost comic.  The dialogue seemed more suited to adolescents (especially Anastasia's) than to adults involved in what is supposed to be a profoundly erotic liaison.  I have read both The Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn, The Story of O and 9-1/2 Weeks, all decidedly erotic, but with interesting plots and fascinating characters, and in no way does this book compare. I managed to finish this book, but I will not be reading the remaining two.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|a must have app for Christians with mobile devices. keeps getting better.  works very well on kindle fire. one thing is that offline versions of Bible does. not carry over device resets.  I used to have nlt and niv but lost them when I had to reset my kindle..
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Love this for my Kindle Fire. Feels great in the hands, covers the screen well. Easy to use as a stand also. My only concern is the elastic strap, and it's ability to withstand the test of time. The strap makes a great handle for the Kindle... all in all, well worth the money for this product
B004LROUNG|3.0|The characters in the book keep the action going, but the plot is thin and I didn't feel that there was much research or new in the way of location, situation, or background.  While the story was unique, this general story must happen often (with more lawyers around than white mice, it is easy to see a lot of attorneys following this path)and the outcome similar.  I was expecting more in the way of intrigue.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Received the cd FAST and packaged well. I am very happy! I love this sound track. I love Irish sounding Rock and this is one of my favorite albums so far!
B005723JSQ|5.0|This is the very first book I have read by Sophie Kinsella and I absolutely loved it! I was expecting a light, easy read, but I throughly enjoyed every page of this book & I could not put it down. I am one of those people who skim over some of the writing, so that I can get to my favorite parts (generally the romantic parts!), but with this book, I wanted to read every single word/line/paragragh! I connected to the main character, Poppy, and I felt like her connection with Sam was so real and genuine that I was disappointed when the book ended; I wanted it to continue and possibly never stop!! I laughed out loud at a lot of parts and was very satisfied with the way it ended! I wouldn't oppose a movie or television version! So, bloody fantastic!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love this app. thanks so much for making it available for free! it's awesome that you can download offline versions and listen to audio versions.
B005J9ZFQG|5.0|The Best if you LOVE this stuff! More cool and better refined than Evil Dead I. Lots of GORE and scarry stuff! Wonderful Movie! Can't wait to get the Third One!
B0085776BG|5.0|I bought two of these dvds for gifts. And the guys I gave them to loved them. Well worth watching!!
B002NXOQF2|4.0|A great novel, Watership Down is also a great book of learning.  The story will delight everyone that reads it.  This book is so well written, I found myself right in the middle of some very interesting rabbits.  Hazel, Fiver, Bigwig and company start out on an adventure to a new place to live.  Along the way, they meet with other rabbits, birds, and every kind of living thing you can think of.  This community of rabbits govern themselves, and then venture out and see how other warrens are governed.<br />Lot's of humor, action, adventure and trouble make this the perfect book for just about any age.<br />While most children will love the story because of the rabbits and the trouble they get into, the more mature reader will appreciate the underlying wisdom.

1936608898|4.0|I read many books on nutrition and this is currently one of my favorites. As a nurse I have a need to understand the \\"why\\" of things and this book does just that. I always feel that it is easier to accomplish something if you understand why you are doing it not just that it works. Dallas and Melissa are two people who walk the walk and I like that too. Lead by example. Impressive health mavericks!! Love it. I recommend it to all my friends.
0446693804|3.0|This book made me a little teary as in how the characters are.  Oh man, can you get a little teary after being a little emotional.  N.Sparks is known for having characters passed away.  I guess his characters could kind of relate to people in real life.  He adds a little blooming romance and then some dramatic conflicts where it can't all be a happy ending.  If you read it, you'll know what I mean.  His writing is so so, but still a Hallmark-y feel and many might enjoy.
B005K17RU0|5.0|great app works great gives awesome weather couldn't possibly find one better! lil lil lop lil lil lil lil lol
1612130283|3.0|This book is basically one huge sex scene. If you dont take it too seriously, it is rather funny. But is it funny in a weird way or a ha ha way...sound familiar ladies???<br />My big question to this audience is, am I the only one that kept laughing every time Ana mentions Christian's smell and the body wash??? What is with the body wash comments? Have to admit I finished this book in 2 days. So for summer entertainment and a laugh at the authors expense, it can be a great escape.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The series is awesome and I'm glad it was offered as the trio so I could just go from one book to the next without a break in between.  The books are addictive and whoever reads it will not be able to put it down!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I enjoyed this easy-to-read book. The writing is average and the story line became somewhat tiresome towards the end. I would suggest it to others who are looking for a light summer read (so long as they can handle the subject matter).  I am glad I didn't purchase the trilogy.

0446572993|1.0|Anytime the plot depends upon the protagonist doing something utterly stupid and out of character or inconsistent with their profession, it's irritating.  This protagonist has the brains of a rock, is consistently clueless, lets his lower brain stem dominate at the wrong time and the plot depends upon his flaws until they magically disappear in a flash of insight that's \\"out of a rocket launcher.\\"<br /><br />If this is your first Baldacci, don't give up on him, at least try one of his early Camel Club or King & Maxwell books.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I work at a library, so when I heard the flap about 50 shades, I felt I should read them so I could contribute an opinion to my patrons if they asked about the books. The first book was fairly interesting from a psychological viewpoint. But I ended up skipping through the 2nd and 3rd books to just get them over with! How many times could she look at him and think to herself, \\"He is so hot!\\" Til world without end evidently! The sex was not as controversely strange as the buzz told,(Laurelle K. Hamiliton could teach James a few things), and the storyline after the immediate plot line was revealed was insipid. If you're over 35, and/or have been married for 20+ years, these books are fairly tame. To each their own.(Handcuffs)

0374275637|5.0|The book is very interesting and reveals and define separately, for better understanding, the systems of human thinking in two systems apart. The fast thinking (system 1) moves the mankind routine but always should be balanced more in detail when a better and a more robust decision is needed (activating the slow thinking, system 2 - lazy one). The data are also evoked as keys for a better decision making of system 2. Another idea is the \\"averse to losses\\" which is totally applicable and it can be used in several circunstances.The book is extense and brings several worth examples of understandings and misunderstanding of the human nature, its instability and how and why, in some cases, the humans speeches are disconnected with their behaviors.<br /><br />The book is assertive, based on facts and analysis of a plenty quantity of evidences.I do recommed this book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good for passing time or occupying my son for a bit...nothing special but I knew what we were getting when we downloaded it.  Wish I had more time to get into it.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|I liked this flick to which I have to say is better then the last one.  Definately, worth the rental and purchase.
1593272839|5.0|I have currently read about two thirds of the book and it's really fantastic. Often I find it hard to read a book about a programming language since I think it's much easier to just start coding and googling what you are wondering. However, with this book it's different. I have never enjoyed a programming book as much as I enjoy this one. The content is well structured and the depth is good. The examples are really good and almost all examples are tested with some test data. Even that test data is carefully selected, it helps me with all my curious thoghts I have along the way. The book is charming with funny pictures and the text is written in a funny way while still maintaining a good level of depth. I haven't had to google once because all the concepts are explained just enough to get me going.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to any newcomer to the language.
B007PS0X0W|4.0|I have been a fan of the series since the first Underworld.  And this tale did not disappoint...well I miss the character of Michael but, I assume he'll be in the next one. Anyway, it's worth the rental and purchase...Enjoy.
B008578PRK|4.0|Good thriller.  We enjoyed it as a family and my wife had a blanket pulled up to her eyes at several points.  Glad I didn't pay to see it at the movie but well worth the PPV cost.
0679745203|4.0|I loved the movie so I read the book. The book was amazing and I cannot see what confused people so much. Well thought out plot. The characters are real beyond developed. Definitely would read again. Wish his other books were as wonderful.
0062197258|4.0|I thought this was a well written book with good, creepy suspense that kept escalating in solid increments. Not to spoil the ending for other readers, I felt that some of it didn't make that much sense though, especially some of the things the abuser does in the end. It seemed like the ending was neatly packaged to tie up loose ends (as if everything and everyone needed to be accounted for). It made me wish that one of the mysteries had been solved in another way, that would seem more realistic. However, the writer did an excellent job of drawing you into the world of someone who suffers from OCD and PTSS. The reader is able to see what life is really like for someone who suffers from these debilitating disorders, the panic, the fear, the repetition that is required until the person feels safe enough to stop circling through their patterns. Overall, it was a very good first novel.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|it so amazing and fun and addictive i plus it keeps the little sister even other sister busy i hate to have to ho witout the fill version
B007549YM4|4.0|Of the post-apocolypse genre, this one is better than 'The Road', but not as good as 'Book of Eli;' in my opinion. The idea is sound, with the strangers being thrown together and how their actions degenerate/change as their time goes on. The outlier of the outside soldiers and what they are doing adds to my interest in this, and would certainly like to see a sequel. Kind of like 'Cube' was supposed to be a standalone, and fans got them to make two more! So, would certainly rent it to see if you like it enough to your permanent collection; I do not think I will be doing so, but will watch it again someday.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought this book on the recommendations of several friends.  I tried to keep and open mind while reading this book. A very dull and boring cliched plot and characters. The writing is terrible!  I was disgusted to have paid money for this.  My opinion: don't waste your time or money!
0345803485|2.0|Everything seemed to be drawn out just to fill pages.  The basic story idea is good but incredibly slow-moving.  There was a great deal of redundancy and lack of creativity.  The idea of the taboo/BDSM had me interested after reading the Sleeping Beauty trilogy, but this was poorly executed.  I won't buy the second or third books in the series.  There is much better erotic literature out there.  If the author wanted to hit the taboo scene, she should just buck up and go for it.  She seemed unsure of herself so just stayed weak and repetitive.
0143113100|5.0|I liked this book and think of it often.  Very positive and lets people know of things that are within their power to change their life. Good message.
B004GCPJDQ|1.0|I don't find the USB power source functional at all.  If the computer goes to sleep or shuts down, the charger loses power (naturally).  So, if I want to charge my mouse overnight (ie when not in use), I have to leave my computer on overnight.  That's not what I call eco-friendly, Mobee.  I have scheduled my computer to shut down only after 5 hours of inactivity, so that my mouse will get a 5 hour charge every night.  I've been testing this for over two weeks, and my mouse has been at 5% battery the entire time, constantly warning me that it's about to die.  Seems that I have to turn off the mouse and leave it on the charger with my computer powered on, not in sleep mode, for 24 hours to get a full charge.  Obnoxious!!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Without question this work is an essential addition to any self publishing writers suite of guidance material on publishing eBooks. The book takes the reader on a clear step by step journey through the process of publishing to Kindle. Although doable, self publishing eBooks is not as straight forward as it first might seem, especially if your proposed publication is to contain many images. So, publishing guides such as: Building Your Book for Kindle are truly indispensable for Independent Writers/Publishers.
B007SGM084|2.0|The same boring vanilla sex every other page....I was told this compares with Anne Rice or Bertrice Small........The plot didn't show up well into the 3rd book....weakly.......I suffered through the books because I thought it would get better & my girlfriends thought I (the QUEEN of \\"dirty,DIRTY novels\\") would LOVE this series.......it was like reading stereo instructions................
0066620996|4.0|I have not come across too many business books which actually offer a wealth of information sourced from intensive research activities. This is, in my opinion, the reason why this book stands out. It offers insights from a 5-year research project led by Jim Collins and answers some interesting questions. In addition to WHY some companies make the leap, there is information on WHAT they did differently and HOW they got there. Well-worth the time and money.
B00112ASXK|5.0|This little horse is wonderful. All the reviews on it's detail are true, amazing detail for a little toy horse. He really has an expression. I agonized over a horse for my three year olds birthday, she is really getting into horses. He was the perfect pick, and I will absolutely be buying more Schleich animals, they really are the best I've ever seen. And I have no worries that they will stand up to heavy play, even though they are beautiful! Buy this horse!

031618201X|4.0|I really enjoyed this manga adaptation of the first book in Gail Carriger's Parasol Protectorate steampunk fantasy series. For those unfamiliar with the novels, the series is set in a Victorian age in which vampires and werewolves are \\"out of the closet\\" and intimately involved with British politics and society. The adaptation successfully captures much of the quirky charm of the novels, and I'm looking forward to the next volume. The manga-style art is top-notch, and I enjoyed seeing artist/adapter REM's versions of the familiar characters, but I'm subtracting one star for drawing the protagonist with a conventionally cute nose, instead of the Roman nose that she has in the books.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|As a long-time Rush fan, it's difficult for me to review this album without heaping adulation on Geddy, Alex, and Neil; all the same, I'll do my best to avoid gushing. I have been listening to Clockwork Angels just about every day since I got it, and I am really, really impressed: the guys have proven themselves truly progressive, in the sense that they continue to push their sound forward, adding new elements to their songwriting repertory without abandoning the chops and complexity that make them great. The end result is that Rush have managed to put together a steampunk-based concept album that not only rocks hard, but also feels incredibly vibrant, unpretentious, and down-to-earth. Well done, lads!
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Immediately bought this after the 25th anniversary played on PBS. Just had to see it without those annoying fundraising breaks! A fantastic rendition of Les Mis in concert.

I love this CD!!!

B007FZ7R7W|2.0|Chris Brown who  has been making albums for almost a decade now and he has a decent voice when he is actually singing and not coming off like he is just a dancer and performing on alot of these shows.  this album has a modern feel and tone and the sad part his voice is burried underneath a whole lot of nothing.  not much to write home about these songs either.  if Chris brown wants to ever be on that Next level as a Artist well he has to kick the trendy sounding stuff to the curb in a real way.  i wonder what he might sound like with some real instrumentation and a church feel album all the way through? sadly mess like this keeps him at bay and you never know what the cat might actually have as far as the musical goods.  his albums don't do a thing for me, because he is never challenged properly as a artist.
B001P5Q6FC|5.0|yes, LAMB OF GOD is one of the best total brutal tHRASH DEATH METAL bands of all time!!!! Randy Blythe's vocals are incredibly raw and insane, and the band sound is like the HEAVIEST side of PANTERA with SLAYER...this one, WRATH is total METAL with high screams, great lyrics and an allucinated fast band!!!! yes, it's that good!!! All the songs like SET TO FAIL, CONTRACTOR, BROKEN HANDS, CHOKE SERMON and EVERYTHING TO NOTHING are DEATH/THRASH METAL GEMS!!!!...WELL DONE, LAMB OF GOD!!!!
0062206281|4.0|THE PRISONER OF HEAVEN by Carlos Ruiz Zafon: While the note from Julian Carax suggests that the three books in the series (THE SHADOW OF THE WIND and THE ANGEL'S GAME having preceded THE PRISONER OF HEAVEN), I have no idea what a newcomer to the series would make of THE PRISONER OF HEAVEN as a standalone novel. My recommendation is to read the first two novels first, as THE PRISONER OF HEAVEN refers back to the events portrayed therein. If you've read the first two books about the Cemetary of Forgotten Books, I see no reason why you wouldn't enjoy the third (and the fourth, which I can barely wait for). When I say that THE PRISONER OF HEAVEN is more of the same, I mean it in a positive way: THE SHADOW OF THE WIND and THE ANGEL'S GAME were sensuous feasts of words and atmosphere that I found immensely enjoyable, and THE PRISONER OF HEAVEN was equally diverting.    In this installment, Ruiz Zafon explores the history of Fermin, with Carax telling us in the prologue: \\"I have always known that one day I would return to these streets to tell the story of the man who lost his soul and his names among the shadows of a Barcelona trapped in a time of ashes and silence.\\" If you find that sentence seductive, the novels of Ruiz Zafon will appeal to you; if you find it overwritten and melodramatic, you probably ought to skip this series entirely. I was immediately drawn back into post-WWII Barcelona, which Ruiz Zafon evokes so beautifully. The story begins in 1957, just before Christmas, with Sempere & Sons bookshop financially strapped. Fermin has an idea for drumming up business: \\"Perhaps if by chance I was seen arranging the shop window in my underpants, some lady in need of strong literary emotions would be drawn in and inspired to party with a bit of hard cash. According to expert opinion, the future of literature depends on women and as God is my witness the female is yet to be born who can resist the primal allure of this stupendous physique.\\" Sempere decides to go the more traditional route of a nativity scene, and customers begin to trickle in. Among them is a mysterious stranger who buys the most expensive book in the store and leaves it as a gift for Fermin. This is the trigger for Fermin to tell Daniel Sempere his own story: beginning with his time in prison during WWII and revealing connections between Fermin and Daniel.    My only complaint about this novel is that it was too short. Having read it on the Kindle, I had to look it up to find out that it is apparently 416 pages long, but it breezed by in little more than a night of reading. Fermin's story is gripping and the dribbles of information relating to Daniel's mother, David Martin, and the mysterious stranger are well-paced. Fermin's usual cynicism and humor lighten up the narrative, and the ending is satisfying, although clearly setting the reader up for the fourth book.    I found THE PRISONER OF HEAVEN engrossing and delightful, and I recommend this book to fans of THE SHADOW OF THE WIND and THE ANGEL'S GAME.

B000002IPZ|5.0|SOULS OF BLACK, TESTAMENT 4th album is another great THRASH album!!!! Many say is not as inspired as the first 3 masterpieces from TESTAMENT...well, i think THE NEW ORDER and PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH are among the best THRASH EVER...SOULS OF BLACK got some THRASH gens like FACE IN THE SKY, FALLING FAST, ABSENCE OF LIGHT, MALPRACTICE, LOVE TO HATE and the classic title track!!! it´s another great collection from TESTAMENT...not as remarkable as THE LEGACY and THE NEW ORDER, but it´s TESTAMENT at their best!!! REALLY GREAT!!!!WELL DONE, TESTAMENT!!!!!!!
B0073U2FB2|5.0|This movie was very entertaining.  I don't know why it is receiving so many negative reviews.  I honestly didn't read them because when I watched it, I loved it.  It wasn't gory and overly violent (well, many people are killed by aliens but they turn to dust.  There is no blood.) and the special effects were more than decent.  What I really loved about it was the location:  MOSCOW!  You are taken through so much of the city -- there's a great scene or two in Red Square, one of the Cathedral of Christ the Savior, a couple of Metro stations, the Russian State Library with it's statue of Dostoyevsky out front and the inside of GUM.  Having been there more than a decade ago, it was great to see so much of the city on film.  The acting wasn't Oscar-worthy, but who cares?  That isn't the point of the film.  It was a suspenseful, interesting movie that showcases a beautiful city.  I know I would watch it again.
B000002IOJ|5.0|PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH is a TOTAL THRASH MASTERPIECE!!!!! It's more polished than their first 2 THRASH MASTERPIECES, THE LEGACY and THE NEW ORDER, but show TESTAMENT in their peak!!!! The title track, PERILOUS NATION, BLESSED IN CONTEMPT, SINS OF OMISSION, ENVY LIFE and TIME IS COMING are THRASH GENS!!!!REALLY GREAT!!! WELL DONE, TESTAMENT!!!!! TESTAMENT RULES!!!!!!
B005PK57IK|5.0|I couldn't stop watching!  I purchased this for summer entertainment as I didn't get to see many episodes in Season 3. I simply couldn't put the box away after one episode.  This is definitely a keeper & looking forward to Season 4 this Fall.  Anyone who enjoys this show will have the same problem I did for sure--one episode isn't enough for one sitting.  I didn't realize I have addiction issues; have to work on that.
0399159029|3.0|This was my first Bernie novel. I read it on audio. I enjoyed the presentation but would not jump up and down about it. I will say that I will now investigate other Bernie books as I came to like the character and want to see how he does in life. That alone should make an author happy.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|If you're looking for a well-developed plot and deep character development, then you're going to have to look elsewhere. But if you're looking for a classic pulp made real, or a completely fun Saturday afternoon cheeze fest, John Carter is for you.
0439023521|5.0|Katness Everdeen will live into my thoughts for many years to come. The first book, The Hunger Games, is a story with this amazing heroine.  People of in her District are cut off from food most of the time, and communication from the rest of the world (only propaganda is show on TV by the Capital. All this takes place thousands of years after a kind of nuclear apocalypse, but they live more like the Middle Ages, with starvation and illnesses killing off the young and weak.  Katness finds ways, with her friend, Gale to feed her family (by hunting in forbidden lands), but these adventures ultimately train her to be fast with a bow and arrow, her choice of weapons when the time comes.  Every year a raffle decides which young person will go off to fight for their lives in a game called \\"The Hunger Games,\\" masterminded by the evil Capital as a means to keep everyone in the outlying Districts of this futurist world in check and \\"the Capital's way of reminding them of how totally they are at their mercy.\\"  Devised after a so called \\"revolution,\\" the games are used as a reminder of the Districts crimes against the Capital years before when they revolted.  One winner years ago still lives in her District, his name is Haymitch and adds some comic relief throughout the story--gruff but loveable, he becomes her mentor.  Everyone tries not to think about the \\"Reaping\\" but it come too soon every year.  When the Reaping begins in her district, shockingly, her little sister is picked!  Prim's only 9 years old!  To save her sister, Katness volunteers to go instead.  She's not a likely heroine, other than she wants to save her sister, her other motive is pure survival, though she doesn't think she'll win the games.  She never, not even in future books, realizes how strong she really is! Katness expects to hate everyone at the Capital, but she forms bonds with the team of stylists set out to make her beautiful and appealing, a sure way to garner sponsors. These relationships develop and a strange bond is formed that is never broken, not even in later books.  Of course, there's a sweet romance with another boy picked for the games, Peeta, who to this reader the real hero of these stories!  Katness is soon she's torn between what she thought she had with Gale and what the future holds with Peeta.  Hunger Games swept me away (unexpectedly) into a futuristic world where the lives of children are simply entertainment. Hunger Games has all the elements of suspense, surprise, love, meaningful relationships, told in a youthful narrative but relatable to any age. I couldn't stop reading it! I quickly bought the other two books and loved them all equally as much. I only wish there was going to be more!

B007X15GRQ|4.0|What more can a moviegoer ask for?  Mark Wahlberg and Kate Beckinsale!  The duo makes a great couple in the movie which makes the action and suspense that much more exciting and enjoyable.  It was definitely worth renting for date night with my girlfriend.
0345803485|5.0|It lacks literary brilliance. The story is improbable but not entirely unbelievable. Sure, it started as fan fiction and it's easy to take cheap shots at it. But, for all that, I came to care about what happened to the characters. I wanted to know they found happiness in the end. The sex, while repetitive at times, is steamy and fun (except for when it's a little scary...in a good way). I found the \\"stream of consciousness\\", first person reporting a welcome diversion. I didn't have to think too hard; I just devoured page after page.<br /><br />So, if you're hoping to come away with a greater understanding of life, these probably aren't the books for you. If you're interested in an easy to read, BDSM laced story, pick these up, head to the beach, and enjoy!

B00846REIS|2.0|I read this book because so many people compared it to the Fifty Shades books. I beg to differ. I didn't find it better written or nearly as compelling. At no point did I find myself pulling for one character or another, hoping they would find a way through their difficulties by the next chapter. No, my only prevailing thought throughout each agonizing chapter was, \\"ugh, these characters are one dimensional and I can't wait to be done with this book\\". If you are hoping for something remotely as interesting, funny, or layered as Fifty Shades, keep looking. This is NOT the book for you.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a fun game it gives you the experience of being the major and that seems like it's fun.
B0012QE4Q2|5.0|I fell in love with the book, \\"The Other Boleyn Girl,\\" so I knew I just had to have the movie! I was not disappointed! I loved the costumes, the acting, everything about it! This movie and the book as well would be great for anyone that likes historical fiction!
1936608898|5.0|Dallas and Melissa do a fantastic job of explaining the basis of a healthy lifestyle. They don't fall into the trap of going along with trends or fads but rather give you science facts to prove their thoughts. This book made me think, laugh, and question the foods I put in my body. If you have any questions about health or food you need this book!
B007I2BZIE|3.0|I HAD ALL OF RUSH'S PREVIOUS STUDIO ALBUMS, AND I ACTUALLY LIKED _SNAKES_AND_ARROWS_ QUITE A LOT...SO, NATURALLY, WHEN I SAW ALL THE RAVE REVIEWS FOR _CLOCKWORK_ANGELS_, I GOT EXCITED AND PICKED IT RIGHT UP.  IT TOOK ME A WHILE TO FIGURE OUT WHY I IMMEDIATELY FOUND IT ANNOYING, BUT IN THE END I DECIDED IT WAS BECAUSE THE ALBUM SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE THIS REVIEW LOOKS.  EACH SONG (OR AT LEAST THE \\"HARD ROCK\\" ONES, WHICH IS MOST OF THEM) RACES STRAIGHT TOWARDS MAXIMUM VOLUME AND STAYS PEGGED THERE UNTIL THE END, WITH NO QUIETER \\"BREAKS\\" TO SPEAK OF AND NOWHERE TO GO HIGHER FOR ANY SORT OF CLIMAX.  WHILE THE SOUND MAY STILL BE REASONABLY \\"CLEAR\\" -- AT LEAST COMPARED TO THE INFAMOUS _VAPOR_TRAILS_ SLUDGEFEST --  THE UTTER LACK OF ANY VOLUME DYNAMICS ULTIMATELY MAKES THE ALBUM REALLY TEDIOUS TO LISTEN TO, JUST LIKE THIS REVIEW IS TIRESOME TO READ REGARDLESS OF HOW SHARP ITS INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERS MAY OR MAY NOT LOOK ON A SCREEN.  IT MIGHT NOT BE TOO BAD TO LISTEN TO JUST ONE OR TWO SONGS LIKE THIS, BUT BY THE TIME I'VE LISTENED THROUGH THE WHOLE \\"CONCEPT ALBUM\\" IN ONE SITTING, I'M ALL TOO GLAD TO GIVE MY EARDRUMS A BREAK FROM THE MONOTONY.  IT'S A SHAME, SINCE SOME OF THE SONGS MIGHT HAVE BEEN PRETTY GOOD, BUT WITHOUT ANY DYNAMICS TO GRAB ONTO THEY ULTIMATELY JUST SLIP IN ONE EAR AND OUT THE OTHER.  IN MY CASE, AT LEAST.  I KNOW MUSIC IS ALWAYS A MATTER OF OPINION, YOUR MILEAGE MAY VARY, ETC. ETC.  BUT SERIOUSLY, WHO THE HECK THINKS PRODUCTION LIKE THIS IS A GOOD IDEA?  UGH.
1936608898|5.0|I have never been so excited to eat my vegetables! I love Melissa and Dallas' approach and this book is so easy and fun to read.  I'm 15 days into the Whole30 and I feel amazing.  I have already lost weight but I don't even care about that part.  What I am most happy about is how my body feels and my stomach issues have disappeared.  I have so much more energy, which is hard to come by- I work 40 hrs on the graveyard shift of a very stressful job, have a 2 1/2 year old and a 7 month old baby and I'm still nursing almost exclusively.  Before doing the Whole30 I felt so sluggish and weighed down and always so dang tired, now I have energy to play with my kids and look forward to cooking! Everyone should read this book...take control of your life and your health.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|The app was always behind when I powered up, and there is no<br />refresh capability.  It eventually refreshes itself.  Also, there<br />is about a third of the screen at the top taken up by the weather<br />channel promo.  Went to the Android instead.

B0053VKP8S|4.0|My new LED TV came with only a digital output to connect to my analog external speaker system that I had used for years. I did not realize that many new products only have digital outputs until I got it home and was not pleased with the mini TV speakers. I searched and found this device on Amazon and now have a way to connect my old sound system to the digital output. It works well and I am happy with the device. I am disappointed at manufactures that have poor sound systems with the new large screen TV's, but this is a way to connect them to our older and very good analog sound systems.
0385360169|5.0|It is a great love story, you cry and laugh. I am getting ready to read it for the 3rd time. I have never in my life read a bk 3x. I feel everyone should have spice in their relationships.  it is a spicy bk, not for kids. I have read what some write about it, it really is a beautiful love story and I was sad when it ended. I hope she does write from Christians side. Way better that twilight. LOVE LOVE Christian.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this app does what it says.  it's very simple to use; very easy to read on my kindle fire; I love the large numbers.  the memory feature is particularly useful when reconciling a check book.  bestows of all it's free!
B000W93CHC|5.0|Great book. I will read it again at some point. I actually think this was better than The Pillers of The Earth.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so addicting I cam not put my kindle fire down it is an AWESOME. I love it please get this game
B007VUA7VO|5.0|its awesome to know how much time i really have left then to finnaly get up ang plug this in. INCREDIBLE! !(:
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was so good that the ending kind of takes you by surprise.  I couldn't wait to find out what happened and the ending just left me feeling deflated.  I literally kept turning pages on my Kindle, thinking \\"Really?  That's it?\\"
B007UQ5Z1G|2.0|I have to admit,there are more catchy melodies, & well written songs on this album, than any since possibly Hybrid Theory. But damn guys, where are the real drums ???  Instead you use that cheap, crappy synthetic sound for your rhythm track, that is so overused in HipHop & Pop. That's what set this group apart before. You layered rap over a great strong \\"ROCK\\" sound, with a strong rhythm track of real bass & drums. Even when the more synthetic sound was used, it was added on top, not used instead of. If you want to become a hip hop group, so be it. But what a waste. I thought you guys were talented musicians. I guess I was wrong !!!!!!!!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is an awesome boredom buster when I am stuck at work on a super slow day. I love all of the variety it offers. and it keeps my toddler amused too!  anything that keeps him amused while I'm grocery shopping gets my vote lol. simply awesome app with all the classic games
B00479SVBU|1.0|I do NOT recommend this product in any way, shape, or form.  I tried it in a Corvette, Mazda Miata, Honda Pilot, and always had the same result.  Static in the music, distorted sounds, and abysmal sound quality.  I tried a friend's FM modulator to see if they were all this way, and his produced significantly better results.  And his only cost $14 at Walmart.  I won't buy one from Walmart, but I will keep looking.  This one is going back, thanks to Amazon's generous return policy.  I hate to stick Amazon with a return item of such poor quality, but maybe they will elect to quit selling junk like this if enough of them get sent back.<br /><br />Update:  7/31/12:  After my initial review, I was contacted by Satechi customer service.  They said I must have had a defective unit, and they very generously offered to send me another unit at no cost to evaluate.  This level of customer service is rare, and I appreciate the concern for customer satisfaction. I received a new Satechi Soundfly FM Modulator and have evaluated it in the same 3 cars as before.  While I had better results in one car, the sound quality in the other 2 was equivalent to AM static.  This company does stand behind their product and offers great customer service, but unfortunately, I can't endorse this product when 2 out of 3 cars the music is so full of static it is difficult to tell what song is playing.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|its Ann okay app but when u hag noone to play with an pick a random apponent it takes forever to find one :/ but other than tht I guess its cool. 1&lt;3 1D!

B0088RQ4TI|4.0|Good enjoyable movie. Great for a movie night at home. Looking for something to watch for the evening John Carter is a movie I would recommend.
1423113454|5.0|Loved thus book from the series Kane Chronicles.  I have recommended the series to my friends and family that read as much as I do.  Thank you very much and would deal with again
B004TTMYQG|4.0|please update my beloved calendar app.  it is the best I've used.  however the jelly beans 4.1 really messed up the display.  it doesn't show the events colors nor text inside the calendar box in month view.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|This is by far the best recorded version of Les Miserables. I enjoy it much more than the 25th Anniversary at the O2. I enjoy Lea Salonga's interpretation of Eponine much better, Fantine is to die for amazing, the best Javert I've heard, and Michael Ball as Marius is amazing. Jean Val Jean has the perfect blend of emotion and talent in every song. The Thenardies are amazing as well.
B0000VAFNQ|4.0|First of all, I have a hot lady crush on Kate Beckinsale in these movies. She's just too badass and sexy to handle.<br /><br />The storyline is cheesy with just the right amount of intrigue, there are ridiculous looking werewolves, the traitorous vampire Kraven is predictably scumbaggy, etc, etc, etc. It's not mind boggling, it's just brain candy.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|It's OK a little too flimsy when using it to prop up kindle falls easily. But better than no cover!!
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This case might be made for good reason..but it will not fit alot of cases..and if you carry a purse..you have to put it in with other stuff (to bulky for pockets..on purses or person.)<br />Sorry...Make a thinner Case....with all the benefits...Hey, they can put a man on the MOON  !!!
B006RUJST6|5.0|Layken is a girl dealing with the loss of her father, supporting her mother, and trying to be strong for her brother.  After moving to a totally different state, she has to learn how to grow up way to fast for her age.  After meeting her neighbor, she is taken on a whirlwind of emotions that give her a break from her gloom and doom.  Will is a guy that can understand exactly what Layken is dealing with.  He is a young man that has also had to grow up too fast.  They are trying to determine if whether they can take a break from thier responsibilities and be thier age WHILE dealing with some very heavy issues.<br />The supporting characters are just as important as the main ones.  Their humor and intentional approaches to the circumstances in the book are important to allow Layken and Will to learn how to deal with thier lives.<br /><br />I cannot begin to tell you what this book has done to me.  If I could give it 10 stars, I would.<br />I finished the book and went to class the following day with dark circles and blood-shot eyes.  I am not a person who normally cries in a book, and this book was no different...because what I did and the noises I made while reading this book cannot be called \\"crying.\\"  This book hit home with me, forced me to visit emotions I usually keep under wraps.  However, it (and the second book) was also therapeutic in dealing with the issues at hand.  If you have ever lived through the events presented in the story, get ready to revisit some hard emotions.<br /><br />The author does an amazing job investing you with the characters through humor, clever conversation, slam poetry (something I was not aware existed!), and real-life connections.  As soon as I was done, I immediately bought the second book, Point of Retreat, and started it...at 3am in the morning!<br /><br />I'm afraid this review is nothing but a random mess, but I cannot seem to find the words to express what I feel for this book.  It was terrific...no, it was butterflying amazing!<br />Buy the book.  Tell your friends.  Be forever changed.ng!<br />Buy the book.  Tell your friends.  Be forever changed.
B005MMY80O|2.0|I got as far as watching the third episode and decided I had had enough of a poorly written re-telling of an old tale, old themes and characters that did not fit the roles.  Maybe I missed the point of some of the previous episodes this isn't a romantic re-telling, it isn't believable, it seems to be a sci-fi but it just didn't make it.  The fantasy stuff was silly, the romantic scenes were silly.  The director had to be unhappy with the lead actor, costuming was mis-matched, it seemed like the director couldn't decide if the characters should look like cave dwellers or wear futuristic fantasy costumes.  Dialogue was \\"campy\\" and trite.  Not a classic flick for sure not even a good made-for-tv series.  I guess I'm too old school for any remaking of classic tales other than the way they have already be done, Regrave and Harris, Burton etc.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it is so awesome. I love it so much.it would not work on my itouch so I am glad that I can get it on my kindle fire.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|good clean fun for a grandma!  it s challenging without violence, inappropriate language,  or nudity! I recommend for family members of all ages!
0345803485|1.0|I am so upset that this book is so unbelievably popular. According to my Kindle I made it through 40%, but that's all I can stand. I am so very pleased to read some of the well articulated negative reviews including the mention of the repetitiveness, the all to unrealistic character that is Christian...a 26 year old billionaire who speaks French, plays piano, flies his own aircraft, possesses amazing good looks, and has an enormous penis (which he doesn't need since he can evidently make a woman climax with a mere glance and the lightest touch). This, coupled with the writing style, leads me to believe that EL James is actually 1/2 teenage boy and 1/2 teenage girl, which equals (in this equation) one whole joke of an author.<br />I'd rather re-read the Twilight trilogy.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|I have watched this millions of times and it never gets old! I love One Direction! If you are a directioner then I would definitely recommend this!
B0000AUHPG|5.0|THIS FULL LENGTH, WIDE SCREEN VERSION IS ONE OF THE TOP TEN WESTERNS OF ALLTIME.  IT HAS GREAT MUSIC, GREAT DIRECTING AND GREAT ACTING.
B004ZJZPWA|3.0|Product was mostly as described, was supposed to be brand new, but case was broken, top can not close. Other than that, great purchase.
0307592731|5.0|This is a memoir and the author wrote this for herself.  If you just want to read about hiking fun adventures, this might not be for you.  This book started out with the author's heavy past.  A lot of readers could not empathize with the author's self destruction pattern.  I tend to think this was from childhood domestic violence damage, traumatic childhood experience which led to self destruction in adulthood.  What happened to her mother was just a trigger of that.  The story is about how a first time, totally uninformed, unprepared, messed-up-in-the-head backpacker who survived her journey.  By doing so, she picked up all the broken pieces within herself and healed herself at the end of the journey.  Again, she wrote this for herself, not for you and me, so this book is honest and there could be information that readers don't want to normally know.  I enjoyed it cover to cover though.  I remember my very first backpacking trip (also unprepared) for only 4 days.  It is amazing to see how long she last on PCT under extreme weather. I always find backpacking therapeutic myself, I could totally feel the healing of the author as I read through the book.
B0027P2ZWC|3.0|After seeing a travelling group perform at the local University my wife and I had Les Miserables fever! I eventually settled on this version and kind of wish I had picked the original Broadway cast version as that is the version that I listened to on tape as a kid after my parents went... My problem with this version is<br />1) The recording is low (for my taste) so compared to other digital albums I have to turn the volume way up, and you can tell it is recorded in a large hall, which is forgivable, but<br />2) Jean ValJean...just adds too much of his own pizzaz is I guess how I would describe it, and it is distracting. Probably only because we just saw it and wanted to re-create that experience where the singer did not have the annoying pizzaz.<br />Overall still good, but, preview as much of Jean ValJean as possible before you buy so you are not surprised.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|For the 1st time in decades I'm using the Bible again. Thanks for making it easier for my old brain to understand.
B000007UTN|4.0|The packaging of the vinyl is top notch. Solid sleeves and of course the liner notes are in the gatefold in a nice computer programming-type font and style. The audio quality is amazing, however on perhaps my favorite song on the record (\\"Subterranean Homesick Alien\\") there is some distortion on the high pitched guitar and it's quite noticeable when comparing to the CD. Other than that, this is a fantastic Vinyl to add to anyone's Radiohead collection.
0374275637|5.0|This work is an excellently crafted, deliberately demonstrated, summary of a lifetime's work, studying the mind. It is personal, since the personal is what is remembered, it is delightful in places and also surprising about how much we have yet to lean about our economic theories, our legal systems and the soundness of our advice in the face of our contradictory and contrary information systems: we and our expert advisors are both subject to powerful biases. These ideas and examples suggest future work in the areas of communication, risk management, statistics and the Law.
B008220AVW|5.0|Saw the movie as a favor for my 12 year old, but found myself being drawn into the singer's work ethic and personal life challenges. Realizing it is also a promotional tool, I have to admit I would rather pay for us to see this movie in 3D, than to buy expensive, bad concert tickets in a huge arena. Up close footage from the concert via 3D movie beats standing way back in the cheap seats, and seeing a disappointed daughter because she can't see what's going on on stage. The movie portrays a strong work ethic and a strong, individualistic female role model for young ladies.
B00846WWVM|2.0|is cost WAY to much money. It is totally NOT worth 1.99<br />save your money DO NOT BUY .its not even that much fun
0446541478|3.0|Start-up Nation is a feel-good book about Israel and its current success in both attracting foreign investment and maintaining a highly dynamic technology-focused & entrepreneurial culture.  However, it ignores some of the crucial predecessor activities that occurred in the marketplace (i.e., Elisha Yanai and Motorola) or beautifies through hindsight others (i.e., Intel in 1980s).  In a nutshell, it is a good introductory book for people who want to learn more about Israel's tech society today.
0345803493|4.0|I thoroughly ejoyed this book even more than the first one of this trilogy. This is a great read and very addictive.  I could not put this book down. I read it within a week. I would recommend this book to any and all women and even men to read.  It's unlike any book I have read that's out there.  It has some dark moments but also some really enjoyable moments to read.  It is so descriptive and so well written.<br />I really think anyone who reads it will enjoy it and maybe even learn a thing or two about relationships.<br />A truely great great book. I am currently reading the third and final book.<br />Very entertaining read.
034580404X|5.0|Yes this book has SEX in it, but I also really like the story line.  Started on  50 Shades Darker, and love it.  Can't wait to get to 50 Shades Free!  Delivered before date said it would be.
B006YTTVHO|2.0|Don't get me wrong, the author is genuinely trying to be helpful. It's well-written, but it's not very interesting and speaks in such generalities that it isn't very helpful.

0439023491|5.0|I didn't find this book as traumatizing as the first one, but I think that's because the underlying current of terror was pushed to the surface and you were faced to deal with it square on, just as the characters were. My heart ached for them all, especially the tributes/victors. Hadn't they experienced enough pain and suffering? The author is amazing at writing characters that break your heart and characters that you would be terrified of if they existed in real life. I knew something like the ending was going to happen, but I hadn't quite figured it out before it happened. I cannot wait to read the next book.
B001VLXNLU|4.0|I would like to start out by saying that I read many reviews before i commited to buying this book. i was worried it would be a waste of money even. nobody likes reading about somebody that is so special and has a whole herd of adoring adherants and tall handsome guys falling at their feet. goodness knows it makes me feel like poo when i read that stuff, but it was pleasently suprised. i loved this book and have read it multiple times. yes the characters were underdeveloped and cliche, there are grammer problems everywhere, and there are way too many conflicting messages in the book for compfort. it was still good. the first book is never as good as those to come. read it then keep reading, read them all, the novellas, everything. look deeper into these books than the flaws that are so easy to pick out a chipmunk could do it. there is a beautiful spiritual presence through out the entire series and the characters become evem more developed and you will fall in love with them.
B008EEB4TA|5.0|Electra Heart has got to be my album of the year. I haven't had a single album where I liked every song since Amy Winehouses Frank album. She admits herself she got a bit conflicted on the last album and didn't quite know what direction she was going and you can tell how more reassured she is now. Every track is fun and has meaning, whether or not people chose to pay attention to the message is their choice. Hopefully she'll get the fame she deserves, either way I can't wait to see her live in DC! She's one of few artists that deserves everything she gets (fame wise etc).
B0019HQIGS|5.0|A DVD of John Mayer performing acoustically, with his trio, and then with his band.<br /><br />The performance was awesome, and the commentary was very minimal, and well-placed.  Highly recommend.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easily start reading many different versions. My favorite is that it comes with the life journal reading plan and it allows me to keep all my notes and journals in one location.

0425263908|1.0|So I was excited to really compare it this book to the ones E.L James has written, and I could not help laughing as I started reading....It is a copy cat of Fifty Shades of Grey!  The first chapter I just thought to myself \\"give it a try, it is only the first chapter, but then by the 2nd. chapter when she writes about a tie, and gray in color I was really disappointing. I will read it, I already bought it, and like my husband said, the author got what she wanted, to sell.  I really don't understand how she even compares it to Fifth Shades, she copied it!!  It lacks originality, it could of being a great book, no wonder there is not much talk about it as Fifty Shades...
B003YOEXUM|5.0|I'm a child of the 80's but was never a big Accept fan.  I didn't particularly dislike them, just didn't listen to them that much.  Lately I've been listening a lot of old-school style metal and seeing all the 5 star reviews on this, I decided to give it a try and oh-my-lordie-lou am I glad I did.  This album is freakin' awesome!  It manages to sound new and classic at the same time.  I am now a convert \m/ \m/!!!!!!

B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|I saw this movie in a theater the first time and it's a great guy-flick with lots of action. It's very close to theater-quality on a Blu-ray disk and a movie well worth having in your library. It's the kind of movie that you can watch over and over and the timeless theme stands up well in future viewings.

B001E2JNA6|5.0|LOVE it!!! Received it before expected date and was brand new still in packaging like it said it would be.
0143123173|5.0|Every now and then I read a book that lingers long after I've finished the last page.  This is one of those.  I truly like the characters - I would love to sit on the new porch with Walt Longmire and Henry Standing Bear and watch the sun set over the Wyoming landscape.  The story was complex, no easy plot line, and although the ending was a surprise, it was also an \\"of course\\" moment.  The author builds his characters, and his environment, slowly, but thoroughly, and blends in the tensions of reservation life with the world of the whites.  I think that one of the things that makes this book so memorable is the way the author develops individuals, avoiding the caricatures so many writers of western novels employ.  He clearly depicts the clash of cultures, and uses some of that to build the plot, but he also shows the common threads that make friendships possible, no matter what the background of the people involved.<br /><br />This isn't a book you can breeze through, but it is one you can escape into.  The plains, mountains, towns and people came to life - the story intrigued, and the end of the book came far too soon.  I'm glad there are more Longmire stories out there - he has become a friend and I want to spend more time with him.  His Philadelphia Deputy is a kick too!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great game,! I been playing since I downloaded for two weeks straight. totally fun and easy!  download, download, download! spool!
0345803485|1.0|This is quite possibly the most poorly written book I've ever attempted to read. Although I don't believe it's true to its Twilight roots, it is pretty clear that it started out as fan fiction- awkward, over-the-top writing that requires you to be invested for some other reason. With the Twilight characters out, I suppose people are in it for the sex. Too bad the sex is written like the pre-Grey virgin Ana wrote it. If I had to read Ana refer to her vagina as \\"THERE\\" again I would have thrown the book across the room.<br /><br />Meanwhile, where was the editor? Did no one think that perhaps a book with American characters set IN America shouldn't be laden with British-isms? It was completely distracting.. right down to the main character's obsession with tea. I fully expected the next sex scene to be set to God Save The Queen.<br /><br />Ultimately I couldn't subject myself to a full read. I got about halfway through and then skimmed to see if she ran for the hills or not. The last page of the book drops you mid-story, pretty much forcing you to buy the next book if you're at all invested in the story line. Lucky for me, I'm not.
B005HSL626|5.0|I like about that you can slice the fruits because it's fun and you can get 3 chances when you miss a fruit
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app has many fun games to play all day long and all night long though I wish they would take out all of the in game ads
B00884GR0W|3.0|Ok i like this game. The only problem is the controls! I cant seem to place any blocks! The movement and flight is terrible. Combat is also terrible. Honestly i say just go get minecraft. This level of frustration isn't worth 5 bucks.
B004ZQBP22|5.0|This is by far one of the best party/club albums I've ever come across. From begining to end this record does the trick, it's 10 tracks & I think thats one of the best things about it cuz they didn't seem to put any \\"album tracks\\" on here just for the sake of quantity. They delivered bangin production, & catchy hooks, all the way through. I don't care who you, you should buy this album.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really good since its free n u don't have to pay at all but too bad u have to earn coins
0345803507|4.0|**Contains Spoilers**<br /><br />Fifty Shades Freed is the third, and last, in the Fifty Shades trilogy. I didn't like this one as well as the other two, but I still enjoyed it. Actually, if it weren't for all the hype - I would never have picked these books up. The covers don't appeal to me at all. They look like a \\"man\\" book to me. With no femininity added, I would never have guessed there would be such a deep romance entwined within this trilogy.<br /><br />Now, don't keep reading if you don't want to read any spoilers. There are just some things that I wanted to bring up in my review that I can't say without giving anything away... I was disappointed when the book started out with them already married. Yes, there were some flashbacks but I just felt like I missed out. I also started getting annoyed with all the sex. I mean, several times a day gets a little old.... That part just wasn't that exciting to me anymore. The first half of the book just seemed a little slow.<br /><br />The second half of the book picked up and was more exciting. Another spoiler ----> When Ana told Christian that she was pregnant, I was totally pissed by his reaction. He was a major jerk and if I were her I would have walked out on him. Again. It took something big happening for him to realize what an a** he was.... And then you couldn't help but soften toward him again. He is someone that is hard to stay mad at.<br /><br />There was major growth in Christian's character throughout the trilogy. Ana's character grew a little too - she got a bit of a backbone. Christian may have had many lovers, but this was his first REAL relationship. I loved seeing him go from \\"I don't do hearts and flowers\\" to being a lovesick puppy. They had lots of issues threaten to come between them, but in the end they overcame everything to be together.<br /><br />The ending had a nice epilogue that wonderfully closed the story. That being said, I'm sad it's over. Christian is just a character that is so interesting to read about. There was some bonus material at the end of the book from Christian's point of view. It was from the time he first met Ana and I really enjoyed reading that part and being able to know exactly what he was thinking. I'd really love to see the author write a whole book from Christian's POV. I don't think there needs to be 3 - I think a lot of stuff could be cut out. I think that one book from his POV could cover the more important things from all three books in the trilogy. He is just such a complex character and I'd like to know what was going through his head at different times. I really hope the author puts out more books with complex characters and steamy romances - I'm a fan for sure.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I love this app I think it needs more levels but its still osem. I hope they mack more levels.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Great Cover! I have had this on my Kindle Fire for about a month. It gives adequate protection for what I need. I have tried the stand while watching a movie with  the Kindle on my coffee table, and it stayed in place. I will say that I realized that the stand feature can only be used in the landscape orientation, not letter, but that's not an issue with me.I like the feel of it, the color, and all around appearance. The elastic band is a nice feature to keep the top secured. As advertized, it is fairly light. I would recommend this product for minimal protection, as it is designed for.
0345803485|1.0|I heard this referred to as \\"mommie porn\\" and truly believe the only people that could be titillated by such mundane erotica are long-married and bored housewives in far-flung suburbia. They too are the only ones who could slog through such terrible writing and come out the other side with anything nice to say about it.<br /><br />The plot line and characters are hackneyed. The writing makes you want to rip your eyes out or read it out loud to your friends while drunk. And the sex, well, he spanks her!! Yes, he does! Dirty, dirty. Yawn. I have had first date sex that was racier than all the sex in the book combined.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This product is great fun.  The white section gets really tense. Hard to hit the 4 minute mark but still working on it.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|Reminds me of old school Mario! Pretty fun so far! I love it!! My kids love it too. Easy enough for them to play.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|I use to love watching this movie as a kid and now that I have children of my own, they watch it all the time too.  With all the remakes of Snow White coming out in theaters, there is really nothing that can compare to the original Disney movie!  Great movie and an all time classic.
B006ZXZWP4|5.0|As I walked over to the bookshelves carrying a bottle of water and a single chocolate bar (on top of the bag of m&m, the Fruit loops and the Doritos), I had no idea I was just about to have a \\"Sophies-choice moment\\".    The bookshelf at the San Francisco airport was filled with intellectual books,autobiographies & history books. As I approached the shelf, Steve Jobs was looking right at me. I had for a long time been wanting to read this bestseller with the dream in mind of bringing up intellectual facts at a high-end cocktail party (which I go to all the time).    Other well-known people stared at me while their eyes loudly screamed \\"pick me, pick me!\\" I politely thanked President Obama and Colin Powell for wanting to give me the insight into their brilliant minds and reached for the man who helped the world become a better place, Steve Jobs.    As my eyes were about to turn towards the cash register, they suddenly landed on something bright and yellow. The face on the book was not screaming \\"Pick me\\". Instead it calmly looked at me and said \\"If you pick me, I will show you a good time, but whatever....\\". With Steve Jobs in my left arm, I reached very nonchalant for the yellow book. It could not hurt to look...    It did not take me long to realized that Houston had a problem. On my left I had the story of a genius (and you never know, some of the smartness might just rub-off on you while reading the book), and on the other hand I had been given the promise of a book were the author \\"reveals all\\".    I started comparing the weight of the books and even though I knew the battle was over at first glance, I had a moment of intellectually reasoning. Both books promised me bestsellers (aka: people who know people, read bestsellers). However in the end, the \\"safety first\\" side of me kicked-in. Mr. Jobs was a little too heavy for \\"light reading\\" on a flight (you don't want to bring on board more weight than necessary). So the nonchalant yellow book might possibly save usall from a \\"to much weight plane crash\\".    So at the next big, fancy, intellectual cocktail party, I will thanx to Tina Fey, be able to join the conversations with amazing topics like Breastfeeding, Princesses, Photoshop, the Electoral Process, and Italian Rum Cake!    I've always wanted to be funny, but for now I leave it up to the professionals. So if you are looking for some laughter this summer, go for the yellow book!    Oh yeah... if you happened to be on the SFO-AMS on May 30th and heard someone in the back laugh hysterically, yes Ma'am, that was me... I blame it on my new bestie Tina.    ( [...] )
B006RUJST6|5.0|This is an amazing book!  It is meaningful on so many levels...a must read.  It's a love story with a twist at every turn...poetry is intricately weaved into the plot and reveals the characters' feelings, struggles, and thoughts that helps to unfold a beautiful story about love and friendship in this journey called life.  I can't believe this is the author's first book...it's written beautifully!!!  Seriously, you won't be able to slam the pages shut until you have reached the end of Slammed, and then you might (you just might) read it all over again.
B00881VLCE|4.0|great game to pass the time.....  fun without investing too much time or money.  Worth the download...... try it you just might like it :)
0811876373|5.0|A year ago when I was hearing about cake pops for the 1st time and had no clue what they were...I did a little research.  Bakerella's book was the most recommended book.  I learned what cake pops are and the book very clearly gives you step by step instructions on how to start out.  Supplies needed, handy tips...love it!  Her cute ideas that are doable even by a novice.  A great variety of pops for many seasons or reasons.  I'm a reader of her blog now and am still picking up new ideas and discovering other things to try out.<br /><br />This is the 2nd copy of this book that I've purchased.  The 1st one is mine.  This copy is for my friend's daughter.  She doesn't need too much to get started in her new married life but doesn't splurge much for herself.  She got a full \\"kit\\" to help her start making cake pops.  I tried to get her things that I use and may be harder for her to find.  This book, a [[ASIN:B000H849V6 Wilton Chocolate Pro Electric Melting Pot]], [[ASIN:B0020ZURDI Gourmet Food Writer Edible Color Markers (10 color set) by AmeriColor]], 2 chocolate molds to make the cupcake bites on pg 24, [[ASIN:B00076TPNA Wilton Mini Romantic Metal Cookie Cutter Set]] so she could make the cupcake pops on pg 18 and spring pops on pg 50 in the book, pop sticks and 1/2 dozen assorted sprinkles.  Everything to get her started except cake mix, frosting and chocolate candy for coating the pops, because those are easy for her to get herself.  She has many friends that have young kids like she has and this is something I know she would enjoy but may not have purchased all for herself.
0345522478|3.0|This was a tough one to review. I like so many things about this book -- from Hearne's take on Druid magic to Atticus's fantastic dog Oberon. Hearne's writing style is easy to read and he has populated this book with likable (if somewhat shallow) characters. My favorites - Oberon and the old lady neighbor. And, let's face it, Atticus is not only likable--he's hot. (Please don't ever change the cover.)<br /><br />Hearne clearly knows how to appeal to his readers on several levels. And yet...<br /><br />Atticus is perhaps too perfect. He knows everything he needs to know and has everything he needs to win. Everything seems to go his way. Even the goddesses fall all over him. But the biggest problem is that Atticus seems to feel no pain or fear or guilt or regret. We only know what he feels because he (or the author) tells us so. Hence there's no real sense of suspense and this book was not as engaging or exciting as I'd hoped.<br /><br />But, like I said, I liked a lot of things about this book. I'll probably try one or two more in the series.
1455508977|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. The story line was excellent.  The villain got his in the end and the hero gets the girl. What more could you ask for?

B006ZDU7QI|5.0|This album was a great surprise. I'm not the biggest fan of Gotye's current single \\"Somebody I Used To Know\\" but I purchased the album anyway after giving into the hype.<br /><br />Gotye has a good grasp of a lot of musical styles. There are hints of reggae influences, 60s pop and down-tempo lounge music. I would have never expected this having only heard his radio single which is a little more grungey/alt-rock. That being said, the album seems a little schizophrenia as Gotye takes you on a different musical ride with every song.<br /><br />An extremely skilled musician with a great voice. This album is a wonderful ride as long as you're open to the different types of music he has to offer.

034580404X|4.0|I have fallen head over heels for Fifty Shades. After reading the first book, I had to rush out and purchase Fifty Shades Darker and right after that Fifty Shades Freed. I'm coming close to the end of the final book and it has been such a good read that I want more!! I am completely addicted to Anastasia and Christian Grey. I have never read three books in one month...E.L. James has done a great job at keeping people captivated and all warm inside.

0525423656|2.0|Like many others, I am suffering from the \\"Hunger Games Hangover,\\" so I'm reading a lot of other young adult dystopian books. I actually found myself enjoying the first book, Matched, though the characters felt under-developed and the plot wasn't original by any means.  However, this book, as mentioned by others, was a filler book.  Almost nothing happened, the character development was weak, and the plot lacked focus.  I could never leave a trilogy without reading the last, but I am feeling very humdrum about picking it up when it comes out.  I'd suggest looking for another series instead.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|This is a compelling look into a sociopath from his mother's point of view.  This book is riveting on so many levels, but also very disturbing and sometimes hard to read. The writer uses such descriptive terms in EACH sentence, this is really one of the best writers I have ever read.  This story is so riveting but at the same time disturbing, but I could not put this down! I don't think I could read it again, but I have thought about incessantly since I finished it.  The book is very dark, as it is a character view into a sociopath's personality starting from birth. I do believe that some people are truly born this way without a conscience and can have everything from nice parents, money, nice house, private schooling, and still do something utterly horrific.  I loved this book.  It is not for the faint of heart, but if you love a good writer with a compelling story, this is it!!
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Fair dues to an author who has brought erotica out of Ann Summers shops and onto every Tube, bus and airplane in the Western world, but it just really wasn't for me.  Whilst the protagonist is young, the writing as well as her voice sounded so immature it jarred with the explicit content.<br /><br />And on the subject of the explict content, the only thing that shocked me was how repetitive the scenes were. And frankly, how little it took to have poor Anastasia scraped from the ceiling. Not the most true to life representation, perhaps, but then fiction such as this is meant to be an escape from reality.<br /><br />I recently asked my friends - Christian Grey devotees the lot - to just tell me his backstory as it unfolds in the next two books, as I won't be buying them, but found his mysterious past the only interesting part of the book.<br /><br />Says it all really.
B007KZY1YY|3.0|An unputdownable book but a load of nonsense all the same!  Read with an open mind and skip some pages when descriptions get tedious - don't take it too seriously.
B007SGM084|5.0|This is the best book/book series I've ever read!  The story is richly layered with fascinating characters and story lines that are constantly surprising.  I've already read it 5 times and I never get bored or skip over parts that are slow, as I've done with other books.  And, I continue to find new tidbits that I have overlooked each time I read through it.  Of course, the sensual love story (it is so sweet!) between Christian and Ana is the very best part of the book!  I can't get enough of it!  I hope the author is working on her next book and I hope it is along the same lines as Fifty Shades!
0374203032|4.0|Sandel's new book takes up the large and undeniably important question: What, if any, are the moral limits of the marketplace? What shouldn't money buy? True to form, he worries that things have gone too far, that we have \\"drifted from having a market economy to being a market society.\\" His aim is to show the moral cost of what happens when everything is for sale, when any good can be commodified.    Far from an academic treatise, the book consists mainly of short case studies of surprising new commodities and labor forms.    Examples abound in Sandel's book, which makes for a good, even rollicking read. And as the examples accumulate, one begins to appreciate just how deeply markets and market behavior have rooted themselves in virtually all aspects of our lives. The claim that we are a market society, as opposed to having a market economy, seems not far-fetched.    Sandel could have conveyed a more sophisticated view about markets. Not all markets and marketplace exchanges are alike, or have the potential to corrupt valuable non-market norms. Take for instance the simple distinction, familiar to any reader of SSIR, between goods offered for sale by for-profit versus nonprofit organizations. Commodification looks different if the marketplace is populated by nonprofit organizations, but this distinction is lost in Sandel's undifferentiated treatment of markets.    This review is an except from a fuller review, posted at the Stanford Social Innovation Review: [..]

B0015AARJI|1.0|Buy Retail Pay Wholesale sold me this controller and it was a counterfeit.  I received the contoller and it looked great.  Plugged it in, charged it up and it worked just fine so I threw the packaging away.  The controller sat for about a week before I had time to play games and I noticed immediately that the buttons were a little off.  The joysticks were off a little and didn't press down (L3 R3) at the extreme angles. The battery level on screen always indicated fully charged... until it suddenly died after less than an hour of use.  Then, the controller would randomly freeze up and would not work again until I shut the PS3 down and restarted.  Also, no rumble feature which I didn't really care about anyway.  I bought a new controller at best buy to be sure I just didn't buy a defective controller.  Subtle differences throughout such as the fake one having lighter colored text and button symbols.  Also the fake is much lighter.  Amazon is willing to refund me; but we'll see how easy that process goes.  I filed the claim today.<br /><br />I highly suggest everyone just buy a controller at a store and pay the extra amount to be sure to get a real controller.  Amazon can't do anything to prevent all the vendors selling these clever counterfeits, so it isn't their fault; and is beyone their control.

B00004RIV4|4.0|I stumbled upon Moloko while browsing YouTube and watching the video for The Time Is Now, and it was love at first sight. Róisín Murphy's voice is sensuous, versatile, and haunting; she simply exudes style. And Mark Brydon, the other half of the duo, can mix his butt off and knows how to make you want to dance. After discovering another winning track, Indigo, I decided to purchase Things to Make and Do, but I didn't realize what I was getting myself into.<br /><br />Let's get this out of the way: Things to Make and Do is frustrating. You'll hear a wide variety of musical influences, find catchy melodies, riffs, and bass lines, the audio production is superb, Róisín Murphy shines, and you can't help but move. However, the songs rarely reach their potential. I didn't realize it at purchase, but the album versions of The Time Is Now, Indigo, and Sing It Back (the holy trifecta on this album) are not what you hear in the music videos. The videos use radio edits that can be found on Moloko's Catalogue album, and the edits (with the possible exception of Sing It Back, which could benefit from a longer intro and a livelier guitar solo) are nearly the right length. Sadly the album versions are too long for their own good, unless you're on the dance floor. Additionally, there are a number of short interludes that add nothing to the album except a bit of quirk (Radio Moscow, It's Your Problem, Bingo Massacre, Just You And Me Dancing, and Keep Stepping). I would include Drop In The Ocean in that list, except that it's on its way to becoming a great song... The lyrics are thoughtful and the beats are fun but it just fades off at the end and leaves you hanging with an overwhelming sense of incompleteness. C'mon, Moloko! You couldn't bring yourself to write a minute or two more of music to finish it up? Finally, the album is melodically and harmonically static, which may be a turnoff to some. The music rarely goes anywhere except by slowly layering tracks, and the repetitionmay get on your nerves if you're sitting down and listening.<br /><br />Here's a track-by-track breakdown (though I'm leaving out the interludes).<br /><br />Pure Pleasure Seeker: One of the four singles on this album. It opens with a contrabass sax riff (no, seriously) that continues throughout. I love the sax and I applaud Moloko for using an obscure instrument, but the repetition and the lack of development ruin this otherwise funky track for me. At least the lyrics are good. 3/5<br /><br />Absent Minded Friends: Catchy trip-hop. This one actually has a bridge, though it smacks you in the face with its awkward transition (forgivable because you forget about it by the return to the chorus and the original key, and that transition sounds awesome). 4/5<br /><br />Indigo: Another single and the track that I can't get out of my head. The slightly distorted bass line will haunt you. Sure, I prefer the radio edit, but this is one of the best tracks on the album and the lyrics are mighty fine. Think Lady Gaga meets Zero 7 (except that Moloko came first). 5/5<br /><br />Being Is Bewildering: I want this to be my favorite track. The exposed vocals over acoustic guitar and organ are ethereal and the lyrics are perfect. But a sound reminiscent of a chirping cricket appears around the one minute mark and stays for the rest of the song. This is grating, plus the piece doesn't build enough energy! Still, a solid track that showcases Murphy's voice. 4.5/5<br /><br />Remain the Same: A rocking piece that reminds me of Linkin Park. The repetition of \\"Change my name I remain the same\\" may get on your nerves. Oh, and the Hammond organ is back. 3/5<br /><br />Dumb Inc: \\"Dumb, dumb, we're dumbing it down\\" is an accurate lyric. This groovy and simple electro-infused dance piece has a nice build. 4/5<br /><br />The Time Is Now: The third single and the second reason to buy this album. The funky bass line is awesome, Murphy's voice croons, and the synth strings are a nice touch. 5/5<br /><br />Mother: Quirky lyrics about the disparity (or lack thereof) between a mother and daughter. The music reminds me of Halloween (the holiday), but again the repetition pushes me away. 3.5/5<br /><br />It's Nothing: An apt title. Hardly any lyrics, this song drags on. I like the melody and the singing, but it doesn't save the piece. 2/5<br /><br />Somebody Somewhere: Ooh, this is new. A male vocalist joins Murphy for a funky upbeat dance piece, though the bass line falls victim to the same problem as the sax in Pure Pleasure Seeker. Still fun. 4/5<br /><br />If You Have A Cross To Bear...: While I enjoy the creepy piano parts, this is my least favorite track on the album. The same lyric repeats over and over and the electronically manipulated vocals don't do it for me. Maybe if I were a dancer I'd want to do some twitchy choreography to this one. 1/5<br /><br />Sing It Back: The intro is too long and the guitar solo is too conservative, but this fourth single reminds me of Basement Jaxx and is just pure fun. 4.5/5<br /><br />In short, this album provides quirky amusement and the tracks that shine are Indigo, The Time Is Now, Being Is Bewildering, and Sing It Back. Get this if you want something slightly unusual to dance to or if you already love Moloko. If you're looking for more mainstream dancepop then you're better off going with Statues or Catalogue.

B00870ZH3U|5.0|This review is for Phantom fans who aren't sure about the sequel. Yes, \\"Love Never Dies\\" wasn't very well-loved when it opened, but that's because it is unique and has a sad ending. When I heard about the story, I initially refused to see it because I'd heard Meg and Raoul, for example, both \\"go bad.\\" I didn't want anything changing my mind about how Phantom is \\"supposed to end.\\" But then I heard the music. Just listen to Ramin Karimloo singing 'Till I Hear You Sing\\" on YouTube, and you'll recognize Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom. That song is incredible, like others in the show. There are even some phrases and melodies (but not too many) from \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" incorporated into the sequel, and it's fun to try to recognize them. After listening to the soundtrack a friend had bought, I was convinced it was good. Seeing the video was so fun because the music came alive in the story. It really isn't that bad. Raoul is a bit tense the whole time, and Meg does things you wish she hadn't. But Phantom and Christine haven't changed at all. Christine is still beautiful and sweet and gentle, and Phantom, though less blood-thirsty, will do anything to woo Christine back to him. The climax in the story is when Christine must choose to sing or not, each of her lovers trying to pull her different ways, and she is once again caught in a hard decision. Overall, this movie was well done. The story is a bit changed from the soundtrack version, but I think it's clearer, and the cast (in my opinion) is not as good. Sierra Boggess and Ramin Karimloo (original cast) are simply amazing. So I'd suggest listening to the soundtrack first and the music will probably convince you to see the movie, as it did me. :)

B00782O7NE|3.0|I'm a silent movie lover, so I was excited to see \\"The Artist\\". While it's generally a very cute, heart-felt movie, it does have its flaws. The film begins as a romantic comedy between a popular silent film star named George and a new actress named Peppy trying to make her way to the top. The chemistry between them is wonderful. However when sound comes to film, their roles are reversed. George refuses to do sound films, and he pays dearly for it. Peppy, on the other hand, becomes a big name actress. What was once a fun, romantic comedy turns into a depressing melodrama that drags on too long. This part of the film could have been significantly shortened without harming the story or character development at all. Instead, it ends up dragging down the film.<br /><br />As far as the overall look and historical accuracy of the film, it's pretty top-notch, although it has the look of a film from the 30's rather than the 20's. The styles and costumes are spot-on for the most part, although I would have liked to see the clothing styles change as the film progressed into the early 30's (Peppy's gowns should have been ankle length instead of knee length towards the end). Not only would it have been more accurate, it would have demonstrated the progression of time more clearly. Also, while Berenice Bejo turned in an excellent, emotional performance as Peppy, her look is too Latin (she's from Argentina) to match the more Anglo look of popular actresses from that time period. No doubt being married to the director had a little to do with her casting. Jean Dujardin, however, looks like he was plucked directly out of the time period.<br /><br />I'm only being nit-picky because I was expecting great things from this movie, but it ended up falling a bit short of expectations. However, I'm very glad someone decided to do a modern-day silent film. Kudos to the filmmakers!
B0058YPG1G|5.0|I love Breaking Bad but fell behind on the seasons...having the season set was great to zip thru!!The set arrived so quick , I was able to get right to them. Also a very user easy menu.

B001C4CI8U|5.0|The show is about an FBI Division that explores the freak or unusual phenomena. The relationship between Peter and Olivia, Astrid and Walter, Peter and Walter (father and son) are just so deep and wonderful to watch. The characters are rich and interesting, Walter Bishop is just the best Mad Scientist since Doc Brown. I can't say enough of this series through here. If you like a good detective story investigating the paranormal, look no further. If you enjoy the thought of alternate universes mixed with a little bit of time travel, and some out of the ordinary characters (The Observers), there is NOTHING like FRINGE.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|When I first started reading \\"A Stolen Life,\\" I have to admit that I almost gave up on it quickly.  I wasn't very fond of the writing style, and I thought that it just wouldn't be worth the effort.  But then after a while, I realized that the style fits the actual story comfortably, kind of like an old pair of shoes.<br /><br />Besides some asides, most of the book is written in the present tense, which at first can be disconcerting.  I thought that it was an odd choice, but then after thinking about it, I believe that it was a good choice.  Writing in the present makes the reader feel as if he or she is right there with Jaycee, living her life with her while fighting for survival.  (You could argue that that is a bad thing, and you would have a good argument.  But the point of a book such as this is to make the reader understand what Jaycee really went through, and unfortunately, you must be pulled along for the ride.)<br /><br />I vaguely remember when Jaycee was first kidnapped, but didn't think much about it for quite a while, probably like most people.  When she was rescued, I saw that on the news as well, but then forgot about it again.  But finally, I was watching the show \\"Wicked Attractions\\" and was surprised that Jaycee was held captive just a half hour from where I live.  I watched an interview on Youtube that she had done (I thought that the interview was hit-and-miss, really; the interviewer purposefully tried to make Jaycee cry at one point and I thought it was an old-and-tired trick, a real rookie move by the interviewer), but I did see Jaycee had written a book and therefore just had to read it.  Two days later, I was finished, trying to hold back the tears at the end.<br /><br />A few side notes:  while it is obvious that Jaycee doesn't like her stepfather, I do believe that he was thrown under the bus, particularly by the media.  I have read a few web sites that seemed to imply that he had something to do with his stepdaughter's abduction, and he was treated poorly at least until she was captured.  Hey, just a thought:  innocent until proven guilty should be our motto, but that idea was thrown out long ago.<br /><br />Also, I've always believed that abductors involved in kidnapping - and some other violent crimes - should just get the death penalty immediately.  Why not?  If that had happened to the guy that kidnapped her - I won't say his name since I don't want to give him any more press - then Jaycee never would have had her life \\"stolen.\\"  Just something to think about.
B0058SNKRY|5.0|This review is from my mom:  Love, love, love these shoes!  I have a bad back which causes my legs to ache terribly. These shoes did wonders, leaving me with just barely any ache after the first time of wearing them (regular crocs help but not as much as these do).  They look stylish and go nicely with dresses.  Am going to order another pair in black.
0307956350|4.0|I started this book on a three hour flight and was kept entertained the entire time. I was once an expat wife so that part was relatable - to a point. But even if you have never lived overseas, this book will keep you entertained because it quickly stops being a book about a housewife living overseas and becomes a thriller with all the elements of a spy novel. It can be a bit predictable but isn't that what we like from a good international crime mystery that includes members of the CIA and FBI? It doesn't telegraph the outcome but it does give you enough clues to piece things together as it moves along.
B003Y5H57E|3.0|Any scene involving Ryan Gosling worked well (and no, I'm not a man who dresses neat and likes a certain type of music who is hypnotized by The Gosling's abs) but the rest of this movie is an indecipherable mess. The kids' love story is the worst and the babysitter's part where she's obsessed with the ancient Steve Carell is plain creepy. I get what the screenwriter was trying for but it still came across as weird especially as the babysitter overplayed the awkward teen persona.<br /><br />The movie is also completely disjointed. It seems the edits from scene to scene at times are completely abrupt.<br />Plus, sorry, but Kevin's Bacon and Julianne Fries Moore just did zip for me in this. They just seemed to be acting as if they were comatose.<br />Also, Marisa \\"the screaming banshee\\" Tomei makes a gratuitous appearance that adds nothing but the audience wondering why she gets movie roles given her acting range consisting of looking at things with those deer in headlight eyes and shrieking.<br /><br />Also, forget trying to figure out the math as to how an almost 50 y/o Steve Carell and over-50 Julianne Moore conceived a child at 17 years old who apparently is still in her early 20s.<br /><br />No extras at all on the DVD.
B0037VNX44|1.0|Waste of time, pointless, mundane, boring, blah, rather watch paint dry.  Their are a million other movies better than this.

B00843TZJM|2.0|This is all speculation of course since the DVD hasn't come out yet, but if it's anything like what I have seen live of late from these guys, don't bother with it. I was a huge fan for many years. Probably longer than I care to remember, but it's time for them to give it up.<br />Most notably Steven Stills. His voice is shot. There is no way around trying to hide it. It's just gone. And Davids' isn't too far behind. They certainly aren't the only ones that should give it up. Paul McCartney comes to mind, but this is about CSN.<br />Please let me remember the way you once were, so very long ago...

B0085HWZ9Y|5.0|If you are in any way like-minded to my thinking you'd say Robert Plant began an excellent \\"Americana Roots\\" influenced musical journey with Raising Sand which quite unexpectedly ramped up to a more emotively charged height with Band of Joy.  In fact, I was so personally drawn to this group's music that I eagerly looked forward to their next album and tour.  Well, that is not to be, apparently...But, by leaving us with an excellent concert on DVD and Blu-Ray, Plant has left us with a searing document of just how fantastic this band was.  I stress this is not just Plant with a backing band, it is a real band in the truest sense as this concert unequivocally proves.<br /><br />I was a bit slow to get on board as I found myself, after the initial honeymoon phase, not reaching for the Raising Sand CD very often.  Then I watched the BBC's Live at Electric Proms with Robert Plant and Band of Joy.  Wow!  Immediately this concert became a long-term favorite right up with the likes of such stellar concert DVDs at \\"Concert for George\\", \\"The Last Waltz\\", and my boot of Brian Wilson (& his band The Wondermints) at Glastonbury Festival.  I had to get the CD, which while not as quite as powerful as seeing the band live is wonderful and remains one I am drawn to.  This is a case where a live concert is even better than the CD which the tour supports.<br /><br />The BBC show isn't, AFAIK, available as a DVD.  You can find it to burn to DVD if you know the usual places to look for this kind of stuff.  That really doesn't matter very much, however, because if I had to pick one: this one is the winner by a bit more than a nose, IMHO.  While they are both similar they have some important differences.  The BBC show has a finale with a full choir, but pushing this concert over the top is the middle stretch where Miller, Scott, and Griffin unique talents are showcased to a point that is brilliant.  That plus Plant and company's Zep reworkings, added in this part, drive it over the top.  It is uniformly excellent in all categories.  Keep in mind that I am saying this before the DVD or BD is out because my recording of it from the PBS broadcast is superlative and the even better sound, and likely even crisper (if that is possible) video of an official release will assuredly raise the bar - I look forward to delivery of the Blu-Ray from Amazon!<br /><br />For me the knock-out unexpected centerpiece is fairly left-field. I am referring to Darrell's rendition, of all things, an old Porter Wagoner song: \\"A Satisfied Mind\\".  This warrants another \\"Wow\\"!  Plant is selfless in allowing this group to contribute individually as well as collectively.  As mentioned Miller, Scott, and Griffin literally \\"tear-it-up\\" as they each take centerstage.  Not to forget the killer rhythym section of Byron House on bass and Marco Giovino on percussion.  Just listen to the fuzzed out electric bass (like on Move Up) as well as the articulate acoustic bass playing of House, it really is amazing.  Giovino's understanding of how to create texture is unsurpased as he's both fleet feeted with a lot of finesse as well as very heavy (Satan, Your Kingdom Must Come Down)...Brilliant percussive work!<br /><br />Well, to me any way, this is Robert Plant's real \\"second coming\\" and this DVD is all one should need to observe that.  This is one concert I truly have no complaints other than I wish it was even longer!t is uniformly excellent in all categories.

B002VPE1WK|3.0|I agree the bag has a number great features - you can read many of the other reviews for more info.<br /><br />However, if wear a men's jacket size 42 or larger, you may not be able to wear the bag very comfortably. The bag seems to be designed for smaller, more petite people.<br /><br />The bag is great as it has many adjustable straps, but the straps themselves are not very long.  The padding on the shoulder straps is not very long either, resulting in uncomfortable chafing/rubbing of the exposed strap against the more sensitive skin under your arms.  Attached to the shoulder straps are chest straps that attach to hold the the shoulder straps together across your chest.  Larger people may have to position the chest straps higher up, perhaps to the point of getting close to the neck area and creating a choking feeling and/or rubbing against your skin.<br /><br />There is also a waist strap that attaches across your waist/belly - also very short and a tight, uncomfortable fit.<br /><br />I suppose I could just wear the bag with the armstraps only, but I like the security provided by the chest and waist straps and I don't want them dangling uselessly.<br /><br />I purchased this bag for a trip to Europe, but at this point I'll have to spend some time wearing it at home to see if it's going to create blisters.  If so, I'll have to return it and look for something else.<br /><br />Another minor quibble, but not a deal-breaker:  The zipper grips have a rubberized \\"Amazaon\\" logo covering nearly the entire zipper handle.  I want to be able to lock the zippers together with a travel lock as a deterent to pick-pockets, however, the solid rubber covers means there are no holes on the zippers through which to loop the lock.  I have purchased a small cable lock with the hope I'll be able to thread the cable through what little space there is.  I will update this review when more details are know.<br /><br />----------------------<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />I purchased a Masterlock 4688D luggage cable lock with the hope of threading it through the zippers - there wasn't enough space in the zippers to thread the lock through.<br /><br />I returned the Amazon Basics bag and instead went with the Lowepro 250 AW bag.  The Lowepro bag was subtantially more comfortable (but also unfortunately around triple the price).<br /><br />I am giving the Amazon bag 3 stars as a comprommise - it is really a 0 star bag for me since it is unusable.  However, it does have some quality features that make it a great value for people with smaller builds.
B000002LIM|5.0|Danny Elfman's BATMAN score is haunting and enjoyable.  The tones are very dark, symbolic of the nature of the film.  Elfman abandons the typical operatic superhero theme and embarks instead on a musical course much more reminiscent of Dracula or some similar gothic (perhaps even Victorian) story.  My personal favorite track is the aptly titled \\"Descent into Mystery,\\" a fitting name which carries the mood of the entire soundtrack.<br /><br />Overall, this score tells the story of the film to an extent few film scores can match.  I'm particularly pleased that this edition contains only the Danny Elfman score and not the Prince songs.
0345803485|1.0|My asshairs are more complex than absolutely any and every part of this book (as well as the others in its series, I'm sure).<br /><br />It is complete garbage. The plot is garbage. The writing is garbage. The characters even fail at being one-dimensional and epitomize every failure of character development, and the book was just completely bizzarre and just total garbage. I tried to stick with it...but I stopped about 120 pages in, I couldn't it was just too badly written and altogether nauseatingly poor. I went on the internet to read more on the book, and it says that the book was originally a Twilight fan fiction which was simply expanded upon. The writer simply changed the character names to avoid infringement reprimand. After discovering this small tidbit, it all started to make so much more sense, this is glorified twilight fan fiction, it even fails at being that much, every bit as much as you'd expect, and then some.<br /><br />The only positive thing I can say about this book is that it is reminiscent of Farenheit 451...in the sense that I want to gather up all versions of this book in existence, ban them, and burn them.
0061692042|5.0|I don't usually read this type of book, but after getting a sample, I could not stop.  Very clean writing, thoughtful, full of grace and simplicity. I could not believe this book was fiction.  Wish it was as I gained alot of knowledge of that era.
B002SR2PKG|1.0|I'd like to begin my review by saying I love Stephen King.<br />He wrote the worst books I have ever read in my life. But he also wrote the best ones, and the best ones are in my top 10 favorite books.<br />That being said, I really hated It. It is the single worst book I've ever read, and I would give it negative stars if allowed. I can't believe I managed to finish it.<br />I decided to buy the book because it has so many good reviews. I don't get it. I don't understand how this book is considered a horror classic.<br />It was long, boring, pointless and not scary at all. Even ridiculous at some parts.<br />It started off ok - some misterious deaths, stuff like that. but then it goes on a while without anything happening. Well, let's say it takes about 200 pages of nothing before something interesting happen. Then, you start getting curious and the book goes back to being boring.<br />The most interesting parts were the ones when the main characters have problems with bullies, and you want to  keep reading to find out if they manage to scape. The rest of the book is a lot of nothing. Sometimes, a character comes up and you start thinking \\"who the hell is this\\", and have to go back and find out if the character was mentioned before. It's something like: there is something happening that is the main plot. Then, there is the by-stander. King tells the name of the by-stander, what he does, what happened to him when he was a child, if he is married, and goes on for several pages. You figure the by-stander is an important character after all. Turns out he wasn't, and in not mentioned ever again.<br />There are a lot of characters you figure are important and wants to know what happen to them, and you don't. They're simply forgotten.<br />The way the main characters deal with the It monster is pathetic.<br />I had a really hard time concentrating on this book, and was easily distracted while reading it. I had to go back pages several times, because I couldn't concentrate. Reading it felt like work, and I often would stop and sneak a peek at another book I was actually enjoying.<br />I love to read, and its very rare for me to take more than one week to finish reading a book. Reading It took me over a month. I never took so long to finish reading a book. I'm really glad it's over.<br />\\"It\\" managed to be worst than \\"The Tommynockers\\" - which I didn't like, but it had some interesting parts and got me entertained somehow.<br />If I had to describe \\"It\\" in one world, that would be: \\"Unreadable\\"..

B007SGM084|3.0|The first book was ok, however the next 2 could have really been rolled into 1. If you took out the sex in the 3rd book, you would have about 1 chapter of storyline. This could have been a great book. Sometimes you just need to leave something to the imagination.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|This is one heck of a game. My<br />brother is so in love with this he always is playing it thank you for inventing this game.
B005LAII0I|5.0|I was a little bummed when I didn't get to see this movie so when this came out on dvd I was excited! I love Mirror Mirror! It was funny and magical! I loved that Snow was still independent and a fighter but yet still remains girly and not turn her into a tomboy. The scenery and costumes were magnificent! The costumes reminded me of Alice in Wonderland mixed with Marie Antionette type costumes but still having originality. You could tell that all the actors enjoyed their roles! Julia Roberts and Lily Collins shined as The Evil Queen and Snow White! I can't wait to see Lily Collins as Clary Fray in the Mortal Instruments movie based on the book series. I think the best actors are the ones who enjoy acting and being the characters they were given rather than just doing it for the money. I also loved that this film was a comedy and it didn't take itself too seriously. I also loved the magic mirror now that was different where you go inside the mirror and go into this alternate world. The ending was a twist that you didn't see coming! I loved the Bollywood number even if it didn't match the movie. I know it didn't do that great in the movies, but I heard more good things about this film than I did with Snow White and the Huntsman and I saw Snow White and the Huntsman and that one was a horrible film.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Because of all the hype, I Was curious about this book. I felt no need to continue the trilogy.  These characters make no sense to me and the author needs a lesson in vocabulary development!! There was no love story...Just really horny people with no depth.  YUCK!

0553386794|5.0|Any fantasy fan who doesn't know about this book by now is living under a rock. I'm afraid I have little to add to the conversation but to give my 5 stars and move on. A Song of Ice and Fire remains one of the great fantasy series of all time. Anyone who enjoys fantasy would be remiss not check it out.
0143119680|5.0|Maybe it's not exactly a fear, but considering the current vampire culture, I'm just not into it. Never read a vampire book. Never saw a vampire movie. Really. Never. There was something very compelling when I picked up Discovery of Witches in BookPeople in the Austin Airport. I find alchemy, genetics and libraries irresistible, as well as the idea of worldwide class warfare acted out via the races of vampire, witch, daemon and human. It's a great read and has me looking forward to the next installment. It reminds me somewhat of Diana Gabaldon's Outlander stories. Still not going to see vampire movies. Unless...

B0009P5YXO|5.0|Knowing nothing about Dr. Who I bought this blindly for a buddy's birthday.<br />Apparently this is the coolest thing since inline skates. He loves it and has been taking it everywhere.  Pulls it out at random times in bars to scan the contents of his drink.  Embarrassing, but apparently, fantastic.
B0088D076I|5.0|I've been listening to Rhapsody since Symphony of Enchanted Lands and am very familiar with all of their albums.  Luca's new album is absolutely incredible and perhaps the best Rhapsody album to date (in my honest opinion).  The layers of orchestration, piano, keyboards, guitars, and choirs leave the songs so rich that my brain can't process all that is going on in a single listen.  Each time I hear something new that I hadn't noticed before.  The new singer, Alessandro Conti is more operatic than Fabio and I think fits even better with this style of bombastic epic movie score metal.  Everything feels very dense but not in an overly crowded way... it amazes me at how much polyphony can be going on in each song without crossing that tolerable threshold.<br /><br />On the production side of things, this album is crystal clear and packs a heavy punch.  It is not overly compressed and utilizes a wide range of dynamics.  Luca's guitar playing, riffs and solos are his best and most inspired work I've heard.  You can tell he takes much care and thought into each guitar solo to seemlessly integrate it with the music forming a cohesive composition.<br /><br />The songwriting is very strong and there are many highly infectious choruses.  Some I like more than others, but not one stands out as flat.  My current 2 favorites are the opening track \\"Ascending to Infinity\\" and \\"Excalibur.\\"<br /><br />For me, the only weak point on this album as with any Rhapsody album is the narration.  Thankfully, the voice acting is solid and it is not overused...<br /><br />To summarize, this album feels like Luca Turilli is at the top of his game, right at the peak of his creativity and is his best work to date.
030758836X|1.0|Boring constructs.  Jerry Springer mode.  Flynn tries too hard--she never hits an authentic or correct note for me.  Neither main character is likeable, engaging or warped enough to keep my attention---these are the same characters that you might see on Dr. Drew's horror fest...or the Jerry Springer freak show. Readers who enjoy this drivel might well be experiencing early dementia.  In conclusion, I really didn't care what happened to either character. That's the death knell of a novel.  The theme:  two boring sickos that clearly belong together. Does that put you to sleep or what?  You wonder why fiction is dying...look no further.  I realize now that some women no longer have a cushy life of earlier generations and have to make a living.  But can't they take their time and find something they're good at?
B005HSL626|4.0|this game is a lot of fun! its in a way sort of addicting because you always want to unlock new blades and backgrounds and you always want to get a higher score! or at least I did... I do recommend it.

B0027MJU00|5.0|\\"I was not a lovable child, and I'd grown into a deeply unlovable adult. Draw a picture of my soul, and it'd be a scribble with fangs.\\"<br /><br />Gillian Flynn crafts this dark and twisted story so wonderfully. 25 years after the murder of her mother and two sisters, Libby Day begins to question the events of that fateful night, including her own memory that her brother, Ben was the perpetrator. After being approached by The Kill Club, a group of murder mystery enthusiast, Libby seizes the opportunity to make some quick cash. The story follows the events of that day in 1985, narrated by Patty (Libby's mother) and Ben, and Libby's current quest for the truth. This is my first Flynn book, but it will not be my last, the opening line pulled me in and has not let me go.<br /><br />\\"I have a meanness inside me, real as an organ. Slit me at my belly and it might slide out, meaty and dark, drop on the floor so you could stomp on it.\\"
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the trilogy.  It's always a pleasure finding a book or series of books that you can't put down.  I read all three books in one week :)
B007IUEINK|1.0|Man, I don't even know where to begin. This album is just horrible. I'm not a huge Drake fan, but I've never been dead set against him either, although maybe after purchasing this album I might lean towards the latter. When people started talking about the fact that he barely even raps, I didn't think it was a big deal UNTIL I bought this album. DON'T waste your money. Listening to this album is like listening to the loud whirring of fan blades chop the air. Almost every song sounds the same. There is really not much diversity lyrically, melodically, or even beat wise. The only song that could redeem Drake to his former self is \\"Hyfr\\" in my opinion. I like Drake when he raps, he's definitely clever, puts u at pause for a minute. BUT, Drake barely raps on this album. Like I said, glad I only paid 99 cents.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like it. its a good app when your bored and just want to waste some time. some of the games kinds stink though.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun little games to waste time with. I personally like the progressive unlock of new games and the variety of games.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Learning to play the game took a little getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, it is fun. At first, I couldn't figure out why I could move certain blocks of cards but not others.  It is very limiting, but therein lies the challenge!  Love the challenge of figuring it out.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Games are fun but a little frustrating at times. You have to play games yo earn points and these points are used to unlock other games. I just started playing them but I'm liking them.
0062197258|5.0|WHAT IT IS ABOUT: This book has two timelines. In one (2007/2008) we encounter a young woman, Cathy Bailey, who is obviously very traumatised by something that happened to her in the past. As a result of this, she has developed Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. She checks her apartment for signs of disturbance when she arrives home and makes sure to leave it in a certain state when leaving again. Because she can't be sure she really did a proper check, she may check up to six times to be absolutely sure. She spends a lot of time on this, and doesn't have a social life, until she meets her new upstairs neighbour Stuart, who she feels safe with. He  pushes her to find help for her illness.<br /><br />The other timeline (2003/2004) sees Catherine as a very outgoing young woman, spending way too much nights out on the town. Life is one big celebration. When she meets Lee Brightman, they fall in love and slowly but certainly, she falls under his spell. But he turns out to have a violent side, which is slowly uncovered. And during the story, we find out what he did to Catherine to make her into an OCD patient.<br /><br />In the current time (2008), Lee is released from prison, just as Cathy is getting less anxious about life...<br /><br />MY VIEW: This was not a thrilling thriller, but a very good read! I was never about to \\"check the locks on [my] doors and windows [...]\\" as Karin Slaughter suggests on the front cover. Nonsense! When, finally, Cathy does have something real to worry about, she's become such a strong person that she isn't all that scared any more, and with her, neither was I. That doesn't mean there aren't any scary moments in the book, there were, but I never wanted to hide under the covers.<br /><br />I found Cathy's OCD very believable and extremely fascinating. The idea that someone knows what they're doing is nonsensical but not being able to stop themselves. Spending hours upon hours checking that her flat is safe, getting exhausted from all this and still not being able to give up. It's amazing that someone would do that.<br /><br />I was surprised that Cathy was happy to accept her new neighbour as a person she could trust. I think I'd be paranoid about everyone that I didn't know. I'm still not sure if this was a flaw in the story, or whether it was very well possible that someone like Cathy would accept her neighbour as a (kind of) friend. Whether she was right to trust him, you need to find out for yourself!<br /><br />The book was built up very well. First we don't know all that much about what happened in the past, but bit by bit more of Lee's behaviour is revealed and it becomes clear why Cathy is so scared of him. In the current time, it's great to follow Cathy and I hoped she would recover from her illness to the point where it didn't control her whole life. And of course, as a reader you hope Lee won't find her and/or some other nasty man will repeat history with Cathy.<br /><br />Not a thriller, but a very good read.

B007XU0N1G|4.0|After Rhapsody Of Fire was separated in two bands, Luca Turilli went on to create quickly Luca Turilli's Rhapsidy, keeping still his trademark and style of cinematic, symphonic, power and fantasy Metal.  The new singer is almost similar to Fabio Lione in range which makes the experience comfortable and the transition smooth.  This has to be one of Luca Turilli's greatest albums.<br /><br />1) Quantum X - this is an introduction of things to come.  The sound is as always, epic and full of splendor.<br /><br />2) Ascending To Infinity - nice beginning, fast and powerful.  The vocals are great in this one, so clear and energetic, even the chorus shines along with it.  The guitars and the keyboards play a strong role here.  A good way to start things.  5/5<br /><br />3) Dante's Inferno - dramatic beginning, very suspenseful.  I love the vocals and chorus in the first two minutes, they are haunting, beautiful and full of impact - really showing the intensity and mysticism of the Dante's Inferno classic.  There's a decent solo almost at the end, things finish with the repetition of the chorus.  Cool song.  5/5<br /><br />4) Excalibur - cool intro, fantasy-like and medieval.  Things then get very serious and intense, the listener will know that this is a neat way to pay tribute to the Excalibur legend.  The lyrics are breathtaking.  The tempo is uplifting and royal, this is one the greatest songs in the album.  5/5<br /><br />5) Tormento e Passione - the intro is really quick and catches the listener off guard.  Both vocals work nicely in this one, there's this opera-like emotion around.  The melody is soothing yet it never seems to let go.  Good song full of passion and serenity, a good choice to calm things after three strong songs.  4/5<br /><br />6) Dark Fate of Atlantis - mystic and suspenseful intro.  The song itself has cool lyrics, the melody is fast and beautifully chilling.  The vocals are a bit more dramatic here, which sell well the tragedy expressed in the lyrics.  The chorus is absolutely perfect, the solo is great, swift and fluid.  Another favorite of mine.  5/5<br /><br />7) Luna - this is a cover song.  The melody is soft and a bit touching, the vocals are a little similar to song 5 in terms of opera.  3/5<br /><br />8) Clash of The Titans - the intro reflects the problems of today, it's evident with the sirens, etc.  The melody is fast, but it's more progressive than in other songs (in my view) - the vocals and chrous are full of energy and rage.  5/5<br /><br />9) Of Michael the Archangel and Lucifer's Fall - the intro is soft and mysterious, the listener knows that this is the band's epic song, so things will change in time.  Almost at 3 minutes things get wild, the melody is nicely abrupt and the chorus is haunting.  There's the typical power and symphonic, but there's a slice of progressive to make things more interesting.  The use of keyboards is great in this song.  At ten minutes, the melody is so odd yet captivating, a truly work of art.  Awesome song.  5/5<br /><br />*Songs March of Time and In The Mirror (which are covers), are great songs as well, they are Rhapsody-ed, listen to them if you have the chance*<br /><br />One of the greatest albums of 2012
0062082353|5.0|I must comment on this from the perspective of a father trying to understand the experience of his son, recently returned from Afghanistan.  I found this narrative, written in the first person by both soldier and wife very helpful.  I now understand, as I couldn't before some of what my son felt and thought as he was in combat.  I understand better the evil that our soldiers are fighting and how that must color their thinking.  I also appreciated the story as told by his wife and how she was affected.  I can better encourage my son and his family from this understanding<br /><br />It is short sighted to judge this book as a technical narrative.  This is a personal story, I am sure told at great emotional expense and gives insight into the struggles our soldiers and their families must deal with.  It also shows that these trials can be overcome and one can become a better person through the struggle.<br /><br />This book was recommended to me by a former Marine and I think all family members of our servicemen should read this book.  We would all be the better for it.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|To describe this book as anything other than a disappointment would be misleading. It was \\"OK\\" - hence the three stars - but compared to The Hunger Games and Catching Fire it was a total let down.<br /><br />The author must have been under some deadline to get this book done because the entire thing felt rushed and poorly put together. The main character showed very little personal growth as she came to terms with her new surroundings, and I became frustrated by her inability to realize the obvious. The entire time I was reading Mockingjay, I held onto the hope that the climax would make it all worth it.<br /><br />It didn't.<br /><br />A story that started with such promise instead ended with a cop-out by the author in a rush to finish the book. You remember the back story and plot development leading up to the end? Well it takes the author all of ten pages to take a sharp right turn and end the tale abruptly. I almost wish that Suzanne Collins would write a fourth book that starts with Katniss waking up inside the Capitol with the realization that the last 150 pages were just a terrible dream she had.<br /><br />Fans of the series could easily skip this book and wait for the movie, but they won't. My only hope is that the screenwriters will craft the Mockingjay story in a way that is far more compelling and interesting than the author allowed it to be.
B002BU0DPE|2.0|These babies have been worked hard, but breaking after only 7 months is not acceptable.  The plastic near the ear piece (non-mic side) has broken, which results with it just hanging.

Email sent to Turtle Beach to check on their warranty, but I don't expect them to replace the headset.

B0058YPG1G|5.0|OMG!!!!  This is the best program and series I have seen in years!!!!  You have to see it from season 1 though.  The characters are evolving and there are many things based on previous events that give more meaning to what happens.  I can not say enough wonderful things about this series.  There is a surprise around every corner and I can't wait for season 5 to begin July 15th!!!!!!!!!!!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I'm constantly changing my village based on different goals, so its holding my interest longer than most other games.  I may look into city planning as an alternate career after this!
B0063GORYU|4.0|Good thinking game<br />this game I would recommend to any and everyone that likes thinking strategy card games. or you want to just use your mind a little more.
B007I2BZIE|3.0|Best album since Test For Echo.  (My favorite of their 90's work).<br /><br />My fave tracks.. \\"The Wreckers\\", \\"Wish Them Well\\", \\"The Garden\\" (one of their prettiest songs), and \\"Caravan\\".  There are actually some SONGS here... something I felt lacking on 'Vapor Trails' and 'Snakes & Arrows'.  It is a challanging listen at time, so recommend listening to it a few times before judging (if you are a Rush fan).  If you are new to Rush, you are much better off starting elsewhere.  But if you give a chance, songs like the \\"Wreckers\\" will be stuck in your head for some time.<br /><br />Biggest negative to me is the mastering\mixing of the CD.  That's a big negative unfortunately.  It's just a loud mix.  Levels for all instruments are maxed out, so you lose any warmth and most of the dynamics of the album.  Just sounds muddy.  A LOT of others have mentioned it here.<br /><br />I find myself listening to it a relatively low volume in my car, which seems to help the sound to my ear.<br /><br />I wonder if the vinyl version sounds better?
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|well the game has came a long way hence befit they just made the game with nothing and now they make better games earasers pillows blankets shirts etc
074356619X|5.0|I love the CDs!! I am able to drive and listen to The Secret over and over. I Love to hear positive words all day.<br />This is a must to purchase! IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE - HERE IS THE PERFECT GUIDE!
B003U0I9U0|5.0|This is one of the best compilation albums I have seen. All the big hits are represented (e.g. Take On Me, Sun Always Shines on TV, Living Daylights, Crying in the Rain, Summer Moved On) but, more importantly, a lot of lesser known gems are also included as well (Never a Forever Thing, Dark is the Night for All, Angel in the Snow). Lots of great remixes and a brand new song to boot!

B0067QPVJ6|3.0|I can understand why many reviews are comparing this movie against earlier versions as it's a prequel. However, I have never seen the original, and I don't remember Carpenter's version very well. With that said, i'm going to review this movie on it's own merit.<br /><br />The plot is not the most intricate, but keeps the viewer engaged, and drives the movie like a good plot should. The acting is also pretty goood. The problem with this movie is that it relies on overdone action scenes and alot of CGI. There is a strong enough plot here to drive the movie with pure suspense. While the CGI was good, I kinda wish they would have showed 'The Thing' less. All in all, a worthwhile watch if it happens to be on TV. If nothing else, it has sparked my curiosity about the Kurt Russel version as I remember liking it.
B00846TTDG|5.0|This was an excellent movie.  Some are whining about the acting.  You're right, the acting is poor, it's more like REAL people carrying on conversations.  Many people know very little of what has been spilt for this country...so you can go watch some silly movie with some great acting.  Keeping this short (I hate those long boring reviews), this is a movie well worth watching.
B006P96PAO|5.0|every family should get this video.  Especially great for all men.  Should be required for men before marriage.  Great marriage counseling advice.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|BIG A +++ the book is right to the point no bs just the information you need to get where you want to be. I would recommend this big to any one.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I bought this book when I first read that John Locke had become the first Indie author to sell 1 million novels. I've recently re-read it and realised just how relevant and achievable his techniques are. I thought it full of useful and practical tips and was surprised at the number of one star reviews it's received. Anyone who's sold 1 million anything deserves better. Maybe his critics are forgetting this is a book primarily about marketing a book not how to write a book?<br />Personally I'd recommend it to any author whether Indie or not, and indeed any marketer or any entrepreneur in the modern age.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00MDSM1PY The Magpie Murders - Omnibus Edition]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00ESIVR3O Jane Hetherington's Adventures in Detection Omnibus (Books 1-3)]]

B0054JZC6E|5.0|Our whole family plays.  It can be highly addictive and some are very difficult to beat. Hours and hours of fun!
1579128149|4.0|Most of the information in the book is trivial, and the book is encyclopedic in nature, each element gets an entry. What I love about the book is that it has great pictures. This book is awesome for kids who are curious and it provides a gateway into chemistry. As a science teacher I like to have it on the shelf so when they are done with all their assignments they have something to read that will raise questions about what they are learning or make them more interested in the practical applications of chemistry. Mind you some will just open the book because of the amazing pictures, graphics, and layout. It is reader friendly for anyone out of middle school, perfect for high school kids, and even adults might enjoy it. Buy this book, even if it just sits on a coffee table or bookshelf, it is not just encyclopedic information, it is art. (I didn't give it five stars because for a as heavy as it is it should be hardbound, but its not. They use heavy paper which should not be paperback).
B00005N6KG|5.0|I have now had the Sony Ultra Lightweight headphones now for about 2 weeks and I exercise brutally with them each and every day! I go to the track and run and they dont fall out, I will jump rope for thirty minutes without them falling out! And the sound quality in the headphones are AMAZING it seriously feels like Im listening to music from Dre Beats! I have never been so impressed with headphones, if you are \\"thinking\\" about buying this BUY them trust me you wont go wrong for such a good price and such great quality! BUY IT!!!!!
B002SRQ214|4.0|Great CPU, works like a charm and easy to install. My only complaint would be the fan that comes with the processor, which is extremely noisy.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is good for passing time no matter where your at. a plus is the kids love it as we'll.

0143121316|5.0|As a Chinese who have spent 21 years in China I would say this is a rather illuminating book. It reveals some historical facts and their influences I was not aware of. Also I am getting a better understanding of how Americans are looking at China and the foreign policies. Surely he seems to show too much respect for Mao's actions but his analysis about more recent leaders and events are really insightful. In a modern world filled with superficial media coverage it is really beneficial to read a book like this and reflect.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I can not wear the little earbuds because they always fall out of my ears when I run and some other models of this style are too big for my head or too bulky. These are absolutely perfect. They are lightweight, they stay put, they sound great and are everything I need in a headphone. I have been using this particular model for years. I do replace them about every 6 months (one side always goes out). Worth it for the money though. Also, purchasing on Amazon was much cheaper than paying for these in a retail store.
034580404X|5.0|I have just finished all three of the Fifty Shades Of Grey books and they were wonderful. The third book is the best because it has more action and story plot. The first two books have a lot of in detail sex and that is pretty much what they are about but still a very good read. Definately not for children.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|This is a solid, well built and sturdy monitor arm. As others have noted, don't expect to move this often. It is designed to lock in one place, maybe rotate from side to side but thats it. Right now it is holding my Acer 20\\" monitor with no problems. It took a while to setup and get it \\"just right\\" but now that it's in place, there are no problems! I use it on a drafting table and it's not especially tall, about 11\\" from tabletop to the bottom of the monitor. However, with all the adjustments, aesthetics and build quality, it is well worth the money.
0307477479|5.0|This book turned out to be a page turner.  I wasn't sure it woud be for me, but after 60 pages, I could not put it down.  It was a fun and interesting summer read.
B0042J6VUS|3.0|You can't expect much from a product that only costs a couple of dollars. For the price this product was alright. It is made out of cheap plastic and the tripod isn't very sturdy. That was to be expected though. Overall this item is alright for the price. It does the job however I know there is many better products out there that are similar to this.
0765316994|1.0|I had read Old Man's War and its sequels and liked them a lot. I purchased this novel without waiting for the reviews and didn't know it was supposed to be a comedy. That being said, I hated this book. I hated it so much that I had to write my first ever online book review. Maybe I can spare others from buying this stinking garbage.<br /><br />I'd say spoiler coming up, but anything this rotten is far past its sell-by date already.  The premise is that the lives of the crew of a starship in the far future are controlled by the script writers of a cable TV show in the early 21st century.  The starship's characters are right out of the original Star Trek.  The non-stars of the show (i.e. Redshirts) are killed off at an alarming rate.  The Redshirts figure out that they must be living out the dreams of a 21st century script writer, go back in time using admittedly impossible physics, convince the writers and producer not to kill them in any future episodes, and go back to the future where they live happily ever after.<br /><br />The Not-Star-Trek crew are flat and lifeless.  The story is internally inconsistent, with the physics of the universe warping around the main characters.  I had to force myself to get to the end of the main part of the book.  I couldn't stomach the coda's. The writing was lame, the premise comes off as just stupid, and the only joke here is on anybody dumb enough to pay for this book.
0385342063|5.0|I have read everything Sophie Kinsella has published and I have to say, I love her more and more with each book I read. I absolutely adored the characters in this book. It has been a LONG time since I have stayed up all night to finish a book, but it was worth every extra cup of coffee today!
B0083SBMBM|1.0|First of all the movie is great, one of the best I have ever seen. It is how the movie is being released that I have a problem with. The DVD comes with a lot extra features while the DVD release comes with almost none, not even the deleted scenes. I was looking foreward to seeing the deleted scenes. This is not fair. If I buy the movie I want the full movie, including the scenes that were cut. They are just trying to get more money out of you. If they can put it on the Blu-ray then they should put it on the DVD as well. I should not be punished because I do not have a Blu-ray player.
159514188X|1.0|The premise of this book is good.The actual story was weak. The only sympathy I have for the heroine in this book is the fact that she is mentally ill and in need of medication and intensive inpatient therapy. The book only touches on the fact that her parents do not pay any attention to her. She blames the kids at school for her decision to take her own life. By making audiotapes and sending them to any person who committed even the slightest injustice, is the ultimate vindictive act.<br />The book does not make it clear enough for a teenager to understand the gist of the story. I don't know if the average teenager would understand that the girl is the one to blame for her actions. If they read this book and side with the girl, then this book gives a very dangerous message. I understand that yes, you should be nice to everyone but using a girl for a ride to a party or standing her up for a date should not cause her to give up hope and want to end it all.<br />The book also did not show clearly, all the ways that this girl invited some of the problems that she had. If she suspected that the boy wanted to grope her in the ice cream shop, don't sit on the inside of a booth and when he touches you, say firmly to stop, not stare into your cup and then whisper \\"why are you doing that?\\" Come on.<br />Most girls would understand that when someone is outside your bedroom window taking pictures, you don't just say \\"oh poor me\\" and dress under your blanket. You would call the police.<br />She definitely had self esteem issues and very poor coping mechanisms. I wish the book would have explained that better.
0345803485|1.0|This is the most terrible book on the planet, I'm quite sure.  And that is why this B.S. fan-fiction \\"author\\" is making what, $1.4 mil per week on it?  Yikes.  This book is awful from start to finish.  Christian is fine, sure.  Sexy and rich, with a big d**k, of course.  But wouldn't you think his standards would be higher?  I mean, really?  He goes for some waify middle-road, lip-biting NOTHING????  bleh.<br /><br />I suggest she goes back to school and gets away from fan-fiction, which is in and of itself, a literary cop-out.  Make up your own stories.  God, I hated this book.  And I wish I could get back the 20 minutes I spent reading it.
B007XNAPNY|5.0|I was fortunate enough to catch Duran Duran on the All You Need Is Now tour last fall, and I can tell you first hand that if you are a fan, then this performance is a must have.<br /><br />Its incredible that thirty years after the New Wave explosion, Duran Duran has released what is probably the best album of their career, next to Rio of course. They are one of my favorite bands, but even I have to admit that as much as half their discography is unlistenable due to the changes that major labels forced upon the band's sound.<br /><br />If you ever doubted the validity, creativity, and strength of Duran Duran, then A Diamond In The Mind will prove you wrong. The energy and flawless delivery of their early performances are all here, packed with a diverse selection of tunes, a lot of which come from the new record.<br /><br />Do you realize that as I write this review, Duran Duran are STILL on the same tour for this release?!? They have been touring for almost two years and still have some shows lined up for the end of the year. This is an incredible feat for a young band, but for a group of posh guys in their 50's, that is just unheard of. Very proud to be a life-long Duran Duran fan, especially now that the band is back and better than ever.<br /><br />I only wish they would have put Tiger Tiger on here as that was the most atmospheric track they played live on this tour and I love the lighting they used for it.<br /><br />Cheers!
034580404X|3.0|Ok, I am way too old to appreciate that 3 volumes of sex 3 to 4 times a day x 1800 pages without much other content are worth $30 or the time spent reading them. Book 3 took about 5 minutes, scanning quickly to see if anything of value was to be uncovered (so to speak), but nada.<br /><br />Back to my less kinky reading endeavors.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|My favorite thing about this story is how blunt the characters are. There are no games in Hazel and Augustus's relationship. There was not a hint of cheesiness in their encounters and they are both very unique characters. You can't help but fall in love with the both of them. It is extremely different from your normal depressing cancer stories. I'd recommend this book to anyone and everyone who's open to it.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This is a great little sharpener. Very small and compact, yet has everything you need to get a decent edge back on any knife or tool. You are not going to get a knife scary razor sharp, but great for a pocket or in your pack sharpener.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|it is the best program to keep and organize notes! I wish that I had this software when I was in college!
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|I really like this game but there should be a way to zoom in on a scene as some items are too small to see.  also the items are at times hard to click exactly on them &amp; you get a 20 second penalty pretty quickly.  Aside from those 2 things the game is fun &amp; easy enjoy over &amp; over.
1936608898|5.0|I bought ISWF shortly after starting Whole30 and found the content of the book exceptionally helpful to understanding WHY the challenge has you remove certain foods from your diet. The science-y explanations of the logic behind the Whole30 plan were wonderful and were re-emphasized with analogies to make it even easier to understand.<br /><br />However, the biggest thing I took away and learned with this book was about having a relationship with food, and how certain foods can stimulate hormonal responses that can make you essentially addicted. I still am amazed at how much of an affect food has - I'm not sure why, after all it totally makes sense! But, it definitely does start with food and I highly recommend this book. In fact, after raving about it with family my mom & sister each got the book too.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just finished reading Wool Omnibus by Hugh Howey.  The story is well written and engaging.  The characters were well drawn and I liked getting to know them.  As I became involved in the story, I felt the emotions of the characters and walked with them into elation, fear, despair and joy.  This is one of the best books I have read for quite a while.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is the best game ever super fun love it is the second best gameloft village game Oregon trail is the best
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Bought the first book mostly because of all the hype and after I had read about 100 pages(?) I deleted it from My Kindle.<br />What an upsetting and degrading book for women. I thought we had put female bondage and male domination in their proper places many years ago.<br />The sales of these books seem to be saying that women everywhere are searching for \\"love at any cost\\" and I guess they are finding it in the porn of these books.
B007SGM084|1.0|I have to agree with the other 2 reviews.  This is certainly too high a price for the kindle edition.  I would love to read these books, but am also not willing to spend that much for a digital copy.  Usually kindle is much cheaper then the tangible book.  I realize its a popular series, but we already paid quite a bit of money for the kindle itself, AND, there are other popular series that are not as expensive.  Until the price goes down, I'm sorry to say I wont be purchasing this.
B007SGM084|5.0|I couldn't put these books down!!!! I read the entire trilogy in one week! Captivatingly delicious treat!! I have never read a book that provoked such depth of emotions...I look forward to more from this author.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I read this book because of all the hype about it and was very disappointed.  The writing was not very good.  It was repetetive and a very weak plot.  Not what I was expecting at all.
0345803485|1.0|This sort of book is not my genre. It is overblown media manipulation feeding on the \\"liberated\\" woman's misconceptions about female liberation.<br />After being annoyed by a friend incessantly to give it a chance, I gave in. I got through 40 pages, each on like nails being driven across a chalkboard before I knew I couldn't take another page without my gorge reinventing itself in unpleasant ways.<br />The characters are insipid. The writing is mediocre. The heroine is a simpering imbecile, and that Gray fellow may  just as well be a Penis strapped to a male as the male character has the depth of a zucchini.<br />This is one of the finest examples of media manipulation of the television suckling public I've EVER had the displeasure to witness.<br />Meanwhile all the fine books, the unique books, the books that involved effort and critical thinking besides an author's self indulgent mental masturbation, are being lost in this generation of malleable idiots.
B007ZBWJXI|4.0|If judging a 5-star review as the original album, then this is certainly a 4-star album.  11 tracks of which only 3 I don't care for, similar to Omega.  I'd rank this album alongside that one, keeping up the decent standard of the post-Payne era revival.  Say what you like about the argument as to whether Asia is better with Payne or Wetton, my preference is clearly for Wetton.  The songs are stronger, catchier and Wetton's voice blows Payne's out of the water.<br /><br />Tomorrow The World begins quietly, a departure from the usual Wetton-era albums, but its not unpleasant.  Then suddenly bursts into rocky life and is a great start to the album.  Reminiscent of Finger on the Trigger as far as the general beat goes.  I also like one of the lines that uses a Shakespeare-style twist to a phrase.<br />Bury Me In Willow is one of those songs that can only be described as beautiful.  Wonderfully crafted and composed.  Not a really outstanding track to me as one or two of the others but beautiful nonetheless.  And a perfect foil for what comes next.<br />What can you say about No Religion?  OMG.  Steve Howe's power chords.  A head-nodding foot-tapping number so reminiscent of the 80s.  I love it.  Alright, alright, so part of it sounds like Blue Oyster Cult.  So what?  This knocks Don't Fear the Reaper out of the way.<br />Faithful.  Um.  Too similar to the bland pap of the middle part of Phoenix.  Don't like it.<br />I Know How You Feel.  Not this version, no.  I think the keyboards are a little too irritating.  It doesn't do it for me anyway.<br />Face On The Bridge.  One of those slow burners.  Wasn't sure about it when I first heard it but now, yes its a good one.  Runs smoothly.  I did wonder why he mentioned the King of Bohemia but then when I watched the DvD that comes with this version I got it.  I've been on the Charles Bridge too, and it is beautiful.<br />Al Gatto Nero.  Spooky, this.  We have a cat called Nero.  Al Gatto = The Cat.  No!  Surely not!  Of course it means The Black Cat (Nero isn't black, by the way).  Love the song.  Oh what a gutsy start.  The only weak bit is the chorus but I can live with that.<br />Judas.  Not bad.  Fairly good.  Good guitars.  It doesn't quite reach out and grab me hard like No Religion or Al Gatto Nero but a nice album track nontheless.<br />Reno.  Rubbish.  Bonus track?  Bin it.  Payne standard.<br />Ghost of A Chance.  Haunting.  Wasn't too sure at first but its grown on me.  Yes, one to keep on the old iPod.<br />I Know How You Feel (Midnight Mix).  Now i do like this version.  Its atmospheric and comes without that Supertramp irritating falsetto keyboard sound.  Good song.<br /><br />The only thing I'd moan about is that it didn't end with a really great track like Alpha or Asia did.  I'd like to see the guys insist with Frontier Records in future they do.  And also like all Asia albums its a little too polished and over produced.  Asia are far better live.  I'm going to see them this coming December and cannot wait.it means The Black Cat (Nero isn't black, by the way).  Love the song.  Oh what a gutsy start.

B0077SGMXM|5.0|As stated, this game is very fun and a nice challenge. Freezes sometimes but not really a big deal. Also even though this game allows in-app content purchasing, it is completely possible to beat the game and enjoy without real money. Money buys golf bucks which can be used to buy extra powerups during play or unlock powerups faster. Not necessary and takes away the challenge anyway. Would recommend.

0345803485|5.0|This series is so breath taking! I loved reading them! I soo hope there are other books that will add to this series! I feel there is much more to be learned regarding the new baby and Christian's softening heart for his wife and family
0765316994|4.0|I enjoyed Redshirts.  Its funny and meta, it lovingly satirizes old sci-fi tropes but its a stretched out running joke.  Its smart and well written.  There are a few areas where it gets self-consciously meta and I expected there to be some lengthier examinations of some of the metaphysical consequences of the concepts at play in the novel.. but I've been reading a lot of Philip K Dick lately and he does that sort of thing.
B002RKSZKI|5.0|The download was quick. This story looks great on my kindle. I am so glad to have purchased this item!
B0018OASZE|5.0|There is nothing bad to say about this album! Adele is my favorite female singer around. There is no one like her, now or ever. I bought this album for my fiance on our anniversary because it has our song we will dance to on our wedding day. Her voice is out of this world. Adele fans will not be disappointed.

B004NDVJWI|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this album!! It sounds so much more grown-up than their previous albums, as it should because these guys are no longer teenagers. Some of the songs are a bit more dance club hits, while others are more laid back romantic type. My absolute favorite songs are \\"I'll be your man\\" and \\"I need a woman\\"!! Those two songs definitely put off a grown-up vibe. Tom's voice hits notes we haven't heard much of before, and although it might take some getting used to, it is definitely something amazing. This album is a must have for true fans of McFly who aren't afraid of their more current and grown-up sounds.
0143038583|1.0|Not a speck of good data or a study to validate argument. It can be used as a good discussion book because it is so lacking students would learn from dissecting it. Otherwise, skip it.
B007CIQ4B2|5.0|As someone who appreciates well crafted musicianship from serious singer/songwriters, Ben Howard is now near the very top of my list along side David Gray, Nick Drake, Fink and the John Butler Trio. And you'll hear slight influences of all of them in this album. I can't remember the last time an album literally transported me into another realm.<br /><br />\\"Hot sand on toes, cold sand in sleeping bags,<br />I've come to know that memories<br />Were the best things you ever had<br />The summer shone beat down on bony backs<br />So far from home where the ocean stood<br />Down dust and pine cone tracks\\"<br /><br />You can smell the ocean air and feel the pine cones beneath your bare feet. I played this album in the background while I worked and found I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing, I kept drifting off to the ocean, the woods, teenage memories of camping out with friends who you would eventually lose touch with. It's simply an outstanding collection of songs.<br /><br />It took me hours to get to the last track because I kept replaying the first three songs. This album will remain in my playlist for many months to come. And at only 23 years old, I can't even fathom how Ben's music will evolve in the coming years.<br /><br />Buy two copies of this album and send one to that old friend you used to camp on the beach with, the one you lost touch with so long ago.
B00884GR0W|5.0|Its okay and fun but not minecraft. It is a smaller and cheaper version. $5 seems a little bit overpriced for me. lower maybe a dollar or two and I might buy
B0018QOIXU|1.0|it was ok i like it i gave it to my son he love it he play it all the time
B007IXWL2C|5.0|this was overall a great series, a good trilogy, definitely recommend this book. The story line was well defined and has a series of surprised events that takes the readers through an emotional roller coaster and makes you want to continue reading more.
0345803507|3.0|There are different aspects about this book that I liked and then really didn't like.<br />The underlying plot in all three books is absolutely awesome. I'm a sucker for the typical troubled and haunted alpha male falling for the beautiful and innocent heroine. That part of the book was done well and thought through perfectly.<br /><br />Character wise, Christian is absolutely captivating. He's domineering and bossy, but that changes in an instant, and all of a sudden he's sweet and caring. That doesn't really bother me as much as the fact that every time it happens, she just says \\"oh, my Fifty\\" or \\"My Mr. Mercurial\\" and that's all she calls him. She never gets in his face about how moody he is and how he's behaving like a two year old- she just lets him get away with it. That said, I read the whole trilogy in two days, so it kind of seems like it's all one book to me. It was convenient because what happened probably could have been fit into one book... but either way, all of Christian's personal transformations/revelations were perfect and heart breaking at times. There is real depth to him and Ana. She's just a bit too whiny I think. But she does redeem herself a bit in this book compared to the first two.<br /><br />Execution is where I find a real problem with these books. Overall I enjoyed them. It's definitely worth the read. But there are a few flaws in the dialogue that take away form the rest of it. I understand they're newlyweds so at first its cute and flirty how they call each other Mr. and Mrs. Grey. I think it's adorable. But after this happening for half of the book, it gets on my nerves. They do have real names, you know. There's nothing really major wrong with the execution and writing style, but it's just the little things that bother me. The three phrases that are repeatedly continuously:<br />1. \\"Stop biting your lip, you know what it does to me.\\" (this is in ALL three books. Almost every chapter. I don't understand. Is Christian only with Ana because he has a fixation with her lips?)<br />2. \\"Laters, baby.\\" (at first that's cute... but it's over used by the second book- I can't believe she put it in the 3rd one too)<br />3. and Ana constantly talks about her \\"Inner Goddess\\" to the point where I almost threw the book across the room.<br /><br />It's also not as R-rated as previous reviews make it out to be. As a long time reader of everything romance, nothing in these books was overly shocking or too rough in my opinion. It's definitely not a book that you give to someone as a introduction to romance but it's not as heavy as some of the stuff out there.<br /><br />If you like romance and alpha males, the Fifty Shades trilogy is something you'd be interested in! (if you're a tolerant reader who can look past a few mistakes)
B006LSZECO|5.0|The creepy factor alone makes this a FABULOUS read. This is the first book I picked up this summer and couldn't put it down. I was so sure I had it all figured out, when a major twist occurred, and then when I figured it out again...NOPE! I was totally wrong again! This book is a great study into the mind of a true sociopath and the commentary on parenting is not hard to miss. I loved this book. I don't often hope for a sequel, but I am for this one.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|i love it i play it all the time Adel is a very  good singer and you know she love sing
0345803485|4.0|I got this book, honestly, because of all the hype.  I actually paused when I discovered what Christian's...appetites were, and took a minute to decide if I wanted to read further.  Glad I did.  I managed to finish all three books during the course of a 5 day vacation.  I have to admit to getting restless and bored through most of Ana's inner monologues, though her inner Goddess made me laugh out loud a number of times.  And the sex even got tiring, primarily because there was so much of it, and the author seemed to run out of ways to describe what Ana was feeling, so she was much too repetitive (though the individual acts were largely far from repetitive).  At the heart of the books is a love story - a twisted love story perhaps, but a love story nonetheless.  The characters were both frustrating and engaging.  I found Fifty Shades to be an entertaining, somewhat insightful page-turner, and could not wait to download the second book.  It was a great beach read.<br /><br />If you are at all squeamish about BDSM and detailed descriptions of sex, then simply don't read the book.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love it! i play it everyday! i love getting money! creating the families are so much fun! playing the paranah game is my absolute favorite!
B0077SGMXM|5.0|This game is super addictive and totally fun!!! I can play a round in about 7 minutes, perfect for a quick break. I was never much of a golfer but I love practicing the challenging shot line ups and angles :)
B0024RIMBG|5.0|After releasing many more DVDs, this one remains the best DVD from Celtic Woman.I enter into a state of musical bliss and complete satisfaction after watching the full DVD - each time! Buy this DVD and it is sure to make the best DVD among any music lovers collection.
B007D2XSW0|3.0|One of the better photo editors available (along with aviary and snaptastic).  It's main failing is that you can't select a photo from your gallery and &quot;share to...&quot; the app for quick editing. Instead you open the app and pull a photo to it *from* your gallery.  This is backwards from my normal work flow. The effects are merely ok, (instagrams are far better) but the ability to use a slide to apply more or less of an effect is nice. Needs white balance adjustment.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|To me, a great director is someone who just tells the story and keeps your attention throughout the movie. Winter's Bone is such a film. Nothing fancy, just the story. This is a bleak but excellent film. I couldn't believe all the negative customer reviews. People are such morons! Jennifer Lawrence's performance just blew me away. The rest of the stellar cast wasn't bad either. This film held my attention to the very end. Very very good, I really loved it.
0345803485|1.0|I managed to get through the trilogy trying to understand what all they hype is about and let me tell you that this series exactly that - hype.  With all the media attention surrounding this series, I would not waste your time or money reading this series.  As the negative reviews pointed out, it is poorly written with the same metaphors used repeatedly through all three books.  In addition, the BDSM theme is really underplayed here so there is not much to be shocked about.<br /><br />I, myself, enjoy erotic romance novels and have read different styles of erotic prose that really tantalize and illict a response from the reader.  Fifty Shades of Grey and its next two volumes did nothing for me but bore me to tears.  I got so annoyed with bombardment of too many sex scenes that I ended up skimming through the majority of the series hoping to find some semblace of a plot and discovered it had none.  Furthermore, I found the characters one dimensional with no substance or development whatsoever.<br /><br />The basic premise involves a damaged control freak hero with Mommy issues seducing some innocent, virginal emotional damsel in distress and that bascially sums up the series.  There's real no conflict here except for how much sex and whether or not it can progress more into other extreme forms of BDSM behavior.  At one point, I was hoping for a plot twist for the protagonist to take more of the dominant role in the relationship in the end but that never did happened.  I finally finished all three books still unfazed by all the hooplah surrounding it.<br /><br />In short, pass on this series.  It simply borrows elements of 9 1/2 Weeks and the film Secretary.  You're better off reading other authors who are more experienced in writing erotica on Amazon.
0393088774|5.0|This book is a great introduction to our current economic problems, how they originated and what can really be done to solve them. It is written for a general audience, and doesn't require a background in economics or monetary policy. Krugman is not hesitant about telling you what he thinks about the purported solutions put forward by those who approach the problems with an almost religious zeal, but not much attention to the actual data about what has been going on for the past 60 years or so.<br /><br />The book is an easy read and presents a realistic way of thinking about what we should be doing to get out of our mess. Too bad those in power, and that includes the leaders of both political parties, have not been paying attention to what is really needed.
1250004217|5.0|I have to give this book five stars as it was a watershed book for me.  Once in a very long while I've come across a book that seems to speak to me personally, and this one did.  I am not Jewish or French but the human angst and the palpable tragedy got into my head and allowed me to see things more clearly.  The book is about the tragic incident in the summer of 1942 when Jews in France were rounded up by their own police and taken to a huge arena where they were were piled in enormous numbers with little food and water.  Families were separated and were sent en-masse to Auschwitz to the gas chambers. It is such a tragic story and it tore my heart to read about this, but even more so, it shows the horrendous damage caused by secrets of this magnitude.  Families, both French and French Jewish, were touched by this event. The secret was kept and the actual events were blocked out and never discussed again by the French families that saw this happen.  Survivors of the Holocaust were forced to do the same thing-bury the secret and never speak of it again.  A toll was taken on many survivor's lives from which many never recovered. Family secrets are insidious and very damaging to all family members and descendents.  Sarah's Key shows this like no other book I've ever read.  It pulls at your heart strings, and draws a lot of emotion out as you read it.  This is a book that should be read by anybody who wants a clearer understanding of the Holocaust and the human toll that it caused.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I was thoroughly impressed with this book.  The story was told in a manner that added just enough suspense.  The pace was fast enough to keep it moving but took time needed for character development.  The writing style was mature and refined - too often authors have good stories to tell, but it is presented so simplistically I feel like I'm reading a work meant for 10 yr old reading level and lose interest.  I have not read too many books recently that I feel I would not only enjoy, but also get more out of a second reading.  I feel that way about this book.
159562015X|4.0|I received this book in good shape. It had no marks or highlighting in it and was not scuffed up almost like a new book. I received it promptly. I'm very satisfied.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is a very excited game with a great theme just like Indiana Jones.  its a a a a amazing!!!!!!!
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Can't wait for season 5 to be available to buy!  Despite Weeds having a similar theme, Breaking Bad takes the plot to a completely new plane.
0345803507|5.0|Excellent read.  Engaging and captivating characters involved in this enticing story with lots of \\"exciting\\" moments.  Keeps you wanting more and more.  EL James really brings it!!
0446572993|4.0|Baldacci has had some ups and downs since his early work. The Innocent is certainly one of the ups. This is an entertaining fast thriller, with twists and surprises. The set of characters is refreshingly new and original. Of course, with Baldacci, it will certainly be a governement conspiracy-type of plot. My only problem with the book was that the plot and characters sometimes really lacked plausibility. But I enjoyed the read, no doubt.
B007X4N0DU|5.0|1) Eyez - 9/10<br />  Been out a while so many probably already know it. Features Sonny's famous screams and some great guitar work from Marcus. It's a hard rocking song<br />that starts the album of perfectly.<br /><br />2) Murdered Love - 7/10<br />  Murdered Love is the title track and a good follow up for Eyez. However, the repetition from the guest artist is a little bit much. Besides the guest artist, this is a nice heavy song with plenty of Sonny's Screams to voice a strong message.<br /><br />3) Higher 10/10<br />  Brilliant! Super catchy chorus and great verses rapped by Sonny. Brings back memories of their Satellite era.<br /><br />4) Lost in Forever 8/10<br />  First single of the record. I would say that is song is the most similar to their recent styles (ie When Angels and Serpents Dance). That being said I found this to be a much stronger single. It really is just good stuff.<br /><br />5) West Coast Rock Steady 6/10<br />  They seem to have a song like this every album. Fast tempo, rap heavy with a funky chorus. Better than the counterpart on most of their previous records. Still, the chorus isn't great so it gets labeled as the worst song on the album.<br /><br />6) Beautiful 9/10<br />  Amazing song! It's somewhat lyrically reminiscent of \\"It Can't Rain Everyday\\" and \\"Youth of the Nation\\". Pretty guitar rifts by Marcus occur throughout the track. It starts slower but builds into something pretty heavy.<br /><br />7) Babylon the Murderer 8/10<br />  Their \\"reggaeish\\" song of the record. For those of you that don't generally dig their reggae stuff, don't count this one out. It's much heavier than their normal reggae tracks and is definitely a catchy track. Great solo by Marcus at the end surrounded by Sonny's screams so you can't go wrong there.<br /><br />8) On Fire 8/10<br />  This song has been out for quite the minute. I was hesitant to see this make the final cut. I liked the original but it came out so long ago, I wasn't sure that it would fit.Luckily, they edited it some and polished it up. Fits into the rest of the album like a glove. Lyrics are sang with great conviction. Marcus really lights this track up.<br /><br />9) Bad Boy 7/10<br />  Cool little intro by Marcus followed by very rap heavy verses. During the verses Marcos plays a pretty sweet jazzy/funky rift in the background. Unfortunately, the chorus just isn't that great (it is growing on me though). Overall the lyrics are more relationship centered than is the norm for these guys but they pull it off, especially on the verses.<br /><br />10) Panic and Run 9/10<br />  Punk meets reggae. Super catchy chorus. Reminds me of some Pax 217 stuff.<br /><br />11) I Am 8/10<br />  Real heavy track with super overt and powerful lyrics.<br /><br />  Finally, a true successor to Satellite. I've been a fan since Brown and don't get me wrong the boys from Southtown have had some great stuff since Satellite. But they have lacked the fire that they had during Brown, Snuff the Punk, Fundamental Elements of Southtown, and Satellite. On this record, they play with the vibe of their earlier stuff. Their fire and musicianship on this album is great but what makes this album outstanding is the conviction that encompasses the fire.<br /><br />The lyrics this time around feel more substantial (for the most part). P.O.D. have always been a band that managed to sing about their beliefs without coming off as preachy. This album takes their lyrics to a new level. Sonny's work with the Whosoevers is really evident on this record. It's refreshing to hear a band rock so hard and actually have something to say that's worth listening to.<br /><br />Thank you P.O.D. for coming coming back to your roots and creating such an AWESOME CD! Even more importantly thank you for staying true to your convictions and being a light unto this world.
B000MD9UJC|5.0|After reading reviews on here i was hesitant in buying this upgrade, but considering it was this or the regular maglite bulbs i purchased this upgrade on E bay it was cheaper and free shipping for the same product. It was simple to install and after reading that it wasnt very bright i was weary. Would i break down a door to a crackhouse with a SWAT team with this light, no but i was very pleased that i could use it at 3 in the morning to go to the bathroom or in the garage with even in the backyard with it. Maybe flying insects wont burst into flames when they fly into the beam of light but i feel this is a better alternative to the regular maglite bulbs.
B000GPIPD8|5.0|If you own and enjoy any TBK albums, you will love this one too.  I miss the raw sound that they had on this album.  \\"Brothers\\" and \\"El Camino\\" are great albums, but this is what The Black Keys are all about.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Really liking this game so far. The title is exactly as it says. Samurai hack and slash. Get to it!
B006VKKAWQ|5.0|When I was a \\"youth\\" in Chicago in the sixties, EMI used to infuriate American teens by making us wait several weeks before releasing the US version of each new Beatles album (creating a black-market for imported LPs).<br />The record companies are still at it: This time Sony released the Toscanini Collection in the UK in April, but made us Yanks wait until July.<br /><br />This turned out to be a blessing in disguise.<br />The first UK pressings had a major screw-up.<br /><br />In 1992 RCA/BMG released the first 82 CD Toscanini Collection.<br />That is the template upon which the new Toscanini Collection was assembled.<br /><br />In 1999 RCA/BMG issued twelve 2 CD sets of Toscanini in new, 20-bit transfers. Most people thought these were an improvement over the 16-bit transfers of 1992. *<br />In 2006 Toscanini's Philadelphia Orchestra recordings were issued in new transfers.<br />Finally in 2008 Sony Japan issued 15 CDs worth of transfers on Japanese JVC XRCDs [most of this material overlapped with the 1999 20-bit transfers]. JVC XRCDs are highly valued by collectors - I could never afford them.<br /><br />If you're adding this up, approximately one third of the 1992 set was re-done in new and improved transfers.<br />Of course, in an ideal world, someone would have re-mastered the remaining 2/3 using the latest technology, but this is not an ideal world.<br /><br />GOOD NEWS: Sony took the 1992 Collection as a template, and inserted the new and improved masterings onto the appropriate CDs. Can't complain about that.<br /><br />GOOD NEWS: The price is unbelievably low.<br />In 1992, the 82 CD box sold for $1200. Today the 84 CD + 1 DVD box sells for $125. This is simply amazing.<br />Every civilized person should own this set.<br />A Monument to Western Civilization.<br /><br />*******************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />BAD NEWS: ATTENTION UK READERS. This is the most serious blunder.<br /><br />In the first batch of pressings released in the UK and Europe, the 1949 studio recording of Beethoven's Symphony 3 \\"Eroica\\" was MISSING.<br />The 1949 Eroica was supposed to be on CD1.<br />Instead, the 1953 broadcast appeared twice: on CD1 (mislabeled as 1949) and on CD29 (where it belongs).<br /><br />[For a detailed explanation of how this came to be, see the comments section at the end of this review - comment dated July 10, 2012].<br /><br />If you need a quick test of whether you have the 1949 or 1953 Eroica, there is a 20 second difference in the timings of the first movement:<br /><br />1949 = 13:46<br />1953 = 14:06<br /><br />Also, the engineer retained audience noise between movements of the 1953 performance.<br />This is most audible between movements 3 and 4.<br /><br />The missing 1949 Eroica on CD1 was corrected in later pressings, including the North American release.<br />If you have the bad CD1, and ordered it from Amazon UK, contact http://amazon.co.uk to see about getting a replacement CD1.<br />If you ordered from an independent dealer, there is no uniform replacement policy.<br />Contact your dealer: you may have to return the entire 84 CD box, and get a new 84 CD box. Wasteful stupidity.<br />To date, Sony has been ignoring customer's inquiries.<br /><br />[Past experience: My 60 CD Bernstein Symphony Edition came with one missing CD and two duplicate CDs.<br />I tried to contact Sony to arrange an exchange of CDs, but they would not acknowledge my existence.<br />Ended up returning the whole 60 CD box in exchange for a new 60 CD box. Stupid.]<br /><br />*********************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />GOOD NEWS: It comes with a nice book of essays about Toscanini and lots of nice photographs.<br />In 1992, RCA published a booklet with discographical index to the contents of all 82 CDs, but it was a limited edition.<br />Today the discographical index is included in the book.<br />This is important, as the published order of recordings was not and is not alphabetical or chronological.<br /><br />BAD NEWS: The 1992 program notes are no longer included. They were a model of their kind.<br /><br />GOOD NEWS: You can get them in book form: \\"Arturo Toscanini: The NBC Years\\" by Mortimer H. Frank (Amadeus Press, 2002).<br />It even includes a critical discography cued to the volumes in the old Collection, which are the same volumes as the new Collection.<br /><br />BAD NEWS: No librettos for the operas and vocal works. This was predictable. Still sad.<br /><br />BADDISH NEWS: Sony decided to slavishly copy the published sequence of the 1992 edition.<br /><br />This is taking \\"original jacket\\" mania to a ridiculous extreme.<br />They are not even \\"original jackets\\".<br />Toscanini died in 1957, but the totally arbitrary published order of the 1992 Complete Edition must be respected.  Why?<br /><br />Why not issue the CDs in alphabetical order by composer?<br />Or chronologically by date of composition (Bach through Shostakovich)?<br />Or by date of recording (1920 to 1954)?<br /><br />BAD NEWS: The DVD \\"Toscanini: The Maestro\\" features a censored version of Toscanini's wartime film of Verdi's \\"Hymn of the Nations.\\"<br /><br />Toscanini's wartime film of Verdi's composition expanded Verdi's original, which combined the national anthems of France, Great Britain and Italy, to include the anthems of the Soviet Union (the Internationale) and the United States (the Star-Spangled Banner).<br />The unabridged audio of the performance is on CD 63, but the DVD of the film eliminates the Soviet anthem entirely.<br />Actually, this is not Sony's fault - RCA did the censoring back in the 80's when the work was prepared for VHS release.<br /><br />GOOD NEWS: The complete, uncensored \\"Hymn of the Nations\\" is available on DVD.<br />It was a production of the U.S. Government Department of War Information, so its in the public domain.<br /><br />If you want to see as well as hear Toscanini conducting the Soviet National Anthem, do a google search for \\"Berkshire Record Outlet\\".<br />Click on \\"Search Catalog\\".

0439023513|5.0|What I mean by my review title is that it took it's time, and that wasn't always necessarily in it's favor, but that's ok, because once the action got rolling it was more than worth it.<br /><br />Plus, I believe the ending was absolutely perfect. In some ways, the events were highly foreseeable (based on knowledge of and paying attention to the characters personalities), but they were also completely shocking in how they played out. For some characters, it could NOT have ended any other way (or I'd have been very angry if it had at least, because it would have just seem very out of character). This author, for the most part, lets her characters tell the story.<br /><br />The only drawback is various points of explanation that could have been axed. It's a bit less forgivable than her explanations in Catching Fire because the parts that were being re-explained had been explained a few chapters prior (though my opinion of a few and the real distance between the chapters may be due to me reading almost this entire book - sans the first six chapters - entirely in one sitting). It just seemed out of Katniss's character to me, as a reader, to rehash those. But other than that, it's a completely brilliant story.<br /><br />Like the other two, I recommend finding time to read this all in one sitting unless you have the mind and stomach to put it down. Also, if you're fresh off of Catching Fire, read a chapter or two into this (I know that last cliffhanger was a doozy, wasn't it?). Also in line with my recommendation from the other two, once the action gets rolling I suggest trying to stop in the middle of chapters, as those cliffhangers can leave your mind reeling and you'll never get any sleep/work done.

B000P5FH3K|5.0|Last night's bargain-rack movie DVD  was \\"The Rainmaker\\" starring Matt Damon and Danny De Vito and directed by Francis Ford Coppola. Damon was a new lawyer, fresh out of law school, and just passing the bar exam. De Vito was a paralegal assistant who had failed the bar exam six times. They paired up at a sleazy ambulance-chasing law firm until the heat got too high, then left to form and open their own law office in an ultra-low-rent part of town and began their own type of ambulance chasing. Some of their cases were really pathetic, including the main case in the movie. A young man was near death with leukemia and a sleazy health insurance company with high-powered attorneys refused to pay for the needed bone-marrow transplan to keep him alive. He died. The case went to court. It was Damon and De Vito, baptized under fire, against the powerful lawyers of the insurance company. Well, you know who's going to win, or we wouldn't have a movie, but it was still an exciting drama to witness.<br /><br />The acting in this movie was quite excellent. It was the first major movie for Damon and he excelled. I don't particularly care for De Vito, but I'd here give him credit for the best acting I've ever seen him do. The rest of the cast was more than adequate. The filming, sound and direction were excellent. The story had a nice flow and attention never waned. The story was gripping and somewhat gut wrenching. About the only ones who didn't fare well were the lawyers and health insurance company people. Oh well, they're probably used to abuse. It was a good movie. Very well done.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B004GHNIRK|2.0|I loved the movie but I found the book heavy and ponderous.  I could not get through it and gave it up after about 200 pages.  All of the characters were either totally good or totally evil.
0439023491|4.0|This book's strongest aspect is it's characters and how they're handled and developed, and especially how they're all set up for the final book. But that there is this book's biggest flaw. It is 100% set up for the final book (if, for those of you who read it before reading this review, you couldn't already tell by the final line in the book...). For those who haven't read it yet, I promise, that final line is a doozy. Have the last book on hand so you can read a few chapters into it so your mind doesn't explode with thoughts and concerns and, well, all the energy that Ms. Collins invokes in every cliffhanger in this series.<br /><br />And if her cliffhanger's don't bother you, then you are a very, very lucky reader.<br /><br />Now to the content: I do think this is the weakest book in the series. However, it is still an extremely strong book. It actually handles the slow moments better than the final book does at times. This doesn't make up for everything. I said earlier that the characters were amazingly handled and developed, and that is true, but I still wish some of them had gotten more time. Maybe let the book have one more chapter for them? That might have made it too long though. So I know it's a balance that's hard to reach.<br /><br />The other drawback? It's my complaint for the last book as well, though it's less noticeable here: she goes far too overboard rehashing the information from the previous book. Even when the books were being published, I can't imagine that Peeta or Gale would have needed several lines of explanation, as they got, and it really detracted from Katniss's character, since the book is told through her eyes. That really bothered me in the first several chapters. Of course there's going to be remembering to some extent, but most humans aren't going to think in an explaining manner, where it's obvious an audience is being addressed. Those were the only moments of the book that failed me, and those moments really stuck out to me and bothered me. It was a complete breach from character, and that really stuck with me. I know it seems miniscule, but perhaps I'm just one of those people that can't give up on the details. I study the individual trees more often than the forest or whatever other cliche you might enjoy there.<br /><br />However, I can't stress enough that it's a small piece of the book, and unless you're a nut like me it probably won't bother you. I leave one last bit for you: If you haven't read it yet, I strongly suggest stopping in the middle of chapters if you have to take a break. This author knows the old writer's mantra: People are always looking for an excuse to put the book down. And it really shows, because she knows how to keep you going from chapter to chapter. So if you need to go to dinner or get some sleep, I highly suggest not trying to cut yourself off between chapters. For me, at least, it's an impossible feat.thered me.

B007IXWL2C|1.0|What a treat this book was. We get to experience their dreamy wedding, including a totally inappropriate scene in front of the minister and all their wedding guests, in a series of flashbacks. They are on a dream honeymoon and already Anastasia is afraid of her husband's temper. It's never a good sign in a relationship if you are afraid of your partner or have to walk on eggshells around them. But it's alright. He has lots of money and is super beautiful and perfect, as we are reminded yet again on every single page, so as always with her, it's fine! He's just damaged! Her damaged dark little fifty. Ugh. Where's a shotgun when you need one?<br /><br />The descriptions of her subconscious and inner goddess and what they are doing get oddly more specific with each book, to the point where it's just bizarre and annoying. Her subconscious at one point looked up from reading `The Complete works of Charles Dickens', to give Anastasia an admonishing look no doubt. It's not cute anymore. I usually have to put the book down after reading one of these gems and take a deep breath before I throw it. Oh, and her Inner Goddess reads Jackie Collins, in case you were wondering<br /><br />In all three books now we are treated with the `No you hang up!' barf fest.<br /><br />Jealousy, jealousy, jealousy. It's like all these two know is sex and jealousy. Every woman is jonesing after Christian all the time. And it's ok for him to get so irrationally possessive he buys her company, but if she shows a hint of jealousy with him, it's all *Tsk-tsk*<br /><br />It is never romantic when your husband says he really wants to beat you. He says that lovely line after someone broke into her home. Victim blaming, anyone? I don't care if he is mad, which is totally misplaced most of the time. All of the time actually. He gets angry because she disobeys orders. He gets angry if she has a disagreeing opinion. He gets angry cause she wants to work.  On top of that, she has to ask his permission to doanything. To go to work, to drive her car, to see her friend, to have fun. She is a grown woman. Does she know this is not how marriage works? That this isn't the 18th century anymore? And can I just say wow, at his reaction when she tells him she's pregnant. I'm surprised she didn't divorce him right then and there. But then again, she is always making excuses for his atrocious behavior. This relationship disgusts me.<br /><br />Once again, the plot is more of an afterthought, which I should have known better by now. It takes forever to get there, and when it does, it's so stupid it's laughable. And then all is well in Ana and Christian Land and they live happily ever after and we have to read a terrible epilogue anyways, filled with pregnant sex. Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse. I knew I should have stopped reading at the end of the book. And then we are treated to this delightful little nugget: \\"I think she likes sex already.\\" Yup. That's them talking about their unborn child right after they had pregnant sex.<br /><br />You are welcome everybody.<br /><br />Now I need to go read something good, or at least marginally better to get rid of the taste this awful book left in my mouth.
B005LAJ212|4.0|NO SPOILERS<br /><br />Drum roll....and the answer is Emily Thorne.<br /><br />First and foremost, I like this show.  It and the program Ringer both debuted in 2011 and both portrayed women pretending to be someone they were not.  Where Ringer was more about fitting in and ultimately solving a mystery, Revenge focused on that all consuming dish \\"best served cold!\\"  Each week another name was crossed off the \\"list\\" as Ms. Thorne continued down the ultimate path of vindication and validation.<br /><br />Some of the episodes are un-even, however (and I fully expect to incur wrath), what I simply don't get is how Emily Thorne (Emily VanCamp) manages to so quickly reel in the male leads in the land of the \\"pretty people\\"?  Personally, I find Emily more handsome than pretty.  Especially, when she is in like the same zip code as say Ashley Madekwe (AKA Ashley Davenport) and even her alter ego Amanda Clark (AKA Margarita Levieva).  IMO, Gabriel Mann (as Nolan Ross) dominates as the geeky, social inept Bill Gates type character.<br /><br />Revenge is an interesting show with not much competition in the genre.  I am perplexed as to where they can go with the show once Amanda/Emily's final revenge has been consummated?  Then again, I am not a writer, so why worry, just enjoy the ride!

B0060MYM3S|5.0|Dear fellow Game of Thrones viewers, potential and current alike,<br /><br />As an avid A Song of Ice and Fire fan, I cannot resist the urge to say that any reader should experience the epic and tragic tale of Westeros. Nevertheless, this review is about the current HBO spin-off of the rave political fantasy brawl.<br /><br />I will not spill the bloody details or shocking twists and turns of the show, nor will I layout a treasure map of the plotline for Game of Thrones. That is not the point of a review, the reason is to advice potential buyers and viewers whether or not the item is Aye, or Nay.<br /><br />With that, the Second Season of Game of Thrones is simply put, amazing. Do not expect your typical Lord of the Rings fantasy adventure; expect bloody plots, devastating climaxes, and gripping horror. Game of Thrones is not for the light of heart, that loose their grip on the present to a splash of blood, or a glimpse of a nipple; or the young of age, whom should not even be in the same room when this show is airing. (Shame on you if so)<br /><br />However, do not strife. This is not one of those shows that is merely sex and blood. No, be prepared to be floored by the twists and turns of the devious plotline. You will be enthralled, gripped, and captivated by the talent on and off screen.<br /><br />To put it simply, Game of Thrones (both season one, two, and beyond, based on the novels) is astounding. You might get a little confused by the cast of thousands and dismayed by some of the events, but Game of Thrones is entertainment at its best.<br /><br />I would now like to address the unhappy viewers that are distressed about the show detouring from the novel. Let me share some words of wisdom from a quote written by George R.R. Martin, himself, from his A Game of Thrones The Graphic Novel: Volume One,<br /><br />\\"The comic book is not the book; the graphic novel is not the novel. The same, of course, is true of the films and television. When we move a story fromone medium to another, no matter how faithful we attempt to be, some changes are inevitable. Each medium has its own demands, its own restrictions, its own way of telling a story.<br /><br />There are aspects of my epic fantasy series, A Song of Ice and Fire, that make it an especially difficult work to translate to any visual medium. The sheer scale of it. All those scenes. All those settings. A cast of thousands. The complexity of my plots and subplots. The structure: tight third-person narratives, interwoven from the viewpoint of many different characters. In the novels, I make free use of some techniques that work well in prose, and less well, or not at all, for a visual medium: internal monologues, flashbacks, unreliable narrators. I strive to put you inside the heads of my characters, make you privy to their thoughts, let you see the world through their eyes. Screenwriters and comic-book scriptors cannot do any of that, not without resorting to clumsy devices like voice-overs and thought balloons. For all these reasons, I went for years thinking A Game of Thrones and its sequels would never be adapted. Not for film, not television, and certainly not for funny books. Just. Could. Not. Be. Done.<br /><br />Shows you what I know.<br />...<br /><br />For my part, I love television series, and I love the comics...er, graphic novel...too. This is my world, these are my people, and this is still my story, now being told in a different medium, where a whole new audience can enjoy it.<br />...<br /><br />A series of novels.  A television show. A comic book. Three different media, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, its own pleasure and frustrations...but all ultimately telling the same story.\\"<br /><br />There you have it folks. I understand it can be slightly frustrating when a TV show, movie, etc. does not follow the book verbatim, however, it is its own story. Reading Martin's Preface to his Graphic Novel allowed me to understand and relinquish any hostilities toward TV shows or movies that did not honor the \\"complete\\" storyline of personal favorites. Take the previous words to heart, and you will realize just how marvelous Game of Thrones Season Two is, by itself, as its own story.

B0086213XW|4.0|When we last heard from writer-director Sarah Polley, she had earned a 2008 Academy Award nomination for her adapted screenplay for her debut feature film \\"Away From Her\\". Now finally comes Polley's second feature film.<br /><br />\\"Take This Waltz\\" (116 min.) brings the story of Margot (played by Michelle Williams), whopo is in her late 20s, married for 5 years to Lou (played by Seth Rogen), and living in Toronto. Then one day a handsome guy named Daniel (played by Luke Kirby) moves in across the street, and almost immediately Margot and Daniel start flirting with each other. The entire movie is built towards the \\"will they or won't they\\" question. All the other side stories, including some juicy scenes involving Lou's sister (played by Sarah Silverman), are secondary at best, as they do not move the film forward. The movie felt a bit too sugarcoated for my liking, as if I was watching some Nicholas Sparks-adopted movie.<br /><br />But there are several pluses that make this sill worthwhile checking out, none more so that the stellar acting performance, again, by Michelle Williams. If you just take her last 3 major roles (Blue Valentine; My Week With Marilyn; Take This Waltz), it's becoming clear to me that she is the Meryl Streep of this acting generation. Just outstanding, and she makes the most of what I think is rather uneven material. Another major plus is the (heavily Canadian artist oriented) soundtrack, which brings a bunch of great tunes, some well known (Leonard Cohen's title track of the movie; the Buggles' Video Killed the Radio Star), and others not so much (Ron Sexsmith, a Canadian treasure; Micah Hinson, Corrian Rose, etc.). In all, an uneven movie, but still worthwhile to check out primarily for Michelle Williams.

B007SGM084|5.0|I absolutely loved this trilogy!  Yes, the sexual details were quite exquisite, but it was the love story between Christian & Ana that captivated me.  Every woman wants that kind of love, attention, feelings, & passion in her relationship.  Every woman wants \\"HEARTS & FLOWERS\\"!  It's his attention to her that totally made me fall in love with his character...the \\"I wish I knew what you were thinking\\" & \\"What's wrong?\\" & \\"How are you feeling?\\" & THE EMAILS & gifts to her that weren't about the $ but about her & him, ie:  the IPad with their pictures & songs referring to them & her interests in books, the charm bracelet, the \\"Hearts & Flowers\\" moment.  The sexual content is a great added & fun bonus, but the love story is what captured me!

034580404X|2.0|After hearing so many positive things about this trilogy, I decided to read them. I just finished the first book, \\"Fifty Shades of Grey,\\" and I am so disappointed. Obviously, I am one of the very few who did not like this book.<br /><br />The writing is elementary at best. This is a summertime \\"fluff read\\" at the beach, nothing more. The kinky sex didn't bother me---obviously I knew what the book was going to be about. What bothered me was this educated young woman was so quickly willing to be manipulated by this weird man. Perhaps it would have been more plausible if the author explored the pysche of both characters a bit more before having them jump into bed (or bathtub or desk or Red Room!) on every other page. Enough already! Give me some character development! And, enough with their email messages back and forth....it got old after a while.<br />I am going to have a hard time picking up the 2nd and 3rd book after struggling to get through the first.

B003Y5H5F6|2.0|What happened to this movie is very similar to what happened with Blade Trilogy:after 2 great movies, the Blade:Trinity was released which totally killed the series. Underworld: Awakening has a very poor plot due to a probably very limited budget. Whoever liked the first 3 movies,I suggest you purchase the Trilogy on Blu-Ray and watch it in high definition-you will not waste your time and money and will be satisfied at the end. Don't waste a minute of your precious time on Underworld: Awakening or if you are a die-hard fan of the series- simply rent it. Trust me,you will want to use fast forward button after 10-15 minutes.
1612680011|2.0|I will keep this short. I felt uncomfortable with the advice Robert was giving. He basically dissed his own father and loved and respected his pretend rich father. I can see gleening advice from someone who is business smart, but some of it just morally seemed wrong to me. He is basically saying your are not going to get anywhere by working for other people and we are saps for doing so. So, get your own business where other people work for you, don't pay them well, and rake in the cash. Sorry, couldn't do that if I wanted to, which I don't.

B006MGC3VK|4.0|Over the past several years, O.S.I. has established itself as one of the most innovative American groups on the progressive metal music scene. Fire Make Thunder solidifies that position. What sets them apart? Well, not only have they developed a \\"trademark\\" musical style, the distinctive vocals make an O.S.I. recording instantly recognizable to the musical cognoscenti.<br />Here's what I like best: The steady, relentless Cold Call; the uncharacteristically mellow and dreamy Indian Curse; the pounding, driving Enemy Prayer; and the sweeping Invisible Men.<br />The CD comes very attractively packaged and is accompanied by a useful insert containing the lyrics, standard album info, and a picture of the group's two principals, Jim Matheos and Kevin Moore. If you haven't yet come to enjoy O.S.I., Fire Make Thunder is a great place to start!

B00371QQ2U|4.0|Ron Howard is right in his comfort zone in this dramatic retelling of an early NASA near-disaster, with a bevvy of strong characters to play with, volatile situations to work through and nostalgic heartstrings to tug at. Backed by an all-star cast and an excellent script, it's a lesson in efficient, powerful big-event storytelling. Tom Hanks and Ed Harris are especially convincing as commander of the crippled spacecraft and the flight director in charge of his safe return, respectively. Like you might expect from a Hanks / Howard collaboration, it has more than its share of soft-hearted emotions, but a good sense of humor and convincing special effects help to compensate.
030758836X|4.0|I have just finished the book and I must agree with some recent reviews. It is a good piece of writing. The  characters are complex and you will be torn between hating them and loving them; pitying them and being disgusted with their behavior. Nothing is black and white in this novel.  You will want to keep on reading because the story is gripping and will make you want know more with every turn of a page. I do not want to give any spoilers here. Despite all of the above, the ending is very disappointing. In my opinion, it is cheesy and very Hollywood-like.  That is why I am giving this book only 4 stars. It deserves an ending as fascinating and twisted as the 70% of its content. It is definitely a great summer read, though.
0618918248|4.0|Short and sweet:  I thought this was a really good book with lots to think about.  Sometimes he stated things that I have been saying for years (hey, how come I didn't get credit?).  Some of the middle chapters were not as easy to read and I didn't always agree with everything that Dawkins stated (I agree with his overall views, just not with everything he says to support those views).  In closing, I do recommend this book.  Overall, I thought he was fair to religion, but he just doesn't see the truth of it.  It is my opinion that what most atheists rail against is not God, but the concept of God as set forth by organized religion.  That god certainly does not exist but was created by man.  I'm not saying I believe in another type of god, but only that if religion went no further than to state there may have been a creator but that's all we know, that would be a more acceptable position than the one taken by organized religion.  For such a mysterious force, they seem to know so much about it.
1608871045|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2C5LRSB1X7Y4Y]]I am a huge fan of Nolan's Batman films because they bring a sense of realism to the Batman mythology.  This book is great because it allows you to take a closer look at all of the technology and gadgets within the films.  The book provides plenty of photos and diagrams, along with informative text, that gives you a new appreciation for the amount of design that went into these movies.<br /><br />The book covers the following topics: Batman's suit, the Tumbler and Batpod, \\"The Bat\\" flying vehicle, the Bat Cave, and Wayne Manor.  There are also case files for The Joker and Dr. Crane, hospital records for Harvey Dent, many prototype designs from Wayne's applied sciences division, hand-written memos to Bruce Wayne from Alfred & Lucius Fox, Gotham Police decals, etc.<br /><br />One of the unique aspects is that this book, much like the [[ASIN:0061997811 Harry Potter Film Wizardry]], features inserts that can be removed from the book.  Flipping through the book, it almost feels like you went to Gotham City and brought home a bunch of cool artifacts!<br /><br />LIST OF REMOVABLE INSERTS:<br />- The Cave blueprints<br />- Bat Signal Stickers/Decals<br />- The Bat (flying vehicle) blueprints<br />- Gotham Police Dept. stickers<br />- Harvey Dent campaign stickers<br />- 8 Joker cards<br />- Map of Gotham City<br />- There is also a hidden disc behind the folder on the last page -- the disc includes 14 high-res images.<br /><br />**Note that there are many other inserts included, but they are not designed to be removed from the book.<br /><br />Overall, I can't say enough good things about this book.  Batman fans will be satisfied, and it gives you a greater appreciation for the world that Nolan and his design team have created.  If there is one criticism it's that the book is a bit light on \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" material, although characters like Bane and Selina Kyle do get their own pages.
B000K4X5XA|4.0|It occurred to me while watching the opening credits that, at the time this first hit theaters, Action Comics #1 was forty years old. Today, that landmark is right around the corner for this film, and that led me to wonder if it had as much to do with shaping my generation's snapshot of the Man of Steel as the original issues did my grandparents'. The world has changed in a lot of ways since the late seventies, particularly in its fashion sense - many civilians' getups are just as outlandish as Superman's - but despite his squeaky clean image and dated morals, there's still something familiar and relevant about this rendition of the big blue boy scout. He's naive to a fault, but there's no questioning his motivations and it's still refreshing to see a nice guy who doesn't finish last. Christopher Reeve is responsible for the majority of what works, and he buys into the role so completely that it's no surprise he'd be associated with the character for the rest of his life. Gene Hackman is disappointing in his first turn as Lex Luthor, but the rest of the supporting cast is spot-on and the script is impressive given its age. Although the much-maligned ending sequence is a total disaster, the rest of the story does a very good job of balancing a mature, serious tone with the lighter dalliances into fantasy that go hand-in-hand with the character.

B0031RS8AI|3.0|Rebecca Bloomwood is a journalist who is not quite sure if she should be writing advising people on their finances when she simply can't control hers. She feels better whenever she shops - so every problem she has makes her shop more, which brought her into a lot of debt. Now she only has two options: cutting back or making more money. Or maybe use her colourful imagination to keep her bank problems at bay?<br /><br />I picked up this book after reading [[ASIN:0385342063 I've Got Your Number: A Novel]], which I really enjoyed and because everyone seemed to enjoy this series from the same author. It is a funny book and I was curious to see how it ended, but I couldn't feel any kind of sympathy towards Rebecca. Most of her problems were self-inflicted and I still think she got away too easily with lying so much. On the other hand, I don't get a thing about clothes and should have thought of that before start reading this book. The story itself didn't develop much, and even though it's very easy to read I was actually expecting more.

0312382464|3.0|I really wanted to love these books as much as others do.  And while I think there is a lot to admire there is also much to roll one's eyes at.  Now into my third (Sunne in Splendour, Here Be Dragons) Falls the Shadow gives me the same pleasures but also the same reservations.  First, Penman does another splendid job of recreating the period.  However, I think her characterization leaves much to be desired.  I found her portrayal of Simon de Montfort particularly annoying.  Apparently being chivalrous also means being inexcusably dumb.  Not as bad a Sue as say Chadwick's William Marshall, but  very close.<br /><br />When Henry III's son Edward is captured, de Montfort and his sons don't bother to guard him adequately. Edward had given his word as a knight he will not try to escape.  Perhaps his boys were that naive but a man of the world? Simon can't imagine a knight breaking his oath. Really?  The family he thinks is  covetous, venal and avaricious wouldn't tell a fib?  Edward just rides off!!! Bye-Bye.  A brilliant strategist and leader doesn't consider  1) oaths extracted under duress are not binding.  2) they must be given freely and willingly  3) and there are liars in the world.  What follows is all too predictable.  The de Montforts are just too pure for this world.<br /><br />Also, there is a tendency in Penman's historical fiction to verge, indeed cross over into the territory of Romance, a genre of which I am not fond.  First, too many modern love affairs/feelings and emotions. The good guy's wife is almost always as admirable.  This was an age of arranged marriages and a prescribed role for women.  I find it hard to believe that so many broke the mold to be either a Barbara Cartland heroine or devoted trusted councillor.  Richard III and Ann: Tender and Devoted; Llewelyn & Joanna: Passion Betrays! Love Redeems! and Gruffyd & Eleanor--Love At First Sight/Love Among the Ruins. Llewelyn and Joanna occasionally disappoint and worse and when it happes it is like a breath of fresh air.  And just as relationships tend to be \\"of a type\\" so too do her antagonists.  I have no doubt Henry III had his faults and flaws.  But unless Simon de Montfort wasn't human, so too did he.  But we would never know that.  Because the father's are caricature's, their son's must be too.  Simon's eldest:  Noble and Trusting.  Henry's Edward:  Ignoble and Dissembling.<br /><br />What starts as irksome becomes really annoying.  Each of these books is 700 or 800 pages.  It's not as though there wasn't time to develop some nuance or moral ambiguity.  Soooooo, if you want to know who Sharon Penman thinks were the good guys and who were the bad guys in 13th Century England, lug Falls A Shadow home.ke a breath of fresh air.

B0086700CM|4.0|pretty fun game. it is strangely addictive. it does get kind of repetitive after a while but definitely worth it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|A very fun game the more levels you complete the more fun you will have. PS family friendly game. Fun
B00846REIS|5.0|This book is GREAT!!! If I say to much I will spoil it. I wish I didnt have to wait until October to read the follow up but that will give me an excuse to re-read this one.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Well my mom tried and tried to get me to read this book and I am not much of a reader... until now!!! I am in love with this story... I am getting ready to read the trilogy again! I dont understand when people say that they dont like this story... they are crazy to me! I love that I never wanted to put the book down. My husband was always sad that I didnt spend time with him because I was in my book! lol Anyway... Best story I have read so far! :D
0345803485|1.0|For months now I've heard nothing but amazing reviews about this book. It's all I've heard about recently. Then I started hearing all of the controversy behind it and my curiosity sucked me in. It took me five tries and much skimming to complete this horrible book.<br /><br />First let me start off - I am not a prude and the sex in this isn't what turned me off. However, that really is all there is to this book. There isn't much of a storyline at all to follow. It really is just sex and their toxic, abusive \\"relationship\\". Which brings me to how shocked I am that so many women are drooling over Christian and claiming that this book has improved their marriage. I can only assume that these are women with very low self esteem and in a very unstable and unhealthy marriage. I'm still baffled at how a mentally ill man who likes to beat women and control everything about their daily lives down to what to eat, how often to exercise and what to wear could possibly be seen as sexy or \\"amazing\\". It disturbs me on so many levels.<br /><br />Besides the lack of substance, it is also very poorly written. The author really needs a thesaurus. By the middle of the book I was tired of the handful of phrases/words that Ana had going on in her sad little head - \\"holy *expletive*\\", \\"inner goddess\\" and \\"erotic\\". I skimmed and skipped a lot as much of the book was very repetitive and annoying to the point that I visibly cringed and rolled my eyes.<br /><br />I'm just thankful that I didn't waste money on this sad piece of \\"literature\\". Thank goodness for the library! Unless you like reading a whole lot of nothing - don't waste your money. If you feel that you must see what all of the silly over-rated hype is about, hit up your local library. You may have to put it on hold and wait for it to be available but don't worry, you really aren't missing anything. If you loved the book - you really should read more often.
B008AG3PK8|4.0|This episode should have been 2 hours long. They had so many great plotlines that were skimmed over that could have been thoroughly explored. Hopefully next year,if their is a next year. The whole symbolism about people's ghosts coming back to haunt them and how they handle it was good. Love Joan as partner, throwing her weight around in that aqua dress rocking the glasses with the chain.<br /><br />Will say this for the finale. It left me feeling fragile. I could feel for Megan clawing for that crappy commercial so she doesn't have to be tortured by her mom. I have a male family member who does this to everyone and thinks they are<br />' helping ' and is suprised when people don't talk to him<br /><br />. Like that Don would put his pride aside and stick up for Megan like that. The almost childish grin on Draper's face when he was watching Megan's screen test was priceless. I have a feeling he has something gravely wrong with his health, I wonder if she will be there for him when it happens.<br /><br />This episode made me understand Pete and train guy's wife. They are like two weird peas in a pod.It partially explains why Pete is so unhappy with Trudy and his perfect life. Did anyone else think train guy's wife  and train jerk kind of resemble's a prescursor to Rory's bitter resigned grandparent's on Gilmour girls ? Didn't they live in Conneticut ? Wasn't her Grandfather in insurance ?
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is awful, and is an insult to intelligent women everywhere!!!  It's a classic tale of a meek, insecure, young virgin (of all things), that is seduced and dominated by a rich, powerful, attractive man.  The main character has no self-worth and it's insulting to read.  I hated this book!  I can't believe I wasted my time reading the entire thing, thinking it would get better.  Save your money and time, it doesn't...
0547569653|5.0|I read this book over the weekend. If you've read Born to Run then read this book. Scott Jurek is a vegan ultramarathon legend. This is an inspirational story of his life and he is only 38. I needed this book right now. It made me chill out. I've been freaking out about the \\"now what?\\" phase I'm kind of in right now. He got through it and rediscovered his passion. I like guys like him. He is very well read and was constantly mentioning quotes and philosophy stuff throughout the book, plus closed each chapter with a recipe :-) He is passionate about healthy food and I love that! Runner or not, vegan or not, read this book! We can all relate on various levels to the triumphs and struggles he experienced. After having read this book you will be comforted and inspired.
B004JN1D2I|3.0|As a fantasy series I found it quite readable.  However, the series is incomplete in that the reader is left wondering what happens next since the story just suddenly ends with the notice that there is still another book planned for the series which should tell the reader what happened to the characters left alive at the end of book 4.  It should be a 5 book bundle.  Supposedly the title of the 5th book is \\"A Dance with Dragons\\"
1466401885|5.0|Beautiful Disaster was absolutely amazing! I read it right after I read FSOG because of the comparisons I found on different websites. Let me tell you.... I was a huge Christian Grey fan, but now, I'm an even bigger Travis Maddox lover. He is the perfect fiction character; sexy, strong, tall, built with an amazing body, tattoos (very sexy tattos that fit his profile). Abby at times really got on my nerves, but that only made me side with Travis more. I literally could not put this book down. I read it in one night staying up until almost four in the morning. I have to say, this quickly became my favorite book. I cannot wait for Travis' POV. I wish that they was a `sequel' but I guess I can just reread it for the (what feels like) 100th time. If you are looking for an awesome love story that has something happening on every page, this is the book for you!<br /><br />I have never written a review on Amazon before this one, but I loved it so much I had too.
B00884GR0W|5.0|the best app on my kindle fire ive been waiting for minecraft to be on the fire but when I saw this I was so happy and this apps graphics are amazing it so worth $4.98
B005LAII94|3.0|Great acting and very good script(except for the amateurish student film narration).<br />I just don't understand why Stone decided to do that with the ending...it honestly feels like you're watching a work in progress and not a finished film.<br /><br />Worth a rental.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Just finished Wool 1-5 and you have me hooked  I will have to get the rest to see how it ends, if it ends.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am not sure what I can add to all I have seen, and I don't review books very often, but I will try. I loved this book so much I read through the night for the first time in years. I am glad I didn't learn of \\"Wool\\" until the Omnibus edition came out, because I would have been frustrated waiting to learn what happened to the characters. In fact, I hope the sixth book is coming out soon, because I may go into withdrawal.Don't hesitate, buy it today!
B00846REIS|2.0|This book was recommeded to me by a friend who had heard that it was better than Fifty Shades of Grey.  I was astonished at the similarities between the two as far as characters and story line.  But that is where it ends.<br />Fifty Shades was much better written.  The depth and personalities of the characters, and the whole storyline in general are much more developed in Fifty Shades.  If you are looking for a quick read, you'll be fine.  But if you are disappointed, don't say I didn't warn you.
B005LAII1C|1.0|If I saw this poor excuse for a movie half drunk on my couch late at night, I would probably think is was almost OK.<br />But to go to a movie theater, get in line and pay 12,00 to watch this was just a BAD idea.<br />NOT WORTH IT!<br />It tries to shock you, but in the end it follows the most basic and ridiculous Hollywood formula.<br /><br />The E.T. reference at the end(after the first and most obvious one) was the lowest I've ever seen in a movie.<br /><br />If you're anything other than a pothead living in your mom's basement, you shouldn't like this piece of crap.<br /><br />The one joke about the gay(?) friend was the ONLY funny one, thanks to his acting. That guy should've received all of the profits for this JUNK!<br />OK, maybe 1/2 of the money should've gone to another actor(?) that I guess I can't tell you here...<br />YES, it was kinda cool to see where the Flash Gordon thing went, but still...<br /><br />I'm seriously thinking about producing a movie about me sitting on my couch, and saying curse words and offending all religions and ethnic groups for 90 minutes and then trying to get my great film out in theaters...<br />I'm sure that all of these people giving 4-5 starts for this crap will come see it to make me RICH!!!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|What a great show!! The cast is wonderful, can't wait for season 3 to begin! This is a must see
B008DB3N5W|4.0|Not sure what all the negative feedback is about.This is a strong Manowar release.<br />Certainly not as good as the early days but how many bands are releasing stuff that surpasses there earlier stuff.<br />Songs are well written with \\"Touch the Sky\\" a highlight for me.<br />Eric's voice is a strong as ever and all the crying about the bass sound is unwarranted.<br /><br />A huge step in the right direction from \\"Gods of War\\".
B002PEP4SC|2.0|Premise: This licensed tie-in book is ostensibly the novel written by the character Castle on the show of the same name. The plot follows a murder investigation about a rich man pushed off a high balcony.<br /><br />This book did amuse me a little, but mostly it was unintentional. It's funny that a lot of people bought this short, throw-away book. It's funny that some ghost writer got paid to crank this out over a weekend. It's funny that any editors or producer types gave this a pass to be put into production.<br /><br />I know, I know, it's a novel created for the sole purpose of exploiting the TV show's fanbase. I am a fan of the show. I wasn't expecting brilliance. I was, however, hoping for competance. So sue me.<br /><br />This is a somewhat spectacularly bad book, although not quite so bad for me to think that it might be bad on purpose.<br /><br />My biggest problem with it is the terrible use of tie-ins to the show. If this were a stand-alone novel, it could merely be brushed off as hackneyed and boring. However, it isn't as though the author just took inspiration from the show- make Nikki sound a bit like Beckett, use a couple references, that sort of thing. It felt sort of like an episode, except that the plot was incredibly boring. I mean, I literally thought it was an episode that I had seen, but that had been rewritten badly. I checked the episode list, though, and I can't remember which one I'm thinking of. All of the main characters have terribly caricatured one-to-one correspondences. I couldn't take the book seriously for even a fraction of a second because I kept picturing how fast Castle would have been dropped by all of his officer friends the moment the book came out, because of how horribly they are all portrayed.<br /><br />So, in conclusion: Boring, trite, and poorly connected to its source material. However, it skirts close to so bad it's funny.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|A great way to share notes and keep track of items across devices. Excellent way to take notes in different classes.
B000069KE0|3.0|I'd forgotten how adventurous Chicago's 2nd record was! This remastered version of their early '70's jazz rock adventure is true to the sound of the original LP (in fact, it sounds a bit cleaner to me) and should please fans longing to recapture the old days. A lot of care went into the booklet, which features archival photos and interviews.<br /><br />I remember noticing that Chicago II had a very compressed sound when heard over the radio and was surprised to hear that the LP had the same lack of bass, emphasized middle frequencies and squashed dynamics. It was mixed with AM radio and portable tape players in mind and this remaster probably gets the most out of the original stereo tape, which ain't much in terms of musical realism. No matter how good your audio system is, you won't think the musicians are in the room with you. Maybe the next room over!<br /><br />If you seek out the remixed version done in the early 2000's, you'll be pleasantly surprised by how much more life the vocals have, how the horns sound like brass rather than plastic, and hey, Danny Seraphine is banging on drums, not Quaker Oats boxes! Amazon's partners are selling the long out of print DVD Audio version and the stereo version, featuring the same mix (derived from the multi-track master), can be found at your favorite (legal) HD downloads site. Definitely worth searching out.
B006Z9SP3E|5.0|I have always loved Jeffrey Archers's writing and have read just about all his books, and I completely loose myself in them.<br /><br />I can't wait for, as I imagine there must be a third one when I read the last page, so please hurry up sir, as I am 85!<br />It took me through so much history as I was brought up in England during the war. The vivid descriptions of that time took me back to memories of my school days and war torn London.<br /><br />The author's' charactors were so real that it was almost as if I was watching a movie.<br /><br />A TRULY GREAT READ....THANK YOU AMAZON.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Premise: Kvothe of the Edema Ruh has been called many things: student, arcanist, musician, street trash, 'Kvothe the Bloodless', 'Kvothe Kingkiller'... Soon after a mysterious attack by what the villagers agree is a spider demon, a man known as the Chronicler comes to the town of Newarre. He has come to speak to the innkeeper, a man who is more than he appears- he has come to get Kvothe's story.<br /><br />This book was intensely long, but never boring. I really enjoyed reading it; the story was engaging, the characters intriguing, the world well drawn. The best part, however, might be the prose.<br /><br />The prose was full of gorgeous poetry - yet it read effortlessly. From the prologue:<br /><br />\\"The third silence was not an easy thing to notice. If you listened for an hour, you might begin to feel it in the wooden floor underfoot and in the rough, splintering barrels behind the bar. It was in the weight of the black stone hearth that held the heat of a long dead fire. It was in the slow back and forth of a white linen cloth rubbing along the grain of the bar. And it was in the hands of the man who stood there, polishing a stretch of mahogany that already gleamed in the lamplight.\\"<br /><br />This is a very dark-edged fantasy, although it earns its darkness with heart and tempers it with humor.<br /><br />Most of the book is a flashback narrated in the first-person, and I loved seeing those moments where the speaker chooses to emphasize or elide certain details of his story. The themes - the place in our lives for the stories we tell about ourselves, and the difference between legend, truth and memory - were fully explored without ever being overbearing. I especially enjoyed the layers of story-within-story as the book progressed.<br /><br />I feel like I am not praising this book enough, but I'm not sure what else to say. It is expertly crafted and tremendously compelling. Just a wonderful story, well told.<br /><br />The Name of the Wind is clearly only partone: there are exciting action scenes near the final pages, but I wouldn't say that they constitute a climax. I suspect for any closure we'll have to wait for Book Three. This is so well done, though, that I know I'm going to enjoy the entire ride.
B000056NX5|5.0|I grew up with this music and this is the best version yet.  SOOOO much better than the original!!  The sexy French Judas in leather pants steals the show, and Jesus and Mary Magdalene are beautifully acted. Sophisticated and addictive!
B007R41E8O|3.0|All in all the game held my attention and curiosity to the end. I played it in one sitting. The game was very pretty, the story build up was very good, it was appropriately responsive and then it all fell apart abruptly at the very end. None of the mystery was answered, which is surprising given the thought and time put into the storytelling! I also didn't like all the back and forth you had to do. It just would be better to clear a scene at a time. There are so many clues its hard to know what goes where sometimes when you have to remember the whole area. I found myself hitting the hint button too much because I got a bit bored, lost and confused. It held my attention and I enjoyed myself so, three stars from me.
B0087240Z4|2.0|I was disappointed with Zeitgeist, not really a bad album, it simply lacked the should that previous albums had.  I'll just ignore the free offerings of teargarden by kaleidoscope simply because everyone else did, but this contribution Oceania is just a continuation of soulless blaa. This all sadly reminds me of the later Cure material, were band members come and go and the megalomaniac at the head of the band pushes foreword in an effort to produce sequel after sequel of a popular album while watering down the magic it once contained.  So, I'm done buying Billy's albums, at least until we actually see the smashing pumpkins reform, obviously there is a lot more to a band than the singer.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this games awsome. just like the old Mario but u shoot aicorns instead of fire. takes me back to child hood.
0671027344|5.0|This book can actually be life changing. It really makes you think about how you look at those around you. I recommend this book to everyone who needs something to read. I hope that you get it and enjoy it!
B004EPYZSK|5.0|great movie , some gore,  the ladies dont like blood ... not too bad in my opinion . great movie,  and a new idea ,cowboys  fighting  aliens  ... reccomend  this  movie !!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I wasn't sure where she was going to go with the second book, so, although I LOVED the first book, I was a little skeptical about this one. It lived up to the first book and then some. I LOVE this series. Can't wait to read the Mocking Jay!
B005IQZB14|4.0|Cheryl Strayed superbly accounts for her trial of innner strugles to reach her true self  by pushing herself physically to walk the PCT alone.  She shows her misgivings and insecurites but how she learned to cope to overcome them.  Her descriptions of the trail are awesome and anyone who has ever hiked with a backpack can certainly identify with her daily physcial stress as she walked. This is a book about one woman's courage to find her true self and in the process gain self-confidence.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Great packaging. Pricing is good for what you get in the packager. This is for any fan of the Alien Trilogy. What I love is that it has the original theater release of Alien and Aliens as well as the re-releases.

1594744769|3.0|Good beach read.  Interesting story, keeps you turning the pages to see what happens.  Pretty easy to get through (read it in a few hours).<br />I like the extra touch of the photographs.<br />I would recommend this book.
B00893T448|5.0|hi<br />i like it, this is a good start to BAD 25 Anniversary<br /><br />well packed but Poste broke the pack unfortunately : (((
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I LOVED the first 2 books.  This one feels like she tried to fit two books into one so, while there's still a lot of detail and excitement...it leaves a lot to be desired (especially in the end). Still a fantastic book! I ate this series up like it was candy...LOVED IT!
B005D6O0LQ|1.0|They are comfortable,  BUT when I walk they make a \\"farting\\" noise. I don't know why! So I've only worn them one and just around the house. They too loud to take out in public.
159514188X|2.0|I read the book fairly quickly (on the beach in an afternoon).  I kept waiting for it to get better or more exciting, but it never really did.<br />The main character Hannah is SO annoying!  She gets under my skin so much I really didn't feel any compassion for her that she is dead.  I understand that suicide is a big issue in teens, but this girl doesn't accept responsibility, and goes on to blame 13 other people and ruin their lives with her tapes she made prior to killing herself.  I really didn't like the girl.<br />I also found the author's writing style irritating on how he switched back and forth between the tapes text and current time text.<br />I graduated high school 10 years ago and this is labeled as teen (though so is Hunger Games and I loved those books!), so possibly someone who is still in high school would enjoy this more than I did.<br />It makes you rethink your actions and how you treat people, which is good, but the book is just okay.  Really didn't like the characters or the story.<br />In my opinion, not worth reading!
034580404X|5.0|I loved the books and I loved how the last book wraps everything up so your not left in suspense.
B006VKKAWQ|5.0|I have been listening through this intriguing collection over the last few months (got it from the UK) as I am a newcomer to Toscanini's vast number of recordings. My musical journey has been quite enjoyable and amazing. The quality of the recordings (depending on the year) are very good and the performances are indeed enticing. This is truly a bargain in terms of getting a broad spectrum exposure to major works through Toscanini's perspective. The Toscanini box is a great set for beginners, collectors as well as (obviously) the countless Toscanini fans! I will return to these recordings on a regular basis! A bargain that comes highly recommended!<br /><br />In terms of packaging I am quite satisfied with the sturdy rectangular box with each cd in a cardboard sleeve that details the contents on its back-cover. The front covers of the cds contain an endless variation of the maestro himself in black and white photos.  The lid of the box lifts straight up, which allows one to scan the content quickly as the content is printed on the edge of each cd sleeve. They stack nicely and sturdily next to each other.

B0086700CM|5.0|To everyone who says this won't work on kindle fire, I don't  know what is wrong with your kindle's. Works on mine. Download it, it might work.  It's very fun and addicting.I used up a whole hour playing this.

B007U1FEJE|5.0|I have seen so many concerts in my life. Everyone from led zep , kiss, the stones, ray charles, even rap , jazz and classical and I must say that seeing the reunited beach boys was one of the best I ever saw. Every song sounded better than ever and they did 50 songs live! 3 hours at red rocks , colorado. And two of the songs were from this one. The title track sounded as pure beach boys as if it had been written at their peak. It made me decide to buy this cd. I listened to it and it's a very good one. As you can see there are very few reviews that are negative and those that are , are from jerks who comment on how old they are! This is a great cd, and even if you are younger , if you love sweet harmonies and good clear tunes you will enjoy this top ten hit cd.
B007STXHTM|5.0|I had pre-booked the housing when it was first listed in Amazon. Before it got to many dive stores, I recieved mine. 5 stars to Amazon for that.  I used this on 4 dives on a recent dive trip. As expected there was no vignetting in wide angle. But on the surface it has vignette. I have made one video with the clips which I'll try to post the link here. I'm not sure if Amazon let you post youtube links.  [...]  Anyways I'll be reviewing this again after going thru my footage.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Great game couldnt stop playing. starts out easy. gets a little more difficult as you play I was dissapointed when the game ended

B005QUQP76|5.0|Here is my experience in searching for my perfect mouse:<br /><br />*Logitech G5 for over 5 years, great mouse, loved it<br />*Bought the RAT 7 and was disappointed with the tracking issues<br />*Bought the Logitech G500, the mouse was comfortable but it has 2 deal breakers: mushy scroll wheel, and questionable durability<br />*Last but not least, the Corsair M60. I am in love. The mouse fits perfect, durable aluminum construction, rock solid scroll wheel, adjustable weight and DPI.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|really useful calculator. definitely worth downloading to use in mtgs and when the HP isn't nearby.<br /><br />does basics well.  would be great to have some FV calculations but the numbers are big and the layout intuitive.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Got the kindle version of Mike's book for $6 and I must say it was more than worth it.  I am somewhat new to working out, and looking to gain 10 lbs of muscle.  I'm confident that the steps in the book will help me out.  There is a lot of insightful information about using heavier weights with less reps, and some great nutritional info as well.  Also some great definitions of common health/workout terms.  The included bonus report even has candid reviews of Mike's recommended supplements for those who may want/need them.  Finally, as others have mentioned the author actually responds to emails if you have questions about his program!  I would gladly recommend this book to anyone looking to get in better shape.
0345803485|2.0|So I jumped on the Fifty Shades wagon along with everyone else. When I read this book I at first thought wow! This is great but once I got up to the 5th chapter I was like REALLY how many times can she say how HOT he is, and how many times can she orgasm and how many times are they just going to have sex. It gets pretty lame after the first book. There was only a little bit of thriller and mostly all about sex. It kept me somewhat interested but not something I would say was out of this world.
B005ERIRZE|5.0|This is one of those rare books which I happened to \\"bump into it\\" by mistake and which is so far making a deep and profound impact in my life. It has provided a deep understanding of many, if not all, of my past behavior and mistakes in terms of desires, lack of control, obsessions, obesity, addictions, etc.  This book couldn't have come into my life at a more auspicious time. I'm currently on the long  and difficult process of spiritual and mental transformation. This gem of a book  provides the physiological, neurological, scientific ( evidence based ) and secular explanations that coupled with the spiritual ( from other sources and not from this book) completes the whole process.<br />If you have struggled with addiction, eating disorders, gambling, smoking, spending too much, lack of control in your life, hoarding, etc; if you feel a slave to your smartphone, your job, food, alcohol, relationships (bad ones), etc then this book will open your eyes and provide you with tools to help you regain control and put your lives and your minds in order.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|cute game love it! reminds me of pioneer trail on facebook. easier to play. I'm glad I can play it on the Kindle... much easier to tote around than the laptop.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Loved it, could not put it down. Only problem is I want more. Everyone needs a bit of fifty in their lives.
B00846REIS|1.0|Like many others, I read a book based on its reviews.  What a waste of money.  I am dismayed that this drivel was enjoyed by others.  This was a dollar store knock off of \\"Grey\\".  Eva need to bury her head in the sand and suffocate!  Gideon should simply search for himself-on a different planet; he's that far lost.  I haven't been this disappointed in a book in a very, very long time.  I felt as if the author copied \\"Grey\\" very closely, yet not infringe on copyright laws-and did a miserable job at it.  I WILL NOT purchase the next book.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I thought the game was lots of fun and enjoyable. It was cool to make new objects.I couldn't stop playing the game it was so addictive.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Great. I thoroughly enjoy these games. They are great entertainment for kids. They are not to difficult to play and easy to understand.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a really fun game! but a lot of people don't know how to exit. you go to stuff then the arrow will appear at the bottom. hit home and you exited! as I said... unlike a lot of games like these there a lot of times to EARN acorns not buy them so you can still buy things that cost acorns
B0086700CM|5.0|Fun game. Great to pass time when you only have a few minutes - or seconds in my case. it's very addicting!
034580404X|2.0|I heard all these wonderful things on the news, radio and from friends about this book. I went the whole hog and bought the trilogy! What a mistake!<br /><br />Poorly written, underdeveloped shallow characters, take out 50% of the same same boring sex scenes and this \\"trilogy\\" would only be one long novel.<br /><br />Ana character seems to get more and more pathetic as the book goes on- hard to believe that such a drastic change happens in such a short time.<br /><br />The sex scenes were very \\"vanilla\\" considering this book was suppose to be all about putting the kinky back into bored housewives lives.<br /><br />I wonder if this book was copied from a fifteen year old girls diary- although I am sure even a 15 y/o girl would at least find a thesaurus to describe it better. If I ever see the word murmur in another novel I will instantly be transported back to these crappy ones!<br /><br />Thoroughly disappointed. Don't waste your money. Buy a Mills & Boon, it's predictability is much the same, and the sex scenes are a hell of a lot spicier (also you won't waste a week of your life reading it!).<br /><br />Wish I could get my money back.
B0000CDJPQ|5.0|This little adapter saves me from having to bring multiple FW cables all over the place, I seem to use it all the time!  I gave one away and regretted it so bad that I bought several more of these to ensure I'd never be without again!
0062206281|5.0|Carlos Ruiz Zafon takes the reader through an enchanting adventure in dark and dreary Barcelona on Christmas in 1957. A horrifying threat is made to a loving family, and they must dig up terrifying secrets from the past to destroy the threat in order to survive. The mission begins in a desperate search to uncover secrets and reveal the truth. The intriguing story takes you on an emotional roller-coaster ride as the drama becomes intense. Historic facts and images of scenery are fascinating, the characters come to life as the search continues for lost treasures. An incredible story delivered by a Master storyteller. Highly Recommended!
0738727326|5.0|words can not describe how beautiful this deck is. i love the dream like feel of them. the cards also read well. my only complaint is the little book you get with it. i truly is tiny with a few key words describing each card. i plan to get the big booklet. but i suggest this deck to anyone that collects or reads.
B007KCG7MQ|4.0|This Joe Walsh CD was a gift for a friend.  He said it wa \\"awesome\\".  He likes all the tracks and says it is one of his best.
B00563M11M|5.0|I am amazed again and again how Pratchett manages what he does. The books are still very funny and at the same time very intelligent in how they describe real-life problems and -world issues projected on his \\"Discworld\\". This one centers on the commander of the watch again and his unability to leave his job behind, even if he is supposed to be on vacation in the countryside.<br />And of course there is always a crime around that needs him tending to it. You just have to look hard enough.<br />What happens then is classic police work and crime solving with some interesting insights in the population of the goblins who haven`t been described a lot until now in the Discworld universe.
B007RX32TY|5.0|4th album from Portland/Seattle band--Beautiful, dreamy, electronically driven indie pop songs<br />  with a subtle, soaring eloquence that simultaneously engulfs & soothes.  Gorgeous, uplifting<br />  synth/pop music; captivating & misty with elegant, but simple, melodies that carefully drive to the<br />  heart of the hypnotic beat sense.  Occasional interludes of gentle, dark atmospherics wander<br />  through the mix with thoughtful steps of epic intent.  Most songs place a balanced emphasis on<br />  rhythm and melody, creating an unusually relaxing listening experience that rings with a<br />  mesmerizing strength and purity which rivals the call of undulating sirens.  Dancey shoegaze<br />  dream-pop that gracefully transcends any genre limitations by virtue of flowing self-immersion<br />  and inviting hypno-pop soundwaves.  Something about this album really pulls in the listener.  It<br />  feels somehow like it's much, much better than it should be.  Recalls XX, Sigur Ros, New Order,<br />  M83, Beach House, Debbie Harry/Stevie Nicks, Blonde Redhead.  Nice.
B007JOM7C4|3.0|I couldn't resist the $1.99 offer for this collection. Even though I have poo pooed her art since she hit the scene, the positive reaction her upcoming auto-bio pic has made me curious. And it doesn't hurt that her new single, \\"Wide Awake\\" has caught my ear.....it doesn't sound so novelty like all of her other singles.
B007WFQZF0|5.0|\\"WIXIW\\" (pronounced \\"Wish You\\") is the 6th album from this odd Los Angeles band, and is an<br />  absolutely beautiful album of gently twisted electronic atmospheric exploration.  In a stunning<br />  turnaround from previous noisy, cacophonous art-rock releases, Liars have graced us with<br />  ripples of rolling, dream-wave soundscapes that reflect the surprise most listeners felt when<br />  Radiohead moved from \\"OK Computer\\" to \\"Kid A\\".  Make no mistake, though pop elements do<br />  make an appearance; these are still not generally hum-along tunes.  Instead, we get dark,<br />  shadowy trips through a land of uneasy gauze-covered mystery.  Rhythmic, mechanistic, body-<br />  twisting beats occasionally rise to the surface, peeking through a murky, gray film of tense near-<br />  melody.  These songs, however, have undeniably attractive-- if somewhat alien-- warmth that<br />  arises from the band's uncompromising purity of vision.  Liars have created one of the years<br />  most unexpected, and satisfying, surprises.  Resembles a mix of Radiohead, Faust, i LiKE<br />  TRAiNS, Shriekback, This Heat, Tangerine Dream, Cabaret Voltaire, Fridge, Gazelle Twin.<br />  Really, really good!
B0039208JE|5.0|Now near 25 years removed from its production, Tim Burton's original Batman has slowly lost faded into the background of the modern superhero film landscape. As newer - and admittedly wonderful - superhero movies such as The Dark Knight and The Avengers continue to dazzle and amaze audiences with spectacular special effects and genre-bending writing, the more people seem to forget the much more modest and serene Batman film. Which, I believe, is a grave mistake. For while it may not have had the technological advancements at the time to provide stunning effects and epic storytelling, Tim Burton's directorial effort in Batman is, without question, one of most talented and intelligent efforts ever made in film itself - let alone in the superhero genre.<br /><br />I'll forgo any plot description as I'm sure it's quite well known by this point and more importantly because the plot acts merely as a sandbox for much more brilliant achievements in acting, directing and cinematography.<br /><br />The first I'll touch upon is the cinematography. The beautifully rendered gothic landscape that Anton Furst creates in the sets and scenery of Batman is immediately evident upon first viewing of the film. But what is probably much less evident to most viewers, is just how much Burton and his production team borrowed from German Expressionism and the silent filmmaking of first three decades of the 20th century. As someone who's seen a fair share of silent films - and more importantly - films from that small window in the 1930s were sound was a new and somewhat mysterious concept for filmmakers, it's slowly become apparent to me that advent of sound has led to a deterioration of visual storytelling and acting. In short, sound has made today's filmmakers lazy. Instead of having to show their story, the subtleties of their dramas and characters, they can simply say it, and depends with a lot of visual setup and style.<br /><br />It is that silent film element that really makes Burton's Batman exceptional, and really unlike any other film made since the silent era. With Batman, Burton opens up the playbooks of Fritz Lang and Todd Browning and FW Mernau and  instead of telling his story through dialogue or explicitly stated plot points, instead hones in on a myriad of visual elements to express the true nature and grandeur of Batman as a character.<br /><br />The first way in which he does this is to always show Batman from an outsider's perspective (generally, Vicki's perspective). This creates and element of mystery and darkness to Batman that harkens back more to characters like Dracula and the Phantom of the opera than it does Superman or Spider-Man. Again, taking a page not just from Batman's own roots as a creature of gothic horror, but also from the early cinematic works of Dracula and the Phantom. Burton even uses lighting to highlight and display Batman's subtle eye or facial movements - a trick derived quite directly from 1931's Dracula.<br /><br />The second method derives directly from Michael Keaton's own performance. Few seem to realize it upon first viewing, but Keaton turns in probably the most subtle and brilliant acting performances of any comic book movie before or since. In compliment to Burton's visual storytelling, Keaton mirrors the silent style of filmmaking by conveying the majority of his character's emotions through both facial expressions and emoting through the eyes. He rarely says much in the film - and his version of Bruce Wayne is characterized as an aloof and somehow emotionally immature man who is often overshadowed by the bombastic nature of Jack Nicholson's inspired performance as the Joker.<br /><br />But upon closer inspection, it's really Keaton who steals the show in Batman by portraying the character as both wholly sympathetic and always latently psychotic. This juxtaposition of emotional reliability and psychosis is metaphorical tightrope that is near-impossible traverse - in fact, even in the original source materials, most writers struggle to convey a proper amount of emotional resonance in their characterization of Wayne. Yet, astonishingly, Keaton manages to blend these to aspects together with incredible ease; he wears the persona of Bruce Wayne like a second skin, and purely through whispers and off glances both makes the viewer feel for Bruce Wayne, and remain ever terrified of Batman.<br /><br />Outside of these two most notable aspects, Burton (and Keaton, as through the happenstance of a writers' strike, ended up rewriting much of the script and dialogue with Burton on-set) weaves in numerous subtle character arcs and story beats that seem simple - and perhaps even poorly done at first glance - but through subsequent viewings can be deemed extremely intricate and expertly executed exposition. From Bruce Wayne's reclusive and awkward demeanor reflecting Burton's own thoughts on genius, obsession, and emotional pain - to the simply brilliant relationship built between Michael Gough's Alfred and Bruce - Burton continuously weaves a simple narrative bursting with psychological meaning and emotion.<br /><br />I'm certain most would call it absurd to refer to Burton's Batman as one of the best films ever made - and in truth, it does indeed lack some of the emotional or dramatic punch that a lot of the other great films of history do have - but when analyzed with a keen and disconcerting eye, the amount of intelligence and detail weaved into the execution of Batman far exceeds most of the directorial efforts in the history of American film. And, without question, Batman should be seen at least a few times by anyone interested in the classic silent and European methods of the early days of filmmaking, and - along with Blade Runner and  Burton's followup, Batman Returns - should be considered one of the best tributes to that sophisticated and timeless style.ce materials, most writers struggle to convey a proper amount of emotional resonance in their characterization of Wayne.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I loved this movie!  I'm very happy that Marvel kept the character's back-stories true to form and the whole movie benefited from in.  The movie was great and theaters and will be even better at home.
0380729407|4.0|The title of this book is what initially drew me in. I always wondered where this phrase came from; little did I know it was actually a Shakespeare quote. Either way, I had never read a Ray Bradbury book before and I wanted an easy read that would be suspenseful and satisfying.<br /><br />The book follows the adventure of two young innocent boys and their run-in with an evil carnival that comes to town. I found the friendship between the two boys to be very similar to my childhood friendships, which helped me make a quick fun connection. The circus magic in this book seemed to me to have a little influence in the magical Harry Potter series, although not so deliberate in its fantasy.<br /><br />One of the most unique aspects of this book that I noticed was the usage of a mixture of concrete/abstract imagery to set the scene and describe the characters. When describing the dark figure coming into the room, Bradbury writes, \\"The shadow seemed deliberate in its slowness so as to shingle his flesh and cheesegrate his steadily willed calm.\\" With noun-verbs in descriptions such as \\"cheesegrate\\" and \\"shingle\\" it seems as though we can trace the tendency we have in American English of \\"noun-ing\\" our verbs back to Bradbury. At first, the very detailed and obscure descriptions were a little annoying and hard to read through. However, as I got used to the style of the author, I began to enjoy reading the different adjectives and verbs he would use to paint the picture in my mind.<br /><br />Overall, although a little hard to find initial interest, I found this book to be an interesting and beneficial read. The characters that are brought life in vivid abstract-concrete detail provides for a creative story with enough suspense and emotion to keep you interested until this end of this short read.
B006RUJST6|3.0|This was a perfectly decent book. I was definitely interested in the plot, and I anxiously kept reading to see what would happen next. And when it was through, I got on to buy the next book for my kindle. So, it was definitely a good read.<br /><br />However, I see it was a bit far-fetched and too predictable.

B002ZG981E|5.0|A tour de force. If you love sci-fi, you'll be enamored with this movie; if you arenot a sci-fi fan, you'll love the intrigue and suspense. And it all comes to life with Blu-Ray clarity.<br /><br />I don't purchase very many DVDs, but this is one I *had* to own. You should, too.

B004H1V5RU|5.0|Hi, I wasn't sure about ordering the perplexus epic because of the reviewers that recived a ball with broken parts. I took the risk since those buyers recived a good replacement service. When I recived it, I looked at all the parts and screws to make sure mine was in good condition. I'm happy to say that everything is how it should be.<br /><br />This is my first perplexus toy and I went for the epic to be sure to have a good challenge. I'm 19 years old and I really like the perplexus epic! I wish I could buy one of the giant ones haha. The puzzle is difficult at first, but I'm improving fast.<br /><br />This is a great toy and if you want a real challenge, buy it !<br /><br />I put 4 stars for durability because even if the puzzle is in good shape, it feels fragile so this toy may not be good for really young people. for me this isn't a problem since I handle it carefully.<br /><br />I can't say enough how great is this toy !

B007XU0N1G|5.0|Wow, ever since breaking free of the contractual limbo they were in with Magic Circle Music Rhapsody have been on a tear, three great albums in as many years and now that Rhapsody has split into 2 bands, Luca Turilli's Rhapsody and Rhapsody of Fire, Luca seems even more driven to see his visions come to fruition and prove that he was the real creative genius behind the music ,... and prove that he does on this album.<br />He calls it Cinematic metal and that is an apt description for the audial journey he wants to take you on is like looking at a DaVinci painting or watching an epic movie, that is the experience he is trying to create for the ears, and for people like myself that eat this stuff up this is an absolute eargasm.<br />I was worried who could fill the vocal duties since Fabio has stayed on with RoF, but relative unknown Allesandro Conti is an incredible find and slips into the position without missing a beat.<br />I like the fact that this is not a concept album like the previous efforts and the subject matter spans everything from the ancient to the modern to the spiritual, mixing musical elements of Cinematic Score,Neo-classical metal, melodic metal, Opera and even a dash of Jazz, and it all meshes incredibly well.<br />Luca has set the bar high with this release and now I am curious what his former bandmates in RoF can come up with to compete. It's sad to think that this band was once managed by Manowar who almost ruined their careers since any single track off this has more musical diversity, melodies and craftsmanship than the ENTIRETY of the new Lord Of Steel album, and that is not an overstatement, it's like comparing a DaVinci masterpiece to a pre-school finger painting.<br />Bottom Line: If you like Cinemtaic, Neo-Classical, bombastic and epic metal, you will like this, and If you're already a Rhapsody fan it's a no-brainer purchase.

I've definitely read better and more interesting stories like this, but I think the thing that irritates me the most with the whole series is how I have to read through the childish drivel of a college virgin on her first sex-capades and the author thinks I'm going to believe that every moment of every encounter was some mind blowing experience. The character complains about the childish and manipulative ways of her new love, but overall she's even more annoying when she's just as childish and manipulative in her response to so many of his issues. Not everything is conquered by sex, and I'm excited personally for this trilogy to be over with so I can move onto better written material.
B000FA675C|5.0|One of my all time favorites.  It's a fascinating blend of religion and science that creates a bit of controversy, but very thought provoking.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I really loved this book; the imagery created is so detailed and exquisite that I wondered what the author would come up with next. No, it doesn't have a \\"stop your heart\\" plot, but that's not what I read it for. It really is a pleasure to read a book that transports you from normal life and creates that dreamlike feeling so well. As I read, I'd find myself engrossed in it so much that, when I raised my head from my Kindle, I expected to look around and see everything in black, white, and gray, and was surprised at the bursts of color in my \\"real\\" world! It's escapism at its best!

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I've been using this cover for a few months now and I'm  mostly happy with it. It's absolutely done the job as far as protection goes... I toss it in my bag, drop it off the bed or couch, take it to work or the lake and the Kindle still looks brand new... So does the cover for that matter! It gets propped up on the little stand a few times a day for videos and that's working out great, too. Another plus is that it's very lightweight! The only thing that disappointed me, really, was the wrist/hand strap. It's really not that tight or thick or heavy-duty enough to do what I thought it would do... I use it to put my hand in when I'm holding the kindle above me as I lay in bed to read... But, you still really have to hold onto the actual kindle or it'll fall on your face. :/ The strap is just too flimsy. If it weren't for that one flaw I'd give it 5 stars, tho. Too bad it's such a big flaw. :(
B006VKKAWQ|3.0|In terms of packaging, this is a disaster. no expected original Lp cover and label art of Toscanini's RCA releases are restored as you can find in numbers of so called \\"complete collection\\" from Sony/RCA in the past several years. I think this is the biggest mistake Sony/RCA ever made for this release.
B0086700CM|3.0|I have a kindle fire and this game was fun at first but it gets very boring. Its always the same. Me nd my brother would play over and over but its soo hard to get alot of coins. I rarely play this anymore because it skips and and the person will just run through things Its not good on the kindle fire :(
B007IXWKUK|3.0|This book is an easy (a little too easy) to read story - the characters are not well developed.  There are explicit sexual scene and some language but nothing too terribly bad.  I guess it is not too bad for the type of story you are reading...it's just hard to keep that in mind when you are used to reading books with more developed story lines and characters.  All in all - an easy summer read.  You won't be upset when the kids interrupt you or you're too tired to read any longer.

B003L77GRO|5.0|What can I say about \\"Dexter\\"?  Best show on television and season five didn't let down.  Michael C. Hall is awesome!  Whole cast is wonderful.  Doesn't matter to me who \\"guest stars\\" on the show.......I am a fan of MCH and his cast.  Season five doesn't disappoint!
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app is just amazing. I can download songs and videos for free and it is very high quality. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.
1936608898|5.0|This book empowers the reader to escape the \\"diet\\" mentality and confusion caused by the barrage of conflicting reports that flood our media. In easy-to-follow, bite-size pieces, the Hartwigs share a wealth of scientifically-supported information that they have gleaned from personal experience as well as real-world experience with thousands of Whole30 participants. As they explain, our bodies are finely-tuned machines that run better on particular kinds of fuel. Miraculously better, in some cases. Want to look better naked? Want to recover from auto-immune disorders? Want to avoid cancer? Want to heal any number of niggly body issues? Eat foods that support those goals. Wow, is that ever simple. After a lifetime of worrying about calories, fat, whole grains, \\"diet\\" foods, fat [you name it!], this made me feel like I could stop frantically chasing health and just relax ... and give my body some TLC.<br /><br />It turns out that our cravings are leading us in the right direction ... but our modern lives confuse the issue. It Starts with Food explains how different kinds of food can positively or negatively affect our health by triggering different hormonal responses. The conversational style of the book, as well as the testimonials of folks who've improved their own health by eating well, make it an easy read.<br /><br />... and just when you think you're done reading, the appendix offers one of the best \\"how-to\\" guides to cooking that I have ever read. I never used to cook and can use all of the help I can get in this arena. I have several paleo cookbooks, all of which serve their purpose, but this appendix simultaneously offers some really unique flavor combinations and a very simple way to pull it together. They really \\"teach you how to fish\\" ... once you realize how simple delicious meals really are, the combinations and possibilities are endless. The ideas are completely customizeable (is that a word?) to your own palette. I made the beef with broccoli last night and it was fantastic. :)and it was fantastic. :)
B006Y5EMHM|5.0|I absolutely loved this show!! Once I saw one episode I had to see all of them! I was completely addicted! The script, plot and acting were fantastic!! And the VOICES!!!

B0072GPQNG|5.0|I love war movies and this one was great with great action, but without the fowl language.  And my wife loves horses so it was a movie that we both enjoyed together.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love being able to switch translations to better understand the meaning.  This app makes that so easy to do.  There are also extra notes and clarifying information for some of the translations that you can open up while you read.  I also use the reading plans to help me stay on track  An excellent resource!

B000VSAEYI|5.0|Big enough for 4 or 5 kids under 5.  They just love it! Bright colors, slide, water spray from the side-- Grandkids had so much fun and I ordered just in time for the hot weather.  I haven't had any problems with this pool--although you do have to have some type of automated air pump to fill---do not think you can fill without this help. I totally recommend.

0441020712|2.0|One of Reynolds worst books (comparable to Century Rain). I generally enjoy his writing, but wooden, shallow characters and a go-nowhere plot really turned me off of this one.
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is a fun time killer. You run on a path or get eaten by hideous monkeys. Not the most stimulating, but cool concept. Great on my Fire.
0061692042|5.0|Never have I read a book with such magnificent descriptive evocation of character and place.  In the first 200 pages, there are only four main characters: a mother, father, and teenage twins.  In those 200 pages, we can visualize every aspect of that family's life, so compelling is the description of every minute detail.  For those who require plot-driven stories, this will frustrate them.  But if you love good writing, and are willing to spend a few days with a story that is at the same time tragic and (somewhat) hopeful, you will find this to be a masterpiece, as I did.

You 've got to be kidding me !!!
B00006I53S|4.0|I am not a professional or expert photographer...so take these comments with this in mind.<br /><br />I have two Canon cameras, a 40D and a 60D.  I have two other Canon IS USM lenses, a 17-55 f2.8 and a 70-300 f4-f5.6.  I bought this lens to fill the gap between the two.<br /><br />I haven't had this new lens very long, but here are my initial impressions...  First, it's shorter (when zoomed out), lighter and smaller in diameter than the 17-55 f2.8 lens that was previously our typical carry-around lens.  Obviously, it doesn't work as well in low light as the f2.8 lens, but that's to be expected.  Still, it takes very nice pictures, and doesn't seem too limited by the smaller aperture.  The colors seem accurate, and the IS seems to work very well.<br /><br />The barrel doesn't rotate, either when zooming or focusing, so it is possible to use filters that rely on a fixed orientation.  This is not the case with my 70-300mm zoom...that lens rotates as it focuses.  Though it isn't a big deal to me, others might be more concerned with this.<br /><br />My only complaint with this lens is that, unlike my other two Canon IS USM zoom lenses, it will extend under it's own weight when the camera is facing down.  And there is no lock (again, unlike my other two lenses) to keep it in it's shortest length during transport.  This annoys me when I'm carrying the camera.<br /><br />Comparing pictures taken with this lens to those taken with my 70-300 lens (at 70 and 135...the widest two lengths common to both lenses)...this lens seemed to have slightly more vivid colors, and a wider DOF.  The depth of field was to be expected, I'd think, given the shorter lens and slightly larger aperture.  The more vivid colors, I guess, could be explained the same way, though the difference was very small.  Both lenses produced very nice results, IMO.<br /><br />My lens was a white-box lens...which was not mentioned in the product description.  I half-expected this, given that the price I paid was low...lower even than the current prime price shown on Amazon for this item.  But I would like to have seen the item description accurately state this up front.  The lens came wrapped in a single layer of bubble-wrap inside a plain white cardboard box.  This was, in turn, shipped inside a slightly larger box and padded with packing paper.  There was no documentation or software included (save for the warranty card, which WAS included), as you'd get with a lens sold in retail packaging...so be aware that this is the case.  Nonetheless, my lens arrived quickly, and intact.  My order was fulfilled by ALLTIMEDEALS.low...lower even than the current prime price shown on Amazon for this item.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and find it very exciting .<br />The author is pretty good , able to create a strong image of both the male and female characters.<br />I really love the female character and her personality is strong and tough . Also she is clever and skillful which attracted me a lot.<br />Together with all these excited an thrill scene, the strong relationship between the female character and people from other district touches me. I am an emotional person and can cry easily , some of the scene really made me weep.
B008COD5OO|5.0|This movie was amazing especially if you can relate. If you cant or you dont have a crazy party side to you u wont enjoy it. This movie is a sit down and watch every detail from beginning to end to get the full effect. This movie had me going crazy for a week about it and I would recommend it to everybody. CHECKK THIS MOVIE OUT IT IS AWESOME!!!!
B008FWI8OA|5.0|I remember seeing promos for this show but never thought to give it the light of day because it was from the USA network.  I decided to give it a chance in a hotel on a business trip and was instantly hooked.  I was waiting to see if the beginning of Season 2 still continued to impress me and so far it has.  I'm very surprised and anticipating the next episode.  Give this show a shot.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|ok to bad I can't rate if six stars no 7 so much better than the first spiderman game glad u can spin webs. so fun worth 7 dollars but I wish they would of made it so on the main screen you could choose to just. sling webs overall great fun buy it
B006LSZECO|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet. Prior to this book I was in a reading depression....It had been months since I had read anything  that I really couldn't put down. This book changed all of that! I did not read any reviews prior to this book, and I'm glad because I had zero expectations and nothing was spoiled for me. I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN. Great summer read!

B002RI9MZC|2.0|This novel was overly long. It could have done with considerably more editing. As someone else has said, the constant name dropping of various famous figures got rather tedious.He was recruited to Naval Intelligence by Ian Fleming, is best mates with Hemmingway, plays golf with the Duke of Windsor, and unwittingly gets recruited to the Baader-Meinhof Organisation...I ask you! I couldn't warm to any of the characters as they were all pretty selfish and morally corrupt..Mounstuart has an affair with one of his oldest friend's wives. I do not think I would read another novel by this author.
B005LAII0S|1.0|I bought this movie because I was having a friend over, and we have a mutual interest in fantasies and fairy tales. Generally we can find *something* we like about it, but we couldn't even sit through this. I finished it later so I could review it, or else I would have just forgotten about it.<br /><br />Whatever you do, DON'T FORGET that Julia Roberts is in this movie. Remember that Julia Roberts plays the \\"evil\\" queen. She is on the posters, the blu ray cover, and on every other post on the movie's Facebook page. From the time they first started marketing this to the end of the flick, they could not stop harping on her being the star. She got way too much screen time considering the plot (what there was of it), and I think they were counting on her star power to sell more tickets.<br /><br />From the promotion, I thought I was going to at least get some good eye candy, and I did in the animated opening. Then they kept showing the queen in the same yellow dress. [[ASIN:B00795C5X4 I've seen that tiara somewhere before.]] You keep thinking it will get better, but it doesn't. The wardrobe at the queen's wedding was a bitter disappointment, and by the end I think they were digging things out of a recycle bin.<br /><br />They must have blown the budget by the time they got to animating the lake and the beaver dam in Narnia. Every time Julia Roberts went there, they used the same sequence with her rising up from the water, and the exterior looked like something I could have rendered in Bryce about ten years ago.<br /><br />The movie is just bad. Remember when it was cool to see a girl swordfight? Now it's just cheesy. They do this in a montage, too. I'm all for strong female protagonists, but they need to stop doing it at the expense of making the men into nothing but comedy fodder and complete fools.<br /><br />The comedy isn't funny. I get that Julia Roberts' beauty treatments are gross, but I bet they didn't sell a lot of popcorn during that segment. Armie Hammer does his level best to play the bumbling prince, but they don't give him a lot to work with. He is capable of much more. It's hard to play a buffoon when they forgot the funny in the script.<br /><br />It's a criminal misuse of Nathan Lane. Even Lane can't make this movie funny. I was SO looking forward to seeing him, and it was AGONIZING to watch that much talent wasted. THEN Sean Bean actually manages to chew the scenery when he finally shows up onscreen with the horrible dialogue he's given. It's like watching Ned Stark poof in out of nowhere, deliver a few super serious lines and then just stand around. (That's literally what he does, too.)<br /><br />Lily Collins' song just doesn't fit with the movie. It looks like they made Sean Bean, Nathan Lane and Armie Hammer watch while they filmed it, too. It was bad enough watching it on screen; I can't imagine having to see and hear it live. You don't see Julia Roberts standing around, though, because she's the STAR, you know, in case you forgot.<br /><br />I can't believe I almost gave it two stars-- for what? [[ASIN:B007HHSFBK Alan Menken's score]] is the only good thing about it, but you can get that separately. Don't waste your time or your money. It never gets any better than the opening sequence, and you'll be wishing you could forget it.

B006GH1YBA|2.0|I have never read an F Scott Fitzgerald novel before so thought I'd start with this. Whilst Fitzgerald is undoubtedly an excellent writer, this novel left me cold. The descriptions of the places and the atmosphere of the setting were really evocative, however I found the main characters, Anthony, Gloria and their friends cold, calculating and shallow. Gloria is obsessed by her looks and Anthony thinks of himself as an intellectual too good to have to work. They are complacent, and their apathy towards anything but their pursuit of pleasure and their inheritance comes through. Although I do not doubt that Anthony & Gloria loved each other, they loved themselves more. Their passion for each other was lacking. Maybe the author never intended us to like them, howeverI disliked them so much I didn't care in the end what the outcome would be.
0871404133|5.0|The book is most excellent, and I believe should be read by any freshmen entering to take biology, or for that matter any student of biology. It is very well written and provides ample evidence and support for the theories contained within.<br /><br />Change is hard for everyone, it's no different in the scientific community, and debate over ideas is a good sign that we are trying to come to a better understanding. Wilson, I believe, makes a very good argument that many instances where kin selection has been applied can very equally be explained by group selection. I would say that Wilson necessarily say, in the book at least, that kin selection is wrong, more specifically he proposes an alternative hypothesis, that can equally be successfully applied to the areas of kin selection, as well as additional areas. Scientists who have spent their live's assuming kin selection to be true will obviously find any idea to the contrary dubious, and as the idea became so entrenched in science, it really is shocking how many people have agreed with Wilson.<br /><br />Read the book for your self, I believe it makes a persuasive argument, but it doesn't say that it is the final word, decide for yourself. Personally Kin selection never jived with me and felt miss applied to some situations.<br /><br />Cheers

B005LAIGOQ|2.0|If I were young, or hadn't seen very many ghostly horror movies, this might have been pretty good. But I'm not, and I have, so this was a real yawn fest.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. Radcliffe is a solicitor in Jolly Old. He's depressed because he lost his wife during the birth of their only son. His job performance is getting worse and he's in debt. His boss gives him one last chance. He needs to go to an old, dilapidated house in some town and straighten out the paperwork after its final owner has passed. Weird stuff starts to happen and kids start to die. He gets sidetracked and needs to get to the bottom of things.<br /><br />This is all so old. The creepy looking dolls, the creepy wind-up toys. The cob-webs and gloominess. Things half seen. Clues behind wallpaper. I can't believe they're still using this stuff. There are a couple of jump scares which, as any film maker should know, no longer cut it. The music score was too obvious. It underscored the on-screen happenings with a thick, black magic marker. There were a couple of genuinely creepy scenes in the third act but, by that time, it was too late.<br /><br />On the production side, they DID try. The sets, though old news, were done well. The costuming was decent and good attention was paid to period detail. The acting was decent enough, though I found Radcliffe to be rather stiff. And I liked the way they ended the story. They could have sapped it up but they chose a higher road.<br /><br />This isn't bad. Maybe it's made for a younger audience that hasn't been through the decades of horror films as have I.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|I know there will be people that will not like this album because they are too stuck on Hybrid Theory and Meteora. However, as an album I think this is a very good album overall and believe people will like this album as well. Here my rundown of the songs:<br /><br />Lost in the Echoes: 5/5 This is one of few songs on the album that will make people remember HT, though people will argue it doesn't due to electro mix (people must face the facts people change their sounds, the Beatles did it and so have many many artists).<br /><br />In My Remains 4.5/5 Nice rock song, ending of the song only thing that bothers me (not that it is bad but just doesn't have a good pace with how the song begins)<br /><br />Burn It Down 5/5 lead single, most people know it, most seem to like it don't need to add anymore to it.<br /><br />Lies Greed Misery 5/5 I believe this song has the potential to be a single, but think a couple of other songs are probably better off. I really can't wait to see this performed in concert but not sure how it will be performed since some of my favorite parts are the electro repeats of Mike Shinoda's rapping. Also, has Chester screaming in it, can't go wrong with that, if ya liked \\"Bleed It Out\\" has that same kinda Vibe.<br /><br />I'll Be Gone 4/5 This song is good, but for some reason it sounds a lot like \\"In My Remains\\" which I should rate it just as good as that, but I think \\"In My Remains\\" is better.<br /><br />Castle of Glass 4/5 I personally love the fact that Shinoda likes to sing in a bunch of songs, he has a good voice and should express it more. I can see why people may not like it since they are used to him rapping, so I am pretty sure the people that won't like this song are the people that fall into that category.<br /><br />Victimized 4/5 I really really love this song, my only real complaint is the fact that it is 1:46 long. I felt this could have possibly been a single, but do to the length it will not be and is a shame.<br /><br />Roads Untraveled 5/5 This is a really really depressing song and I love it because of that, which is kind of an odd reason to like it but hey we all need some kinda sadness in out life hehe<br /><br />Skin to Bone 2.5/5 I don't dislike this song but when I hear this I just don't feel anything for it. Just seems like a very bland song to me.<br /><br />Until it Breaks 3/5 I like the electronic in it, Mike has some good raps in this and Chester for the chorus is ok. I feel the same way for this song as I did for \\"Skin to Bone\\" but like it a bit more.<br /><br />Tinfoil+Powerless 5/5 I combined the two since \\"Tinfoil\\" is an introduction to this song and nothing more. I really love this song, the lyrics are very powerful and the electronic aspect of the song is what makes this song better. Also, to me this is Chester best singing on the entire album. My favorite song on the album.<br /><br />Overall I think the album is definitely an improvement over \\"A Thousand Suns\\" (although I did like that album as well) and believe many LP fans will be happy with how the album is.
1451608659|5.0|Off Balance by Dominique Moceanu is a revealing memoir by one of America's best gymnasts to compete in the Olympics. At only fourteen years old she earned a gold medal, but her journey to get there was not as supportive as many may have been lead to believe. In this memoir, she is finally able to tell the truth about the world of competitive gymnastics, and also reveals a major life secret that her family kept from her until recently.<br /><br />Off Balance is not your average memoir of an Olympic athlete about how they got to the top of their career and won the gold. Though Moceanu did in fact win the gold, this is not the main focus of her story. I applaud her for writing such an honest and revealing memoir about her life and the sport of gymnastics.<br /><br />I found this to be a very easy to read memoir that was truly captivating enough to read rather quickly. Once I started reading the real story about one of my childhood heroes, I was hooked and couldn't stop. Moceanu is by far one of my favorite gymnastics, and after reading her story, I am even more amazed by her today and consider her one of the top females I admire. She is a true inspiration and I hope that the young gymnasts starting out learn from her example, and can look up to the positive role model that she is.<br /><br />This is an excellent memoir that I highly recommend for everyone to read that is involved in sports or enjoys watching the Olympics, especially gymnastics. The 2012 London Olympics starts in July and this would be a fantastic book to read before watching the gymnastics portion of the Olympics.<br /><br />* Thank you to the publisher of Off Balance, Touchstone, for providing me with a copy of this book for review. All opinions expressed are my own.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am not into BDSM, and it was difficult for me to get through the first half of this book, but once I was through it, I really enjoyed it.  The next two are even better, and I wish there was more.
B0080CL0HM|5.0|I liked the movie and I pick movies apart. The connection was great and this was the first time for me to use the movie amazon process. The only disadvantage in the online process was that if you wanted to go back and listen to something you missed it took a few seconds to rewind back but nothing drastic. Here is my honest opinion of the film. Just remember that everyone has an opinion. I cannot say without being honest that Robert Pattinson did not embed the character fully until about half way through the film. But one cannot deny this man has talent. At the time, you are looking at a 23 year old man with limited experience in portraying adult males. I think considering all, he can hold his head up with pride. The viewer can see that there was definite ease between Ricci and Pattinson because their performances flowed and I give Ricci credit, she performed well off of Pattinson. I feel that Thomas gave an outstanding performance as well. She flowed great with Pattinson. That love scene between Pattinson and Thomas was exceptional! It displayed the pure callousness of Pattinson's character and the starved mature woman's need for affectionate worth. Ricci pulled off her character's need for sexual enrichment and you get Pattinson's connection with this woman and how she expects little back by placing very little demands on him. In my opinion, which is like belly buttons, everyone has one, Thurman was a miscast. Her performance wasn't really the issue, she did well with the character, however, she wasn't as receptive to Pattinson, as if there was a hidden reluctance to let go, which also seemed to bar him a little. Also, Thurman's raspy voice gives less than a gentile female ora. Her blonde hair also fails to promote a sense of intelligence because if anything, Thurman's character was brilliant in both common and learning sense. Actually, Thurman and Pattinson's characters share commonalities. Now to me the greatest disappointment of this movie had nothing at all todo with the actors because, it was pulled off in the end by the actors. It was held in the hands of the director who controlled the cinematography. I am a lover of period films and I cannot imagine this movie with its set budget and the director's attention to beautiful period details to help transport you back to Paris 1800s, only then to trash all that work by staying close up on most of the shots. Mentally, you couldn't move into that century for lack of visual reference to make the actors believable that they really are in Paris of 1800. I loved Thomas and Pattinson's shot at the flower cart on the street and the awesome church scene. Excellent scenes and performances! Same with Thurman and Pattinson's Cannes scenes. Loved Pattinson's scene when entering in his home asking the location of his wife to their butler. All were enhanced by the beautiful visual setting. You cannot fail to brag on Meaney, Grainger, and Glenister who were also perfectly cast and played out their characters wonderfully. I read a review that assailed Pattinson for not having the acting chops to pull off an 1800's Parisian gentleman. This person clearly missed the character. Duroy wasn't a gentleman by birth at all and Pattinson did portray this clearly of Duroy, as well as, development of this gentleman nature in the character the more the character was exposed to the environment of the rich. Maybe the director should have emphasized this developing change by the desire and intent in Pattinson's character more in the movie verbally. Pattinson pulled it off that Duroy was young, impulsive, selfish, vindictive, sensually driven. lazy and callous. He played off well with most of the characters in the movie. There was only a small amount of over dramatic performing in one scene, the one with all the men at the table at the newspaper office, where he is annoyed and tempered. But by the same token who can deny the wonderful anger performance with Thomas and Pattinson, and the scene where Pattinson orders them all from his house. Excellent acting on Pattinson's part, as well as, his counterparts.! If you like period films, this movie will entertain you. Those who are spitting at Pattinson for thinking he is only an Edward Twilight character, well, shame on you! This man pulled off an excellent performance in Remember Me and can be considered solid in that he pulled off this movie at such a young age. I feel he has talent and will be like wine with time. He will have a fine taste as vintage manifest. Pattinson has the talent to be one of the greats of his time if he plays his cards right. He will be vintage. This coming from a non Twihard and someone who believes that Pattinson deserves a fair chance to perform without being ostracized for an outstanding performance he did in a franchise movie. Watching Pattinson's performance develop in this movie and seeing Remember Me, I just imagine, Edward Cullen, was a less than challenging role for this man. You need to see this man in the character he is portraying on the screen while you are watching the movie and let go of Edward.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|My only complaint about the book is that I want more.  I love the whole trilogy.  I think book 3 could have been expanded into another book or so, and I would have loved them.  I love the romance in these books.  I would love to get it all from his point of view.  Once I started it, I didn't want to put it down.  I see all the negative reviews about the editing and such, but that stuff didn't bother me.  The love story is what got me.  And I don't read romance novels.  I normally read mysteries.  I recommend it to everyone I discuss it with.  I know you definitely have to read them all with an open mind.  I struggled with the first half of the first book, but am considering reading them again now that I know it turns out so well.  I might can handle his control freakness better.

1475143389|3.0|Let me first start by saying the 3 star rating is purely due to just reading this book.<br /><br />I have been lifting for several years now and just haven't found a program that can boost my gains. I do believe that if followed correctly that this program can help provide anyone with a program that will exceed your goals. I plan to report back on my gains after 12 weeks (starting day is today) and I will adjust my rating at that time.<br /><br />I was actually directed to this book by my personal trainer (irony i suppose), as I was frustrated with my lack of solid gains on programs like \\"The Winning factor\\". After discussions and sets to focus on my technique and recovery we both noticed that my preferred range is between 4-8 sets of heavy weights. Once that was known I was told to get this book and read it from cover to cover. I must say that this book is very insightful and provides great direction on not only how to lift properly, but how to eat as well. Diet is highly debated (as stated in the book), but to me it accounts for 80% of what I see not only in the mirror, but also what I hit in the gym.<br /><br />This is a great read and I am looking forward to the program (as I will follow this program line for line).<br /><br />Thank you Mike for providing a realistic outlook on not only how to eat and lift, but the marketing behind supplements and the BS that is pushed down our throats.<br /><br />- Joseph
1936608898|5.0|After having read several books on Paleo, I found \\"It Starts With Food\\" to be just right. Not too  \\"sciency\\" but still very informative in an engaging way. This is the one I will recommend first when someone wants more info on \\"that diet thing\\" I 'm doing. I really appreciated the recommendations for those with autoimmune conditions and IBD. I have been on a quest to find effective methods to address the root causes of autoimmune issues, because the standard medical protocols use very toxic drugs (or surgery) to tackle the symptoms without giving any thought to cause or prevention. It has been very frustrating, but everything I have read about Paleo nutrition gives me hope that natural healing can occur. This book should be on your required reading list if you suffer an autoimmune condition.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie yet, whether you are single or married, do yourself a favor and watch this movie. This is one of the BEST I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. Thank you for making this movie Mr. Alex Kendrick and associates, we need more people like you! I also recommend that people should watch FACING THE GIANTS. Another Alex Kendrick movie.<br />We have a room-full of movies in our collection and this one is on the top of our go-to-films that we watch again and again. Worth much more than what you pay for! Watch it!

B002HJ9PTO|2.0|The sound quality is better than my on-camera mic, and it is cheap enough to be treated as almost disposable.  But the lav is a pain to use:<br /><br />(1) The clip falls off easily and I lost mine within 2 days.  Now the mic is even harder to use without the clip.<br /><br />(2) The mic has an on-off switch to preserve battery life, but there is no light or other way to remind you whether it's on or off so it is easy to (A) leave it off while recording or (B) leave it on while not recording.<br /><br />(3) There is no indication whether the battery is dead or even installed properly.<br /><br />(4) There are no instructions.<br /><br />(5) The cable is very long.  I would rather have a short cable with a high-quality extension.<br /><br />(6) The included wind muff also falls off easily.  I expect to lose it soon.

B005B19UPE|4.0|Sarah's Key is a heartbreaking story about a family living in France during the second world war.  The family is rounded up except Sarah locks her little brother in a secret hiding place in their apartment the morning the ss officers come to take the family away.  The story unfolds as the life of Sarah and others she meets over the years unfold. The story is very sad.  The book was recommended by friends.  None of us knew about France's awful involvement in the destruction of the Jewish people living in France. I would not recommend the book if you are highly sensitive to the terrible things happening during this terrible time in history. I purchased this book through Amazon.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I loved the album from the first time I listened to it, that happens VERY rarely.  I enjoy the creativity and the lyrics. Highly recommend it.
B00622B3MY|5.0|Note: I saw this movie in 3-D with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />If you loved Disney/PIXAR'S Cars, you'll love Cars 2. This sequel is James Bond for kids as Puss In Boots is Zorro and The Great Mouse Detective is Sherlock Holmes are geared toward families with young children. Cars 2 reunites most of the original cast for a brand-new adventure that is packed with hilarious comedy and great storytelling, along with yet another strong message about the importance of friendship. Academy Award winner Sir Michael Caine plays Finn McMissile, a spy car ala James Bond with loads of gadgets and snappy one-liners. Perfectly family-friendly.<br /><br />Rated G.
B007KDFWRG|4.0|It's hard not to compare this to other great live recordings like The Allman Brothers at Filmore East or Derek & The Dominos Live at the Filmore. TTB has made a clasic recording that I'll enjoy through the years. As far as live recordings go, the sound quality is excellent and the song selections are representative of their excellent band. Sure, there are a few minutes that I could take or leave, but isn't that the case with most live events? To me, that is part of the live experience... moments of brilliance, moments of imprefection all in a unique experience that shows a candid side of the musician. The TTB is made of excellent musicians and their live presentation on this recording is 4&1/2 stars. I very much appreciate them bringing back this kind of rich soulful music. Good times with great musicians.<br /><br />Advice? Go see them live! I did in Houston and it was one of the best concerts I have ever witnessed. The Everybody's Talkin' recording as good as it is, pales in comparison to the show I saw. WOW! I hope this recording hints at what will be in the next studio effort.<br /><br />BTW - Like Derek Trucks? Check out his work with the Allman Brothers on their \\"Live at the Beacon Theater\\" DVD. It's outstanding. Like the TTB and want to see them live? Check out the Crossroads Guitar Festival 2010 DVD (or on Netflix). The TTB play a few songs with guest Warren Haynes.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I don't like that the game goes on and on. it never ends. there needs to be a better point system so there is a winner. I played a random player and now I cant end the game. it gets boring after awhile because it doesn't end.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought the book to see what all the humbug was about...and i regret the fact that i wasted my 10 dollars and time with it. If you have never read an erotic novel before, i can understand why you would think its a great read, but for those who have, look another direction. its repetitive, the writing stinks, and the sex scenes are so BORING. im having a hard time even finishing it. i had so much hope for this book, and it COMPLEATLY let me down. dont understand why its a best seller...i wish i could get my money back.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|Apparently there have been bootleg tapes of this 1981 performance, when legendary blues guitarist Muddy Waters was booked into Buy Guy's Chicago \\"juke joint\\" (small club with tables right up against the small stage) and Mick, Keith and Ron showed up for front row seats. But this first \\"official\\" release (with wonderful brand new sound restoration) is the first time I've seen it. It's truly a historical moment and Eagle Vision has given it a nice packaging and a very reasonable price. (The DVD itself is under $15.00 and the combo pack with the audio CD with 11 of the 13 numbers is only five bucks more.<br /><br />The whole show lasts 106 minutes though, in reality, there are two numbers up front by Waters band, without the Hootchie Cootchie Man himself. And while Jagger, Richards and Wood are on stage with Waters for quite a few songs, both Waters and Jagger leave the stage for two songs by guitarist/vocalist Lefty Dizz, though Wood and Richards remain on stage. Oh, I forgot the Junior Wells gets to squeeze on the small stage as well.<br /><br />Waters sings his classics and plays on some of them (he puts away the guitar for a few numbers).<br /><br />The camera work is super with nice close ups and you can really enjoy Waters and Jagger riffing with each other.<br /><br />The DVD adds two bonus performances and an 8 page booklet with some photos and an essay by Robert Gordon that - in text - pretty much describes what you see on your screen.<br /><br />Definitely a must-have for both Blues fans and Stones fans.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"

1594630844|5.0|I almost never read advice or self-help books. While this book technically falls into that category, it is, in my estimation, miles apart from most such books. This book grew out of a five-year research project with about 1200 older Americans, so it's not some expert du jour spouting forth his opinions on how to live your life. Nor is it a book of inspirational essays that leave you feeling good for a few minutes, but with no real tools to change your life.<br /><br />The book is broken down into six themes, including love, work, parenting, and minimizing life regrets, with five key lessons within each theme. The lessons are distilled from interviews with older Americans and reflect themes that emerged in the course of the many interviews. Each chapter has a \\"refrigerator list\\" at the end summarizing each lesson in a few take-away words.<br /><br />It would be a mistake to read the refrigerator lists and skip the rest of the chapter, though. The book is well-organized and clearly written, entertaining, yet with practical suggestions for benefiting from the hard-won wisdom of our elders. There are just enough anecdotes to vividly illustrate the lessons, but not so many that the lessons get lost in them. It's an easy read, but a substantive one.<br /><br />I am so glad that I chanced to read about this book in a travel magazine. My niece and nephews in their twenties and early thirties can expect to receive copies as gifts.
0439023513|3.0|I absolutely loved the first two books.  I loved the characters that were developed.  I felt liked I knew everyone in the story in a personal way and I love it when a author can do that. Above all though, I was in love with the relationship between Katniss and Peeta and even the added love triangle with Gale. If this is your favorite part as well I'm sorry to say but you will most likely be disappointed in this conclusion of the series as I was.  I realize that Ms. Collins was mostly like trying to reflect reality of what these characters lives would be after everything they have gone through and witnessed but I don't think the end did justice to the characters and love story she created.<br /><br />Spoiler alert:<br /><br />The most notable disappointing thing to me: When they rescue Peeta and he has obviously hijacked I hate how Katniss doesn't try harder to help him.  She even comes to the realization of that and how if it were the other way around Peeta would do everything he could to remind her of their love and to reach her but she makes no real effort except for one little kiss to keep him sane.  I kept thinking the pearl, the pearl, give him the pearl Katniss!! It will help him remember!! She holds on to it the whole time as a token of that love but never tries to help him remember what that pearl reminders her of!?! Come on!  If felt like to me that the love story that made me love these books and characters was almost completely undone in this book.

B001PPLJIQ|5.0|I read the book some years ago and enjoyed it so much that I recommended it to others who also enjoyed it. I will not comment extensively on it because Andrew Ellington already did so, and did so well, on amazon. I will only add that this film has a pathetic aura to it, but it is so well acted and the plot is so good that even people who dislike pathetic films will enjoy this one. The pathetic aspect is one that quite a few great writers have addressed in novels and short stories. It is about the simple man or woman who because of their simplicity is unable to live a proper life and unavoidably suffers. Examples are Gustave Flaubert's \\"A Simple Soul\\" and I. L. Peretz's \\"Bontshe the Silent.\\"

1594744769|5.0|Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children by Ransom Riggs is the third book I bought. I bought all Young Adult books because they are fast reads and I have something to share with my 17 year old daughter, JL.<br /><br />Well, this book is a delight despite the horrible beginning of the tale.

His grandfather's last dying words leads him to a Welsh Island off of Ireland- that took in his grandfather, a war orphan.<br /><br />What is fun is reading excellent prose and in four or six words Riggs describes an odd child, and turn the page and you are looking at a vintage photo. This does not interrupt the plot, but enhances.<br /><br />Get your copy today. Its a children's chapter book, but the story is robust for adults, too.

B000E6GCJS|5.0|This was one of the best debut albums I heard from the last decade. Band of Horses has developed into something much different than what you hear on Everything All The Time, but that doesn't take away from the quality of this record. You can really see the seeds of where Ben Bridwell wants to take the band - that is, to a full-fledged, legitimate country sound. I remember him once saying something about not wanting to be defined as an \\"indie\\" band. This record did well to establish them as something outside that label.

B002YOKVU4|5.0|Be aware that this review is biased, I am a huge fan of Hunter S. T. and thought this movie has a great on film representation of his work.  While not a family movie by any stretch of the imagination, and man are there some stretchy imaginations, it is an awesome movie to sit back and laugh out loud at.  It's a darker comedy, drug crazed epic that travels right through the heart of bat country.  This one must be watched more than once to fully enjoy the lines and great acting throughout the film.  I catch something that I never noticed before every time I watch it and recommend you do the same.

It feels like Christmas as soon as the theme song comes on so we've been known to watch it all through the year just to brighten our moods.  The language gets a little dicey VERY occasionally but all in all this is safe for the kids and funny for all.  If you don't have this on your must watch Christmas list then you should get it there.  I wish I could give it 6 stars.

B001UN1KVE|5.0|I loved this movie as a kid and I find it funnier every time I watch it.  Sure there's some spicy 10 year boy humor in it but if you can deal with balls being in the title then you should have a general idea of what you're in for.  Mel Brooks hit another homerun with this one.  It's a great spoof on Star Wars and a mix of witty but dumbed down humor that's so dumb at times you can't help but laugh outloud.  If you get offended with the idea of a Schwartz laser being shot at a goofy storm trooper's genitals then DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE.  Otherwise let the silliness run wild on your t.v.

B001EYU1VO|2.0|I usually don't write reviews, but when a product drives me nuts enough then I might feel compelled to jump on and share. I've owned 3 of these!!! Allow me to explain...<br /><br />I needed a joystick that offered throttle control, yaw, and had generally a small form factor to take up less space and also for the occasional move (US military flight student, I move more often than most). The first one of these started acting weird after I moved across country. I chocked it up to perhaps being damaged in the move. That one lasted me about a year. I liked the product so much I purchased another one. After 2 months I got this issue where there was a constant yawing input. I eventually just disabled the yaw feature within my simulators, which was annoying but made the stick usable again. After another month of this finally the stick started throwing in random X-axis inputs and became unusable. I returned this stick to bestbuy whom I luckily purchased a warranty from and given the lackluster selection at the store, I took home another cyborg Joystick....1 MONTH LATER, and the stick now throws in a constant X-axis input and one of the buttons. I'm DONE with this stick, it's a horrible design to not surpass even 3 months of moderate use!!
B0000DD79B|3.0|Great songs and plenty of them, but why couldn't they sound as good as my old recordings of same. They would have been ESSENTIAL, but not for me.  I expected great sound.  Are the other Sony/Columbia ESSENTIALS so poor in sound?  The CD was bought from Amazon
B00003CXZ1|1.0|I just finished watching this movie. I'm not a very big fan of it. The only parts I was interested in watching was the beginning and the ending. Ending Starting with the dogs. Angelina did a good job, but its just not for me.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|New Linkin Park album goes hard, they really know how to make their sound work and I appreciate the care they take in crafting interesting lyrics that really speak to different emotions. It's another album I will have on repeat for a while.  (Can you say \\"Goes Hard\\" to non-rap music? ) #LivingThings
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I read this book in a day. It is now one of my favorites and I cant wait for book 2 to come out. I read it on the Kindle fire, so seeing the pictures and letters were easy. While I loved the pictures...you dont need them to see the vision. Such a fun read. It might be geared to young adults, but Im 30 and enjoyed it.
B0000AK7AA|4.0|This was a easy, didn't take long and hastle free. My niece loves it and was super surprised when i got it early.
B007L96SI6|4.0|Remarkable first album.  Haley was my favorite on her season of Idol.  I'd love to hear her do a blues album.  I'd buy that one too.  Quite a nice variety of songs on this cd. Like everyone is saying, not a bad one in the bunch.  You won't be sorry if you buy this cd. Bravo Haley.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This app is great all u have to do is dowload the song you want off of youtube then its in your music!!!!
B003B96AOW|5.0|This toy or action figure is like a precious work of art.  The face the detail in everything is just like the Deadpool of the comics.  I don't want to take it out of the package until I get another one.  Diamond select Marvel action figures are just amazing, this is my first one and I'm very impressed.  Will likely start asking my wife for more of these for birthdays and Christmas.  She will, no doubt, not understand my fondess for these \\"toys\\" and will likely tell me to grow up.  But come on guys, who really wants to grow up.  I have already started a portion of my mancave dedicated to Marvel and all my favorite comic book heros!
B00723NWJE|4.0|Since her humble jazz-pop eclectic beginnings, Singer/Songwriter Norah Jones has trailed into a more indie-pop/alternative direction. 2009's [[ASIN:B002NWRMVS The Fall]]  was a product of this shift, making Jones sound less Diana Krall and more Fiona Apple.  The Fall was an excellent effort that didn't receive the recognition it deserved, though a cramped fourth quarter release also serves to blame. [[ASIN:B00723NWJE Little Broken Hearts]] is also a solid effort, though stranger and not as excellent as its predecessor. That said, Jones sounds excellent throughout as always, and some fine songs grace the presence, and Brian Burton (Danger Mouse) gives Jones a unique sound where production is concerned. Sometimes there is an air of sleepiness and yearning from the listening end for more `assertion.' All in all though, Little Broken Hearts is another solid addition to Jones's spectacular catalog.<br /><br />\\"Good Morning\\" initiates with minimalist acoustic guitar lines and guitar accompaniment.  Lacking Jones's vocals are lazy and nuanced, characteristic to the sound listeners have come to be accustomed to. The soundscape assembled by Danger Mouse is clever and certainly a distinct way to open the effort.  The full fruition of strings by the end of the cut is beautiful.  \\"Say Goodbye\\" continues to surprise and allure, showing itself instantly more rhythmically driven than the opener.  The mix of soul, indie, and pop styles is a fine sound for Jones considering her ability to crossover.  Jones never breaks a sweat, but it is that reserved and pure sound that makes her so endearing.  The refrain is particularly well penned: \\"Well it ain't easy to stay in love/when you're telling lies/So I'll just have to take a bow/and say goodbye...\\"<br /><br />\\"Little Broken Hearts\\" possesses sort of an old school rock/pop quality.  Jones continues to sing in an undertone, though surrounded by a solid array of production effects.  The refrain is performed rather casually, but one deduces Jones is aiming for a singer/songwriter vibe.  As the track progresses, Jones grows more overt vocally. \\"She's 22\\" is a clear winner, finding Jones and Burton composing a song that is mindful of pacing and spacing.  The songwriting is exceptional here - from the first lines one can sense this one is a winner: \\"She's 22/and she's loving you/and you'll never know how it makes me blue/does it make you happy?\\" She continues the allure on the simple, yet `telling' refrain: \\"You can throw away/every word I say...\\" Jones makes a song about rejection and a broken relationship sound so compellingly beautiful.<br /><br />\\"Take it Back\\" possesses a sort of mysterious sound.  Perhaps slightly less accessible than the straightforward, though clever \\"She's 22,\\" \\"Take It Back\\" is still quite enjoyable. The use of space is well executed, making the pacing a strong suit.  The quibble might be that \\"Take It Back\\" never achieves the full-fledged `frenzy' the listener envisions; instrumentally, it grows more than Jones's vocals do. \\"After The Fall\\" is a stronger cut, still focused on the broken romance theme of the effort: \\"Out on my own now/and I like the way it feels/you couldn't come through/and I'm too far gone/After the fall/do you still want it all?\\" Organ adds further dramatic effects to Danger Mouse's exceptional production.  It takes a while for \\"After the Fall\\" to percolate, but once it does, the listener is clearly engaged.<br /><br />\\"4 Broken Hearts\\" yields a slower tempo and change of meter to 6/8 time.  Absent of a standardize hook, the listener is left to rely on \\"Ooh\\" from Jones.  Solid, \\"4 Broken Hearts\\" may not be amongst `the elite.' Neither is \\"Travelin' On,\\" another solid, though perhaps not valedictory cut. Heather McIntosh's cello and bass playing adds a lift for sure, not to mention Jones's lovely refrain: \\"Ooh ooh...I can't believe what's happening now...\\" \\"Out On The Road\\" may be the weakest of the trio as it feels it needs some change of pace within the production.  The minimalism is great by all means, though wears on a bit.<br /><br />\\"Happy Pills,\\" the exceptional first single, gives Little Broken Hearts a lift.  The production is superb, Jones sounds exceptional, and all in all the cut is well conceived.  \\"Miriam,\\" the penultimate cut is pleasant, but lacks the same spark that characterized \\"Happy Pills.\\" Closer \\"All A Dream\\" is solid all around, though length is a bit of a detraction.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B00723NWJE Little Broken Hearts]] is a solid Norah Jones album.  It never overtly misses, though has some moments that sag more than others.  Jones always sounds as refined as she did when [[ASIN:B00005YW4H Come Away With Me]] broke through way back when.  She also cleverly tweaks and alters her formula so she isn't described as `predictable.' Overall, a solid effort.roduction.

0345803485|1.0|I agree with meymoon on the maturity level! I am on the 3rd book and have to admitt I have skipped through alot of the arotic scenes just to get back to the story (which is about 5 pages for one scene)and the only reason I am finishing the book is to see what happens in the end, laim I know. The 3 books would fit into one book if you took out the (as meymoon said) fifty shades of comments and jeez!

B005PD0VDI|1.0|I love art films...but not when I am aware of the  \\"art\\" in each and every frame of the film.  THE TREE OF LIFE is one of the most self-conscious movies I have ever watched.  Terrence Malick's ponderous, pretentious, painful mode of movie-making as evidenced in this puerile effort is intensely irritating, emotionally deadening and boring beyond belief.  CITIZEN KANE is an arty film with immense stylistic, bravura flourishes - and even when one is aware of its own artistic awareness, the movie still captivates and enthralls and enriches the viewer.  But with this attempted tone poem of a picture, the artifice reigns supreme and therefore the story and its many messages fall fatally flat. Kubrick's masterpiece 2001 - which this film in reminiscent of in many instances - is also a stylistically self-conscious work.  Yet, as with KANE, the artfulness of the film serves the narrative.  With THE TREE OF LIFE the story - what there is of it - is subservient to the style, the art of it all.  Terrence Malick would do well to adhere to a very great dictum for art of all kinds - and that is that art...should conceal art.  In other words, when I see a movie I don't want to see a movie.  Watching THE TREE OF LIFE I was always aware of the director over my shoulder and behind each and every frame of HIS film. And being cognizant of the artifice, the hoped for experience of the movie became instead an insult to the intelligence.<br /><br />This movie is annoying in so very many ways. How many barely audible whispered voice-overs can one bear?  Apart from their often annoying inaudibility, many times it isn't even clear which character is doing the talking.  How many shots of touching hands against the blue sky underscored by hopefully heavenly music does one have to see to get the point?  How many shots do we need to see of Sean Penn walking around looking as if he is wondering how he even wandered into this movie which makes absolutely no use of his considerable acting talents?  How much of Brad Pitt's self-conscious curl of the lower lip - as if that curled lip is enough to create a credible character - must one withstand?  How many times do we have to see the young Jack look like he is about to discover some great secret to the accompaniment of the movie's also self-conscious score?  And what of laughter?  Levity?  Romance? Sexuality? The sheer Joy of Life?  Life has all of these riches - yet this funereal film, THE TREE OF LIFE, has very little of those elements.  It is dull and lugubrious and in its attempt to grapple with the largest issues of Life, it neglects or forgets or self-consciously deletes so many of the elements that truly make Life analogous to a Tree.<br /><br />Think of a beautiful woman entering a room. She is undoubtedly beautiful - but she knows it and is also obsessively self-conscious with that knowledge.  She is overly perfumed and made-up, jewels everywhere, extravagantly dressed and looking for the nearest mirror so that she might bask in the glory of her own self-love. She goes far in destroying her own beauty with her self-conscious display of it. Now picture another beautiful woman coming into the room. This woman is not overly adorned or perfumed or made-up. Her eyes are the jewels she wears. The difference between the two women is that this one is not so certain of her charms so downplays the outward so as not to feel uncomfortable or seem ridiculous should those unnecessary embellishments diminish what she intrinsically possesses. This woman captivates and ultimately can obsess others because she, herself, is not unduly obsessed by that which she possesses by nature. Well, this movie is akin to the first women in this analogy.  The excessive surface of its outward look hides whatever inner, deeper values might be found therein.<br /><br />This movie's basic premise and design - in the hands of a more all-embracing and much more nuanced and subtle director - may have actually been a great movie.  For example,I had no problem with the storyline's non-linear structure or with bringing dinosaurs into the mix.  As a matter-of-fact, first hearing that this movie made such quantum leaps in its storyline made me want to really see it.  But though the intentions of the movie may have been sublime whilst still a thought, the execution sadly killed any power the finished product may have had.  Thus, to me, THE TREE OF LIFE seems more of a big-budgeted, big-starred student-film inter-cut with home movies and lost footage from 2001 than it does the work of matured and visionary film maker.  All in all, I would rather watch paint peel than have to watch this movie ever again. Better still, I think I'll watch 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY for the umpteenth time!I had no problem with the storyline's non-linear structure or with bringing dinosaurs into the mix.

B0074Y2YZ4|5.0|This is a great release and was surprised Roxette came out with another album so quickly after the very good Charm School. It's not quite the same Roxette as from Look Sharp and Joyride, but a more refined and mature release which is a good thing. I hope they keep making music...I enjoy these newer songs more than the older ones from the '90's.
B001UV4XFG|1.0|I love the film. The disc arrived in to pieces. I purchased two discs at a discount for Christmas season and BOTH arrived broken. that sucks.
0345803485|1.0|Hoo boy. I'm exactly 310 pages in and t this point, unable to tell if I can continue reading.<br /><br />I knew what I was getting myself into before buying book. I knew it was a Twilight fanfic turned erotic romance novel. I'll admit I myself haven't read very many erotic novels but good lord this book is terrible.<br /><br />Ana is extremely weak, dumb, and only further proof that literature is getting more and more sexist/anti-feminist/misogynist nowadays. She bites her lip so many times, it's on like EVERY FRACKING PAGE. She is in love with this extremely boring (yet supposedly gorgeous) Christian Grey guy. Throughout the book we're subject to her present tense prose, which isn't always a bad thingnif it's done well, but here it comes off as if E L James is in a rush to finish the book, on a deadline or something.<br /><br />Then there's Christian Grey. Holy crap, he is SO BORING!!!!! He's good looking, he's young and a billionaire (as Judge Judy aways says when she discovers someone is pulling a fast one on her: \\"...yeah, and I was born in 1965.\\"), he has an enormous dong, and every time he speaks, I always hear then lines being spoken in a bad radio announcer voice. Oh, and he's an abusive jerk too. Much like Edward of Twilight, but maybe worse! He isolates her, he stalks her and buys her communicative devices so she won't fall out of reach with him. He hits her hard during sex and can't seem to control himself. Seriously, where is this girl's common sense?<br /><br />The writing is so painful it's making me want to smash my head into the nearest sharp object. She says \\"holy crap\\" on almost every page. There's at least one instance per page of Anastasia biting her lip (most of the time followed by Christian saying \\"Stop biting your lip, it's making me hot\\". I know James is a Brit but she needs to control her British English when writing about America. \\"I began to pull his trousers off\\", really? Then of course she abuses terms like \\"flushed red\\" or \\"blushed\\", \\"I began crying uncontrollably\\", \\"But he is SOOOO gorgeous\\", yada yada yada.<br /><br />But then there's my mom trying to console me with \\"it gets better, I promise!\\" and I'm shocked she loved this book since she has good taste!<br /><br />Sorry, James, but you didn't make a fan out of me.I began crying uncontrollably\\", \\"But he is SOOOO gorgeous\\", yada yada yada.<br /><br />But then there's my mom trying to console me with \\"it gets better, I promise!\\" and I'm shocked she loved this book since she has good taste!<br /><br />Sorry, James, but you didn't make a fan out of me.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Most amazing book I think I have ever read, definatly an adult book only.  Many twist and turns to keep you wanting to come back for more.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Could not put this book down!  I actually was sleep deprived while I was reading this Trilogy!  The heroin in this book is fun loving and relatable!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|this is by far the worst book i have read in twenty years. i simply can not believe there are two more.
B005CFWO8Y|5.0|I love these crocs ! They are very comfortable. They are true to size. I wear a 7.5 and purchased an 8 as I do with all my Crocs<br />and the fit is perfect. I love the color it's almost a clear material with a hint of the Khaki color. I wore them all day shopping and it was like wearing slippers. I wish I could get other colors in this Carliana  but these were all I could find.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I'm using this on a Kindle Fire and overall it has worked well, except for one bizarre issue that I just found.  Trying to animate the radar map in landscape/widescreen orientation causes the app to force-close.  Doing this in portrait orientation works fine.  So, I guess portrait orientation gets 5 stars, widescreen orientation gets 1 star and overall I'll give it 3 stars.

I would use it again and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good board.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Good story line.  Not real well written.  At times seems juvenile in its read.  Can do with less of the sexual fluff.
B007EW9ISM|4.0|So I'm loving this pen, it writes so smoothly across the screen you'll wondered how you ever put up with those softer squidgy ones that tear, however 4 stars purely because i personally would (as i expected) like it just a tiny bit thinner, but it's no great shakes, as everyone says it's comfortable, i guess i just wish they gave you the option of two sizes.  Either way AMAZING stylus, just what you probably want, although you do have to press harder for individual taps than others pens I've used - worth the sacrifice for the ease of writing finally!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This has got to be one of the most boring repetitive OVER HYPED books of all time.<br />In my opinion the author is sexually inexperienced and all the readers who rave about this book must be as well.<br /><br />Give me a good old Jackie Collins anyday - at least they have a story to them<br /><br />DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK - If you must read it get it from your local library
0805095535|2.0|So more power to Mr. Auster in his personal journey back through life and love.  There are a few well-written high points herein (...almost killed my family!, ...almost jumped a Parisian taxi driver!) and a whole lot of tedium.  Every sixty-something should keep such a journal, and most sixty-somethings should keep it to themselves.<br /><br />Sorry, this just didn't work for me.  It was boring and embarrassing to read.

030758836X|3.0|I am one of those readers who reads 3/4 of a book and then stops. I do not know what it is, but I can NEVER finish a book. Not in this case. I read Gone Girl within 3 days because I just could not put it down. The writing is great, the characters are great, the plot is great...until the end.<br /><br />The last few chapters I feel were the \\"Crap, how do I conclude this book\\" chapters. It got really \\"too much\\" toward the end. And then...it was done. I was in shock at the last paragraph. I even did a double take like \\"Was that really the end?\\" I get why it ended the way it did...for one it gives the author the opportunity to write a sequel, but it also allows the reader to make their own ending in case the sequel is never written.<br /><br />All in all this book was very entertaining and I do not regret reading it. If you are looking for a well-written, page turner that is extremely entertaining, then this is the book for you. If you are the type that likes solid, conclusive endings, then you might want to skip.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|ok so i actually saw this movie around three or four years ago. I loved it but today when i was just looking through the kindle store i said :D yay they have a book of the lovely bones so right away i got it. This book nd movie always makes me cry. Me and my cousin watched the movie once and had a contest to see who wont cry. Shun all those people like mr.harvey. tsk tsk. :(

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I just LOVED this movie! Alot of OUTSTANDING actors are in this movie! It is about a young, southern woman named Skeeter, who wants to become a journalist & a novelist! So she gets a job at the local newspaper, and her job is to answer everyone's housekeeping questions. So she askes one of her friends, that she plays bridge with if she can interview her maid Aibileen, played by (Viola Davis), to help her with her housekeeping column!<br /><br /> And Skeeter learns so much about Aibileen's life, as a black maid in the South during the Civil Rights era! Aibileen's friend, Minny, played by ( Octavia Spencer)also tells Skeeter about her life as a maid!<br /><br /> This turns into a personal thing with Skeeter, because while she was growing up in the south, she also had a black maid in her family named Constantine, that she dearly loved, played by ( Cicely Tyson). And Skeeter learns first hand about how her bridge playing, so-called white friends, and even her family, mistreated & used their black maids! So Skeeter writes a book, about all the stories that, the black women, who were maids to white people, tolded her!<br /><br />  The black women who played the maids touched my heart, especially Viola Davis, Cicely Tyson, and Octavia Spencer! THEY ARE OUTSTANDING ACTORS, AND DESERVE AN OSCAR!!  I highly recommend this movie!! It is an AWESOME MOVIE! It gives you a glimpse of how hard it was for the black people, in the South, during the Civil Rights era!! And this movie will tug at your heart, and it will also make you smile!!
B006KX3GXO|4.0|great starter photo art app.  This app has lots of cute options to choose from.  I had a lot of fun decorating my granddaughters pictures.  This is my first time using this type of app and it was real easy to figure out.

B007SGM084|2.0|Reminds me of the teen romance novels I used to read many years ago except with explicit sex added. Liked the thought of the novels but unfortunately they are not very well written and the even the sex expisodes became boring and predictable...
B008BYXQJY|1.0|I'm a pretty big Maroon5 fan and this album really stunk. The first track is great, the next, \\"Payphone\\" is decent except for the abysmal \\"rap\\" part that has NO point or meaning with the rest of the song, and then things go downhill from there. From track 2... that's a bad, bad sign. All the tracks sound very upbeat-ish, but lack ANY of the soulful sound of ALL the other albums. The lyrics didn't grab me on any of the tracks and there just didn't seem to be the raw talent we're used to hearing from Adam and the gang. The saving grace of the Deluxe was a very, very cool version of KISS and a remix of the first track... along with the awesome \\"moves like jagger\\". If I were recommending anything to a fan, I'd say pick up the above listed songs as single downloads and skip this album. Sadly.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Interesting book but with some nice twists.  Not too hard to figure out what is going to happen but still overall good book.
1936608898|5.0|I have purchased hundreds of items off Amazon and have never given a review. I am taking the time to give a review for \\"It Starts With Food\\" becaue it is a book that is WORTH IT!<br /><br />My family's journey to realizing there is a connection between what you put into your body several times a day over the course of years and years does indeed effect your health started three years ago when a nutritionist \\"diagnosed\\" my son as not being able to process dairy. This led to my husband discovering his allergies (that doctors had been pumping him full of drugs for) were triggered by food (mainly dairy and grains). I discovered a link between the migraines I got every 3-6 and wheat.<br /><br />18 months ago my 5-year-old son was diagnosed with sensory and auditory processing disorders and dyspraxia. I began to research how nutrition affects children with neurological disorders and this led me leaky gut syndrome and how to fix it.<br /><br />Everything Doug and Melissa say in ISWF is exactly what I am seeing everywhere else in regard to how food affects your hormones, brain, gut and inflammation. They just say it much more concisely, directly and humorously than everyone else!<br /><br />You need to read this book for the health of your entire family!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|My advice would be to read it only if you feel you have to konw how the series ends.  If this were a stand alone book I would not recommend reading it.
034580404X|2.0|If you are looking for something spicy in your life, save your money and instead of buying these books buy hot wings instead. The story line is weak most times throughout the trilogy, not to mention unrealistic.  Once you read how the \\"first time\\" took place, it contains glances of rape.  Not to mention the unrealistic first attempt at oral ~ PLEASE!  Pfft!!!  After hearing the buzz in the press and my friends, I decided to purchase these books.  I am making a list of who I will no longer use as an accurate review for books or movies in the future.<br /><br />Although after reading these books, I am determined to write a novel or two, for those that are interested in something steamy and spicy in their life.

B007XNAPNY|5.0|I just watched through the blu-ray and I am very pleased with the quality of the production.  The sound quality is excellent.  The video also looks very good, very clear and with some nice touches of editing and effects on occasion to spice things up.  I am a little curious as to why 2 of the tracks are relegated to the special features, but that was an editorial decision.  The show focuses on a selection of the band's hits and tracks from AYNIN.  Concert staples \\"White Lines\\" and \\"Careless Memories\\" make for a very energetic back-to-back in the middle of the show.  Also, the bonus feature with the band talking about their 2011 is a nice bonus, and goes nicely with the bonus interview segments from the AYNIN bonus dvd.<br /><br />Tastefully done and entertaining.  I'm definitely looking forward to seeing the band this August!

0753143968|4.0|As a teenager (now in my 30's), I remember reading a couple or more Jeffrey Archer's novels and I always remember them as being fascinating.  I picked up the audiobook at the public library on instinct.  I did not even read the synopsis and had never heard of George Mallory before.  All I knew was, Sir Edmund Hillary was the very first to climb Mt. Everest aided by his Sherpa.  Until the very end, I was thinking it was the story of Edmund Hillary.  You see, Edmund Hillary...George Mallory...they sort of sound the same and I was foolishly thinking the story was based on Edmund Hillary's life.  For an entire day, I was moved by the ending.  Jeffrey Archer's way of making you love the character is simply amazing.  I felt a connection to George Mallory like never before.  The only other character I had a connection before was Robert Ludlum's Jason Bourne (who wouldn't?).<br /><br />The first few cd's was not that impressive until George's little \\"climb\\" to get into College.  Since that part, I could not wait to start my long painful drive to my new job all the while happy to be listening to this story.  Its truly a remarkable story and the very fact that its based on a true story is all the more reason to give it a listen.

0679809015|5.0|I just popped on here looking for some new touch and feel books for my 9 month old and saw this. We have had this book for years now, and my 8 year old still loves it. He is a very advanced reader, reading chapter books already, so I think it may be mostly nostalgia that he still enjoys it. He was reading it to my 9 month old the other day. A flap or two is missing, but it's just as fun. It's sweet to see him share a book that he loved so much as a baby with his little sister now. Highly recommend this very simple but fun book.
B007X4N0DU|4.0|A lengthy four years after When Angels & Serpents Dance, P.O.D. return with their eighth album, Murdered Love. It is also the second album to feature original guitarist Marcos Curiel since his departure following 2001's Satellite.<br /><br />Although Satellite was a hugely successful album considered a masterpiece by many, it created a rather difficult situation for fans of the band. It was the fourth consecutive album with Marcos Curiel and the most well-received, and then he was replaced by Jason Truby for two albums. Satellite thus become high point to which P.O.D. fans will likely refer when judging future albums. On the one hand, that isn't totally unreasonable, but it is now rather unnecessary.<br /><br />When Angels & Serpents Dance was something of a disappointment for fans wanting a triumphant, loud, and energetic return of Marcos Curiel. It was a mostly melancholy album bearing little resemblance to anything previously released by P.O.D. And there is thus a lot riding on Murdered Love, not to mention it being produced by Howard Benson, who was also at the helm of Satellite.<br /><br />But Murdered Love doesn't sound anything like Satellite. After Testify, P.O.D. chose to play in a style largely resembling hard rock rather than alternative metal. This is most noticeable in the prevalence of chords over riffs and a less distorted sound. Also, P.O.D. no longer have anything to prove. They don't need to scream and shout the same way they did on tracks such as \\"Boom\\" and \\"Masterpiece Conspiracy.\\" P.O.D. have long since defied all critics and continued to release high quality (as well as very diverse) albums for about 20 years. The clearest evidence of this is how relaxed they are on the track \\"West Coast Rock Steady,\\" which would have undoubtedly been extremely heavy a decade ago. Now it's just a bunch of good friends rocking and relaxing.<br /><br />The bottom line is that Murdered Love is the sound of an underdog band turned veteran. Sonny Sandoval sounds absolutely inspired on every track. The bass grooves and rocks, as do the drums, and the guitars provide substance and stylized seasoning (and the occasional solo). There are even a few keyboards thrown in for good measure. Tracks such as \\"Beautiful\\" and \\"Bad Boy\\" sound unlike anything P.O.D. have ever done before. Anybody who scorned When Angels & Serpents Dance will be eating their words when they hear the melodic singing throughout this album. P.O.D. are back in fine form, and Murdered Love is a great album that is best interpreted as a whole rather than as a collection of songs.<br /><br />Highlights: \\"Murdered Love,\\" \\"Lost in Forever,\\" \\"Babylon the Murderer,\\" \\"Panic and Run\\"<br /><br />4/5olutely inspired on every track.

0061992860|5.0|With extensive sections on every type of survival, this pocket sized (actually fits in the palm of your hand)  If you venture out into the wilderness, either tent camping, backpacking or just day hiking make sure you have one.  In my opinion you're an idiot if you don't carry this book with you.  Make sure to purchase the \\"Revised Edition\\" which mentions iPhone App on the cover!  I have purchased many copies of this book for family and friends who don't have their earthquake/disaster kits set up yet!  383 pages of good, solid advice!

B006BDHAX0|4.0|The games are fairly challenging. The game saved fine the few times I had leave before finishing. The games are ordered so as to give you a break every so often (an easy game every three or four games). Not the best on the planet but a fine way to spend a few minutes.
B005CWRB44|4.0|This is a great little light. It's three settings are what make this light a homerun for me. Often the small lights are either too dim or too bright but with the multiple settings this can go from map light to street light in a simple twist. i would prefer a button over the twist on / off but the twist feature is nice as a lock out so it doesn't turn itself on while in your pocket.

B0063IH60K|5.0|This was one of the first apps I put on my Kindle Fire back in January. it is.still among my &quot;favorites&quot;. it relaxing to play a game or two trying to.get sleepy while I listen to Pandora (another early download and still a favorite).<br />I tried another solitaire game but. ame back to this one..<br /><br /> The cards are easy to read. The controls work well.<br /><br /> The banner ads are fairly unobtrusive although placementis near where I hold the Fire so I sometimes open an ad by accident. Maybe that is intentional.<br /><br />I can highly recommend it as the best Solitaire game for Kindle Fire I have seen so far.
B005NF2UE6|5.0|At first listen the tracks didn't jump out at me, I was kinda rushing through them.  But now I've listen to them sevaral times.  Bottoms Up is a great drinking song with awesome guitar riffs as well as Gotta Get Me Some.  I play these often.  My friends give me hell for liking them but so be it, yes some of the lines are corny but the instrumentals are pretty kickass.  I'll play them in the jukebox just to piss'em off. I think people wanna get on the wagon of saying \\"I hate NB\\".  Those are the guys who listen to bands that are supposedly all hardcore but have soft lyrics about depression or heartache. Sell outs?  Who cares, they sell out shows and make tons of money...How can you blame them, they put out solid albums everytime out.

It has answered all my questions. I extremely reccomend this book. I tried \\"Lucid Dreaming in 30 Days\\" but did not finish it because it was too \\"new age\\" and \\"spiritual\\", for lack of better words. This is more of the scientific proof and reasoning of it, and has a many unique methods described in detail for any kind of prospective Lucid Dreamer.

B008GXHOFW|5.0|This app is truely amazing. It has amazing graphics, great sound effects,  and awesome gameplay.<br />This is a free roam game,  which, in my opinion,  is great for a spiderman game. It gives you a chance to just enjoy web swinging around new York. Its fun!<br />But this game also has some downfalls. For instance, SPIDERMANS VOICE! It does not sound like spiderman whatsoever.<br />Another downfall is his personallity. Is it me or does it sound like he 's always praising himself? For instance,  he quotes that he is the &quot;amazing &quot; spiderman, and that he is &quot;neiborhood friendly &quot;. Now I know these are classic quotes from the comics and films, but I don't think it should be spiderman saying this. It would be more fitting if the townspeople said this. When spidey says it, it makes him appear as cocky.<br />But those are two minor flaws that are easily overlooked,  so you'll forget about that after five minutes.<br />Buy it. It is worth seven dollars.
0307887448|5.0|This work of fiiction was a delight to read.  It cleverly integrated references to movies and games of the 80's with an exciting quest adventure, set in the backdrop of a touching personal story.  My husband and I each owned one of the first Atari game systems, had an Apple II primarily to play games on, saw all of the popular movies of the 80's, and knew where to play an arcade game at the mall.  This book was written exactly for us, but I am betting if you are aware of any of these enthusiasms, you'll be hooked as well.  We each read the book in under 3 days and then bought copies for friends.  Very appropriate for young adults as well, no sex, minimal violence and a few good life lessons along the way.

B000LTAY1U|4.0|This automatic Seiko, and its other colored siblings, is an excellent choice for anyone looking to keep a bit of style on their wrists when a more expensive watch isn't appropriate. This model is true to size which makes it perfect for folks with slender wrists or those looking for a smaller diameter face. This color, SNK805K2, is a military green with more gray than visible in the amazon.com image. The crystal is fairly scratch resistant, the watch is water resistant, and the 21-jewel movement keeps good time. One drawback, however, is the watch band; the end of the strap and sides under the wrist have begun to fray and and catches most fabrics if rubbed up against it.
B0054LRR3S|1.0|...They have a penchant for adding bland, boring vocals that contribute nothing to their even blander compositions. The fact that people refer to this as 'minimal' escapes me, as does any classification other than 'pop music', and a rather poor example of it at that. It's not dubstep, it's not minimal, and, frankly, it's not enjoyable, either.<br /><br />Thank you for recommending this uninteresting music to me, Amazon. Considering all the good music I've purchased from your company, I have to assume your recommendations algorithm completely ignores taste and relies on random selection instead, much like SBTRKT's assignment of vocals to tracks (see: Wildfire feat. Little Dragon, or, well, really any track featuring a vocalist).

1577314808|5.0|I bought this book awhile ago and pick it up every now and then, usually more when I'm feeling stressed. I also have it in the audiobook format on my ipod. Reading or listening to it puts me at ease, awakens joy inside me and makes me laugh out loud at myself and the insanity of humanity. Everytime I use it, I pick up something new that went over my head before. I've been really learning to stay more present, focus on my breathe and quiet the stream of white noise in my mind. I am truly grateful for this book. If you want more peace of mind and joy, buying this book is the way to go.

034580404X|2.0|When every woman you know has gone crazy about a book - to the point where you feel like you might be in mortal danger if you don't comply - you either read it or run for the hills screaming. I speak here of a specific kind of mortal danger that is usually reserved for only the most horrifying science fiction robot take-overs. These hostilities usually start with a horde of already converted nearest and dearest swooning something like: \\"You haven't read it yet?! Oh we need to fix that deary\\" {Insert creepy, glazed over expressions and a copy of the book being flown at your face} \\"You'll love it, I promise. Just relax...\\"<br /><br />But I digress.<br /><br />I won't be breaking any new ground by telling you all what you know already: these books are porn. Period.<br /><br />The story arch is flimsy at best and only serves to deliver the reader from one page of hotness to another making it easy to see why something like this climbed the New York Times best seller ladder so quickly. Not that I fault the sex-starved masses for falling for Ana or Fifty's certain style of kinky - but I'm just not impressed.<br /><br />What I am is worried. Seems like those robots will have an easier time forcing us into slavery than I'd originally hoped.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Small in size, comes with a clip on the receiver to add to your belt, and lots of room in cabling. The only downside is that the receiver doesn't have a power indicator to let you know if it's active, so if you leave it on by accident the battery will burn down and next time you try to use it you can miss the fact that it's dead.

B004I8WD6E|5.0|I've had the iphone 3G, 4 and now the 4S and have gone through a LOT of cases for each.  All of them had at least one thing that I really didn't like and have been looking for something sturdy, minimalist, protective, inexpensive and lasts a long time.  This case fits the bill in all those aspects and I couldn't be happier.  I just came from using the Otterbox defender (which is a monstrous sized case) and it feels like I got a phone upgrade because it's lighter, much smaller, doesn't get stuck in my pocket and doesn't have a screen cover that distorts everything and throws off the touch screen (like the defender does).  Highly recommend this case, especially at the great price (9 bucks) Amazon is offering.

B003EV6DBM|5.0|This season is a great start to Matt Smith's Doctor. Most episodes are very good and entertaining. The only detraction I have for this season is the lackadaisical Dalek episode. It's not bad, it's just satisfactory. I get the sense it's just in there for two reasons: 1) To show that there are still Daleks wandering about after the events of the 4th season and 2) Because the audience expects Daleks from Dr. Who. At this point, I think it is just tough to write new original Dalek (and Cybermen for that matter) stories since they've been featured on the show so often.<br /><br />All told, I would say this is very good entertainment.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Okay first off I absolutely love this book! I have to admit though that in the beginning it was a bit yawn but for myself that's how it is with all books until the story starts to get good!<br />This book was amazing it had great characters and had a darn good love story to I hated how it ended just because I couldn't wait to get my hands on the next book but now that the second part is already out I am so excited to get my hands on it! I highly recommend this book!!
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|This season of Dr. Who represents a good end to the David Tennant years. While it does get a bit out of hand during the season finale, most episodes are very well written and well acted. I would highly recommend this season to someone familiar with Dr. Who.
B00382X4XC|5.0|Black Sabbath's ninth studio album Heaven and Hell was released in April of 1980.<br />After the failure of 1978's Never Say Die and being upstaged by a young and upcoming hard rock band from California called Van Halen on its accompanying tour, Black Sabbath made some major changes.<br />First, legendary lead singer Ozzy Osbourne was fired from the band and Ozzy would start a solo career (which would be hugely successful), but what would bass player Geezer Butler, drummer Bill Ward and guitarist Tony Iommi do to replace Ozzy. Simple. Hire the late Ronnie James Dio, whom was previously the lead singer for the blues rock outfit Elf and former Deep Purple member Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow (recording the classic Rainbow Rising).<br />Second, the band got a new producer out of Martin Birch (famous for his work with Deep Purple, Rainbow and subsequently Iron Maiden). Would Black Sabbath succeed without Ozzy? Read on and find out (as I did in October of 1993 when I first heard the album and got subsequently on CD that November).<br />The killer hard rocker \\"Neon Knights\\" opens the album and shows Dio was more than a capable singer to replace Ozzy. Next is \\"Children Of The Sea\\" which starts out as an acoustic ballad-type song before we rock out in a slower tempo. Next is \\"Lady Evil\\" which is an awesome song despite the fact musically in some parts it was reminiscent to Cliff Richard's 1976 hit \\"Devil Woman\\" (namely in the riff that follows the middle guitar solo). The album's first side ends with the strongest track on the album which is Heaven and Hell's title track. Tony Iommi is metal's greatest guitar god, and he's demonstrated it tons of times both before and after the release of this album, but this shows why he is known as one of metal's greatest . The opening solo to this track is the best damn guitar playing he has EVER done. Combine that with some priceless vocals from Dio, and you know very well you've got a masterpiece on your hands.<br />The album's second half starts with the rocking \\"Wishing Well\\". We follow with another classic \\"Die Young\\". The track starts off with a great Geoff Nicholls synthesizer fanfare with killer Iommi guitar solos intro before going into a great fast rocker. Dio's lyrics are amazing and among the best lyrics of all time. Dio and Iommi were on fire on this track. The rocker \\"Walk Away\\" is next and is a great song with a killer riff. We close the album with the classic \\"Lonely Is the Word\\". The song has a superb vocal delivery from Dio and Iommi's guitar solos (especially at the end) are AMAZING!<br />Heaven and Hell is a SUPERB SABBATH album and was also the album that brought them back to the American Top 30 for the first time in FIVE YEARS and also rewarded Sabbath with its first US million selling album.<br />Heaven and Hell is a masterpiece and 32 years later, it still rocks!<br />In 2008, a remastered CD was released by Rhino. Then two years later, another remaster was released by Sanctuary/Universal in Europe as a 2-CD set. The sound is much warmer and crisper than the American remaster.<br />The second disc of this remaster has SEVEN TRACKS. First are early live versions of \\"Children of the Sea\\" and Heaven and Hell's title cut which were from the period when Bill Ward was still with the band. Then it's the mono mix single edit of \\"Lady Evil\\" which isn't bad. Next is four tracks from the band's Hartford, CT performance in August of 1980 (which has been readily available on bootleg for many years) and was one of the last performances with original drummer Bill Ward before left Black Sabbath at the end of that month with live versions of \\"Neon Knights\\", another version of \\"Children Of the Sea\\", this time a full 12 minute performance of the title cut to Heaven and Hell and lastly, a performance of \\"Die Young\\" preceded by a stellar Iommi solo.<br />Recommended!lf starts with the rocking \\"Wishing Well\\".

B003R0B1HQ|5.0|The viewer could tell that the writer put effort into the dialogue and plot of this show. The plan that the character Suzie thought of is actually very well thought out and complex. It's sort of like a mini full-circle ending, if that makes any sense. Everything that occurred in the very first episode was vital to Suzie's plan. She meant to die...killing herself was all apart of the plan.<br /><br />The way the writers wrote it and the way the plan and the plot all plays out is very well put-together. It's organized in a way where you don't suspect a thing until...BOOM!!...they reveal the scheme of Suzie's, at the same time surprising the hell out of you. It makes you start thinking and connecting the dots just as they speak. I have to say, this episode is the best I've seen so far of Season 1. I also must include how I think each episode gets better than the one before, like the show, Torchwood, is still a work-in progress. I feel like the directors and writers are telling me \\"The show is new, it's a work-in prgress, and it gets better...DONT WORRY!\\"<br /><br />haha...so yeah. I liked this episode very much.

B005LAIHIQ|4.0|Uncustomarily compelled to emerge from My Noctuary Lair to attend the external theatre experience, I recently viewed this presentation for the amusement of it, actually not expecting too much by way of factual or actual content, usually preferring one's own viewing room, or the drive-in for these purposes. Yet harboring a deep affinity for the series, and being appreciative of the productions of Tim Burton {especially in combination with Maestro Danny Elfman's orchestrations}, it seemed a natural inspection. He does have a knack for splendidly presenting the Gothic sensibility to a fine point, after all.<br /><br />I first became pleasantly aware of this sinister series through rebroadcasts on a local channel, and has since become preferred entertainment fare, which is presented in a serious vain, whose Gothic psychodramas seem to reflect many predispositions and innate interests. The uses of mood lighting, suspenseful music, occult story lines, grants it a brooding atmosphere similar to Hammer films, yet imbued with Dan Curtis' unique psychological darkness. Dark Shadows features not only vampires & witches, but warlocks, werewolves, zombies, ghosts, sinister cults, insane preachers, time-travels, mad killers, demons, & many more creatures & situations of a paranormal nature.<br /><br />As far as Dark Shadows films are concerned, I personally recommend [[ASIN:B0012DP6L2 House of Dark Shadows]] & [[ASIN:B002SP99BQ Night Of Dark Shadows]].<br /><br />So, when I first viewed the preview for the film, it was a bit underwhelming, as it focuses primarily on the 70's comedic elements, yet in the overall film, it actually became beside the point. Actually, I thought it a bit appropriate after all, that since the series was broadcast in the late 60's/early 70's season {actually premiering in Year 1 A.S.}, that the setting seemed to make sense for a plot such as this. Being leery of any 'remakes, since the early 90's adaptation was actually a pleasing tribute, but what may be condensed in a 113 minute film? Obviously, if you want the real thing, just continue viewing and submerging yourself therein. I have been collecting these on DVD as they became available, & most remarkably, the entire series has recently become available in the marvelous [[ASIN:B007PZ6SYK Dark Shadows: The Complete Original Series (Deluxe Edition)]].<br /><br />In October of VII A.S., Barnabas Collins is unleashed from a century of subterranean incarceration by construction workmen {instead of groundskeeper Willy Loomis immediately, whom he meets shortly}, who of course, sates his blood lust forthwith. He meets a drunken Willy {his 'Renfield'} wandering the Collinswood grounds among the pumpkins, who after a quick interrogation about the current surroundings, quickly assumes his role.<br /><br />Arriving at the Collinswood estate, he meets with elegant matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard and the rest of the surviving family. She is obviously taken aback by his arrival {return}, thus revealing some interesting house secrets during the introduction. After all, a pleasantly dark chamber via a secret passageway is a necessity for any vampire! His descriptions of the architecture and history of the fine resident possessions therein are a remarkable relation, in marked appreciation for the construction of their materialization.<br /><br />Present are Elizabeth {the lovely, stately, lady of the manor}, Dr. Hoffman {here, the professional intellectual physician is portrayed as an attractive, fiery-haired lush living a life of quiet desperation}, David {well-portrayed, rather like a Damien}, pretty little Carolyn Stoddard {the impetuous blonde here portrayed as a hippie-like stoner / rebellious 'party girl' type}, & Roger Collins {the stoic gentleman here portrayed as a rude, inconstant, boorish lothario}. While Barnabas himself is here portrayed in a more slender variation, more akin to a callow [[ASIN:B00005R87K Nosferatu]], intentionally depicted.<br /><br />With the help of these new-found relatives, Barnabas goes about familiarizing himself with the culture, to some amusing interactions with automobiles, entertainment evolutions, & technological advancements. The juxtaposition between a gentleman of eloquence, fine tastes, irrefutable deportment, dashing style, and elite dispositions, to that of an increasingly vulgar, down-slidden society are tangibly evident.<br /><br />Arriving as David's new nanny, Barnabas is smitten with Victoria Winters, seemingly Josette resurrected, who, in another fanciful twist among many, here arrives in Collinwood from that fateful train ride deriving from no less than an asylum. Most amusingly intriguing indeed.<br /><br />He eventually becomes re-acquainted with a busty Angelique Bouchard, the source of his torments, for those unfamiliar, in what would amount to be an undead fatal attraction, the witch who commended him into the coffin-prison for refuting her advances in favor of his dear Josette DuPres {a sweetly diminutive fianc&eacute;}, who herself plunged from Widow's Hill at the bidding of black witchcraft. Harboring resentment of Barnabas & the successes of The Collins Family since childhood, Angelique uses her own immortality & wiles to raise her family name to prominence. Of course, that re-acquaintance yields a passionate fling finally culminating in a final battle.<br /><br />Notable scenes include: one Alice Cooper performing at a ball circa [[ASIN:B000002I99 Welcome to My Nightmare]], with Jonathan Frid, Lara Parker, David Selby and Kathryn Leigh Scott in attendance. \\"David!

In this case, this rendition is an amusing aside, created as a quirky notion of how a vampire would interact with an outside herd world, in continued predation, of course. As a combination Gothic / Comedy / Thriller, it certainly has its moments in the shadows, even while venturing into the lightmare, and may certainly be good for a nefarious cachinnation or two, while asserting an enhanced appreciation for the core origins. 'elp of these new-found relatives, Barnabas goes about familiarizing himself with the culture, to some amusing interactions with automobiles, entertainment evolutions, & technological advancements. The juxtaposition between a gentleman of eloquence, fine tastes, irrefutable deportment, dashing style, and elite dispositions, to that of an increasingly vulgar, down-slidden society are tangibly evident.<br /><br />Arriving as David's new nanny, Barnabas is smitten with Victoria Winters, seemingly Josette resurrected, who, in another fanciful twist among many, here arrives in Collinwood from that fateful train ride deriving from no less than an asylum. Most amusingly intriguing indeed.<br /><br />He eventually becomes re-acquainted with a busty Angelique Bouchard, the source of his torments, for those unfamiliar, in what would amount to be an undead fatal attraction, the witch who commended him into the coffin-prison for refuting her advances in favor of his dear Josette DuPres {a sweetly diminutive fiancé}, who herself plunged from Widow's Hill at the bidding of black witchcraft. Harboring resentment of Barnabas & the successes of The Collins Family since childhood, Angelique uses her own immortality & wiles to raise her family name to prominence. Of course, that re-acquaintance yields a passionate fling finally culminating in a final battle.<br /><br />Notable scenes include: one Alice Cooper performing at a ball circa [[ASIN:B000002I99 Welcome to My Nightmare]], with Jonathan Frid, Lara Parker, David Selby and Kathryn Leigh Scott in attendance. \\"David!

B006R8GK2Q|4.0|I liked it for the most part. It became a little repetitive though. Same puzzles, no increase in difficulty. I would have liked a little more variety but all in all I enjoyed it.
B0052FG750|5.0|Got this for my husbands birthday according to him a must for any true Doors fan all their best and some less known and just as great
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly depicts the adventures of Captain Malcolm Reynolds and his crew on board the ship, Serenity, after they picked up two fugitives on the run from the totalitarian government known as the Alliance. It really is a show you have to stick with for the first disk or two, but, it more then well pays itself off by the third disk. With its western like hold ups, futuristic setting, and cleverly plotted missions and tasks, this show is almost like a hybrid of Star Treck, Bonanza, and The A Team, except a whole lot better. Cancelling this show might have been Fox's worst mistake. It is funny, clever, exciting, and suspenseful, Firefly is an excellent purchase and a steal.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|It's ok but its the same old thing. It was free so it gives you something to do when you are bored.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|Joss Whedon never did get the recognition he deserved (until his most recent film, The Avengers), especially during the duration of one of his greatest pieces of work, Firefly, which was unjustly taken off the air. Firefly finally gets its smashing finish fans were praying for, in this hip, humorous, and triumphant movie adaptation, Serenity. Not only is it every bit as good as fans could ever want it to be, it's also easy enough for the novice to get into. With breakneck pacing, cool visuals, an attractive cast, a hilarious script, Whedon's knack for action choreography, and a story made for all to enjoy (not just the Firefly elitists), Serenity is a joy to watch.
B007Y2W44W|5.0|Nile have once again done it again. This is a perfect release in my opinion. I have all of their albums and to me, this album conjures the magic of Catacombs while burning and blazing through the flames of the Duat with Karl, Dallas, and George's expert musicianship. Neal did another bang out job on this record and like always, Nile has me craving their next record already. At The Gate of Sethu has not left my CD player since July 3, 2012. I am still digesting this beast and could not be more thrilled with it. Keep up the good work guys, can't wait to see what you come up with next. Fans, do your self a favor, buy this CD and put in your system and blast it. If you still think it sucks than I don't know what else to tell you. Sucks for you that you don't get it.<br /><br />Deez...
B001VNB54A|5.0|I bought this for my dad for Christmas and he loved it!  It was the same price as the DVD series, so I could not pass up this great deal.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved the books and  was not offended by any of the content but was a little flustered when Ana didn't get to be dom as Christian started trusting her completely. I'm glad there was an openness about sex that you don't get to read in other books, atleast not this in depth anyway.
0345803507|5.0|The third and final book to a great series!  Reading these books you have to go into it with an open mind.  I was weary at first when I started reading them because I have heard many different takes on it; some like and some strongly oppose.  I like it.  It's definitely an adult series and I found myself thoroughly entrapped in the story.  Even when I got to the 2nd book, I found myself skimming through the sex scenes just because I wanted more of the story.  If you stop reading after book 1, you need to finish out with book 2 & 3 to get a full understanding of Mr. Grey and Ana's love story and how it comes full circle.

B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Although this is a very quick and easy read and maybe the plot is a little simplistic, it has beautifully well described characters. You discover how life has formed the different people. It does give a snapshot view of Irish life at a certain time and examines one of our scandals and how it affected one persons life.

B008JAGZDE|2.0|I expected at this to atleast follow the HANGOVER receipe...same movie, same jokes, a few smaller laughs.  Very disappointed in the approach was different....and not in a good way...they tried to change the movie which is respectable, but they changed it away from its roots....Big let down.

I previously used my own DIY buckle system, which worked, but not as well as the BRAD clip. I love that there is a part of this which is elastic. Did not expect that. Very nice product, -1 star for being almost 20 bucks for such a short strap :

B002C6K7N0|4.0|Testament, Formation Of Damnation. Metallica, Death Magnetic. And finally Megadeth, Endgame. The return to form has finally come! Well...almost. Overall, it is a modern thrash, hard rock, classic. We start off with \\"Dialectic Chaos\\" A pretty average instrumental but it was never meant to be a stand alone track. Its mission was accomplished in 1) giving you a whirlwind of riffs 2) to bring into the scene one of the most brutal songs in Megadeth's recent career. \\"This Day We Fight!\\" Intensity? Check. Double bass drumming? Check. Solos? Its Megadeth, you already know that is a yes. The solos bring memories of Rust In Peace era tracks like \\"Hangar 18\\" and \\"Poision Was The Cure\\". Dave's vocals aren't bad at all for almost pushing 50. \\"44 Minutes\\" starts with a police call as the introduction about the California bank shootout. The riffs are powerful and once the chorus hits they become melodic. It is a catchy song and mid paced. It is a nice cool down track from the speed of the first one. The fourth track \\"1,320\\" about racing. It seems to be like the 'odd man out' on an album called Endgame. But it picks up the intensity yet again. Broderick has a great solo on this track though and keeps things going to the next track. (Think 502 from So Far...So Good...So What!, put it on steroids and add a different story line) \\"Bite The Hand\\" compared to the tracks before, it is the first political track. The rhythm is unequal on the album. Of course the solo is nice as well. Nothing TOO spectacular about this song. \\"Bodies\\" almost like \\"Symphony Of Destruction\\" with the stop in the lead guitar, allowing the bass to keep pace with the drums, while Dave is singing. \\"Endgame\\" starts off with the loud speaker barking orders at citizens under martial law. This is Dave's personal outlook on what could happen with the 'New World Order, America, Mark Of The Beast, ect ect' It expands on the ideals from United Abominations so depending on whether you liked that album or not will determine how you respond to this track. \\"The Hardest Part Of Letting Go\\" Starts off acoustic, and on this track, Dave's vocals seem forced. Just doesn't feel natural, but the main riff is catchy and is also used on the next album Th1rt3en in \\"Public Enemy No 1\\" \\"Headcrusher\\" Speed, Aggresion, Venom, and brutality. The lyrics are dark and could have fit on any old 'Deth record. The solo is impressive and blows away posers with ease. The unspoken plus on this album is the bass work. Its audible! \\"How The Story Ends\\" nothing too technical, but a downright catchy song. \\"The Right To Go Insane\\" A great track to end this album. You can feel as if you are in the main character's shoes. The guitar sound gives off a sound that in itself is stressful. The chorus is catchy thanks to Dave's vocals.<br /><br />Overall, Endgame isn't a full out break neck thrasher. Instead it is a modern masterpiece of metal with thrash influences. It doesn't come close to the 'golden days' of Peace Sells or Rust In Peace. But it cuts close in with Youthanasia, and Countdown. Endgame is political at times, thrash at times, melodic, brutal, intense, calm, a full range of emotions that any good album should have.<br /><br />Best Tracks: (Dialectic Chaos) and This Day We Fight! 44 Minutes, Bodies, Headcrusher, The Right To Go Insane<br />Good Tracks: 1'320, Bite The Hand, Engame, How The Story Endsow you respond to this track. \\"The Hardest Part Of Letting Go\\" Starts off acoustic, and on this track, Dave's vocals seem forced.

0439023521|5.0|This book is addictive.  I could not put it down.  Although the writing style is simple, the story raises many interesting, sophisticated questions about society and humanity.  I highly recommend.
B004WPT3ZM|5.0|Peace Sells...But Who's Buying? Is an all time classic. The first time I heard this album, I feel in love. I dont know how mortal words can desribe this amazing piece of thrash metal history. So I will try.. Its badass, rude, in your face, violent, and fun to listen to. The way the tracks fit together on this album is really amazing, and the album ends with one of my favorite songs ever \\"My Last Words\\" My favorite tracks are: Wake Up Dead, Peace Sells, Good Mourning/Black Friday, and My Last Words. All are amazing tracks! There is only one track I dont really like and that is \\"I ain't superstitious\\". The Conjuring, Devil's Island, and Bad Omen are good songs, they just dont match the other tracks like Black Friday or Peace Sells. Plus if you like violent music, check out the lyrics to Black Friday, I was shcoked but I loved it all the same. If you like metal, thrash, or just music in general you have to have Peace Sells...But Who's Buying. I bought it and I wasnt sorry!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I'm not an author, and I'm certainly not well spoken and I don't use fancy words. However; I did read this trilogy in about 4 days. The plot was simple and not well written. Although unbelieveable, the sex was hot ..at first...then became redundent (like most porn). I didn't really care for Ana - at all. She was unbelievable and whiney - way too insecure for me. (I did like her inner goddess, thought that was funny). I wish she had been older...experienced..maybe damaged herself? I don't know. I love Christian. I can't help it. Although quite unbelieveable (no one is THAT hot, THAT rich, THAT sweet, THAT mind-blowing) but I can dream, right? and that's what this book did for me, made me want a little MORE..I felt closure after the series. I typically don't read these types of books (nothing can compare to Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series - sigh...Jamie Fraser!) but I'm glad I read this, it was fun and a fast read on a camping vacation. The best part were the emails back and fourth. I love that it is set in Portland and Seattle since Portland is where I live - that made it even more fun. For those that haven't read beyond the first book....if it matters at all..I enjoyed each book more and more, the last one was the best..and had the most plot and back history. enjoy!
B0002EXH4K|4.0|The thrash titans Megadeth decided to change their approach to their brand of music with this 1992 release. We start off with the classic track Skin o' My Teeth. Starts off with a nice drum roll intro and then picks up. Marty has a nice solo and through it all it is a solid track. Next we have the excellent heavy metal track Symphony Of Destruction. With its memorable riff and Dave's killer vocals on this track it is one of their most popular songs of all time. Architecture Of Aggression is like Skin o' My Teeth, its a good solid track and just about the same tempo as the first song. Marty does have a nice solo as well but it doesn't beat his solo on Foreclosure Of A Dream. Just as politically incorrect today as it was in 1992 it perfectly describes the path this nation is going down. Marty's solo is killer on this track and it might be the best off the whole album. Next we have Sweating Bullets. Everyone seems to know this song and they call it corny. I agree to some extent but it is good song, I just hate the stop and go guitar. This Was My Life is probably one of the most underrated songs off the whole album, has a great rhythm to the track. Countdown To Extinction is possibly my favorite song on the whole album the riff is really catchy and the chorus is good as well. High Speed Dirt has the speed of the first track and is a cool song about skydiving. Psychotron, a song about making man the perfect killing machine by implanting computer chips in the brain stem. No this isn't something Voivod came up wtih (only old school metal heads understand that) but it was a program that the Soviet Union was experimenting with and is pretty cool. The track rocks and has a good solo. Captive Honor is the tale about a man who goes to jail for crimes \\"against all humanity\\" and dark things happen to him. Ashes In Your Mouth is another nuclear apocalyptic track from Dave and the guys and closes this album out with a bang. The riff is catchy and lyrics are more mature compared to the likes of Sweating Bullets. Now the remaster has the un released song Crown Of Worms. It is a good track and doesn't stick out at all it fits right in with the album.<br /><br />In conclusion, the band has changed a lot since Rust In Peace but this is not their sellout album, it is a different direction they took. If you ask me they decided to blend the up tempo qualities of thrash to the hard rock accesible playing style. The weak point would be production, not as polished as Rust In Peace or Youthanasia after this one. Still a great album and a must have for a Megadeth fan.the likes of Sweating Bullets.

B00785P2QC|5.0|the trash takes a lot of money but it helps with population. The Happiness part is hard cause they allways. have to be sad.
B000003T9B|4.0|This debut rivals the classics of Kill 'Em All, Killing Is My Business, and even The Legacy. \\"Raise The Dead\\" sets the tone for the whole album. A windy background sets the tone, and the sadistic guitar tone brings dread to all who hear the riffs. The double bass intro and Boom! Raise The Dead has you caught up in a whirlwind of headbanging. \\"Rotten To The Core\\" The second track and just as energetic as the first. The riffs aren't too technical but they are catchy. The solo is one of my favorites off the whole album. Rat Skates keeps pace through the whole song and the gang shouts make the whole song catchy as well. \\"There's No Tommorow\\" a true power driven track that shows us a glimpse of the next album (Taking Over) its energetic, Blitz's vocals are high pitched, and the solo is blazing fast. \\"Second Son\\" we see the darker side of Overkill. The lyrics are driven with strength and the track as a whole has a great rhythm. \\"Hammerhead\\" fast riffs and fast drumming. The chorus is a little repetitive but still good. Of course, gang vocal shouts are used to add power here as well. \\"Feel The Fire\\" The listener gets some pretty dark lyrics here mixed with an energetic and up beat feeling. The song gallops (literally) on riffs of intensity. \\"Angels raining down, stories that they tell. J.J. played with fire, now he burns in hell!\\" pretty dark especially for a debut. \\"Blood And Iron\\" Now in the album we see the departure from the upbeat and punkish tracks of \\"Rotten To The Core\\" and \\"Hammerhead\\" we get to the darkest side of the album. While the lyrics aren't as gruesome as say, Hell Awaits, or Endless Pain, they get the job done in the horror and imagery for the listener. \\"Kill At Command\\" This is a track I have named, fast paced dread. Usually darker songs take time to build up. Not this one, it hits you in the face right from the start. The chorus is catchy and everytime I hear it I yell \\"MEET YOUR MAKER!\\" Rat Skates has his most impressive showing on this track. Just listen to the drums, the guy hardly ever gets a break. \\"Overkill\\" The darkest song on here. Full of creepy riffs, insane vocals, catchy and disturbing lyrics, what else could you want from a song?? A great track and one of the bests in ALL of thrash metal.<br /><br />Overall, want to start with Overkill? Try Feel The Fire on for size. While the production is weaker to some of their later albums, I recomend this on the fact that the riffs are catchy, chorus is powerful, Bobby's vocals aren't TOO high pitched like on the next album. (Which I love Taking Over, to some his vocals on that album take time) also check Years Of Decay, Horrorscope, and I would say even Ironbound for a more modern sound with the classic Overkill intensity.sten to the drums, the guy hardly ever gets a break. \\"Overkill\\" The darkest song on here.

B004SIP8JI|5.0|This is actually a second purchase...  Our first DVD was getting stuck in the opening credits (after a zillion viewings...)  Had to replace it...  It's challenging when you don't have one of your favorite movies working at top speed...  I know that Hugh steals the show, but Breckin Meyer and Liev Schreiber have choice parts, too...  Oh, heck, it's all good :)  I do have trouble watching \\"the new\\" Meg at times but... that's Hollywood : 
B000OCXFCO|3.0|This isn't a bad album at all. Its better than some of the stuff the put out after Rust in Peace. In case you didnt guess, this is a political Megadeth album. The tracks aren't bad though a few are a little tiring this is a good album. Plus people wanna bitch about a newer version of A Tout Le Monde, well im pretty sure Metallica made three different versions of Unforgiven so look in the mirror guys. Anyway, this isnt their best album of all time but its a solid album from Megadeth. I like the apocalyptic refrences in this album. It really adds a feel about how Dave sees the modern day society. Some people say that this album sucks because it is politically charged but part of me finds that part interesting. If you are a fan you already have this album im sure if you dont have this, I urge you to check it out, you might like it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I enjoy wasting time onthis game. the lagging controls are the only bothersome issue. when you game a lot you notice the tiniest of delays.
B000002H97|4.0|Early 1990s thrash was dying and Metallica needed a way out as well as all the other bands. Sometimes this album gets a bad review because they were the first to change their sound or \\"sell out.\\" This is not a sell out album this is a solid hard rock/heavy metal album and I will tell you why. Enter Sandman is similar to \\"Tapping Into The Emotional Void\\" by Excel but it is a good song and my Hokies come out to it so its a killer track! Second is Sad But True, a good heavy hard rock song and it has a nice beat. Kirk has a good solo here as well. Holier Than Thou is a fast paced track compared to the first three and for a second a listener thinks they are going back to thrash but it is a good fast paced hard rock song. The Unforgiven is a nice ballad about a man that has been wronged his whole life and is really performed nicely. Wherever I May Roam has a 'different' intro but once it starts it is one of the heaviest songs off the album. I actually like Lars on this performance. Don't Tread On Me is one of the most underrated tracks off the whole album and is a classic in my opinion. Through The Never is like Holier Than Thou, fast paced and semi-heavy. Its a good solid hard rock song. Nothing Else Matters, another ballad and while not as good as the Unforgiven it is still a decent track and James has a great vocal showing. Of Wolf And Man, perhaps the most likely song that could be featured as \\"thrash\\" a really cool track and is in one of my favorites from the band as a whole. Next is the God That Failed. There is some obvious Black Sabbath influence on this track more than anything the guys have ever done. My Friend Of Misery, is probably the low point of the album, not a bad song, but it doesn't match the intensity of Through The Never nor does it match the heavier tracks like Don't Tread On Me. But it is still a good track. The Struggle Within, another semi thrasher ends this album with intensity. Now it is not as good as Ride The Lightning or And Justice For All, but the self titled album is their first good solid release. The sad thing is, this is the best album they will release until Death Magnetic in 2008. I recomend others to skip over Load, Re-load, and St. Anger. If you have to choose one, choose Re-Load though.but the self titled album is their first good solid release. The sad thing is, this is the best album they will release until Death Magnetic in 2008.

B0086700CM|5.0|I'd love to play a game on my kindle because I just got it and still experiencing my little kindle fire.
B000002HMH|2.0|This is in no way above a four star album. And before everyone says, \\"you just don't like when a band changes direction, they can't play thrash forever.\\" Actually, I like it when a band takes a different direction. I liked the Black Album, I like Megadeth's \\"Countdown\\", and Overkill's \\"I Hear Black\\". But seeing the fact this was after the Black Album, it is a let down. Big time. First off, the production is horrible. Lars has never really been the best drummer but the drums are way too stale. James has changed his vocal approach big time. (with his famous OOOhhhhs and YEEAHUUH!) But the blusey riffs are a high point on this album. The solos, well they are not impressive. And I would say something about the bass...but you can't hear it. Ain't My Bitch starts off decently heavy and for the first 45 seconds I was liking the new sound. But when you look at the lyrics and listen to the vocals, it is a laughable track. 2x4, the chorus is boring, and something tells me James is losing his hearing (he says \\"I can't hear you...\\" 16 times in the whole song) way too repetitive for my tastes. Next is the House That Jack Built. A decent rock song and sadly, one of the bests off the album. It has a good riff and possibly in the top 3 best songs off this album. Until It Sleeps is another good song with a creepy intro. I really like this song, it has power, and you can feel the emotion from James on this one. If the songs has this kind of power like this track and the next one, it wouldn't be rated so low. Next is King Nothing, and it is possibly the best rock song Metallica has ever wrote. I like the way it builds up and yes the riffs are simple and so is the drumming but it is just a good solid track nothing wrong with that. 6th is the most overrated song off the whole album. Hero Of The Day is a sad attempt at making a soft rock song for the younger generation. I skip it everytime. Next is Bleeding Me and although it takes awhile to build up it is a good song and one of the bests off the album. The 8th track is Cure, and we go back to step 1. Same riff as Aint My Bitch. Poor Twisted Me, has an opening riff that fades in and out and is already annoying by the time the actual song gets here. James's vocals are altered and it sounds horrible.

The songwriting is hilarious. But next is the song I hate most from this abomination, Mama Said. I'm from the South. It is hard enough to like metal down here when you are surrounded by country music (nothing against the greats like Johnny Cash. They were great. I'm talking modern country) but when you have one of your favorite metal bands stoop so low as to make a country song it angers the listener. Think if Lynyrd Skynyrd made \\"Simple Man\\" absolutely horrible with no emotion, no heart, and just did it so they could be heard. That is exactly what you get with this song. Thorn Within has a decent hard rock riff and once agian draws from the earlier songs like King Nothing. Next to last is Ronnie, and it starts off with a nice blues riff and I actually like this song, it isn't too serious but it is pretty good. Last is the Outlaw Torn and it is a lazy way to end an album. But luckily, Re-Load, while not as good as the Black Album is an improvement over this. I would not recomend this album, but I would recomend Until It Sleeps, King Nothing, and Bleeding Me. Sorry fellas but three good songs can't save this album.s off the album. The 8th track is Cure, and we go back to step 1. Same riff as Aint My Bitch. Poor Twisted Me, has an opening riff that fades in and out and is already annoying by the time the actual song gets here.

B0018O4YT0|3.0|Dark City is one of those movies that I can't help but to have mixed feelings about. For when the movie is good, it's great, but when it's bad, it's embarrassing. I love the aesthetics of the film, the photography and cinematography in general. It really captures that noir element that it's going for, there's, mystery, insomnia, paranoia, vertigo, amnesia, detectives, and hookers. it's all good, it's all there, it's all noir. But then, there's this unexpected twist which knocks you off your seat (in a bad way), Aliens, dressed in some s&m attire, and make really creepy yet nerdy noises. think of the cone heads with a fetish for leather and needles.<br /><br />At the very first moment these \\"hair-less\\" people revealed themselves, I lost all interest in the movie, and thought it would only go down the hill from there, but to my surprise, it didn't, and it managed to re-captre my attention over and over, again, because the mystery and visuals are so engaging, so effective I can't help but to keep watching the story. Needless to say the performances and actors are superb, great cast.<br /><br />Ultimately the movie goes from 10 to 0 in a rather laughable conclusion that throws out any good the movie had done at that point. I am ok with the idea of aliens experimenting with a human society and concepts of existentialism in a noir-ish fashion, but I wish it would have been aesthetically  more subtle, more like Blade Runner and less like Star Trek, the next generation for that Dark city goes from classy noir to trashy, mindless sci-fi in a blink of an eye.<br /><br />Overall, if youwere to watch this film, go for the director's cut and do it with very low expectations.
B0002EXH4A|4.0|So Far, So Good...So What. Underproduced in its time, raw, gritty, thrashy, and its worthy of your hard earned money. Megadeth takes a different approach to their new album in 1988. As with the previous two albums we had a thrash/jazz hybrid that resulted in my favorite Megadeth album (Killing Is My Business) and the band's major breakthrough with Peace Sells...But Who's Buying? Here we see Megadeth take a step back and go for a more thrash/punk filled album. By no means is it a crossover album, but instead, something entirely new. \\"Into The Lungs Of Hell\\" the instrumental that starts off this underrated thrash classic. It has a few nice solos here and there but its main job is to prepare the listener for the next track, \\"Set The World Afire\\" this is the first song Dave wrote after being kicked out of Metallica. I like the intro session from The Ink Spots' classic song, \\"I Don't Want To Set The World On Fire\\" this is a great nuclear warfare track that Megadeth soon came to master. In fact, it is one of their most dreadful songs that hint at impending doom with a nuclear holocaust. \\"Anarchy In The U.K.\\" Remember I said they went for a punkish vibe? Here is part of your proof. A great cover from the Sex Pistols. Dave's vocals sound a little stressed but it is okay they fit well with the song. \\"Mary Jane\\" Megadeth takes on the supernatural again like in Peace Sells... Overall it is a great track and has some really nice guitar work, some of the best off the album. One of the major highlights. \\"502\\" another punkish song, with a \\"Last Rites/Loved To Deth\\" feel to it. The song is about running from the cops. A good song that could have been better if Dave wasn't so strung out on drugs. \\"In My Darkest Hour\\" The semi-ballad to Metallica's fallen bassist Cliff Burton. One of the greatest songs ever written. The intro is beautiful for a metal band, and the riff, well it is so simple, yet incredibly catchy. It makes for a memorable listen. The solo is great. \\"Liar\\" another punkish feel latches on to this track. It is about former guitarist Chris Poland who, in turn, stole guitars for drug money or something like that. This track spits pure venom and hate. A great song if you ask me. \\"Hook In Mouth\\" another punk driven thrash classic. The lyrics prove Mustaine's song writting genius (even if he was strung out on drugs at the time) \\"F is for fighting, R is for red, ancestors blood in battles they've shed. E, we elect them. E, we eject the, the land of the free and the home of the brave. D, for our dying, O, for your overture, M, is for money and you know what it cures. This spells out FREEDOM, which means nothing to me, as long as there is a PMRC.\\"<br /><br />So Far, So Good...So What! Has Megadeth at change of pace, and different sound with a punkish vibe replacing the jazz influence from the first two albums. The third album from the fellas of Megadeth is as much of a thrash classic as Peace Sells...But Who's Buying.kish feel latches on to this track.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|This is simply a really good read... I like'd their drama and struggle to figure each other out and what works best for them. It's co-dependancy at its best. Although she is certainly not a damsel in distress which I totaly appreciate and who doesn't love a bad boy. Every man I have ever been attracted to has a bad boy appeal to him, which maybe precisely why I loved this read and its funny momments.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|As mentioned in an earlier review, I don't typically care to write bad reviews since I admire authors and the willingness of someone to put themselves out there, but I feel compelled in this case.  I find the female character to be an idiot! Who gets involved with someone who is such a jerk and stays?  No self respecting, educated, well rounded female that I know.<br />He is so screwed up that most women would have the good sense to run in the opposite direction.  Who wants to be subjected to constantly having to be on guard emotionally around this type of guy? Not me, not ever!<br />I don't even care about the characters enough to read the second book, where almost assuredly she will rescue him from his awful childhood! (How else would there be 2 more books to follow?)<br />Sorry to say I found the sex scenes flat and predictable.<br />I'm sorry, but I wouldn't waste my time on this book if I had it to do over.
034580404X|4.0|This is a great book, I do wish the pricing was lower though.<br />All in all, you must be used to this style of writing from fanfiction, but it still is a great read.
B001MTENOC|2.0|This book left a bitter taste on my mouth. I wish I had never read the book. It is not that I totally deny the possibility of things described in it. What I don't like is souls, once departed from the body, will gain an objective, sometimes even distant, position toward their past lives. I lost my wife in May 2012 after a fierce battle of three years against glioblastoma, a deadly brain cancer, to cure her. If the book is right, my wife will not have the same depth of emotion about our premature separation as I have now. My life with her will seem to her just one of many test projects during her repeated reincarnation.  Such thought makes me feel more miserable and deserted. I also feel, after reading the book, as if souls are using humans as a mere vehicle or instruments for their development. This book simply does not feel right.<br /><br />To elaborate, what makes it hard for me to swallow this book is its portrayal of human lives as a kind of life experiment for the development of souls. If this book is right, I, as a soul, chose my life where my wife had to die of brain cancer to experience the pain of bereavement and as a result to reach higher development of my soul. This book also says something like spirituality belongs to soul and emotion mainly belongs to human. In other words, soul gains development through human's emotional suffering. Well.. If I, as a human part, meets my wiseass soul in person, I want to give him a punch in the face. No matter what higher plane of spirituality he may reach through my suffering, he is nothing but a sadist to me. At least Buddhism makes sense in this regard. If my life had to be the way it is because I was a quack doctors who sent hundreds of people across Jordan river prematurely, then I deserve my lot. Karma can explain human suffering to a certain degree. But a soul choosing a miserable life for enlightenment? I feel it's disgusting.
0345529057|5.0|I watched the first 2 seasons of Game of Thrones on HBOGO and quickly got addicted. Then I got the books and I just started reading Book 1, Game of Thrones. I love it so far. I find that the book goes into more depth on the characters. If anyone is having trouble figuring out which book to read first, it tells you on the back of the book which number it is. I also find there's nothing wrong with the quality of the books. 4 books for $20, why in the world are you complaining???? People find the dumbest stuff to complain about.

B000VNQGUO|4.0|Like all narrative non-fictional works that, eventually in this case, deal with technical subjects whose details are beyond the scope of the non-specialist reader, this book attempts to strike a balance between two extremes, between a book so chock-full of technical detail that it reads like a textbook and a book that skimps so completely on the heart of the matter at hand that it can only be described as fluff.  Singh has done a remarkable job in balancing the two here, it seems to me, and the book is worth any reader's time whose interest is piqued by cryptography.<br /><br />Singh is singularly aided by his subject matter here.  This book was recommended to me by a fellow poster on a crossword puzzle blog which I frequent, as a daily solver of the New York Times crossword.  The discussions on the blog vary from the whimsical to the technical with all manner of things mooted.  So goes Singh's book as well.  But what makes this possible is that cryptography and cryptanalysis, for most of human history, has been no more complex, au fond, than a very difficult crossword puzzle.  And one is not surprised to see a crossword used during WWII by the British to test potential candidates for work at top secret Bletchley Park, which was responsible for cracking Germany's \\"Enigma\\" code.  The crossword is provided in the book and was jolly fun to solve.<br /><br />It seems to me that up to the Vigen&egrave;re polyalphabetic coding, known for centuries as \\"le chiffre ind&eacute;chifferable\\", anyone with an interest in this book could understand and create such a cipher and write an encrypted message in it.  Indeed, it's in deciphering such messages without the \\"keyword\\" that the technical going gets somewhat involved and perhaps beyond the ken of some readers not familiar with basic statistical analysis, and, not coincidentally, this decipherment of such encryptions is where maths starts to predominate.  But it's certainly not difficult to understand the concept of how these encryptions are deciphered, it's merely very tedious and painstaking to do it as Charles Babbage finally did in the 19th Century.<br /><br />Up to this point, for this reader in any event, no trade-off was necessary and Singh is free to fill his tale of codes and ciphers with histories which hinge upon them, starting with the life and death of Mary, Queen of Scots.  Also, he makes an elegant segue in the tale of how the Linear B tablets were finally translated, and the toing and froing of certain egotistical archaeologists etc.  - It should be noted here the final decipherment and translation of Linear B was the cumulative work of men (and one woman) of genius who were linguistic prodigies.  - Again, pass the 19th century and the non-specialist becomes more than a tad lost in the, literally and figuratively, nuts and bolts of Enigma machines and multi-lingual scholarship and fluency.<br /><br />Thus, it's no surprise that the ending of the book was the weakest part for me.  Though it must be said that Singh goes out of his way to use \\"Alice, Bob, Eve\\" analogies to make the concepts clearer most effectively, being able to do what the main players in the tale are doing is far beyond the amateur's grasp.  Also, the book is thirteen years old and the final sections dealing with computer encryption seem a bit dated already.<br /><br />In sum though, a very pleasing, well-written book about the perennial human need to keep matters secret.re deciphered, it's merely very tedious and painstaking to do it as Charles Babbage finally did in the 19th Century.<br /><br />Up to this point, for this reader in any event, no trade-off was necessary and Singh is free to fill his tale of codes and ciphers with histories which hinge upon them, starting with the life and death of Mary, Queen of Scots.

I do however, love a good yarn regardless of the genre.  This, dear readers of my review (if there are any) was a fanstically absorbing, extremely well written and highly relatable tale that I simply could not put down.<br /><br />I don't believe in posting reviews with any spoilers or plot information... so I shall not.  I will, however, make it known that Mr. Hugh Howey is completely responsible for the derelection of my household duties for almost 3 solid days.  Thanks to him, my husband was cranky with me for not laying my Kindle down for longer than completely necessary.  In fact, I think that my 3-year-old daughter is still missing under the laundry pile somewhere.  :  )<br /><br />I have since purchased \\"First Shift\\", and plan on ignoring my family again shortly.

0062082353|5.0|Well, to start, the book was great. I went through the emotion spectrum, from laughing to crying, and back within the same page. Chris' story of the wars and being s SEAL really have given me a real view of the every day occurences that our troops face overseas. I feel that he did a great job writing it: yes it wasn't perfect english, but thats becasue its not written by someone to be a top of the line best seller that little girls get excited over. This is a REAL novel, telling the story of a REAL man who went through REAL heavy times. The way he described the training he went through, the people he met, and the stories he brought back with him when he finished his Navy terms. His life after the war and what it is actually like for people who come back from these places. All in all, I would read this book a few more times, I loved it. It had eveything I wanted. I learned some, I felt every emotion I can feel, and I have looked at life in a different way.<br /><br />Be prepared to read about real llife war situtaions if you are planning on reading this book. The war scenes (especially Marc Lee and Ryan Jobs') really got to me. I wasn't prepared for it.

0141034599|5.0|\\"Thought is only a flash in the middle of a long night. But this flash means everything.\\"<br />Henri Poincar&eacute;*<br /><br />When I talked to friends and colleagues about The Black Swan (\\"BS\\"), they were surprised about my interest in the movie with Natalie Portman. I cannot say, I have not watched it. I was talking about Nassem Nicholas Taleb's book and theory. Some other friends classified at it as American b... s..., these superficial books that give advice on anything and that seem to always become bestsellers; my colleagues would classify it as airport literature, not to be read in academic circles.<br /><br />I read it and enjoyed it, but I have to admit Taleb is sometimes painful. Is it because he was so much frustrated by I do not know whom or what or is it because he is so proud of his certainties? I am not sure. But his ideas are certainly worth thinking about more than a minute. (Whereas you forget about airport American b... s... after 30 seconds). So back to the BS.<br /><br />You'll find great accounts of his book or of his theory, e.g.<br />- Nassim Taleb's \\"The Black Swan\\" by Andrew Gelman,<br />- The Wikipedia page on the Black Swan theory<br />- or even another essay by Taleb, the Fourth Quadrant,<br />so I will not try to do the same.<br /><br />However defining the Black Swan might be useful! In the Fourth Quadrant, Taleb writes the following: There are two classes of probability domains--very distinct qualitatively and quantitatively. The first, thin-tailed: Mediocristan\\", the second, thick tailed Extremistan. Before I get into the details, take the literary distinction as follows: In Mediocristan, exceptions occur but don't carry large consequences. Add the heaviest person on the planet to a sample of 1000. The total weight would barely change. In Extremistan, exceptions can be everything (they will eventually, in time, represent everything). Add Bill Gates to your sample: the wealth will jump by a factor of >100,000. So, in Mediocristan, large deviations occur but they are not consequential--unlike Extremistan. Mediocristan corresponds to \\"random walk\\" style randomness that you tend to find in regular textbooks (and in popular books on randomness). Extremistan corresponds to a \\"random jump\\" one. The first kind I can call \\"Gaussian-Poisson\\", the second \\"fractal\\" or Mandelbrotian (after the works of the great Benoit Mandelbrot linking it to the geometry of nature). But note here an epistemological question: there is a category of \\"I don't know\\" that I also bundle in Extremistan for the sake of decision making--simply because I don't know much about the probabilistic structure or the role of large events. Black Swans are the unknown deviations in Extremistan.<br /><br />Here are more notes taken while reading.<br /><br />[Page xxii] The black swan is characterized by \\"rarity, extreme impact and retrospective (though not prospective) predictability\\" (with additional footnote: the occurrence of a highly improbably event is the equivalent of the nonoccurrence of a highly probably one.<br /><br />[Page 8] The human mind suffers from 3 aliments:<br />-The illusions of understanding, or how everyone thinks he knows what is going on in a world that is more complicated (or random) than they realize;<br />-the retrospective distortion, or how we can assess matters only after the fact, as if they were in a rearview mirror; and<br />-the overvaluation of factual information and the handicap of authoritative and learned people - when they platonify.<br /><br />[Page 15] While in the past a distinction had been between drawn Mediterranean and non- Mediterranean (i.e., between the olive oil and the butter), in the 1970s, the distinction suddenly became between Europe and non-Europe.<br /><br />[Page 54] There is a major difference and often-made mistake between no evidence of something and the evidence of its non-occurence (mental bias.)<br /><br />[Page 77] The answer is that there are two varieties of rare events:a) the narrated Black Swans, those that are present in the current discourse and that you are likely to hear about on television, and b) those nobody talks about, since they escape models - those that you would feel ashamed discussing in public because they do not seem plausible. I can safely say that it is entirely compatible with human nature that the incidences of Black Swans would be overestimated in the first case, but severely underestimated in the second one.<br /><br />[Page 80] One death is a tragedy; a million is a statistic. [...] We have two systems of thinking. System 1 is experiential, effortless, automatic, fast, and opaque. System 2 is thinking, reasoned, local, slow, serial, progressive. Most mistakes come from using system 1 when we think we use system 2.<br /><br />[Page 140] We overestimate what we know and underestimate uncertainty. Another bias, \\"think about how many people divorce. Almost all of them are acquainted with the statistic that between one-third and one-half of all marriages fail, something the parties involved did not forecast while tying the know. Of course, \\"not us\\" because \\"we get along so well\\" (as if others tying the know got along poorly.)\\"<br /><br />[Page 174-179] Poincar&eacute; is a central personality of Taleb's theory, in particular through the 3-body problem. According to Taleb, \\"Poincar&eacute; angrily disparages the use of the bell curve.\\" Now the next figure simply illustrates the concept of sensitivity to initial conditions.<br /><br />Predicting<br /><br />Operation 1: imagine an ice cube and consider how it may melt.<br />Operation 2: consider a puddle of water. Try to reconstruct the shape of the ice-cube.<br />The forward process is generally used in physics and engineering, the backward process in nonrepeatable, nonexperimental historical approaches. And the backward is much more complex to analyze.<br /><br />[Page 198] While in theory it is an intrinsic property. In practice, randomness is incomplete information. Nonpractitioners do not understand the subtlety. A true random process does not have predictable properties. A chaotic system has entirely predictable properties, but they are hard to know.<br />a) There are no functional differences in practice between the two since we will never get to make the distinction.<br />b) The mere fact that a person is talking about the difference implies he has never made a meaningful decision under uncertainty - which is why he does not realize that they are indistinguishable in practice.<br />Randomness in practice, in the end, is just unknowledge. The world is opaque and appearances fool us.<br /><br />[Page 204] Trial and error means trying a lot. In the Blind Watchmaker, Richard Dawkins brilliantly illustrates this notion of the world without grand design, moving by small incremental random changes. Note a slight disagreement on my part that does not change the story by much: the world, rather moves by large incremental random changes. Indeed, we have psychological and intellectual difficulties with trial and error and with accepting that series of small failures are necessary in life. \\"You need to love to lose\\". In fact the reason I felt immediately at home in America is precisely because American culture encourages the process of failure, unlike the cultures of Europe and Asia where failure is met with stigma and embarrassment.<br />[It's really Taleb writing and not the blog's author, but I fully agree !]<br /><br />[Page 207] When you have a very limited loss, you need to be as aggressive as speculative and sometimes as unreasonable as you can be. Middlebrow thinkers sometimes make the analogy with lottery tickets. It is plain wrong. First lottery tickets do not have a scalable payoff. Second, lottery tickets have known rules.<br /><br />The economics of superstars<br /><br />[Page 24] Who is this book written for? You need to understand who your audience is and amateurs write for themselves, professionals write for others. [This irony of the author's is stimulating. I experienced it, I'm an amateur. But are the masterpieces not then written by amateurs? The Black Swans (The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter) look often like a work of amateurs. The Yevgenia Krasnova example provided by Taleb is also stimulating]<br /><br />[Page 214] Someone who is marginally better can easily win the entire pot. The problem is the notion of \\"better.\\" People take from the poor to give to the rich. An initial advantage follows someone through life and keep getting cumulative advantages. Failure is also cumulative. The advent of modern media has accelerated these cumulative advantages. The sociologist Pierre Bourdieu noted a link between the increased concentration of success and the globalization of culture and economic life.<br /><br />[Page 221] Taleb claims new comers mitigate the cumulative advantages. \\"of the five hundred largest US companies in 1957, only seventy-four were still part of that select group, the S&P 500, forty year later. Only a few hundred had disappeared in mergers; the rest either shrank or went bust.<br /><br />Actors who win an Oscar tend to live on average five years longer than their peers who don't. People live longer in societies that have flatter social gradients.<br /><br />[Page 277] What is poorly understood is the absence of a role for the average in intellectual production. The disproportionate share of the very few in intellectual influence is even more unsettling than the unequal distribution of wealth- unsettling because, unlike the income gap, no social policy can eliminate it. Communism could conceal or compress income discrepancies, but it could not eliminate the superstar system in intellectual life. [I am not sure]<br /><br />Skepticism<br /><br />Taleb defines himself as a skeptic and his mentor are Hayek and Popper. He links it with hunility in the following: [Page 190] Someone with a low degree of epistemic arrogance is not too visible, like a shy person at a cocktail party. We are not predisposed to respect humble people, those who try to suspend judgment. Now contemplate epistemic humility. Think of someone heavily introspective, tortured by the awareness of his own ignorance. He lacks the courage of the idiot, yet has the rare gust to say \\"I don't know\\". He does not mind looking like a fool or, worse, an ignoramus. He hesitates, he will not commit, and he agonizes over the consequences of being wrong. He introspects, introspects, and introspects until he reaches physical and nervous exhaustion.<br /><br />Experts<br /><br />[Page 146] We know the difference between know-how and know-what. The Greeks made a distinction between techne and episteme, craft and knowledge. We have experts who tend to be experts: astronomers, pilots, physicists, mathematicians, accountants and experts who tend to be... note experts: stockbrokers, psychologists, councilors... Simply things that move and therefore require knowledge do not usually have experts and are often Black-Swan-prone. The negative effect of prediction is that those who have a big reputation are worse predictors than those who had none.<br /><br />[Page 166] The classical model of discovery is as follows: you search for what you know (say, a new way to reach India) and find something you didn't know was there (America). It's called serendipity. A term coined in a letter by the writer Hugh Walpole who derived it form a fairy tale, \\"The Three Princes of Serendip\\" who \\"were always making discoveries by accident or sagacity, of things they were not in quest of.\\" [...] Sir Francis Bacon commented that the most important advances are the least predictable ones.<br /><br />[Page 169] Engineers tend to develop tools for the pleasure of developing tools. Tools lead to unexpected discoveries. So I disagree with Taleb's definition: A nerd is simply someone who thinks exceedingly inside the box. It may not be contradictory but I prefer the engineer-like one: \\"I think a nerd is a person who uses the telephone to talk to other people about telephones. And a computer nerd therefore is somebody who uses a computer in order to use a computer. [...]<br />And [Page 170] Pasteur claims \\"Luck favors the prepared\\"<br /><br />[Page 170] On the difficulty of predicting, just look at the failure of the Segway which \\"it was prophesized, would change the morphology of cities.\\"<br /><br />[Page 184] Another example of Taleb's target: optimization... Optimization consists in finding the mathematically optimal policy rgar an economic agent could pursue. Optimization is a case of sterile modeling [discussed also in Chpater 17].<br /><br />Globalization/Scalability<br /><br />[Page 28] a scalable profession is good only if you are successful; they are more competitive, produce monstrous inequalities and are far more random.

I am still looking for a single counter-example, a non-dull activity that belongs to Mediocristan.<br /><br />[Page 90] You not only see that venture capitalists do better than entrepreneurs, but publishers do better than authors, dealers do better than artists, and science does netter than scientists.\\" (I can add that gold seekers made less money than the people who sold them picks and shovels.)<br /><br />[Page 102] The consequence of the superstar dynamic is that what we call \\"literary heritage\\" or \\"literary treasures\\" is a minute proportion of what has been produced cumulatively. Balzac was just the beneficiary of disproportionate luck compared to his peers.<br /><br />[Page 118] The problem here with the universe and the human race is that we are the surviving Casanovas (who should not have survived and had his life without luck - no destiny].<br /><br />Statistics<br /><br />Taleb is not against statistics, but against Gaussian law, averages, etc. [Page 37] \\"The near-Black Swan are somewhat tractable. These are phenomena commonly known by terms such as scalable, scale-invariant, power laws, Pareto-Zipf laws, Yule's law, Paretian-stable processes, Levy-stable and fractal laws.\\"<br /><br />One thousand and one days or the story of the turkey confirms to me that an individual may not owe to the society that fed them initially!<br /><br />[Page 239] Standard deviations do not exist outside the Gaussian, or if they do exist, they do not matter and do not explain much. But it gets worse. The Gaussian family (which includes various friends and relatives, such as the Poisson law) are the only class of distributions that the standard deviation (and the average) is sufficient to describe. You need nothing else. The bell curve satisfies the reductionism of the deluded. There are other notions that have little or no significance outside of the Gaussian: correlation and worse, regression. Yet they are deeply ingrained in our methods: it is hard to have a business conversation without hearing the word correlation.<br /><br />[Page 240] Taleb has nothing against mathematicians, but he refers to Hardy's views: The \\"real\\" mathematics of the \\"real\\" mathematicians, the mathematics of Fermat end Euler and Gauss and Abel and Riemann, is almost wholly \\"useless\\" (and this is as true of \\"applied\\" as of \\"pure\\" mathematics).<br /><br />[Page 252] A critical feature of Gaussian statistics is the inclusion of two assumptions: First central assumption: the flips are independent of one another. The coin has no memory. The fact that you got heads or tails on the previous flip does not change the odds of your getting heads or tails on the next one. You do not become a \\"better\\" coin flipper over time. If you introduce memory, or skills in flipping, the entire Gaussian business becomes shaky. (Whereas there is preferential attachment and cumulative advantage in non-Gaussian events.) Second central assumption: no \\"wild\\" jump. The step size in the building block of the basic random walk is always known, namely one step. There is no uncertainty as to the size of the step.<br />[...] I have not for the life of me been able to find anyone around me in the business and statistical world who was intellectually consistent in that he both accepted the Black Swan and rejected the Gaussian and Gaussian tools. Many people accepted my Black Swan idea but could not take its logical conclusion, which is that you cannot use one single measure for randomness called standard deviation (and call it \\"risk\\"), you cannot expect a simple answer to characterize uncertainty.<br /><br />But Taleb goes one step further. [Page 272] \\"But fractal randomness does not yield precise answer. [...] Mandelbrot's fractals allow us to account for a few Black Swans but not all. [...] A gray swan concerns modelable extreme events, a black swan is about unknown unknowns. [...] I repeat: Mandelbrot deals with gray swans; I delal with the Black Swan. So Mandelbrot domesticated many of my Black Swans, but not all of them, not completely.<br /><br />Finance<br /><br />Taleb shows that the stock crashes are sometimes linked to bad modeling and is particularly critical of the Black-Scholes options. He is very much critical of thestock portfolio theories and related Nobel prizes (Markowitz, Samuelson, Hicks or Debreu, \\"wrecking the ideas of Keynes\\". The story of the LTCM hedge fund is an illustration of Taleb's points.<br /><br />Business and technology<br /><br />[Page xxv] Almost no discovery, no technologies of note came from design and planning - they were just Black swans.

B007P06DOK|2.0|This Grammy Award-winning album from 1986 is usually considered to be Paul Simon's crowning achievement in a stellar career with many high-points. His peerless songwriting and poignant lyrics are fused with intelligent use of folk and brass instruments: Zulu Mbaqanga rhythms, the Ladysmith Black Mambazo choir showcasing their a capella style, plus the Zydeco creole music of Louisiana; the Everly Brothers, Linda Ronstadt and Los Lobos also feature in cameo performances. It's absolutely gorgeous and hasn't aged a day in 26 years.<br /><br />The album works best when listened to as a whole experience, rather than sampled track by downloaded track - like having a full meal rather than just eating the beans one day, and the sauce on another occasion. Only when the whole is savoured and digested can the extraordinary blend of complimentary musical styles be appreciated, and the grand creation be enjoyed and fully understood.<br /><br />Now the 1986 CD release was in every way superb, containing a dynamic range allowing for the subtleties of the unusual instrumentation and vocal combinations to shine, with plenty of light and shade. The 2004 `re-mastered' CD was overall `louder' than the earlier mix, lacked the depth and contrast of the original and was definitely not an improvement. Unfortunately this `25th anniversary remaster' (actually the 26th anniversary, not the 25th) CD is, if possible, even worse.  It's another victim of the `loudness war' destroying the subtleties of thoughtful and complex music by compressing the dynamic range, resulting in little difference between loud and quiet sections, diminishing its emotional power and - compared to the 1986 original - making it a tiring experience for the listener. The dynamic range is so reduced by compression and clipping that the result is just loud: as with dance music, it's like being shouted at all the time. Greg Calbi, the engineer, has short-changed genuine music fans and diminished Paul Simon's masterpiece to a result that's just, well - DULL in comparison to what it should be.<br /><br />Best advice is to stick to the 1986 CD release, if you can get a good copy. It's the real deal.result that's just, well - DULL in comparison to what it should be.<br /><br />Best advice is to stick to the 1986 CD release, if you can get a good copy. It's the real deal.

Music from the United-Artists era, such as \\"Soon Over Babaluma\\", \\"Ege Bamayse\\", \\"Tago Mago\\", and \\"Future Days\\" etc. is reminiscent here.<br />My gripe is with the totally sub-par packaging.  The item is actually a calendar-sized cardboard box with an (EXCELLENT) information booklet inside, same square shape.  It covers each selection in detail & provides interesting graphics.  But beneath, the 3 CDs are mounted into totally unprotective cardboard circles from which they need to be pried loose, and CAREFULLY (if any of them hadn't already been jarred loose while en route, as was the case with mine.  That's NOT Amazon's fault, & my discs were fine).<br />Suggestion for anyone purchasing this item:  Round up a few virgin CD cases, such as 3 singles or possibly a 4-disc box) and immediately transfer the CDs into those, where they'd be protected.  Check Amazon's fare; there are several varieties of CD-case sets available.  And keep the info booklet handy, despite its size.
B005LAIH54|3.0|I really enjoyed this lighthearted action movie.<br /><br />It's a fanciful contemporary spin on the myth of how the three brothers Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades, long after having dethroned and permanently immobilized their titanic father Cronos, have become less powerful due to the declining devotions of the people. \\"Not without reason\\" says Perseus sarcastically when he's visited by Zeus with this complaint.  Now here you have the first departure from the Tradition: per Hesiod, the declining sacred religious devotions of people signalled the fall of the golden age into silver, then bronze and iron.  IE, devolutionary descent into skepticism and religious non-observance harms the people rather than the gods.  But of course we live in the modern secular \\"kali yuga\\" ourselves and so the common inverse of the Tradition principle is the pretext instead.  Well that's enough semiotic interpretation there.  Back to the story.  So anyhow Old Cronos is about to bust loose, and hence the need for Zeus to enlist demigod assistance to whup the titans up oncet 'gin.<br /><br />I wasn't overmuch bothered by this modern heresy against the ancient polytheistic Tradition, since the movie immediately presents not as grand tragedy, but as  fun and humorous.  Rather than the pretentious desacralized \\"Troy\\" of diretor Wolfgang Peterson, which plods unhappily along without the gods, as a kind of secular revisionist unsuccessful stab at improving the Illiad.<br /><br />The all star cast was not wasted on this film.  Liam Neeson makes a fine Jove, a wee bit humbler than one imagines Zeus Olympias, but it works in the story.  Ralph Fiennes really steals the show as a conflicted Hades who goes the wrong way due to his ressentiment of his brothers, then turns back to the right path in time to save the day.  Unexpectedly, Vulcan has a big role in this film, which I found very imaginative, depicting him as a kind of skinny elder tinkering sage more so than the jealous cripple often conjured by the Hellenic myths.<br /><br />Sam Worthington perplexes as Perseus a bit, overplaying the reluctant hero theme a bit.  I realize he was probably trying to bring value to a simple action role but hey Sam, thats all it really was. The demigod aspect of the character was just backstory.<br /><br />Rosamund Pike plays an Amazonian Andromeda, all dressed up in a tunica intima and bronze greaves etc, leading the phalanx and so forth.  An even odder twist, but one sense that Hollywood now demands a female presence to fetch in more ticket sales.  She played it well even if it was obligatory and she's easy on the eyes for sure.<br /><br />The special effects to me here were totally satisfactory and can't really help being besides the point with this series since the original \\"wrath of the titans\\" evoked by the title-- the one with Laurence Olivier and Harry Hamlin-- was unforgettable for how cheesy the stop-motion effects seem today.<br /><br />All in all a good rental for watching with one's teenage kids.  I totally recommend it served up with pizza and beer.e Hellenic myths.<br /><br />Sam Worthington perplexes as Perseus a bit, overplaying the reluctant hero theme a bit.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|After downloading this book based on a recommendation from a good friend, I had high expectations. It had been many years since I had read Stephen King. I've always enjoyed his books but sometimes I find they get a little too long winded.<br /><br />I LOVED THIS BOOK. I've never been a huge history buff but the thought of changing history fascinated me. This is so well written, I felt like I was right there along for the ride. Toward the middle of the book, it was slow but I am so glad I stuck with it because once it picked up momentum, it didn't stop. I could turn the pages fast enough.<br /><br />Highly recommended. This one will stick with you!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is an awesome I will regimens it to all of my friends. my brother loves this game too. it's. amazing
0887431453|5.0|My daughter has a great attention span and is already starting to write letters at almost 3 years old. This is the ONLY helpful tool I have seen that challenges her and is fun for the two of us to do together - a page or two each day. She loved the mazes and did those first. At two years, the mazes were about all she could comprehend but as she is growing, more and more of the book is opening up to her. I may be purchasing this book for all of her 3 year old friend birthdays! Highly recommend.
B000003S0D|4.0|I agree with a previous poster regarding the album cover art work, it is nearly equally as spacial as the music.  Many have written with detail regarding the works of this band and it's many guest hosts.  I will say that side 1 will live forever in my mind, it is dramatic and melodic all at the same time.  My favorite bit is Prince Ruperts Lament and Robert Fripp's guitar work, simply genius.  I also favour Indoor Games as it might pertain to anyone you know, cough, hint, hint.
B007Y5IAV0|4.0|I always enjoyed listen to serjs albums, loved s.o.a.d. the lyrics are always my favorite part, I love music work a message and some real thought. Most music is nothing more then a product, a quick grab at cash, this album is worth the price
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|pretty easy and fun the nice thing is that there are many levels to do. Fun story line to with it.
B001GZ6QEC|3.0|The Dark Knight, like many of Christopher Nolan's movies, is predicated on lies. The movie depicts a world which needs to be lied to, a society which cannot face a full-blown encounter with the truth. Hence, the hero - Batman himself - embodies deception in its purest. He has a secret identity known to less than a handful of people. The secret identity itself is based on people's uncanny fear of bats i.e. of a mammal with wings often used to cloak itself. Yet it's not simply that Batman has to maintain a lie. In order to save society, the District Attorney Harvey Dent had to pretend he was Batman; Dent had to lie to the city in order to save the city itself. In the end, of course, Batman returned the favour by willingly taking on the role as baddie, as Dent's killer, in order that the city would have a hero to celebrate. Dent (a good guy turned bad) was venerated and Batman (a great guy turned bat) was vilified - this was the solution the city had to be fed.<br /><br />The `Dark Knight', thus, refers to the falsely incriminated hero who takes on the sins of the real criminals so the city could continue life as normal believing in lies.<br /><br />The arch-villain, the Joker, on the other hand, is all about truth. He sought to expose the truth of Batman's identity, of love and dilemmas (was Rachel Dawes more worth saving than Harvey Dent?), of the superficiality of noble intentions (could a public figure/hero turn bad over the death of a loved one?), of human self-centeredness (could a group of people willingly blow up another group to save themselves?) and, most critically, the truth of what it takes for society to police itself. Towards the movie's end, Batman realized that the only way to apprehend the Joker was to rely on mass surveillance, effectively ending the privacy of Gotham's inhabitants. That is the price and the ground of peace - an exceptional act which takes the form of violence.<br /><br />Nolan also presents a stark and awkward contrast between the candor of evil and the superficiality of the good. The Joker never takes anything personally - perfect candidate for Prime Minister? Batman takes justice too personally - perfect example of a political whiner? The Joker uses anarchy to expose the lies the people tell themselves (of goodness, of heroes, etc.). Batman uses and perpetuates a lie - himself! - so people can continue believing in the illusory motifs of hope and justice. Batman wears a mask and disguises his voice. The Joker wears make-up, which is to say that he turns his face into a mask - i.e. the Joker becomes the mask he wears which is about as close to the truth as anybody can get (simply reflect on how many personalities we `put on' in our everyday dealings; the Joker, really, has only one face and is entirely transparent) - and doesn't bother faking his voice.<br /><br />Could the painful message of the movie therefore be that, in a world as messed up as ours, we often yearn to be lied to almost as desperately as we yearn for justice? Are we totally equipped to handle transparency and truth?<br /><br />When politics and power are concerned, we must reflect on the possibility that truth is something that must be discarded at times without which chaos would reign. Political governance is inseparable from the sacrifice of truth, the betrayal of heroes and the elevation of falsehood. Political maturity, hence, is not simply the ability to expose socio-political lies but to decide which lies have to endure and be endured.<br /><br />Does all this simply translate into the boring fact that all politicians must lie? No, it means that in radical politics truth often takes the form of fiction. Justice may look like injustice. Strength can appear as weakness.<br /><br />Democracy may resemble its violation.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I absolutely love the original CrossMe app and this is certainly an interesting, albeit sometimes more challenging, twist. I certainly do enjoy this game and recommend it to many of my friends.It's amazing how a simple picture can be such a great payoff after struggling for hours on certain puzzles.

0345803485|1.0|Best part about this trilogy for me is that it was loaned to me; I didn't spend my hard earned cash on this garbage.  The story line is hideous, the sex scenes (which are every other page) are not even good.  The entire first book is demeaning of women.  I really wonder about the psyche of the women who rave over the greatness of this trilogy.  The editor needs to find a job grading first grade papers as there are numerous edit errors that make the flow almost impossible to follow at times.  It probably DID enhance my sex life as it made me appreciate my husband a bit more.  I don't know what more to say other than don't waste your money or time.  I'm half-way through the second book and I've decided to just give them back.  I'd rather spend my time watching grass grow.
0345803485|5.0|I love these books!! Why is everyone so focused on the sex in these books?? They are a journey of transformation and unconditional love.<br /><br />It's important to take the 3 books together as a whole. They are not about sex (though there is a LOT of it here). The \\"real\\" story doesn't fully being until the 2nd book...the 1st more or less setting the stage.<br /><br />A bit of details with some spoilers to the books:<br /><br />I think some people are put off in the first book by the \\"Contract\\".  It has some uncomfortable things listed there, particularly for the \\"vanilla\\" type person. And if you're reading hoping they WILL happen...well then you'll probably be disappointed.  Most of these things are only to plant a seed in the reader's mind...make you wonder exactly what will happen.  The majority of them never actually do.<br /><br />So many are bashing this as a set-back for women, saying the protagonist is dominated by the man...clearly they have not actually READ the books.  Ana will NOT submit to Christian.  She does find she enjoys some of things in the 'darker' side of him, but the journey of her leading Christian to the 'light' is quite profound. It's not an easy transformation for Mr. Grey, but he loves Ana so very much and she's quite a strong woman.<br /><br />Is it writing at its finest? No. The author will admit that herself. But it IS captivating and told in an easy to read, comfortable style that only grew on me the deeper I got into the books. Ana's subconscious and inner goddess...at first annoying repetitives, morphed into additional characters that gave me insight into the struggle Ana was feeling within.<br /><br />It's disappointing that many of the negative comments I've been reading (here and elsewhere) seem to be by people who have not actually READ the books.  Their comments lead me to believe they've flipped through a few pages, or just as bad...rely on what someone else has said rather than deciding for themselves.<br /><br />E. L. Jameshas written a series that can make the reader laugh, cry and even swell with joy.  That's all you can ask from any good book.
B00005JLR8|5.0|I read a lot of best of lists. I would see this film in many such lists but I waited for all these months and years to finally watch it this night. In America instantly grabbed me by that part of brain I pray so hard to relax with Yoga. It has a pulverizing magnitude, the kind that made my head spin because of the terrific association with the characters.<br /><br />In America is an experience that I won't forget for several days, I think I will be dazed but shush I shouldn't predict such things I've been advised.<br /><br />There were three scenes in the film during which I found myself helpless and miserable but dear reader, it doesn't end there just like it doesn't begin there.<br /><br />I can hardly believe this film exists, I wouldn't like to take away anything away from it but I must say it instantly enters my all time top ten. In America - reminds me of why I watch films with a voracious vengeful pace, it is to find solace in dramas woven with a tender touch of magic, finality, sensation and heartbeats such as this one. Thank you.

There are 20 legal systems examined in this book.<br /><br />Such is the practical value of the series and, specifically of this book, which offers in one convenient volume, a learned and wide-ranging overview, (termed a `National Report') on commencement of insolvency procedures in each of 20 countries worldwide and there is quite a cross section -- from Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Cameroon and Canada, to Sweden, Tanzania and the United States (oh yes, and England too - `England', we take it, refers to England and Wales).<br /><br />Some of the selected countries are economically developed; others are emerging - some with common law jurisdictions, others with civil, or mixed legal systems.<br /><br />Two of the editors, Dennis Faber and Niels Vermunt (who are also the series editors) express the view that `this is the foundation of any future harmonization of insolvency law that would have a chance of widespread acceptance, and the series thus complements pending international projects on insolvency matters initiated elsewhere.'<br /><br />Note that much of the previously inaccessible material provided in this volume now emerges conveniently in English The hoped for result, in the words of the editors, is that this book and those which follow will `(demystify) national perspectives on insolvency-related subjects... by illuminating divergences and common elements of national laws,' as well as inspiring innovative ideas and analysis and ultimately, criticism wherever appropriate.<br /><br />For the sake of consistency and clarity, each article is similarly structured to facilitate - in the words of the preface --- meaningful comparisons without stripping national narratives of their richness.<br /><br />We infer from another statement by the four editors that their approach is descriptive, rather than prescriptive and for the most part, non-judgmental.  `We do not venture into the troubled waters of judicial independence,' they say, `or worse, corruption, even though lack of the former (and the presence of the latter) may obviously have massive influence'.<br /><br />This research, they add, is better left to comparative legal sociologists, `hoping that they might perhaps find our conclusions of use in delineating the agenda for their work.'<br /><br />Distinguished by its usability, as well as readability, this copiously footnoted book is a mine of scholarly information, not to mention numerous tools for further research.<br /><br />It provides a detailed table of contents, extensive reading lists and massive tables of cases and legislation, plus a lengthy index at the back.<br /><br />Practitioners, as well as academics involved in global business, would do well to add this useful and enlightening book to their professional libraries.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is a GREAT app, I can't even fully put into words how amazing it is. It is easy to create notes (big or small) and edit them and organize them. You can have different folders so for example if you want to take notes in a class you can put them in that folder, and then your to-do notes can go somewhere else. There is something you can use on your web browser that clips the pages and it will be sent to your evernote account on your kindle. They also have a companion computer application so you can write notes on your computer and they are all synced. Definitely recommend this. Never had a problem with force closing.
B001NLKT60|5.0|The second book of Stieg Larsson's trilogy was better than the first and I really enjoyed the first.<br />Excellent character development and a thriller to the end. Can't wait to read the third book.<br />Also, I am sad that there will be no more. I would have been a long time fan of Larsson.

B0086700CM|5.0|I cannot stop playing this game. I usually like puzzle games, but this one has me hooked! The path changes every time you play it so you can't memorize what is coming next. It is so fast-paced it makes my heart race at each turn.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|This is one of the worst books I have downloaded for a long time, it is poorly written and not at all compelling. I felt like having a shower after reading it and that wasn't because of the sex scenes. Don't waste your money people.

B005NPLXJ4|4.0|First of all, the Editor who wrote ´Tallica as Metallica is a \\"moron\\". No harm intended. Second, Lou Reed claimed to have invented Heavy Metal when in 1975 he recorded Metal Machine Music as the ultimate conclusion of that genre. Now, Lulu is the outcome of that assertion, lyrically and musically. An attempt to go farther than Bowie did with Tin Machine in 1990. Why all the connections? To show that you have to be a \\"sound lover\\" to get outside de box and \\"listen\\". Enjoy....

B001AH6ZWY|4.0|I haven't read the book, but the movie was really easy to follow and quite interesting. Really worth the time and money, I feel. I also think it backs up some theories and ideas I have for my \\"Aliens\\" book, which I haven't started writing yet but have growing inside my head.

034580404X|5.0|Got all three books in the middle of June and read all twice before the end of the month! Such a page turner, I laughed, cried, got angry, and want to read more of the Grey family.  Don't know how it's going to turn out as a movie, would have to be rated R-17 or X or cut alot out of the book so what would be the use of that.  You have to leave the \\"inner goddess\\" remarks in the story line as they made me laugh, and the back and forth e-mails, it will be interesting to see if Hollywood can do this.  Gonna start reading it again, I can't get enough of it.
B005LAIGNC|1.0|Atrocious. I can only imagine that the real Tuskegee airmen are rolling in their graves. Honestly the terrible characters and tepid story line could be forgiven, but the dialogue, oh the cringeworthy dialogue... Somewhere between robot and overtly racist minstrel cartoon. The white people's lines are read by Microsoft Sam and the black people are horrific parodies of a Chris Rock character. Oh, and the dogfight scenes in this are so cheesy they make 'Pearl Horbor' and 'Flyboys' look like historical documentaries. George Lucas truly is a hack.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|This game will rip you off!  I was charged 14.99 for a \\"Oppossum Pack\\" that I never ordered.  I realize that sometimes kids will get on these games and click things that they think are free but they're not. This is NOT what happened.  I'm the only one who has ever played this and I'm a 35 year old woman!  I would have known if I was purchasing something for real money.  In fact, I've barely even played this game at all.  After some research I realized that the \\"Oppossum Pack\\" is a pack of 250 acorns.  Guess what??  I didn't even get the acorns that I was charged for against my will!  So, not only are they randomly charging me for things I never purchased, they aren't even giving me what they are charging me for!  Ridiculous!!<br /><br />Obviously this app will be removed from my Kindle Fire ASAP.  I would beware if you are considering ordering it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was surprised by how the first book snatches the reader's attention and basically makes you regret having to stop reading. You just want to keep on reading, until you can breath again. I haven't finished the Trilogy yet, but feel it will be worth it. Also, this being my first Kindle experience, I can definitely say it will be a device I'll carry with me for a long time!
B003UESJIS|4.0|Don't get me wrong -- this slice-of-life movie is very well done.  But how is it that such excellent writing, directing, and acting leave me sad and a bit puzzled?  Is there nothing beyond what Tom and Gerri can see?<br /><br />Or is that the question we are supposed to ask?<br /><br />What of the opening words of the funeral service, which we hear outdoors as the family arrives for the service:  \\"I am the resurrection and the life, says the Lord.  Those who believe in me, even though they die, will live....\\"<br /><br />On a different line, I'm puzzled that few reviewers mention elements of Mary's life by which she spoils her own chances of happiness.  This goes far beyond the counselors' words about taking responsibility.<br /><br />Or does it?  Maybe that's all the movie means.
0345528581|5.0|never new there where so many exercises you could do with just your own body weight , love this book . Read it cover to cover lot's of great information to get you started on the right track !

0545128285|5.0|My two children are obsessed with Harry Potter.  They have cloaks and wands and of course all the movies and books.  When they got this book they were ecstatic.  They had of course known about these tales from within the story of Harry Potter but to have an actual copy made their day!  Great book to add to the Harry Potter collection.
B000BNI90O|5.0|Everything is here, from Gandalf's and Aragorn's little singings to Enya's \\"May it Be\\". How can you go wrong? I have the single disk versions for in the vehicle, but THIS set is what I listen to at home. Excellent!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|If you've read the first two books, this is a must read. It gives an ending to the triligy. Good thing, as the author has passed away.
B000V6BE6M|5.0|This is my favorite set of all of the Complete Recordings. All of the great songs are here in their entirety. I love the last few songs, and this set does not disappoint! For any true Lord of the Rings fan, this is a must have! Get the other two Complete Recordings, as well, and let the music play on!
B007L3BMGA|1.0|This book is so overated. I'm all for erotica but it's such a disappointment in this day and age that a woman is  portrayed as the sweet, innocent virgin who needs to be enlightened by the billionaire, powerful male stalker. It is degrading to the female protagonist who has to be the submissive and have the twisted lead male control what she eats, wears etc. The writing is cringe worthy- oh my- I felt like puking everytime I read that phrase!
B006UG90RM|1.0|I gave it a one star (not surte if zero stars is an available option) because of Eddie's guitar work (great as usual but it doesn't make the songs any more tolerable).  I'd give it 5 starts for Eddie's mastery but its about the songs and not necessarily the guitar work alone. The lyrics are pure crap (to put it nicely).  Dave's voice is actually pretty good but if he wrote the lyrics then he needs to revisit how he helped write all the other good stuff.  After all, how many times can one say \\"tattoo\\" in one song?!!  The nice harmonies and backing vocals are obviously gone since Mikey left.  The little VH on bass is adequate at best.  So annoying.  I actually deleted this nonsense from my iPhone.  Trust me, I've been a VH fan since VHI but this album is the worst (Gary's album was even better than this sorry piece of #$%^).
1936608898|5.0|I've voraciously read pretty much every Primal/Paleo/Gary Taubes/Michael Pollan-esque book out there in the quest for better health, but this is hands down my new favorite food and wellness book and the one that will be the most dog-eared and highlighted in my collection. Unlike other books I've read, I didn't just learn about food itself - I learned a lot about fixing my relationship with it. I now understand what's really responsible for my food cravings, why my body reacts the way it does to the things I eat, and how to improve my health through diet - all backed by extensive research, but written in laymen's terms.<br /><br />Thank you, Dallas and Melissa, for taking my knowledge to the next level and giving me a sense of empowerment to finally overcome many years of food cravings and addictions. I never thought it was possible, but I now have a relationship with food that encourages optimal health instead of making mindless emotional choices.
B006XIR9KM|3.0|On my Photon 4G after playing for a while, it won't let me exit the game or turn the phone off.  I had to yank the battery. It's happened twice now. Too bad, cause it's a fun brain teaser.
B00005JMYI|5.0|The script may have have the imprateur of Will Ferrell and Adam McKay but I also sense the influence of Judd Apatow, Todd Phillips, and David Wain.  Take it a step further Steve Carrell gained prominence on \\"The Daily Show\\" and Christina Applegate cut her bones on \\"Married With Children\\".  This is a terrific Seventies satire capturing the mores and fashion of that time.  The film makes a point of highlighting institutionalized sexism but oddly glosses over racism but thats a minor quibble.  This may be Ferrell's greatest screen creation with his Burgundy an amalgam of hair, mustache, and pomposity.  Thought it was a nice touch naming his dog Baxter, a reference to the idiot news anchor, Ted Baxter, played by the late, great Ted Knight from \\"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\\".  Equally funny is his rival from another station played by Vince Vaughn is named Wes Mantooth which recalls the bland actor from \\"Emergency\\", Randolph Mantooth.  I saw this in the theatre in 2004 but it left no impression on me.  Watching it now I appreciate it as a milestone in modern comedy.  Time has caught up with Ron Burgundy and is very kind.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great storytelling, and very enjoyable to read. Loved how many deep characters there were, and how the author doesn't shy away from killing them off or introducing new ones even after the first few books. Probably one of the best sci-fi books/series i have read in a long time.
B005B0QYMM|5.0|This movie starts out slow and corny, but that's the point.  The second half of the movie is terrifying if you imagine yourself in the situation.  Lots of good scares, I HIGHLY recommend it.

B004SH40BQ|5.0|Very quick delivery. Arrived in a box with other items, it's own box a bit bigger than a box of matches.<br />It really is very small, about the size of the screen on my 2nd generation nano.<br />Read the instructions and paired it to my new headphones (LG TONE HBS700, also purchased on Amazon).<br />Turned the headphones on to \\"pairing\\" mode, plugged the KOKKIA into my ipod, saw it's blue LED light flash quickly, heard a bleep on my headphones and then pressed play on the headphones. Repeated the process for the other ipod. The whole procedure took less than 2 minutes.<br />Range may not be enough for some but works for me. I know my nano is coming to the end of it's life (after about 7 years abuse the screen is unreadable but it still plays ok) and I didn't want to have to wear my classic on my arm at the gym - now I won't need to.

0765365278|5.0|I felt when putting a title on this review that the final words of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" would be somewhat appropriate. I, like Samwise the Brave, have returned from a great journey.<br /><br />That journey lies within the pages of Brandon Sanderson's novel, \\"The Way of Kings\\".<br /><br />There are a couple bottom lines I'd like to make clear before I discuss this book in more depth, and I'll go ahead and set them up here to prevent anyone from unnecessarily spending their valuable time.<br /><br />1. \\"The Way of Kings\\" is the best book I've read in a while. 9.5/10 on my scale.<br />2. I've noticed a lot of reviews draw comparisons between \\"Kings\\" and Robert Jordan's \\"The Eye of the World\\" / \\"The Wheel of Time\\" series. This got me thinking - it's probably good that I make clear what I think of the three prevalent fantasy-series touchstones before I discuss this book so whoever reads this knows how my mind works. This reader loved \\"A Game of Thrones\\" as well as the subsequent series, but found books 4 and 5 quite tedious. My reactions to Robert Jordan's WoT series are lukewarm at best - I found \\"The Eye of the World\\" to be derivative, predictable, and a lot of the time very poorly written. This being said, yes, I enjoyed it for what it was. I loved \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" but have clearer and fonder memories of \\"The Hobbit\\".<br />3. Books like \\"Dune\\" tax my patience. Heavily.<br />4. I hate reviews with spoilers. Be at peace, wary reader. Here, there be no dragons.<br />5. This book is over 1200 pages long. I've spent about three weeks reading it. This review is going to be long as well, and arguably nowhere near as well written.<br />6. Did I mention that I didn't like \\"Dune\\"?<br /><br />Now that we've gotten the introductions out of the way, on to \\"The Way of Kings\\" itself. I'll go ahead and call it TWOK from here on out. It sounds cool and it's easier to type. So. Here we go.<br /><br />ATMOSPHERE: As I think I already made clear, this book absolutely blew me away. Carried me away might be a better phrase, actually, or transported me Elsewhere with a capital E. It did everything I want a fantasy book to do - took me out of my world and introduced me to one so fantastic, so alien, so unforgettable and yet so believable that I found myself thinking about it...well, all the time. I would describe the world in detail, but so many other reviews have beaten me to it I'll skip that and relegate myself to saying this - imagine an ocean floor without the ocean. I think someone may have actually already written that. Well done, anonymous person. You hit it right on the head.<br /><br />There are more mysteries in this world than there are answers, and whenever one question is answered another four sprout up in its place. The nature of the highstorms (and their somewhat ominous sounding \\"Origin\\") was of particular note to me, not to mention the nature of \\"spren,\\" the strange spirits that accompany basically everything in the world. If I were to pick a character to fall in with, I'd roger up with Axies the Collector, a side character from one of the Interludes who I sincerely wish Sanderson would make into an entire storyline. When you find yourself fascinated by the daily life of characters that have no bearing whatsoever on the overall storyline, you know the author has done something right with their Worldbuilding. This, actually, brings me right into my next point of review.<br /><br />CHARACTERS: The book focuses on four main characters, or maybe it would be more accurate to say three and a half. Kaladin, Dalinar and Shallan account for the majority of the book, and though he appears far less frequently, Szeth-son-son-Vallano, Truthless of Shinovar (Yes, that's his name) accounts for what remains. There are a smattering of side characters, some utterly forgettable and others utterly unforgettable (Axies the Collector, for instance, who travels the world studying spren) and they form the interludes between parts. In the end, you'll care about some more than others. Fortunately, Sanderson did this on purpose. The result is that when one chapter ends, you're angry because you don't want to leave their storyline. And then you finish the next chapter, and feel the same way. And so on and so forth. It's similar to what Martin did with his Song of Ice and Fire series, except without the Sansa chapters.<br /><br />I noticed that one of the chief complaints about this book was that it has a lack of gray characters. This fascinates me, because gray characters tend to grate on me after a while. Again, I'll go ahead and reference that Other (pun intended) epic fantasy series, \\"A Song of Ice and Fire,\\" for a reference point here. I love it when characters surprise me. I don't like it when there aren't really any heroes I feel like I can root for. George Martin, I'm talking to you here. But I digress. Are the characters in TWOK relatively one dimensional? I suppose maybe they are.<br /><br />There are others who suggest the characters found in this book are largely derivative. I disagree, except to say that they are very typical heroes. I think I like that, though. I like that Sanderson has heroes who are capable of heroic things. Who else would a fantasy writer choose to follow? The uneventful people? Would that be like Holden Caulfield goes to Middle Earth? I don't know. Maybe it could work. The point is that Sanderson has characters I can get behind, characters I can fall in love with, who I can fear for (I'm thinking of one character in particular here) and who when they are in genuine danger I can start gnawing my fingernails. I thought the characters in this were great, for what they were. And let's be honest here. The last 75 pages have more twists and character revelations packed into them than the other 1125 pages combined. This brings me around to the next part of my thoughts.<br /><br />PLOT, PROSE AND PROGRESS: One of the chief complaints about \\"The Way of Kings\\" is that nothing much happensin it. I blame this sentiment (and yes, I use the word blame because I think this is a shortcoming of us as readers) on the fact that we live in a largely instant society. We want everything NOW. Take, for instance, the adoration a lot of people have for \\"The Eye of the World\\". Things start happening pretty fast in that book and they don't really let up. For a reader like me, that's boring. TWOK is more about setting up a storyline. It's a 1200 page introduction to a 10 book mega-epic that demands an enormous setup. It's the kind of book that has a prelude and a prologue, lots of interludes and lots of parts.<br /><br />This being said, I never once felt like the book was lacking in action. There are battles galore, intrigues, mysteries, romances and failures. There's a real sense of wonder and mystery in this world - its inhabitants are as baffled by it as we are as readers. This comforts me. I liked that I didn't feel stupid reading this book. A lot of the time, I was sitting there going \\"Wait, what's this now?\\" only to discover a character a few pages later going \\"So wait...what was that, then?\\" Sanderson is trying something interesting here, introducing a world where characters don't know what's happening. Unlike most other books, which have the standard Wise Old Person to tell them exactly what is happening, this book doesn't have one (yet). The characters, readers and story wander around in the dark with a candle, looking for something while hearing frightening sounds coming from the shadows. The Alethi Kingdom is at war, and yet everyone has a strange sense of creeping dread that we the readers are infected by. We know SOMETHING is coming - we just don't know what. Something called the Night of Sorrows. The True Desolation. What that means and who its bringing, we never do quite figure, but it sure doesn't sound like they're bringing sweeties.<br /><br />Brandon Sanderson has a strange way of writing. I say this fondly. His prose is never astonishing. When Iread George Martin, for example, I usually come across a paragraph/line or two that I savor in my mouth for a bit before carrying on. Patrick Rothfuss does this too, and so does R. Scott Bakker. There are always those zingers that I text to my friends, often annoying them with my enthusiasm. Sanderson has none of that. His paragraphs are simple, his words elemental. He sets out to tell us a story, not wow us with his language. I'm wowed anyway. Prose this transparent, this clear, this unpolluted and convincing...it's a gift. In other words, his writing is deceptively intelligent. I was in awe for reasons I've never really been in awe before. In fact, when someone asked me for a good quote from the book, I was genuinely stumped. The book itself is a quote. It cannot be separated from itself.<br /><br />OTHER FACTORS: One of the things that impressed me most about this book was the storyline of Kaladin. Kaladin himself may be your run of the mill hero (the general who became a slave, the slave who became a gladiator, the gladiator who defied an emp - oh, wait, wrong movie, I mean book, I mean - aw phooey...) but he's approached differently than I've ever seen a character like this approached in fantasy. Here, Kaladin earns his place as a leader by a painstaking process which unfolds over literally hundreds of pages. Leadership isn't a microwave meal, and neither is Kaladin's story. His struggles, his dilemmas, his obstacles and solutions are all strikingly realistic. As a current United States Marine, I found myself thinking a lot about some of the people I serve with while I read this. The portrayal of what it means to be a leader that Sanderson has created here is uncannily accurate, and really gives some good guidance on what it means to be a better leader. This, needless to say, is quite impressive.<br /><br />I noticed some complaints that the women have hardly any role in this book. This is true. Only one of the three main characters is female, and she only hasone of the biggest character twists in the story. (If you haven't caught the sarcasm dripping from my words, here's your cue to chuckle.) Look, I'm not going to deny that the women in this book are pretty much the same spunky independent females you get in most fantasy books, but I think that can boil down the fact that it's surprisingly difficult to write a female character everyone can get behind. The closest thing I can think of off the back of my hand is probably Katniss from the recent \\"Hunger Games\\" trilogy, and even she had her nay-sayers. Plus, she was written by a woman, which definitely helps. This is a story about war, and the women in it are certainly subject to a patriarchal society. I for one have a hunch they will play a bigger role later on in the series (in fact, the twist I mentioned in Shallan's storyline basically assures this).<br /><br />Magic is used in a way unlike anything I've really seen before. Rather than dying out in the world of Roshar, it's coming back, and no one really knows what it is or how to handle it. The result is exhilarating - magic feels mysterious, dangerous and intriguing. Exactly the way magic should feel, in my opinion - unless its in \\"Harry Potter\\". For example, in TWOK, gems hold stormlight in them which is used to power magical armor called Shardplate or to light a street. Different colored gems means multicolored lanterns. As a result, streets at night turn into little disco parlors. This is just one of the many ways Sanderson uses magic in this world.<br /><br />Most importantly, I think, is the sense of wholeness that Sanderson's world has here. The amount of detail with which he can see the imaginary is nothing less than astonishing. The book comes with a copious amount of artwork inside it, which adds to the story in a way I've never seen used before. The art is beautiful and masterfully done, to the point that I want to buy the hardcover edition of this book just so I can have larger copies of it.<br /><br />WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: Not much. I mean that honestly. I noticed one of the chief complaints amongst readers was that the book was too long. This made me chuckle a little bit. It reminded me of when I went to see \\"The Return of the King\\" in theaters, knowing full well that the film was going to run over three hours, and yet my friends still complained about how long it was. Friends and fellow readers. Please, for the love of everything that is holy, don't pick up a book that is 1200+ pages and then complain that it is long. Yes, it is very long. It was intended to be. It's a comprehensive, detailed look at a magical world. Not every moment is going to be spent in swashbuckling glory. There are going to be times when characters need to sit around campfires discussing the strange natures of markings on other character's chests. This book didn't come out of a microwave. Someone sat down and wrote out 1200 pages of great material that culminated in a great book with a distinct beginning, middle and end. I dare you to try the same.<br /><br />Are there some parts of the story where the language gets carried away with itself? Sure. As long as I'm being honest, I actually had to put down the book a couple times to rub my eyes when a couple of the characters had incredibly emo moments. I also had to put a belt between my teeth early on to avoid breaking all my molars at the shockingly immature use of the word \\"storm\\" as a swear word. It's funny - the story addresses mature themes such as suicide, murder, rape, the controversy of religion - and yet when it comes to swearing, characters say things like \\"Storm you!\\" or even \\"Storm off!\\" I think my favorite was \\"Storm off!\\". I wondered the first time I read that if I had made a terrible mistake.<br /><br />Are there slow parts? You bet. There were a few slow parts in a couple other books that come to mind, such as \\"War and Peace,\\" \\"Anna Karenina,\\" \\"The Brothers Karamazov,\\" even \\"East of Eden\\". \\"But Sanderson is neither Russian nora Depression era Californian!\\" some people cry. Sure. He's not. He's a 21st Century American writer who wanted to tell a story about a war and a whole lot more than that. A few slow parts in a 1200 page book really isn't that bad. If you are looking for instant gratification, STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK. If you're looking for a world to roll around in and delight in, please, buy it and encourage this man to write more. I honestly don't know what I'm going to be doing for the next year.<br /><br />Last but not least, the real subject matter of the book - namely a couple of the twists towards book's end - made me hesitate. Understand now that this book has a very serious undertone to it, and when it hits you what this series is really about, you'll know. I can think of another fantasy trilogy which addresses themes Sanderson brings up late in this book, but I'm willing to operate on a little faith here. (For those who have read the book, you'll get the pun there.) The twists are great. A couple of them I genuinely didn't see coming, and they blew me clean off my rocker. One was underwhelming. One was genuinely bewildering. So it goes.<br /><br />In the end, I can't recommend this book enough. It's got great - albeit one dimensional - characters, an utterly original storyline with just enough of the familiar fantasy trope to make us feel at home in our own genre. The world it introduces to us is breathtaking, one which we will have no problem whatsoever spending 10 books frolicking in. The questions it raises at books end are tantalizing, not to mention dangerous. It is very well written, and the best thing I've read since I first met the Others north of the Wall over two years ago, shivering in the snow.<br /><br />Bravo, Mr. Sanderson. Bravo.<br /><br />9.5/10<br /><br />**EDIT: Upon re-reading \\"The Way of Kings\\" in preparation for \\"Words of Radiance,\\" I feel confident in its original score. I will keep a tally of the overall series here as it comes out, as well.**<br /><br />Book 1: The Way of Kings - 9.5/10<br />Book 2: Words of Radiance - 8.8/10, Excellent but unfulfilled due to pacing issues.

B007A2O3FO|4.0|great actors, interesting story exploring several issues of the time, definitely worth watching, nice dvd to watch while waiting for the next season of Downton Abbey
B00004SW9R|4.0|Considering this is 1968, and considering that I've waited a long time to find out why many people admire Dr. John's early stuff, I can see why this album is held in such high regard.<br /><br />This version of \\"I Walk On Guilded Splinters\\" is drastically creepier than the more guitar rock and jam-oriented Humble Pie version thanks to Dr. John's deep, almost buillfrog-like voice and lyrics that seem to make you think you've stepped in another world.  What exactly these lyrics are about I honestly couldn't tell you.  The background arrangements eventually put you into a hypnotic twilight zone if you let them.  \\"Crocker Courtboullion\\" is the best song here however.  A downbeat tribal-like rhythm sets the pace for what I consider a truly bizarre experience with harpsichord solos that disguise themselves as uplifting and \\"pretty\\", flutes solos played in the deepest, darkest part of the woods where the witches come out to play, and guitar playing that's equally as fitting... or make that it, fittingly out of place, haha!<br /><br />\\"Gris Gris Gumbo Ya Ya\\" is interesting for the way Dr. John introduces himself, and the fact he says the word \\"y'all\\" is memoralbe since I didn't realize that word existed in 1968.  The female vocals appear in all the right places.  Are those violins in the background?  If so, strange addition there.  \\"Danse Fambeaux\\" is unique for the way a mandolin carries an R&B style groove and the female vocals are appropriate and add to the spookiness of the song overall.<br /><br />\\"Danse Kalinda Ba Doom\\" is a surprisingly awesome song based around more tribal beats and vocals, however this one is more melodic and almost pop-like with wonderfully creative mandolin arrangements.  \\"Mama Roux\\" is a highly melodic almost soulful vocal melody but with a special touch of Dr. John's distinct style.  \\"Jump Sturdy\\" stands out for being almost uplifting and the vocals are super catchy.  No dark vibes in sightt on this one, but the vocal melody being so good makesup for that.<br /><br />Overall, I only take away one point because despite how cool this music sounds, it doesn't always translate into being listenable.  Still, it's awesome.  Dr. John has entered the building!
B00000JPH6|5.0|Totally has to be one of the most underappriciated ever!!! Loved it as a kid, still can watch it today, only wish they would come up with some stuff to celebrate the 30yrs aniversery.
B004EPZ08O|4.0|I never tire of the Final Destination series, AHHH!!!<br /><br />I really don't.  It's a winning formula to me.  Cheat death, think you've miraculously survived, only to find out later that you were SUPPOSED to die!  Your death was planned out ahead of time unbeknownst to you!  Everything happens for a reason!<br /><br />However let's be totally honest, this is the worst one in the series by far.  Wanna know why?  Well for one thing, by now we all realize that the lack of storytelling is because there's no actual way to improve upon the writing.  This is why all the lines delivered by the characters are short and sweet, and really generic and predictable- we've already HEARD this story four times already!  The movie writers didn't even bother to elaborate on the \\"been there, done that\\" aspect of the storyline.  That's why, for example, the teens pretty much figure out that they're supposed to die in the exact order that the one teen envisioned without any further elaboration!  The movie writers expect that you already KNOW this!  That's actually a dead giveaway (har har!) that it's time to stop the series altogether however...<br /><br />Me being me, and loving (and craving!) the apparent endless ways to graphically kill the teenagers who missed destiny's call, I can't help but sit through another one of these films and *enjoy* it.  Since I already fully understand the way the movie writers build the suspense, the best thing I can hope for is a build up to a graphic, violent and tragic death... which this movie executes just splendidly!  It's also obvious the movie writers are trying hard to make the deaths more violent by the way the blood and the body part-chopping is more plentiful than ever.<br /><br />So... I like the movie.  Sorry!<br /><br />This doesn't excuse the horribly bland, exaggerated, and terrible writing that is the airplane segment at the end though.  Take what's already been shown several times in other movies (that being, an airplane splitting inhalf and the people flying off and clinging onto the remaining parts for their lives) and make it to the point of total exaggeration so you're laughing at it instead of feeling fear.  No thanks!
B005IQZB14|5.0|I liked Cheryl's memoir on a number of levels.  First of all it was very well written and made for a wonderful read. I found the hike on the PCT fascinating  & her descriptions of her life both on & off the trail honest & compelling.
B000BDLJBU|5.0|I was positively surprised when I received this replacement plug. Neutrik quality is top notch. The tolerances as well as the quality control are definitely very tight. I would recommend this product to everyone.
0307949435|5.0|As a scientist, I appreciate the evidence presented within the book to support the authors argument as to why we get fat. I think the book is well-written and an easy read.
034580404X|5.0|When I purchased this set, it was backordered, but I only had to wait about two weeks. I prepaid when I bought it but at the time of the set being shipped, the price went down so I actually got a refund of the difference!! How often does that happen?? Just starting the third book but I must say, the first two books were awesome! This storyline will be hard to beat!!
B007D2XSW0|1.0|I was able to upload a photo the first time I used it and the app worked great, but ever since then I can't get it to open anything at all. It's a shame since this app seems to have everything I need, but I can't even use it.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|super fun! my bro and I loaded it up on my fire at 9:00 pm and played till 4 am! no bugs or anything!
B006N9KFPC|2.0|I think this was a disappointing album by Adam Lambert. I love his voice and yet the vocals do not showcase what he is capable of. Too much wandering in issues.<br />The arrangements are boring, ordinary and predictive. I will not lose faith though maybe next one Adam
B005RYF5JA|4.0|I am a huge Celtic Woman fan. My first experience was with A New Journey. I saw this on the PBS special and bought it when it hit Amazon. Sure, I wish there were more than just the three singers, and the costumes leave something to be desired, but who cares?? The music is AMAZING!!! Two of the songs I went back and heard over and over are Only a Woman and I Dreamed a Dream. If your a fan, then you probably already know, if not, rent it then buy it!!!
1451608659|4.0|I saw the author and her sister on a news magazine show and purchased the book and it kept my attention for the entire time on a flight from the East to West coast.  It highlighted a very ugly side of gymnastics that is probably prevalent in many sports, but the mental, physical and emotional abuse was absolutely overwhelming.  The author seems to have a good handle on all that happened to her while her father and some of her most famous (and infamous) coaches abused her and her mother stood by and did nothing.  Not sure I could be so forgiving. The book could have used a good editing but it seemed more like a stream of consciousness so it worked.  Congratulations to the author on all she has accomplished both professionally, and more importantly, personally.  The serious girl on the cover and the smiling woman within are like two different people, and it made my heart happy.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Ok, when this movie first came out I said to myself...ehhh I should go see it. But then I didn't...and didn't...and didn't. Now I am kicking myself in the head for that horrible misjudgement. THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME!!!!!!! I mean come on, with an all star cast it was either going to be great, or horrible. I read the blurb and was expecting horrible, but got the opposite. Action packed, fully funny with sexy Karl Urban as the \\"bad guy\\". Just thinking about it makes me want to watch it again...in fact I think I will!
1469984202|5.0|This book (apparently 5 separate novellas, though some are short) is a beautifully crafted tale. The characters are engaging and intelligent. The setting took me back to stories like Logan's Run. The writing style is very good, but it's still a quick read. The mysteries (there are several) seep out gradually.<br /><br />Overall, well worth the price. Entertaining and touching.
B0086700CM|5.0|It is so addicting and adventurist. It is sooo freaking fun. and all the bad reviews are by posers. that suck
B003O86FMW|2.0|Not to enthralled with this one.  While disgusting and sometimes graphic, some of the stuff that was thrown into the Games was actually laughable.  Also becoming tired of the main character's inability to connect.  Anyway, good enough to finish off the trilogy, but starting to feel like all three books could have been combined into one -- with less detail.  At least they are a fast read.
B007SGM084|5.0|I of course heard all the rave about the Shades trilogy, and I decided to form my own conclusion.  Once I started the the books I was unable to put it down, an now that I am finished I have thought about reading the trilogy again.
B0063IH60K|3.0|The game is a lot of fun and I especially like the Undo button.  The ads,  however,  are terribly annoying and really decrease the enjoyment of the game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is awesome!!!It has so many fun games. I like this game called Aquarium and it is fun. I reccamend this game.
030758836X|5.0|I could not put this book down. It was a page turner.  Highly recommend!<br />Great stories on a crazy marriage with rich characters.
B0088ETCHW|5.0|This book is very easy to understand, well written and on the cutting edge of swimming.  I have read many books on the subject of swimming and most try to get you to swim in one particular way.  This is the first book that I have seen that encourages you to swim in the fashion that works best for you depending on a few factors such as body type, the particular distance that you are doing, and whether you are swimming in a pool or open water.<br />I could not put it down and I think that it will be a best seller among swimmers, triathletes and their coaches. It is a must read!  But the best part was that I was able to get it instantly for $9.99 on my kindle instead of pre-ordering for $19.37.<br />One thing that should be edited is that on the kindle edition it is hard to read some of the captions on one or two pages.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I got tired of inching my way through Game of Thrones and I started reading the first book on a Friday night. I didn't put it down until I was done with all three. It's about 15K tiny pages on an iPhone but it reads so easily, I was done in 4 days.  Great rest for the brain.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|The PS3 Ear Force PX21 Gaming Headset is very durable and works great. I feel the item was fairly priced when comparing but this particular one had much better reviews so I chose this and very happy that I did!
0061689246|3.0|Young Tristran Thorn promises to retrieve a fallen star from the realm of Faerie to impress his true love.  He will learn that the star is more than he thought, and he is not the only one who seeks it.<br /><br />I am not the ideal reader for this book and I did not read it under the most ideal conditions.  I am not a particular fan of fairy tales.  Neil Gaiman writes very well, often beautifully, but the story feels like he fished for story elements in a grab bag of fairy tale tropes and strung them together in a narrative that feels very arbitrary and filled with coincidence.  In a world where virtually anything can happen, it can become hard to care about what happens.  To compound matters, I read the story in its E-book version.  Only later did I become aware that it had been published previously with reportedly gorgeous illustrations by Charles Vess.  I suspect that, had I read that version, I might have been more positive toward the story.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|The ideas and research in this book are very important and I think it's something everyone should read. However, as the book even illustrates, these aren't new ideas; there's just some new research to back it up.<br /><br />If you've ever heard saying like, \\"do something 50 times and it becomes a habit\\" you know what this book is about. As I said, there's new research on the subject and it's very interesting, but in my opinion the book tells you everything you need to know in the first two or three chapters. After that it's all examples. Now, some of these examples are well worth reading -- and they illustrate the author's point very nicely; however, after a while you're just reading the same thing over and over again.<br /><br />Oddly, I started to read The Thank You Economy after reading this, and I've found that book to be the same; it has some really important ideas to share, but reading the same thing (care about your customers and engage them on twitter and Facebook) starts to get old.<br /><br />I feel like my valuable time is being wasted in order to justify a book-length publication on both accounts. So far I'd suggest you get the book and read the first half.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|Got this with Prime. The Blu ray disc came quickly and looks fantastic on the 50\\" plasma. I really like how the sets are actually projected onto a screen instead of actual, physical sets. The part where the Phantom is playing the organ is really cool looking!
B001IYCMNA|1.0|Purchased this item for my small business as I was told that it would make the wireless set-up here a lot better.  Due to the previous set-up, installation of this device was a miserable experience.  The tech people where extremely helpful, but that is where the fun ends.  This device must be reset at least three to four times a day!  I really have not determined if any of the other 'features' of this device are any better than the previous wireless set up
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great for passing time and relaxing. don't mind the ads too much, just skip them! anyways, I like it a lot!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a great game for all ages....I love it and would highly recommend it!!!! A must have to keep you busy.
B0063IH60K|2.0|The software is apparently manipulating the odds/results when offline. When I have a web connection wins occur at usual 15 to 20%.  Get on an Airplane, or go to a park, and you'll be lucky to see 1% (adds don't work when offline).  Really unscrupulous.  Game is conditioning you to only play when on line, with adds.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Great book about life and death and a near death experience. Thought provoking and interesting. Great book club selection with questions after the end of the book.  I highly recommend.
B0088RQ4TI|4.0|I read a lot of poor reviews when it came out in the theaters, so I was a little skeptical about renting it. The think the critics were too harsh. The kids loved and it and I had a good time watching it. Lots of of fun. It had some slow parts but what movie dosen't. Rent it you won't be disappointed.
0345529057|5.0|Quality paperback books. Box is a little tight, it would be very difficult to put all books back once they are taken out. Also, It's easy to lose track of the order of the books. I read 3 chapters of the fourth book before I figured it out it wasn't the second book.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|When I had no roof, I made audacity my roof- Robert Pinsky<br />I never heard of the Pacific Crest Trail. Now after reading  wild by Cheryl Strayed I will never forget it. The Pacific Crest Trail is not a trail to take lightly. The weather conditions are harsh. Their aren't many other hikers on this trail, and there aren't any well developed lodges like the photos you might see in a  travel magazine. I believe the sort of circumstances where a hiker finds herself has something to do with how successfully or unsuccessfully the hiker will ascend and descend the trail. It's important to know about Cheryl Strayed's life before she walked the PCT. \\"...my hike on the Pacific Crest Trail hadn't begun when I made the snap decision to do it. It had begun before I even....\\" Before the hike she suffered through the illness of her mother. Then, watched her mother lose her battle to cancer. She also struggled through a bad marriage with Paul, her husband, which would lead to divorce. Last but not least she had been strung out on heroin with a man named Joe. Cheryl slept with different men looking for love as they say in all the wrong places. She also had a father to remember for all the wrong reasons.  This is her baggage when she starts her trek on the Pacific Crest Trail.<br /><br />She didn't choose an easy route to hike. The Appalachian Trail is easier to hike than the Pacific Crest Trail. The Pacific Crest Trail is out West: Oregon, California, Washington State,etc. The Appalachian is a trail through Georgia and up to Maine.  The author briefly compares and contrasts the two routes in her book. The Pacific Trail is cruel. It's like a man who beats up an old lady and takes her money. I thought it was fitting when Cheryl Strayed met the two or three men who seemed to want something more than a hike. Their intentions were anything but nice. After meeting those men Cheryl Strayed felt humiliated, frightened and a bit unclean just like she felt at different times on the PCT. The trail raped  her soul and heart before it ever gave anything back to her. In the end she received the gift of seeing her inner and outer self in a clearer and brighter light. I doubt if before the journey Cheryl Strayed knew exactly what her toenails looked like. She definitely didn't know what the toes looked like after the nails dropped off. The trail filters out the pond smudge like a water filter. Cheryl Strayed is the water. After the climb she would feel clean and clear like fresh spring water discovered in the mountains. No wonder she would be named The Queen of the PCT after ending her travels.  \\"There was the woman I was before my mom died and the one I was now, my old life sitting on the surface of me like a bruise.\\"<br /><br />Along the way the author meets a few other people walking at their pace through the trail. Some choose to walk through heavy snow and some choose to bypass such a hardship. The memoir is all about shifting, leaving behind and picking up what is most needed. It makes sense that her backpack is named Monster. Monster, to me, symbolized the burdens she carried in her heart. Those heart burdens, as I wrote, were monstrous and painful. Monster will help her learn about loneliness and being alone. \\"Alone had always felt like an actual place to me, so if it weren't a state of being, but rather a room where I could retreat to...\\"<br /><br />It is fitting that Cheryl Strayed is the only woman the men meet on the trail at that time. Her backpack is almost too heavy for the men to pick up. I think women carry heavier and bigger emotional baggage in the than men. I think we carry love on our shoulder. I am always aware if anyone tries to give me love or take it from me. Women will fight for love to never end. They don't give up quickly. The thought is that everything will be alright in time. Hope and love are a woman's battle gear.<br /><br />In conclusion it's a memoir not just about traveling a physical trail, but also it's about traveling life's emotional trail where anything can happen to tear apart our will to exist from day to day and chance never seeing  the light of another morning. Cheryl Strayed ends the memoir with gratefulness. \\"Thank you, I thought over and over again. Thank you. Not just for the long walk, but for everything I could feel finally gathered up...\\"<br />storify.com/OprahsBookClub/wild<br /><br />cherylstrayedife's emotional trail where anything can happen to tear apart our will to exist from day to day and chance never seeing  the light of another morning.

0439023491|5.0|After I finished the first story I had the second book ready to go on my kindle.  This book was by far my favorite out of the 3!  The story and all the twists just kept me hooked.  Definitely an awesome book to have in my library.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|I have been an ALW \\"phanatic\\" since junior high (many more years ago than I care to remember), and Phantom is one of my favorite musicals of Sir Andrew's; this is particularly true since it was the first ALW musical I had ever heard, thanks to my junior high art teacher who played it during class. Sierra Boggess is phenomenal in this production! I was highly skeptical of anyone other than Sarah Brightman being able to do the role of Christine justice, especially since it was written for Sarah's voice. Sierra Boggess does an admiral job, and I was surprisingly impressed and pleasantly surprised. If you are an ALW \\"phan\\" as I am, this is a must-have! Enjoy!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I heard of these books from my co-workers before the movie came out.  They all were so engrossed that I thought I had to see for myself.  Loved the book and was able to read it in just a few days.  Found myself reading it whenever I had a spare moment.  Great book and I was very eager to continue reading the rest of the trilogy.
0425263908|5.0|I felt this book was a lot like 50 shades. I had to check the dates of each book to see if someone was trying to re-write 50 shades. I enjoyed both books.
0439023513|4.0|Unfortunately this was my least favorite of the trilogy and hardest one for me to finish.  I felt like the book dragged and I just couldn't keep myself interested in it.  I still give the book high marks because she tied all the loose endings well making a wonderful series of books.  I also enjoyed them because my 9 year old son was reading them also.  It was nice getting to discuss the story line with him.

B000JMKTLO|5.0|Sharp Objects is a strong book that slowly descends deeper and deeper into hell and evil. The main character, Camille, is sympathetic, but certainly not without flaws. Only two minor characters in this story prove to be truly good. The book will take you on a dark and horrible carnival ride, but it is compelling and demands to be read.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is one of the worst books I have ever read. Waste of ten dollars. Don't waste your time or money on this book.

B002O5M4SA|4.0|I love the new (added footage) Leon. It fulfeels the true movie intent. I wish there was a follow-up to Leon like Matilda: The Protege. This movie would be the return of Matilda when she graduates from high school and begins her hidden life as a \\"cleaner\\" and her regular life as a Wall Street analyst? Just a thought Luc! Anyway watch the new Leon version, it's worth it!

B006XF5BTG|5.0|I am turning 50 this year and was concerned about doing squats and dead lifts . I followed the warm up routine and have had no problems. In week three I feel strong and have great energy! My workouts take no longer then 45 minutes with 30 minutes of cardio 3 times a week. Lost 15 lbs. and 1% body fat so far without losing strength. Went to a large family get together and got several compliments. Great book!
1475143389|5.0|A book that explains it all in a very easy to understand way. Nutrition according to cutting, bulking or maintenance goals, workloads, sets, reps, how/when to increase weight,rest, etc....  I wish I had this book in my hands years ago.<br /><br />I have been lifting weights for over 15 years trying to get \\"there\\", I have tried countless workouts, diets, people's advice, trainer's advice and I always ended up not getting \\"there\\", why?  Because I was doing it all wrong.  All the information out there, magazines, internet, blogs, etc. It's all confusing and contradicting.  Do yourself a favor and read this book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved the whole omnibus! I think if I had to read each installment as a stand alone book I would have gone nuts waiting for the follow-up and don't think I would have enjoyed it as much but, lucky for me, I got the package deal and loved the story. I especially liked the way the author developed a character and then introduced another character to become the major in the next segment...after he killed off the first. Awesome. Don't think I've ever read a series written in this style.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love it<br />its fun to play especially on a rainy day like today. although I think that the could make scratch a little bit easier to find in friends villages.
0765326353|5.0|How do you review a book like this?  It's overwhelming...  Let it suffice to say that IMHO, this is the pinnacle of epic fantasy!  The very best I've ever read. R. Jordan is awesome, G. Martin is amazing, P. Rothfuss, B. Weeks, both incredible.... Brandon Sanderson is KING!  Read this book!  Then join the throngs of us who check his blog constantly for updates to see of #2 is started yet!
0765356147|5.0|After the third book in the series, I'm glad to be done. Not because it was poor writing, but because I couldn't stop reading while I had any story left to discover, and so my apartment became a mess, my food choices became lazy, my sleep schedule suffered. I just had to see how it all ended. When I picked up the first book in the series from the library, I didn't know what I was getting myself into. But once I was done, I had to buy the second on my kindle instantly, and then the third - no hesitation at spending the money.<br /><br />The third book pulls everything together from the previous two, but leaves you guessing until the end. You see everything coming to a head near the end, but you still don't actually know what will happen (or why, or how) until the very end. But seeing how the hints dropped throughout the books end up playing out (differently than expected, sometimes), made for a very exciting read.<br /><br />Best of all, the characters stay true to their development, and you are left with a warm fuzzy feeling about many of the ones you come to love throughout the books.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|its a little challenging but it keeps ur interest worth the $5. was up all night playing it, had to stop because my kindle died.

B0081J9OWC|5.0|I love this CD.  It's my new soundtrack to summer. I highly recommend this CD to any Edward Sharpe fans.
1401235417|2.0|I'm a big Batman fan. However, Synder writes a terrible Batman. Since when does Batman ramble on for pages on end about philosophical nonsense about papers and architecture? He doesn't. He's cold and calculating like a machine with the occasional smirk or burst of rage. There's seriously so much dialogue in here it's almost as if he's getting paid by the word. That bugged me right off the bat. Then Greg Capullo's art start irking me in all sorts of ways. There's so many unnecessary scenes that do nothing but show off the Batcave and how cool it is like we didn't know that already. His facial expressions and anatomy is God awful as well. As others have noted, almost everyone looks like Bruce Wayne except for Gordon and Alfred. The only difference is some are more disproportional, like Lincoln looking like Mr. Incredible or Dick looking like Bruce five years ago. Now onto the story. I'm supposed to believe, that for all the things Gotham has gone through and everything Batman has done (taking down countless villains, natural disasters, OTHER secret societies that \\"really\\" control Gotham) there was really ANOTHER group controlling Gotham. How is this anything new and not almost a parody of Detective Comics in general? The whole owl analogy was incredibly boring from the start and the fact that several other titles got dragged into it just made me hate it even more. I honestly don't get how people are praising this as one of the best comics of all time. It's not the worst thing I've read and it could of been worse but to give it anything more than 3 stars is lunacy. There's plenty of great 52 series out and this is definitely not even in the top 10, check out Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Action Comics, etc if you want something new and fresh not this trite nonsense.
B003E8P9G0|4.0|I wish I was more aware of Egyptology or Egyptian mythology, I loved Greek and Roman mythology but for some reason I never expanded past that. The Red Pyramid takes on a very Percy Jackson feel. In fact Carter and Sadie have almost the exact same voice as Percy did the Riordans previous series. Once I got over the fact that the voices of this story and the chapter headings were taken from the familiarity that Riordan has developed with Percy I could get into this new tale. Not that Percy was forgotten in this book because there was a brief mention of the Greek Gods twice, but they were side notes and meant to amuse fans. I also noticed that The Red Pyramid is about twice the size of all of the Percy Jackson books, which was nice. We could have a great flushed out adventure but it felt like it could have ended sooner. There were parts of the book that were not as interesting and slowed the story down quite a bit. I think Riordan had a knack for spinning mythological tales and I really love the dept of the Egyptian mythos and this world was done beautiful. The characters are really well done and you're wondering right along with them who you can trust and who you can't, and there are some great twists and turns along the way. I think that middle grade children and older will LOVE this book, especially if they were fans of the Percy Jackson series. There is action, adventure, crushes, explosions, angry gods and plenty of sarcasm and humor. I think this one is well worth picking up.
B0086700CM|4.0|temple run is one of my favorite apps! it is super addictive and fun, but I give it 4 stars because its kind of glitchey for my kindle
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. The only thing I didn't care for was the constant repetition.  I never got bored with this book, it only took me three days to finish it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|What a total waste of time and money! I am amazed this book is a top seller. The author is clearly indulging in some of her more wicked fantasies and that's basically all there is to it. The characters fail to make any impression and the constant repetition of the same ideas again an again is really tiring. Please don't buy this book.
B0052VUNHC|3.0|i wonder what happened to good lovemaking for women.  seems like a clueless teenager wrote that part of the book. ick
B005IQZB14|5.0|This is a book that was chosen for my book club.  I thought it would be one of those typical \\"journey of a woman\\" books that are so popular with book clubs, but it is so much more.  It is the story of a young woman who basically falls apart after the death of her mother.  She has such a hard time keeping it together after this great loss, that she ends up losing her husband and her family too.  She decides to hike the Pacific Coast Trail, an extreme hiking trail 1100 miles long, although she is alone, ill-prepared and has never hiked before.  The journey in this book is both figurative and literal.  It is exciting, thought provoking, sad, scary and exhilarating.  Certainly not your typical \\"woman's book.\\"  I highly recommend it.  To my surprise, I couldn't put it down.
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|Rental. This was actually a good well thought out movie.  Enjoyed it quite a bit and did not get bored.  Fun stuff really!
034580404X|3.0|I tried really hard to get into these books and like them but just never could. Throughout Book 1 I kept thinking Ana is the stupedest woman alive for not running the other way. Books 1 & 2 could have been made into 1 book since the story really doesn't develope and go anywhere.  The sex scenes are alright but repeat each other only changing the locations.  In Book 3 the story line actually developes and the story takes off.  I actually did like book 3.  Ana and Christian have a very disturbing relationship.  He is extremely controlling and cruel and each time he tries to break away from his darkside Ana brings him back to it.  He states he will try to change but his promises don't mean much.  Ana can never stand her ground for long and gives in and actually talks Christian into doing things he is trying hard to avoid because she wants him to be happy, but she never seems to get it that he is trying to change.  Their relationship is very disturbing.  Not a series I enjoyed, book 3 had alot more content and storyline.  I wish all 3 books were more like book 3.
B008645YH6|5.0|When listening to this exquisite album, I can't help but feel that I'm watching a \\"bubblegum, psychodrama\\" of an angst-y teenage girl desperate for love, social acceptance, and desire. It's vulnerable but really, really gorgeous. This album is audio cinema! Allow me to share my thoughts on how each track plays in my mind...<br /><br />\\"Bubblegum B*tch\\" sounds like an opening track to a teen movie revolved around angst, drugs, and sex.<br /><br />\\"Primadonna\\" introduces Electra Heart. I can imagine a confident and naïve young girl in her sophomore year of high school, convinced of her own self-obsession but her vulnerability, however, is quite obvious.<br /><br />\\"Lies\\" sounds like first love DRAMA. Haven't we had one of these in our teenage years? Puppy love gone WRONG.<br /><br />In \\"Homewrecker\\", Electra is jaded, and just downright ruthless.  Talk about re-bounding every boy that comes her way... hopefully, it wasn't the whole football team.<br /><br />\\"Starring Role\\" sounds like a drama club number. I can imagine Electra belting this heart-wrenching tune in her school cafeteria as her peers and admirers pity the crap out of her.<br /><br />\\"The State of Dreaming\\" is the where Electra begins to feel sorry for herself. I imagine her locked in her bedroom, ex-boyfriends photo in hand. Her confidence through \\"Primadonna\\" has faded from the heartbreak. She now finds herself trying to differentiate what's real and what's not. She pines love and desire and from anyone at this point.<br /><br />\\"Power & Control\\" is a song I can relate to. I've been hurt many times, and after hurt comes a little something called ANGER. Electra is out for revenge. She probably made copies of her boyfriend in the nude and passed them out in between classes to her schoolmates. Love it.<br /><br />In \\"Sex Yeah\\", it's clear as day that Electra is \\"growing up\\" - a minor, but important step in her teenage life. Womanhood was never more prominent in this audio cinema.<br /><br />\\"Teen Idle\\" istotally that moment when we realize how foolish we've acted after acting out and causing unnecessary drama. Electra sounds embarrassed, and has yet again, wallowed into her deep and dark sadness. Now this is pure angst.<br /><br />\\"Valley of the Dolls\\" is the aftermath of \\"Teen Idle\\" where Electra seems to explore the depths of her sadness... but coincidentally sounds like the first step to emotional recovery. The song almost comes off as \\"hopeful\\".<br /><br />\\"Hypocrates\\" is Electra Hearts revival. She opens the shades of her bedroom to let the sun in. The birds are finally singing. Electra no longer blames herself, and points her finger at her ex-boyfriend. The \\"Primadonna\\" has risen from the dead. I can imagine in her car, driving to school, with the windows down as her hair moves with the wind. My favorite song of the album.<br /><br />A playful Electra in \\"How to Be a Heartbreaker\\" gives us a lesson in love and how to be the one in charge. Talk about an experienced young lady...<br /><br />Electra has found a new high school crush and \\"Radioactive\\" is the epitome of such the joy! The girl is practically spinning and twirling in this song.<br /><br />\\"Fear and Loathing\\" is an important song and is a phenomenal way of ending this so called faux tragedy. This is a more realized Electra. She comes to terms with herself and understands that the world isn't out to get her. Her worst enemy was herself. No more FEAR and LOATHING for this girl...<br /><br />And that, my friends, is what I call a damn well organized album. The story of \\"Electra Heart\\" isn't new, but it is so darn relatable. I couldn't help but feel that I was once Electra. The best album of 2012... I swear it on my \\"heart\\".
B0079XPUOW|4.0|The book is written well enough to engage the Trek fans as well as other readers. The characters are enjoyable and the pace is fast. The price for the Kindle edition is the only real negative here. The book is not long enough to justify that kind of a charge. Wait for the bargain bin discount before you get this one.
B007Y5IAV0|5.0|I really liked this album and would definitely recommend it.<br /><br />I wish they had released it on vinyl as well (like the previous albums). Why not this time?
0345522478|5.0|Many people have compared this series to the Dresden series by Jim Butcher, and with that soley in mind did I purchase the first couple books of this series.  I am so thoroughly enthralled!  Atticus is very likeable, interesting and sympathetic narrator, and I can't help but wanting to meet Oberon in person, and hope that he would like me as well.  The plot is quick, banter witty, some very nice vocabulary thrown in there, and I keep wondering what the characters are up to when my book is closed.  I still love the Dresden series and will continue to read them, but I think Atticus O'Sullivan can sit right on the shelf next to him and hold his own.  I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys not only fantasy, but a good, solid, well-paced story.  Well done, Mr. Hearne!
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I ordered this box set for my granddaughter for her 16th birthday.  She lives in Louisiana, I live in Alabama and we were flying to meet in a small resort town in Idaho the next day.  She is a Beatles fan (go figure) and I was trying to decide between having her download it digitally or getting the boxed set.  Well, I made the right decision for two reasons - 1) this sounds great, there's lots of extras that she has enjoyed, and she doesn't have to worry about iTunes when her computer eventually gets upgraded and 2) I ordered it one day (after lunch) and it arrived in Idaho the next afternoon in time for the bd party.  Thanks Amazon Prime - next day shipping cost me 3.99 - that's a bargain! And did I say it sounds great...we had a Beatles \\"reunion\\" listening (and singing) their songs as we drove to Glacier National Park. She wouldn't check it in her bag for the return trip to Louisiana - somehow got it (and other stuff) into her backpack to take on the plane as a carry-on.
B004XISI4A|2.0|I'm a huge fan of ASOIAF (and the HBO series), to the extent that I've had to buy multiple copies of the earlier books because I've worn them out from re-reading. Luckily (I think!) for me, I picked up the series between ASOS and AFFC, so I haven't been left with *as* unbearable a wait as some others.<br /><br />With ADWD, many of the problems that spawned out of splitting the planned fourth book into AFFC and ADWD (some of which were already present in the last book) have become hard to ignore and detract greatly from the overall reading experience. Not every novel needs to have the breathless pace and constant action of A Storm of Swords, but both AFFC and - especially - ADWD suffer from a languid pace that leaves you wondering \\"when is something going to happen?\\" more than \\"what will happen next?\\".<br /><br />It was nice to see some of the characters left out of AFFC again, although I can't say I was all that pleased with what we did get. Tyrion's travelogue through Essos could have been interesting had it (1) not been so drawn out and (2) not felt quite so contrived with running into a certain character in Volantis to continue his story. It's nice to get some world-building (unlike many people I see post, I'm actually very interested in knowing more about Essos), but it just doesn't work when you spread Tyrion's journey across an entire, huge, book to do so (especially compard to the more reasonable way travel was dealt with in, say, AGOT, when Catelyn can get around Westeros without needing the entire book to do so).<br /><br />Dany reappears but, well, her character and storyline are both rather stagnant until her last couple of chapters where...well...it's not that significant things happen so much as it seems like they're *about* to happen. Small victories, I guess. Theon returns (he lives!), and probably is the most compelling PoV character in the book. He's not really on a redemption arc, but his psychological sufferings are quite vivid and the goings-on in the North are probably the book's strong point on top of it. I wish I could say the same for the Wall, but while it was good to see Jon suffer some consequences for his decisions, many of his chapters felt rather repetitive (someone comes in to tell him some advice, Jon ignores it, Jon deals with wildlings, repeat). Brienne, though figuring significantly in AFFC, is present but her appearance feels extremely tacked on and without any real purpose other than to set up a cliffhanger.<br /><br />What else? Well, there's the multiple cliffhangers that, while dramatic at first, are now tiresome (Brienne returns from one cliffhanger to exit in another, ugh), the excessive description of traveling, food, urination, sex, etc. that - while providing a lot of detail of the world the story takes place in, does little to actually move the story forward. Repetitive phrases (where do whores go?, etc.) are introduced, descriptions we've heard ten thousand times are back (did any of you know the Sand Snakes are deadly? that they might hide poison or knives in their clothes?), and the book as a whole feels more like it's about putting people in place than anything else. As an aside, it's fitting Areo Hotah appears as a PoV character again in ADWD because he's the same; just there so we can see Doran but offering basically nothing aside from it.<br /><br />Now, if you've actually read some/most/all of this mini-rant, you may be wondering what I liked about the book. Frankly, I'm feeling a bit tired of my own ponderous writing at this point, so I'll use bullets.<br /><br />(1) Theon, Davos, the political situation in the North in general<br />(2) Aegon Targaryen(?), though I admit he should have been introduced earlier probably and I also liked his chapters because they provided much needed action.<br />(3) Wyman Manderly<br />(4) The Melisandre PoV was a good example of how to give a PoV to a character to flesh them out and not simply to relay plot details (plus Melisandre's role is interesting)<br /><br />Despite my complaints above, I feel like we've finally trudged through AFFC and ADWD and the series is in a position where a sense of 'normalcy' can return - the characters in Essos are all more or less positioned where they need to be to meet Dany, in particular. I just wish the journey to get there had been more engaging and worthwhile.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The Hunger Games Series was a very interesting series.  The last book Mockingjay was not the ending that I expected.  It was filled with many twists and turns through Katniss and Peeta's lives as well as their mental stability.  I think this book speaks volumes to how an individual returning from war is suffering from PTSD and are trying so hard to hold onto the person that they once were.  I was a little disappointed with Gale's response and attitude toward Katniss in the whole book, but his response to Prim's tragedy was what threw me the most.  I did find that I would have to reread parts of this book to figure out what was going on, but then realized it was because we were in one of the characters minds.  I would recommend this book and the series if you are looking for a great read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the whole family loves this game.  from the my 8year old to gra dma.  there is a game for everyone.

B005LAII1C|3.0|What do you do if you are a successful TV show writer who wants to make a Movie but doesn't have the brass to do what the Simpsons folks did and do It blatantly?  Simple make your main character a Teddy Bear, turn his kids into his slacker friend and his wife into his friend's long suffering girlfriend and Presto, you have Ted.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg is John Bennett whose teddy bear Peter (sorry Ted) comes to life after a Christmas Wish that is almost as powerful as an Apache Helicopter.  Unfortunately for John his parents apparently had no idea how to raise either him or the teddy bear and both become pot smoking slacker losers in Boston.<br /><br />At first glance the idea that John has a smoking hot successful girlfriend, Mika Kunis makes no sense until you realize that every single other male Character in the movie and frankly almost all the female ones are even more dysfunctional or downright sick compared to him.  In the population of this movie Mark Wahlberg's character IS the pick of the litter.<br /><br />It's pretty much a standard slacker movie, boy promises to do better, girl gives him second chance, boy screws up royally, girl leave him and is perused by evil rich guy, Boy does romantic thing to win girl back and after an action scene on Fenway's Green Monster ends in tragedy boy gets girl.<br /><br />Every thing else is filler, Peter oops Ted is simply a foul mouthed idiot whose antics would not rate laugh without the fur.  Family guy style jokes abound from the flashbacks to the pop culture references.<br /><br />The movie does have moments.  I laughed out loud at Sam Jones scenes, the funniest of the picture, camp in its purest form.  Norah Jones is amusing in a small role and Patrick Stewart makes you laugh as the narrator.<br /><br />Wahlberg and Kunis don't do BAD with the material they have, I actually think they do the best they could with it, its just the material is nothing special.  As for Peter oops Ted, it depends on what you came in expecting.  Those expecting to be outraged won't be because they've seen it all before on the Tube and those expecting to be laughing will if they think about it wonder why they paid money for a live action Family guy movie.<br /><br />However I suspect the slacker, video game, I'm cool because I watch John Stewart, audiences will love it never realizing that the joke is on them.<br /><br />Me, I'd wait for Netflix.
0805095535|4.0|Winter Journal is indeed a journal - a somewhat limited scope style of memoir, however its appeal is anything but limited in scope.  It is a not a full-blown memoir, because it is a somewhat generalized stock-taking from the point of view of a mid-sixties-ish Jewish man living in Brooklyn (Mr. Auster): a review of salient themes from the past, undertaken with a view to the future - and weighs in at a relatively slim 230 pages.  The scope is Mr. Auster's entire life: from his earliest memories to the moment he removes the nib of his fountain pen from the paper he writes on, with a sometimes staccato and unpredictable selection of moments in between.<br /><br />There are three sections which serve as themes that I discern, roughly: the body; places; relationships.  Each one, while providing part of a united whole, stands somewhat independently, taking the reader on a ride that can be on the surface (I dare not say 'superficial' which none of them are) perhaps consisting lists of favorite childhood candies, uses for one's hands, which on their face might be superficial, but are extremely evocative; or deep, very deep, to the essence of that most basic of questions: who am I; what made me; how do I measure up, whether as a driver, a man, a human being.  The detail with which the reader is drawn along is incredible, and is assembled like a Swiss watch: note, for example, that there is virtually no description of a woman who figures in the chronology over a long period, whether of physical attributes or personality (wife #1), but we are given a strong sense of wife #2 who endures.<br /><br />The story that is told is so true, so real, that any reader who has reached middle age cannot fail to be moved by it.  And it is absolutely provocative, in the sense that it provides a framework of sorts, for the kinds of thoughts and reminiscences that middle-aged people have.  It can take your breath away.  Really.<br /><br />Winter Journal is one of those rare books that you reallylook forward to sitting down and reading; I finished it in a few days, during my rare free time.  But in between, I thought about it, which reinforced my desire to get back to reading it.  If I had the time, I could have read it through in one sitting.<br /><br />I really give the book four and three-quarter stars,  would have given it five, but my reading reverie was diluted in two places, most especially in the nearly ten page recounting of the plot of the 1950 film D.O.A., with which I confess I became slightly bored, and towards the end with the lengthy discussion of the Minnesota branch of his family (in-laws), both of which do inspire the reader and the second of which helps wind down the book, but which have more significance and import to Mr. Auster and his family.<br /><br />Thank you, Mr. Auster.

[...]    My greatest fear is that Fantagraphics Books won't complete the series (2 Volumns per year x 15 years is a long time) [...]/  Apparently, they did the same thing with Peanuts and it also took about 15 years to complete the series so as one other reviewer put it, \\"they are in it for the long haul.\\"    My dad had a pile of these original comics by \\"The Good Duck Artist\\" sitting around in his basement.  They were so \\"well-loved\\" by me and my siblings that they are no longer in anything close to mint condition, which is a shame, but at least they were enjoyed thoroughly.    Barks really knows how to transport the reader into far flung scenes and tickle your sense of adventure.  I really get it when people like Lucas & Speilburg claim Barks' Uncle Scrooge work as inspiration for some of their best work, IE the boulder chasing Indy out of the Tomb in the opening scenes of Raiders etc.
