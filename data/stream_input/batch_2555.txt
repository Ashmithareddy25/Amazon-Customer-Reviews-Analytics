B007TUAHVQ|5.0|This was really a great purchase. The price was definitely worth the number of pieces that came with it. My son had a blast putting it together.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Perfect selection for that person who polkas to the beat of the drummer! I always told my students to learn everything they could, because they don't know what they don't know. I came upon this product while looking for interesting things to read, and Tesla has always intrigued me.
B00563M11M|5.0|Yet another masterpiece by Pratchett. Very engaging and worth investing your time and money. Follow the exploits of Sir Samuel on his holiday to the country side.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I always thought this was going to be just a cheesey scarey show. There was so much more. I enjoyed the story and how it developed over the season. Now I want to see season two although I hear it is a totally different story each season.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I Love it! It is very efficient and works great! It does what is needed and the fact that the percentage can be displayed in the Notification bar. I Love It! Great App!!
B00992CF6W|4.0|its June and 0.7.0 is out but not on the kindle fire yet? REALLY MOJANG? I don't under stand it
3527406018|4.0|The book was in very good state.<br />The only thing I dislike is that I had to pay another amount of money (10$) at the moment of the delivery, as transport taxes.
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|Being an older person, I'm a sucker for the stories where older individuals reveal their prowess and skills.  And the cast is great!  This is a great movie-- highly recommend it!
0375714669|5.0|This book should get 10 stars. I loaned it to a professor who teaches middle eastern politics, she promptly gave it to her next semesters class as an assignment. This book is a life changer. Brava Satrapi!
193700788X|2.0|Considering that I've been following these books for years I'm very disappointed.... But it's been coming for the last few books. Not happy at all.
037571457X|5.0|One of the best reads in a very long time. It's an easy and quick read that I was could go on forever.
B0093QHW7G|5.0|Spotlight on a life well lived.....my favorite Beatle inspired me.  Never before seen views of the real George. Appealing on many levels. Love is all you need.
1408842432|5.0|Tragic, heartbreaking, compelling, beautifully written. Khaled Hosseini is a master story-teller who never disappoints. I thoroughly enjoyed every word of this book, following the lives of the many characters, but most of all I was touched by the poignant and unusual love story of Suleiman Wahdati.
B00BQHA06A|5.0|If you judge this album by your fist listen, then you are missing out. It took at least 2 listens for me to begin to like what I was hearing. Now, I can hear a mix of every album HIM has ever created. The songs are melodic and full of passion. Both dark and light. This is one of HIM's best albums to date!
B0085YOD1A|1.0|Dev says there are no ads. So why does a *paid for* battery monitor app need full internet access? Convince of the necessity, Dev, and I'll up the rating AND actually install the app.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Very entertaining movie and Jude Law is fantastic. I always enjoy psychological thrillers, but this movie begins to project it's ending quite early. It's like they felt the need to explicitly lay out the twist, then just ram it in your face once it occurs. Still, it's worth the watch.
0345529057|5.0|Already in film, there is nothing better than reading the books to create the mental picture, maybe not as quick as the film, it is equally addictive and impossible to put down until you reach the end of the next chapter. Intelligently written and an adventure you feel is part of history.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|One of the few games that claim to be free and actually is! Very challenging fascinating. Can't wait for more!
B003DZX3SA|5.0|The film is one of Disney's best. It is a film that is enjoyable for the whole family.  The music is great.
B00CXN2JNS|2.0|Where do we start with this? Well, first of all I will let you know that I have been listening to this band since the beginning. I remember my older brothers playing some old Metallica demos with Dave Mustaine on them and getting Killing Is My Business for Christmas from one of them when it came out, so I'm not new to this band. Admittedly, I kind of lost interest after Youthanasia made the rounds, but got interested again with Thirteen. Thirteen was a decent album in my opinion. Not bad for a band that has been around so long, and seemingly trying to get back to the trademark Megadeth sound. So when I heard about Super Collider I thought we may be onto something. As I listened to this album in my car I kept thinking two things. Dave Mustaine's voice is so hammered on now that even a recording studio can't make it sound good, and this is a butt rock version of Megadeth. Where I am conflicted on this album is that I actually think some of the songs are okay, but not for Megadeth. When I put on one of their albums I expect something different than this. So to summarize my impressions, this album has some almost classic sounding Megadeth moments, some butt rock Megadeth moments, a very shaky Mustaine voice, flat out bad lyrics, and some songs that sound influenced by country western music. Maybe I'm being too critical? It is possible, so I put the disc in today when my wife and I were driving, and didn't say a word. The first thing she said was \\"This sounds like a s***ty version of someone trying to sound like Dave Mustaine\\". I said, \\"This is Dave Mustaine\\", and she said \\"What? This is terrible! If Megadeth could have heard what they sounded like now when Peace Sells came out, they would have killed themselves back then\\". She is right. Amazingly, she also said, if this was not a Megadeth album I wouldn't hate it as much, but for them it totally sucks! I have to agree.  Although a couple of songs are catchy, this album is pretty bad, especially when they have had such high points. It is definitely a low point for Megadeth, and I'm bummed that they didn't call it off after Thirteen. That would have been a decent way for them to go out. If they don't put out something spectacular it will be a real downer to end on this release.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game so much! I just can't wait till the update because there will be spawning eggs. It is so totally worth the money.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Easy to use.good graphics..even my grandparents can access this application.<br /><br />It was free.<br />I love it.they have a way of making even bad weather  seem temporary.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fast, tricky, and fun.  This is an exciting version of temple run. I highly recommended this game and the price is right...
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|I always thought Kaleb's story had to be the end of the psy series, but Ms. Singh continues to exceed expectations. I loved this book & look forward to future stories from this world.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Without dropping spoilers, a decent story about a guy who goes above and beyond to seek truth and justice, and send the guilty to their judgment...but it just wasn't up to true Cruise style. Should be a $1 less to rent than his \\"regular\\" movies to balance out the return on rental investment.<br /><br />*edit* oh wait...I got an email for $1 credit towards purchase of an MP3. Well, that is *almost* a $1 off, eh? Still rather have the $1 off the video.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Tons of fun! Similar to but different from other temple run games. Alice in Wonderland temple run would be awesome!!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|oh my gosh i wasn't expecting this...just like Day to make me feel all types of things...i hope you enjoy it and feel as angry yet happy about the ending as I did.
B005HJU7HA|4.0|I have a paper copy of this and it's a bit unwieldy but its good to have on Kindle in a compact form.  I had no trouble navigating the book to find individual stories. The only thing that my paper copy had was cultural footnotes which sometimes were very helpful with Sherlock Holmes stories since there are archaic terms that were understood in turn of the 19th century London that don't make sense anymore and aren't found in the Kindle look-up feature.  But you could easily google the terms and figure it out. I'm glad I got this.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|My daughter read this and said it was a great read.  She cannot wait for the 7th book to come out.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is an awesome app.  I read it every day for my devotions.  I like that I can easily find the chaper and verse I am looking for.  Great addition to my Kindle.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I am forever looking for a calculator. I ran across this free app .  Very user friendly.I carry my kindle everywhere and this app is great.
B003AVPV1O|5.0|We ordered these splitters to split the cable coming out of my monitor into our TV<br />but when everything was hooked up the picture on monitor was distorted.<br />I put the blame on myseft but your product is fine I just don't think it was meant for what i wanted to use it for.
B004SDEP38|5.0|This is a useful tool. I am  able to view word documents and also edit them. I like this because I don't always have to break out the laptop.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|it is great and i am sure much faster. i have not tried the one that came with i that you hook to computer<br />this one is great love it
B00992CF6W|5.0|Igot this app because my friends thought it was cool, so I got it to. LOVE IT!!! Its worth the money you pay!
B009CF3MEK|4.0|It as great seeing Robert Redford and Mia Farrow on screen together, the movie was well done.  It should be an interesting comparison of old to new.
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|The true story behind &#34;The Impossible&#34; is harrowing to watch.  A family on vacation is swept away by the Indian Ocean tsunami that struck on the day after Christmas in 2004.  Naomi Watts portrays a mother severely injured and separated from her husband and younger sons, with no way to know whether they survived the tsunami or not.  Tom Holland portrays her oldest son, with whom she is reunited early on.  Both actors were nominated for Academy Awards.  Both performances deserve that recognition.  Rounding out the cast are Ewan McGregor as the father in the family, Samuel Joslin, and Oaklee Pendergast as the two younger sons.  Ultimately, harrowing as it is, this is an uplifting film.  The emphasis is not on special effects recreating the disaster, but on the emotional story of the family.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I love this show! The wit and humor is so funny....the characters are like a few people I know and love!
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|After reading this you will get up and do something with your life! Very well written, entertaining, and overall a great book.  Thanks James!
B003L77G6A|5.0|The writters are so witty and the characters incredibly tallented. I love to watch Penny and Sheldon interacting, especially at her door!

B001FB4VXU|5.0|Penny plays off of all of the guys so well! I love to see her with Raj...his expressions are priceless! She handles Howard so well, Leonard will always be her man and Sheldon....is Sheldon!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Steig Larrson's tales make you want to read more of his tales of Lisabeth Salander in her<br />memorable fight against sinister government forces. I was gripped tight throughout the tale and loved the wrap up sequences.
B001GXYBY6|5.0|Good &#34;clean&#34; video which the grandbaby loved; watched it 3 times in a row the first day!!  Price was great and with &#34;prime&#34; easy to access, thanks.
B008FRFN7A|2.0|had trouble upgrading because I kept getting a message that the page was temporarily not available.  They could make it more convenient toupgrade
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Nice graphics.  For us geezers the icon is easier to read than the tiny one in the corner of the kindle page.  Well done!
B008KNUKVI|5.0|Great album from some amazingly talented musicians. The only problem is that there aren't more songs to satisfy my new-found Pentatonix addiction!
B0091REZMW|3.0|I like the challenges this game has.  The story line is also very interesting. However I feel like there are too many crazy challenges at once. You also need friends for some challenges and diamonds r needed all the time. There are not many ways to earn them forcing u to use real money. If you don't mind just playing for about 30 minutes at a time you can get far and play the game forever. Hopefully updates will occur that fix some of these things.
0307730700|5.0|Eric Blehm wrote a book about a hero.  Others could and have done the same thing, however; this book goes so much further....it is told in a beautiful, hard-to-put down style.....I laughed, cried, chuckled, and was totally amazed at the warrior Adam Brown became.  I know Adam's wife personally so that may be why I feel the way I do about this book.  I feel somewhat cheated that I never got to meet Adam.  But, Eric Blehm has given me an insight into who Adam was and is responsible for bringing this story of Adam, with all his &#34;warts&#34;, to the very grateful citizens of the U. S.  Thanks, Eric!
B002ZG99QS|2.0|This copy switches aspect ratios back and forth several times.  This is distracting.  This must ust be a commercial version.

B000XUBC5E|5.0|Harlan Conan is one of my favorite authors. This book was by far no disappointment, as were all of his other books. Simply,a page turner !!!
B002W7H3EA|5.0|Excellent movie with a young and handsome Cary Grant and a young and beautiful Eva Marie Saint.  Suspense, action, scenery and a little romance.  Who could ask for anything more?  Highly recommended
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|My youngster put it on our Kindle and he really loves it.  I have not played it yet.  Hes happy with it so his recommendation is &#34;I love it&#34;!
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|So, you have great actors and  a great premise- what can go wrong?<br /><br />Apparently many movies are like this, and yes, things can and do go wrong.<br /><br />Some movies are totally ruined, and in the case of this movie, while not totally ruined, it is just a shadow of what it could have been.<br /><br />With more effort involved in the way the storyline unfolds, making an airtight plot and throwing in more character development, this could have been a very interesting, edgy thriller and a movie with far better reviews.<br /><br /> Instead you watch notable actors play their parts and then, as the credits roll in the end, you can't help but think\\" This had the ability to be a great movie- what a shame.'<br /><br />I hate giving away plots and this is hard to give details on without somehow spoiling the movie.<br /><br />All I will say is not everything is what it seems and that is probably the one thing that makes this movie watchable- you are left right up until the end, hanging in the balance, unsure of what will  happen next.<br /><br />Plot loopholes and unanswered questions in general, that will occur to most viewers, will be noticeable for sure by those who like to analyze a movie and  think about what parts did and did not make sense.<br /><br />But as I said, the over all premise of *nothing is quite what it seems* and the twists and turns the movie offers as it unfolds, is the movie's saving grace.<br /><br />It is what holds this movie together and makes it watchable.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|So glad that I am not alone in feeling disappointed about this book.  I loved the first book and couldn't find any fault with it.  I found the second book continued the story nicely and kinda wish she would've ended it there.  The 3rd book I found to be lacking and just stretching the story out with cliffhangers and no real ending just to keep readers and make money.  I love Eva so much and just got tired of her and Gideon during this one.  There is only so much \\"angst\\" I can handle.  Won't be coming back to this series anytime soon.
B004PZ4HC8|2.0|If you're a fan of the genre, as I am, you'll probably have to read this. Afterwards you may find yourself wondering why.<br /><br />Max Brooks does not do dialogue well. His ear is, to be blunt, tin. And since the format is a collection of Q&A interviews strung together, you'll very soon find that everybody sounds the same. This is a drastic shortcoming, since we need the human dimension to bring this story to life - all bad jokes aside. But not only does every segment have a clumsy sameness, each one gets cut off before we can get interested in the speaker. We're left with a long line of anecdotes that may remind you of a bad mimic trying to do impressions.<br /><br />Brooks, or somebody, did a lot of research for this. Unfortunately, it's almost all in the form of military and ordnance jargon. This is what the world would sound like if everyone was a dullish draftee in love with acronyms. A little of this goes a long way, and well before the end you may find yourself craving a conscientious objector or two just to break things up.<br /><br />There are some strange lapses. Different characters use identical expressions. The same baffling grammatical flubs are repeated over and over. It almost seems as if the researcher and the writer are two different people. And I found the central conceit, that slow, stumbling hordes of the undead would overwhelm professional armies commanding billions of bucks worth of military hardware, to be simply unbelievable.<br /><br />To be fair, the zombie sequences are engrossing, at least at first. But you can only throw so much flesh-eating gore against the wall before it all starts to slide off.<br /><br />Personally, I'm waiting for somebody to make a halfway believable case for the physiology behind the zombie phenomenon. That isn't this book. Eventually the whole thing collapses like a million corpses. It's not terrible, and I'll probably read it again, but in the hands of a better writer it could have been so much more.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I've had absolutely no trouble with this game, just can't stop playing it! I ran through almost all the levels on the free version only to learn I could earn crowns if I completed each category within each level. I was delighted!!! And it looks like they may have added another set or two. So, here I go with these new ones. I hope you enjoy the challenge as much as I have !!!  : )
B0097HSS4M|3.0|this app is okay but didnt offer alot to do with a picture....i like imikimi or the other apps with all the frames and different effects....
B004I1AGTC|5.0|very good movie must see if your a maritial artist . donny yen was a fantastic ip man cant wait for next one
B0066WJLU6|1.0|for kids or the easily amused....wasnt impressed.....just thought i would try it out , but didnt find it too amusing...
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I got this as the free app of the day but would willingly pay for it. My 3yo loves it and I love it. So easy and simple yet addictive and fun. Best part is hearing him cackle as he plays :) Fun to play together!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|love this app and playing it online with friends and even with ppl i dont know.....love it.....find it amusing and addicting......love it.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|So, look, say what you will about Tom Cruise the person... Tom Cruise is a fantastic actor!  I can't help but love him in every movie I see him in.  Jerry Maguire, Risky Business, Top Gun, and now Jack Reacher.  He just nails it every time.  This was a really good action movie plot, Tom was fabulous, I didn't expect to love it - I loved it!  Rent it, buy it, you won't be sorry.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|I couldnt even get this app to work on my kindle after playing with it for hours i finally just gave up.....dont recommend.
B0058SNI58|5.0|I bought these shoes because I need to dress up for work. The problem was, my dress shoes were getting really uncomfortable the further along I got in my pregnancy so I bought these. They were really comfortable and super cute.

B00D6BQPMM|4.0|The trailer makes you think this is going to be a zombie apocalypse movie.  Well it is, but it is actually a love story.  If anything, the zombie angle is just a metaphor.  We are all zombies and lonely because of technology.
B00AEJM6H2|1.0|There are way other better games out there than this one, not very entertaining at all....dont recommend unless you want to be bored.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Very good, family friendly movie with a great twist at the end.  I really like the existential question it leaves the viewer at the end.  Must watch!
B00479SVBU|4.0|sounds great but when its on really loud you can hear feedback.....but sounds awesome for the price i had to pay....
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I use this to play many games that require lots of skill buttons, so i found the side buttons to be very useful. Also the two programmable profiles are very useful, because i can use one for gaming and the other for just browsing the internet. And the customization for the lights is useful to differentiate the two profiles. Getting the drivers for this mouse from Anker's website is highly recommended to use the full potential of this mouse.
B004GYY714|5.0|love this app....love the music....recommend it to anyone whose really into music of all genres, you will definitely love it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|PLEASE UPDATE TO 0.7.1!!!! EVERYONE ON APPLE PRODUCTS HAVE THE UPDATE EXCEPT ANDROID DO PLEASE UPDATE ASAP UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE RIGHT NOW PLEASE I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR.THE UPDATE SINCE FOREVER.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great app. super fun. Totally entertaining to any age at all. I love all the cool features. I think it's great but I would never give any thing five stars.
078322933X|5.0|besided having mark wahlberg and reese witherspoon in it , loved the action and the storyline....great movie, recommend it highly.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|At first glance, I thought this was just another childish game based on flashy graphics, but once I delved in, I found a deep and intriguing puzzle game AND great graphics.
B004UNX1LS|1.0|i didnt like this at all....couldnt really use it the way i would youtube......i would recommend youtube to anyone who wants to watch music videos.....
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's the best game on my kindle fire HD 7''  LGT tablet. I heard the new update will have enderman and redstone  and unlimited worlds.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I was looking for a Good calculator but all I saw were complicated.this one is very clear and fast. This app is the best.

B005K17RU0|4.0|this app is wonderful and gives you accurate weather found myself liking it more than the others i tried to use.
0670026638|4.0|I almost despaired when I began the book and saw that it was a first-person narrative. What gives with all the first-person novels lately? I find them tedious to read, being restricted to one person's perspective and thoughts. However, the  first person segments of this book were balanced by third person sections. The writing was insightful, the characters multi-dimensional and the plot had enough density to keep me reading avidly. This novel was selected as the &#34;Go Big Read&#34; book for this year, a university and city-wide program to get people reading and talking about a single book. Although I doubt this one will have as much appeal to young men as it might to young women, there's plenty to think about for any reader.
B007VUA7VO|1.0|dont like this app....dont understand its use.....so i dont recommend it for anyone but for the easily amused.....dont like it.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|Looks good and keeps good time.  This is my second Seiko 5; the first was purchased in Vietnam in 1967,  and still keeps ticking.<br />This only negative is that there is no way to stop the Second Hand to set it exactly on the correct second. No big deal, so I think this is a keeper at 3 times the price.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|this app is okay, but you can get addicted to it easily......recommend it for all those who are into the strategy games.....
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This App is easy to use, and easy to read.  I find that I use it over any of other the half dozen Calculators that we have in the house.
B00632HWOG|3.0|whatever method of email you prefer will work, but for anyone who wants an alternative method of email besides their main one this one will work.
B000EPR7NE|5.0|This is one of the greatest soundtracks ever. I love the score to this movie. Wonderfully dramatic. Lots of mystery.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great story of love, trust, friendship & fear. Great storyline. Love Katie/Erin her strength, courage & compassion! Alex is pretty fantastic too! Jo was a slanderous
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I truly like battery pro because it gives me the percentage of juice left. Not to forget it even gives you an amount of time that it might have left!
0307352153|5.0|It came within a good time,I didn't have to wait long.  I like the new condition. I  haven't read it yet.
B00005YUPO|5.0|Invaluable. We had the VHS version for our daughter and needed to update for our son. A slight guilty feel when you &#34;prop them up in front of the TV&#34; ... but it guarantees a precious half  hour of peace.
B0038JN6VA|2.0|I received this speaker as a gift from a friend. I was really excited since it had the one thing I had been searching for - a headphone jack! I could turn the speaker down low and listen to it on my desk at work, and when I heard a song I wanted to turn up the volume on I could grab the ear buds, turn off the speak and crack it up! Or just leave in the ear buds as long as I was not getting up and down from my desk.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the battery never did hold a charge, but since it was sitting on my desk at work I simply plugged in the USB cable to my laptop docking station and supplied constant power. That is once I could get the Power On switch to work. It usually took about a minute or two of constantly wiggling the power switch button before it would turn on. But, once it was working it worked really well. Too bad it won't turn on any more. The switch has finally stopped working all together, now it is nothing more than a funny looking $60 paper weight.<br /><br />Update: I decided to take the x-mini apart to see if I could bypass the on-off switch and get the speaker to work since I really liked having it on my desk at work. So, I opened it up and took the start stop switch out, used a pin to hit the reset and success! My x-mini is once again operational!!<br /><br />It is the perfect speaker for my application because when I am constantly getting up and down from my desk I can just let the speaker play and when I need to block things out and will be busy for an extended period I just pop in the ear buds, and if a song comes on and I want to crank it up I can mute the speaker and let the ear buds blast away!
B00BRR66SA|5.0|BEST ALBUM OF THE YEAR!!! PROBABLY HIS GREATEST WORK!! JT kept true to his sound, and I'm sure his fans appreciate it!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Very nice puzzle game. it has lovely graphics, is fun and addictive. I love it. developers and artists have made an excellent work.
B002XXNSF6|5.0|It was about character development through dialogue.  The entire movie is two people getting to know one another by communicating face to face.  There isn't any violence or chase scenes.  It was so refreshing.  I immediately watched Before Sunset.  It was just as good and I can't wait to see Before Midnight.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I love it! It has failed to show me any problems! On my Kindle Fire HD, works wonders! It tells me what percentage my battery has, and when it's charging it tells me about how long it will be until it's complete. I love this app! I would definitely recommend it!
B0085YOD1A|2.0|Doesn't really do anything special apart from other battery apps. But why does it need internet permissions? I'm using Battery Notifier BT that doesn't have any permissions at all.<br /><br />It's functional with telling battery and usage, but all in all it doesn't stand out the others.
B008K8U13K|4.0|I played this game and loved it! It's a little pricy at $4 but I used Amazon coins to buy it. The game has a lot of content and while I had never played a Sonic game, I loved it. It is a little bit Repetitive and but the graphics are good and the game is very entertaining. I recommend reading the contolls and using tilt mode but I'd also try touch just to get the feel of it. The point is its a great game that could be improved by lowering the price and cutting off a little repetition. Otherwise it's a five star game and I look forward to buying episode 2 but the price of episode 2, yikes! $5. Still I think I will be compelled to buy the following app after I finish this game.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Firstly, don't get me wrong, I enjoy Sylvia Day's writing, her style and descriptions.  But Gideon and Eva went nowhere in this installment.<br />Same trust issues, same covert activities.<br />And truthfully, almost too many sex scenes; at least closer to the end she abbreviated some of them.<br />Truly wished it would have left me wanting more...but not so much.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|For all the haters out there hatin on this game they need to get a refund on there own device this game works its not that much memory people just want to complain if you want a game that's good and you have nothing else to do then this is a game to try out stop trying to give bad results to the game you people that gave it 1star that's just crazy give the game credit I'm a level43 4th prestige and I have every gun without paying a dime of in app purchases add me my username is _Leon_055
B00992CF6W|1.0|What a lousy game for $7.00. This game is a piece of junk. This game is terrible. If you get this for your kindle fire, you can not even start a game and get people to join it. You can't even get any updates. I want a full refund of my money. Do not make the same mistake I did.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|i would compare this movie to LOTR, which is my favorite. THis is a spin off of LOTR and is just as great
B0090EHVMC|5.0|I am a mother to a 14 month old little girl that simply adores this movie. The colors, the music and eventually when she comes of age to understand what the movie is about she can appreciate the value of nature. :)
B001JIFYSA|2.0|Silly, unbelieveable, syrupy. if you like Hugh Grant doing the same thing for the umpteenth time, then this is for you.
B0093QHWLC|3.0|I want to like this movie. Great cast, solid writing, but both the book and the movie had the same problem: at the heart of the story there is nothing.  In fact, the novel and film should both begin where they end.  Here's the set up, a Boston crime boss discovers he kills the wrong man while his former best friend discovers the real killer.  What will both do?  Now, that has some oomph to it.  I like this film, I do.  But it leaves me with nothing.  Check out Gone, Baby Gone, the film by Ben Affleck that actually makes a Lehane novel into something powerful.  Of the three directors who've tried Lehane, Scorsese, Eastwood, and Affleck, only Affleck had the sense to use Lehane's more traditional novels.  His outliers, like Mystic River and Shutter Island tend to have no strong through plot, and I guess that's what's going on here.  Still, watchable.  Who doesn't love to watch the operatic pain of Boston Irish going down the tubes?  Good Will Hunting, Gone Baby Gone, the Departed, Mystic River, the Town.
0374533555|5.0|Mind opening book for anyone who wants to understand how we think and why most of us don't understand how we think.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like it... but what really annoys me is the link to Facebook? I know it's advertising... but do I really want all my friends to know I still play games I should have grown out of by now?!?
0425263924|1.0|Trilogy equals 3 books. I can't believe she drew this \\"story\\" out to try to get 2 more books...there wasn't even enough plot to fill this one!  Wrap it up already. If you're so dying to cash in on this series, just write them over from Gideon's perspective. Lame!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome app.  Very time consuming though because of how fun it is.  Lots of different stuff do, lots of horses.
B000MRTGW4|5.0|Nice detailing. Just as I expected it. Perfect little gift addition or tiny decoration. Would like to order other critters.
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|For starters I think it is necessary to say that I will probably insult a few people in this review, horrify others, and hopefully make one or two people laugh.  This review will contain a spoiler or two (I'll try to keep them vague).  It will also most likely draw the ire of a few people who think I am off my rocker when it comes to my opinion of the film and of Star Trek in general.  Just know that I do really enjoy the original series and most of the films that it spawned as well as many of the spin-off shows and books.  My review will be written from the heart, tongue firmly in cheek, and with no ill will toward anyone.<br /><br />And so begins my review that CONTAINS SPOILERS.  \\"Shields up, Prairie Cajun!\\"<br /><br />I walked into the theater a couple of weeks ago with my daughter in tow.  As much as I love Doctor Who and Star Wars, her passion burns just as brightly for Star Trek.  She loves the original series and ST:TNG, and is especially fond of Spock, Bones, Data, and Captain Picard.  I didn't plan on seeing Star Trek Into Darkness until it had been out for awhile, but she insisted on seeing it as soon as possible.  We saw it in 3-D and by the end of the film, the rebooted crew of the Enterprise had once again impressed me and solidified her love of the franchise.<br /><br />As the film began, I felt a great disturbance in the Force.  It was as if millions of Trekkies witnessed J.J. Abrams dash the Prime Directive on the rocks of his Star Wars-infused childhood.  The crew of the Enterprise was actually trying to save a race of primitives on a planet that was about to go belly up via a volcano.  Instead of letting nature take its course, Kirk and company literally freeze the destruction of the primitives, expose themselves and the Enterprise to the people (which leads to a new idol for the primitives to worship), and also endangers the life of Spock.  Naturally this gets Kirk into a whole heap of trouble with Admiral Pike, but in true Trek fashion, Kirk manages to skirt any real punishment and is put under the command of Pike who is given back the helm of the Enterprise.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a dark and mysterious figure begins manipulating a poor fellow who is a part of Starfleet.  Whovians will recognize him as Mickey (Noel Clark) from the new Doctor Who era.  This leads to the destruction of a Starfleet archive, which leads to all of the head honchos (including Kirk and Spock, naturally) gathering in one place, which makes it ever-so-easy for the mysterious figure to attack and nearly wipeout all of the biggest members of Starfleet in one fell swoop.  Kirk and Spock are two of the survivors, obviously.  Kirk is basically given the green light to find and destroy the mysterious guy at any and all costs.  Spock follows his lead, but only after making it very clear that he disagrees with the actions of Kirk and of a certain high-ranking official in Starfleet.  To top it all off, Scotty quits, refusing to have any hand in the militarization of the Enterprise in order for it to catch its prey.<br /><br />From that point on, more people are manipulated, orders are questioned, and an old enemy from the original series reveals himself to maybe/maybe not be the villain behind all of the bad things that are happening to Kirk and the rest of Starfleet.<br /><br />I could literally hear the wailing and gnashing of Trekkie teeth while watching this film.  Abrams not only revives an old and beloved villain, he makes him likeable!  He makes this villain work WITH Kirk and then backstab him all within a few minutes of the film!  I was actually pulling for the \\"villain\\" a lot of the time, and to top it all off, Abrams takes a pivotal scene from the most beloved film in the entirety of Star Trek and reverses the roles of its two key members!  He then goes on to take a popular line uttered by one of those said members in Star Trek II, places it within the scene, and has the other person say it!!  Oh, the horror, the outrage!!!!<br /><br />Once again I felt a disturbance in the Force!  It was as if Abrams had evacuated his bowels all over the memories of the high and mighty Trek.  Children were weeping!  Women were screaming!  Cats and dogs were living together!  I literally had friends who got rid of any and everything associated with Abrams' rebooted Trek.  Others were so upset with what had happened to their beloved franchise that they were turning to \\"lesser\\" franchises like Firefly and, dare I say it, Babylon 5, for comfort!<br /><br />And then it hit me.<br /><br />Abrams is brilliant.  He took a franchise that is so loved by its fans and made them see it for what it really is....another space opera.  I've always held the belief that Trekkies placed Trek on a pedestal far taller than it deserved to be upon.  Don't get me wrong.  I've taken my love of Star Wars and Doctor Who to places it has no business being, but Trekkies always managed to take their love just a bit farther and for that, I love them.  I believe that they are so very passionate about their franchise that they forget that the original Trek had its share of cheese, objectification of women, bad acting, and more often than once the Prime Directive was violated.  Kirk was a cowboy in space.  Spock was supposed to be his anchor of logic and Bones the unbridled passion.  When the two combined, they made Kirk a better person.  That, at least to me, is the core of Trek.  It really wasn't until The Next Generation that politics, social issues, etc. came to the forefront of the franchise.  The original series had its moments, but in the end it was meant to be entertaining, and I do believe Abrams has succeeded in doing that with the franchise.  Heck, if you dig deep enough, you'll see that Abrams does manage to touch on modern issues like terrorism and the abuse of power.  He does all of this with lots of bang and zip, which is, quite frankly, something that TNG, DS9, Voyager, and Enterprise often lacked.<br /><br />Now, I am by no means a Star Trek wizard.  My opinion is based purely on what I've read and watched over the years.  I'm sure there are fans of Trek reading my words right now and laughing out loud, possibly calling me an idiot, and I'm okay with that.  I've been a nerd for the entirety of my life and can handle name calling and other forms of verbal abuse.<br /><br />With all of that out of the way, I'll briefly state that the production values in this film were top notch.  I expected nothing less from Abrams and his gang.  The story is fast-paced, well written, and enjoyable to see unfold on the screen.  The few extra bucks for 3-D are entirely worth it.  All of the returning cast did excellent jobs, especially Karl Urban and Chris Pine.  Peter Weller was solid in his role and Benedict Cumberbatch owned the screen any time he was on it (even when he wasn't speaking).  Alice Eve wasn't too shabby, either.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this flick.  I'll buy it when it is released on DVD and Blu-ray.  I highly recommend it, even to hardcore Trekkies.  You'll scream and tear your flesh, but in the end you will enjoy this film.<br /><br />\\"Drop shields, Prairie Cajun.\\"<br />Once again I felt a disturbance in the Force!

147674355X|5.0|In very few words, this book is WOW!!...with no spoilers, This book starts off with alot of plot building, but for good reason, don't get discouraged, this book explodes about half way through and has you glued!! I have read other books such as the Breathing series, the crossfire novels, shades of grey, Down to you, Easy,tainted morals, Beautiful disaster, walking disaster, and this is definately one of my recommended reads!!<br /><br />I love books with a dark element to it and get my fill with this book. (but not too much)
B007EE4XKI|5.0|I love stories that attempt to fill in missing pieces of various puzzles, and this Star Trek novel does just that. I've read it a couple of times now, and it keeps getting better.
B004I744AS|4.0|Its good to be sure of spelling and using a word correctly wherever one is. With this app I'll always have a dictionary handy.
B006C1DH92|5.0|I use the games as a stress relief.  I love the Fruit slash games.  Lots of fun and you don't have to think real hard.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I have to agree with Abbie W. I am finished. Too much of the same. Too predictable. First two in the series were much better.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's good but when updates come out its not on time like the the 0.7.0 update that was<br />supposed to be out on June 5 two days ago but it's still awesome.
B0093LINVK|3.0|Six Month Update Jan 2014:<br /><br />My first NUC was replaced by Intel. I leave my main computer on 24/7. The NUC would constantly reboot itself everyday--if it did not at least do that I would come in and the system was crashed. Intel tech support worked hard with me trying to solve the issue until we gave up and they shipped me a REFURBISHED one.<br /><br />I had to obviously start anew and reload everything (I put a new SSD drive in the new NUC). It's been a month now and the system is stable EXCEPT the video driver. Again, each morning, I come into a screen that has had all the shortcut Icons moved and the windows have been re-sized.<br /><br />I went into Windows 8 and unchecked \\"Turn monitor off after XX hours\\" and changed it to \\"never\\". So I shut the monitor off on the monitor itself at night. This solved the issue---What was happening is when Windows shuts off the monitor, when you wake it, the NUC graphics driver has some problem. I believe the other NUC had this issue and I believe Intel knows about it.<br /><br />So, I'm not sure I'll go this route again--I'm not pleased with the TIME and problems I've had. I'd also like to hear if others are having these graphics issues.<br /><br />(Yes, I have the latest Intel graphics drivers AND have even tried disabling the drivers and using the Windows graphic drivers and there is no difference).<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br /><br />I love this for my home office. I have to have two office computers for what I do and replaced one tower PC with this one. I like that it's only 12 Watts NOT 400! I will buy another.<br /><br />Some tips:<br /><br />I originally loaded this with Linux Mint (I hate Win8) but the ancillary programs (most especially Microsoft publisher) with their similar Open Office programs are just not the same--when rendered to .pdf in the Open Source processing programs the files were huge. Too big to email<br /><br />So I had to put on Win8--(Did I say I hate that?). Anyhow--the trick was gettingthe hard drive to reformat itself. (that took a while) I had to load another op-sys such as Parted Magic (Google that) make a bootable USB drive from their ISO download and that allows you to reformat the SSD so Windows 8 will load. (YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN HERE!!!)<br /><br />Have used it 6 days now--flawless. I did not install the internal wireless card--I use the Ethernet and have a Dongle. Have it hooked up to a USB 4 port hub and run a 4Tb Drobo as the net server for my little office. Too cool for school...and 12 watts??<br /><br />Mine is outfitted with Mushkin mSATA SSD120GB and Corsair Vengeance DDR3 8GB (2x4GB) and Dongle/Ethernet/External, Powered 4-port USB Hub; DVD Optical Drive powered by USB Hub.
B00846REIS|4.0|This was a great book to read, and easy to read too. The ending really leaves you hanging... Can't wait to read the others.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Well done with some surprising twists in the storyline. I can't wait for Season 4 to begin.  My sister in law got me into this series and my husband and I both love it.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|Not typical Daft but def good stuff. As I titled this review, it is growth while also paying tribute to the past. The snippets do not do the songs justice, u really should listen to the whole.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I play this at bed time and set the timer for an hour.  I get to a nice sleep.  When I have trouble concentrating at work a will play something and it works.
B007V65R54|5.0|Silver is adept at making complex concepts clearer and abstractions more concrete. Although he is most familiar to general audiences for his accurate election predictions, in Signal and Noise he takes readers into the realms of baseball, weather and earthquake prediction, economics, and statistics. He is not a &#34;true believer&#34; with a single theory to tout, but a searcher for patterns and explanations who is willing to admit that sometimes there are none. Silver is definitely a fox, who finds many small truths, not a hedgehog with only one way to view the world. Well worth reading and keeping in mind when analyzing the news and considering the opinions offered by pundits and expert, most of whom are very poor predictors or explainers.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I want to play multi with my friend. She has 7.0 update. I don't so now we can't play! FIX THIS NOW
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|I got it for free but it's worth a buck for sure. Decent sliding type puzzle game, connect the puddings to win
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I wasn't sure if the capstone on such a long and rich series would adequately fulfill, but I was extremely impressed.  This book was awesome from start to finish.  I was afraid that it would simply be a drawn-out story of a big battle, but there was a great deal of depth to it.  All it all, I would say that it more than adequately completely the Wheel of Time series.  It was very satisfying.<br />The only downside to the book is that it is REALLY hard to put down... :-/
B00BC24NT4|5.0|John LeCarre has not lost his touch. In fact, this is one of the best since the Smiley series. Exciting, funny, believable. But neither has he lost an infuriating tendency to leave you hanging at the end. I forgive him; he has no equal.
B0085YOD1A|1.0|Does not,show what apps are running and how much power they care using ( at least I couldn't find where if it does).Also my internet,stopped working after installing. Am uninstalling it as soon as I finish this review. I think  most of the good reviews on here are fake. This is based on the language used, they just don't sound like a real person!
0345803485|1.0|Was this supposed to be funny? Because I was laughing the entire time I read it.<br />Do you remember when you were in school, and would use a thesaurus to add \\"smart\\" sounding words to your essays? Using big words makes you sound smart, right? Ms. James hasn't outgrown this. Despite the fact that Anastasia Steele is a college graduate who had a suspiciously broad vocabulary, she doesn't have an e mail address, and thinks like a twelve year old.<br />The sex scenes are cringe inducing. If you did a Wikipedia search for BDSM, you'd find the entire source of E.L. James' research. Ladies, if you want bondage/punishment porn, it exists. You don't have to read this watered down, training wheels garbage.<br /><br />The only up side to this book was that it requires about as much mental energy as watching paint dry, but is over much faster.<br /><br />If someone recommends this book to you, I'd suggest slapping them, but they'd probably enjoy it. Instead, do something Christian Grey would never do, like respecting their opinions and decision making skills.
B00144VBBS|5.0|If a person is not a Toby Keith fan, then it's only because they haven't heard all of his hits on this album. Absolute must for the collector and every party!
B0015DWJX2|5.0|Reading this for my book club was a joy even if it was for the second time .  I cannot wait to discuss it with my friends.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|has all the space i need.  absolutely perfect for my needs. blah blah blah blah blah.  had to write more, but had nothing to add
B002T9H2L0|5.0|All I have to say, is this movie ranks up there with Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained. The actors are excellent (especially the role of Col. Hans Landa by Christoph Waltz) and the storyline is awesome. It is entertaining, funny, clever, and just all around an amazing film. A lot of personal friends that have seen this movie say it is dull and boring because a portion of the movie is in German or French, but it is just to make the story more realistic. Why would people in France be speaking English to each other? Once again, a very smart, entertaining movie. I highly recommend this movie to anyone!
B0015KGWZG|5.0|I bought this years ago on the first release and have referred to it so many times it finally fell apart so I bought and downloaded for my Kindle and then purchased two additional hard copies for family members.  Great book.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game was recommended to me by my sister-in-law.  I am glad I downloaded it.  You really have to think about the route to get to the matching dot.  It's a fun game.  Sometimes when you think you have it right, you don't.  Just keep going and you will get it.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|My son loved this at the movies and he couldn't wait to get a copy to play at home over and over again. He loves this movie.
B001VNB54A|5.0|Very accurate and compelling account of World War II in the Pacific.<br /><br />What I liked the best was historical accuracy combined with great directing, cast and story line.<br /><br />I would recommend this HBO series to anyone interested in how the United States Marines gallantly fought and dies to uphold freedom and honor in the Pacific in World War II
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I enjoyed the first book, it's quite interesting, very similar to Twilight though...<br />But i think it was enough, no bother to write the following two,  pushing the story far making it repeat itself.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|We got hooked on Dexter and my daughter (who got us started) had purchased the seasons on Amazon. After we got back to our home we went ahead and purchased the next season on Amazon and since our TV is internet capable we just switch to internet and load the series and watch :)..
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|kind a like Myst in that there are no active areas, you have to figure it out on your own. They do give you hints if you need it. It is strictly a box that has intricate parts to open. Fun.
1603425381|4.0|I wish it started a few steps on the lineal pattern first before going into the corner.  I’m having a hard time figuring out what the lineal pattern directions are; which makes it only corners and hard to use for me.  Perhaps an accomplished crocheter would not have my problem.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Why did you end this book like that?  This book was nothing compared to the first two books.  We still don't know what happened.  You left us all hanging.  We still don't know if Gideon and Eva makes it together.  We still don't know how or who took Nathan's bracket and give it to that died man. Ms. Day this is BULL.  I paid for a book after waiting 6 months and this is how you leave it?  I GUESS BERKLEY PUBLISHING IS HAPPY YOU PUT SOMETHING IN PRINT.  BUT WHAT A LOUSY WAY TO DO TO YOUR READERS.
0451232852|3.0|If you LOVED Pillars of the Earth and are hoping for more of the same, this is not it.  This book is okay in a take-it or leave-it way.  The characters and story will not suck your imagination into caring about the shallow figures,trying to imagine life in this time/place, or anticipating what delicious plot twist is coming next. (I can't believe 1200 people gave this a 5 star).  It is okay, if like me, you are desperately looking for something to read and will go with a C grade over nothing.  But don't expect to be enchanted.  One good thing was it did help both spark and illuminate my interest in some of the political considerations leading up to WWI. But if book 2 & 3 are more of the same in different historical periods, I will pass.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|A great addition to an already great camera. Allows easy aiming of the camera without adding too much weight. ( I don't even notice the difference).
B0085YOD1A|1.0|what do we need a battery app for?  don't all devices have a little battery Icon that shows how much juice is left on it already?

B00C33M2EE|5.0|After first album, I make decision to buy next part as cd-dvd bundle. And it was great decision. TPG play great easy listening music but the without videos every piece is incomplete. Now with dvd I could go to my parents and play it on big TV screen (no internet) and they were very happy to see and listen.

1476729719|5.0|This was the 1st book by Ms Picoult, that I read.  I couldn't put it down and I became an instant fan.  In a flash our lives can change and this story brought home just how this happens.  What happened and why.  If we had been there, could we have foreseen what was coming and changed the outcome.  I never read one of her books without a lot pondering during and afterwards.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Very smart writer. He is a time tested individual with a unique approach to life. Loves to write and it shows up in his work.
B0034G4OUO|5.0|This is a different movie for Dwayne Johnson. He is so hard and tough and quiet. But you understand why as the story unravels. And I love the gun and the car. Wow
B0026145WK|5.0|Great movie. The storyline is simple and good with lots of action scenes and time to process what's going on. Liam Neeson never disappoints.

B004X6PRO6|5.0|As a teacher of international students in the U.S., I'm always on the lookout for novels that can help me understand other cultures and ways of thinking.  This novel was everything I expected and more -- I couldn't put it down.  Johnson does a superb job of giving us a glimpse into the lives of North Koreans.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|It's a calculator. It's free. It works. That's everything I wanted. What more can one ask? No problems reported to date.

B007STXHTM|5.0|Awesome case. Bought to take on vacation for good quality underwater photos. Takes better quality photos with this case that the original Hero 2 case.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think that this is better then temple run 1 & 2 it is the best running and jumping game
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is my favodite app. i gave it five stars because it has super good graphics and it has lots of cool barriers to jump and slide under.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a great game that uses eye hand coordination. I absolutely love how, every so often, it changes the location of the game. I love it.

B00CW665VI|5.0|I usually don't write review, but I'll recommended this book,  it is an enjoyable read, 5 Stars to the talented writer. Woo hoot!!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|this is a powerful insight as to what our SEALs are required to do, and how much they are willing to give for our freedom, and how they are pressured to give in to the Rules of Engagement, which are suidice.
B00AQF8CJ0|3.0|This game is stupidly addicting. I've been playing for over an hour now and can't seem to stop. I will recommend it to my friends!
B000U6BT40|5.0|Very entertaining and funny. Actually learner a few things by watching.wish it was still running on Tv. Will miss it.

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|After waiting months for Entwined With You to finally come out, I dove right in. I actually liked the fact that Eva and Gideon have more conversations. It makes them seem like a better couple. The chemistry they have is undeniable. I cant wait to read  books 4&5, and  continue their love story. I read this book in 8 hours and hated when it ended. I could have kept reading. Thank you Sylvia for making all of us fall in love with Eva and Gideon.
B000JVT09C|5.0|It was great after seeing this since 2006. The differences on the Blu-ray it shows more of skin sweat and good Color on costumes and outfits. DVD Barely shows any Differences in the movie.
B00992CF6W|1.0|why is this always weeks behind ios devices. now we cant play with our friends anymore we should have bought anwhyi! ipad.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I gave it a one for several reasons.  First, I loved the storyline as it was before coming to this thing called a third book in the Crossfire series. Second, there is no way to have less than one star. Third, her writing style was as good as ever.  That is all the book had, nothing. Some very well written 368 pages of nothing.<br /><br />This book did little to add anything to the plot. Nothing of consequence for Eva and Gideon,Cary, Trey, Tatiana, Brett, the moms...... well maybe just Eva's dad who found out what happened to Eva and said, Oh, ok, lemme screw mom for keeping this a secret.<br /><br />Erotica scenes, yes we know Sylvia can be good at them and she delivered. End of book 3.<br /><br />Disappointed is a small word. Of course this can't possibly be the end. I hope they take me to a free ride next, cause this was not worth neither the wait nor the money.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Such a great story! What a brave girl! I'm thinking about doing a weekend hike in the Oregon section of the trail with my husband. I've never done anything like that.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Like Kite Runner, the story built and built.  I think we figured out where it was going after a while but it was the way we got to that point that it ended just like we wanted to.  Powerful story.  I realize we are fighting there, but Khaled Hosseini writes so well so powerful and you fell you are right there with the characters.  Alzheimer's is a terrible disease and it effects everyone and every nationality.  Was a really good read.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|I just love the concert on mdvd so I bought it in Blu-ray for my OPPO BDP-93.  As my first blu-ray upgrade I am pretty disappointed but it may not be the disc's fault.  Sure it sounds better but I was hoping that the Blu-ray would giver better volume and not over heat my Onkyo TXNR-808 as badly but my hopes backfired.  I just love to crank it and spank it when I can and feel the beer kick in.  That is where it fails.  I cannot get it nearly as loud for whatever reason.<br /><br />Perhaps the Blu-ray version pushes the Onkyo to new levels of demanding performance and It just needs time to break in my BIC Acoustec speakers to a new level.  However this concert is the only one I have that over heats my Onkyo.  My one other Blu-ray, Joe Satriani Live in Montreal, does not have any problem burying the volume nor does dozens of my mdvds either.<br /><br />This concert is a no brainer to own but I am not sure if you really want it in Blu-ray over mdvd if you love to bury your volume like I do.  If I figure the causation out I will update but I need to stop playing the Blu-ray when I cannot control the crank me spank mood to bury the volume which is pretty always.<br /><br />For those that have all the volume you want then the sounds is maybe 15% better and the picture is 10% better on my system so buy it.  You never can get too good of a sound.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|We watched this as a guys' pizza-and-movie night.  It was fun, and well written!<br /><br />The wife of one of the guys was horrified to learn that we watched a Quentin Tarantino movie.  She needn't have been: it's definitely not a Disney movie, but it's much less violent than (say) Kill Bill.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Ok, you can't help but love this couple. Yes, I know they have a \\"Crazy\\" relationship but their LOVE is  HOT for each other.
0792844890|2.0|Belated and ill-conceived parody of \\"Star Wars,\\" which really didn't lend itself to spoofing. A solid comedic ensemble delivers few laughs in this slow-going space oddity. Sad to watch if you're a Mel Brooks fan. \\"Hardware Wars\\" (1978) was much funnier . . . and shorter.
B004G600A4|4.0|My whole family loves this movie.  It's definitely a classic in our home.  The only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars, is that the copy I received did not play in our DVD player.  Luckily, it did play in our travel dvd players, so my kids can watch when we are in the car.
B005V5WBFG|5.0|I have used McAfee security on my PC for years and I'm happy to have it on my Kindle Fire now.  I know it will work.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|Bought this as a replacement to the 1st one.  Watched so many times, my girls finally broke it.  This new one is better quality than my original one.  Vey happy with purchase!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I've watched many BBC series, but his one takes the cake. Actors, plot, setting - all spectacular. Will start season 3 as soon as we finish 2.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|great mix of story and science fiction, a great escape, have watched this series for many, many years on PBS
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The best story I have read, bar none.  The details are perfect, the character's developed perfectly. I am so glad I stumbled across the Crossfire series!
B00CATSONE|4.0|Nice read. I knew he was an inventor of the AC, but I didn't know everything he was involved in.
B0094K1K42|3.0|The movie itself made me cringe, but the acting was decent and the story line was ok.  It was just kind of sad and pathetic, but then, that's the point.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|Synopsis<br />Hazel spends her time tethered to an oxygen tank and occasionally attending the cancer survivors support group. She may be alive following her battle with lung cancer, but she's not actually living. All of that changes on day when she sees a new guy staring at her in group. Augustus is also a survivor and forces her to change her views on sickness and living.<br />Review<br />This book is sad, I can't really state that enough. As usual, I jumped into this book without reading the description and then spent several hours crying as I made my way through the book. I don't know if I was having an emotional day or if this is seriously the saddest book ever. In my opinion, the emotion that the middle of the book wrung out of me overwhelmed the actual story. I also felt like the last 5th of the book just kind of lost its momentum. There was so much buildup, and then it kind of petered out.<br />The characters are pretty strong and feel like they could actually be real. I also appreciated that there wasn't an immediate love, or any kind of normal love triangle. The reality of the story may lose some of the younger readers that are used to the fluffy paranormal books that are running around today, and that would be a shame. This is certainly the first YA book that I have read in a long time that evoked an emotion.<br />My Recommendation<br />If you are in need of a good cry, go for it! I give it 3/5 - Good, but not something I would repeat
B0084670FU|3.0|The development of the story is slow, but I kept watching because I wanted to see how all these people were connected.  Brad Pitt's family connection was easily determined, but the connection to the Chinese (?) family was sketchy and really, what was the point of that?  That whole story line was strange and the movie really could have done without it and just focused on the story of the family.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This app is perfect, it works quickly and accurately, I can delete and access my contacts easily. I love it
B006Y5H74W|4.0|The music and performances were excellent. I am old enough to remember variety shows. I have missed them. Programs like this one and &#34;Glee&#34; are engaging and entertaining.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|I like shot'm ups and action. This has both and I also like to see the bad guy get clobbered. I enjoyed watching Arnold and his rag -tag team do-in the bad guys.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Great storyline and good writing but I was hoping for a different  ending - left me unsatisfied & wanting more
B00BE5U7P8|3.0|John Walkenbach writes in a didactic fashion that allows for good grounding in the basic concepts. For more than beginning VBA dummies, I recommend John's: Excel 2010 Power Programming with VBA. It is the quintessential reference for Excel VBA and with more than three times the material, it is well worth the money.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|a pleasant way to pass time . The acting felt natural. There were some very funny moments.Barbara was her old self with out music.
0679805273|5.0|I got this as a graduation gift for my brother. He loved it! It was perfect for the occasion. Great for kids or adults.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I had two hours to spend after finishing a book and this was a perfect way to do it. Much fun
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|not one bad tune on this CD, back to basics for Boz, like the remakes of some older songs in the Boz style
B003O86FMW|5.0|I watched the movie and wanted to read the book. For the first time ever I realized how much better it is to read the book because you get so much more detail. I was never a reader before this book and now I reade all the time.
B0085YOD1A|2.0|Probably the most basic, pro version of a software. Does what any free version can do and nothing more. It is simple though and easy to understand, but for those looking for more detailed info on your battery, this is not it.
B007N85POS|3.0|I like angry birds and so do my kids but this app is a little slow and I don't see the difference between the one that's HD and the regular one.
B00AYE8C70|2.0|I never received an authorization code from Viber, the app does not let me initiate a call without first having entered an authorization code, and there seems to be no way to contact Viber to get one, so the app is totally useless.  Besides that, Viber's ad stating \\"you can call anyone anywhere totally free\\" is misleading since they fail to say that the receiving party must also be a Viber subscriber.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|It was easy to read and kept me glued to the story! Very well written and intriguing. I would read it again.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This app is completely amazing it is so addictive and so much fun and I recommend it to anyone that likes this kind of game
B00881VLCE|5.0|Love this game!  I have been working puzzles with my boyfriends mom and now im addicted and had to find an app for puzzles!  Good job with this one!
B004GHNIRK|3.0|The book is just too long for my reading.  An abridged version would not scare individuals who do not read much.
B00992CF6W|3.0|it is weird that it hasn't came out on my kindle how do you update it because its not showing up in my updates
B00CW665VI|5.0|Honestly the blurb for this book had me hooked and then after the first chapter I was a goner. This book is just so funny. I laughed the entire way through this book. It is told from the man's point of view which is just hilarious. Drew Evans tells the story of how he fell in love, and got heart-broken. When we meet him he is complete crap and is sick from heart-break, and it leads to his story. I cannot quit raving about this book, it has forever spoiled me for funny books. It is similar to wallbanger in the comedy since but it was just great.
B0064MGU98|4.0|Of course this is the 1st season, and we know what happens in the next 3.  I like courtroom dramas that are realistic.  This is more so than not so.  The wife gag, is good the 1st season, but gets old has time goes on.  If you are married and want to have a boy toy on the side, get divorced and have fun.
193700788X|1.0|Disappointment does not even begin to describe how I feel about this book. About 100 pages into it I just thought \\"wow I really do not want to read this.\\"<br /><br />So Charlaine Harris has repeatedly said that she has known how the book is going to end since book 2.... well really? So you give your loyal fans 10 more books of the romance story they wanted so that they would buy 10 MORE BOOKS... and then just dump all that off the face of the Earth! Seriously?! She made her millions of dollars and then just gave up on the last book and wrote whatever it was she felt like writing... way to be loyal to your fans.<br /><br />As soon as I put the last book down I took a picture of all 13 books and they are all going on Ebay, because I will never read this books again!
B008KP6ENE|4.0|don't. let the cuteness fool you.  this is a challenging fun game that everyone will enjoy.  great graphics fluid play.  recommended.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Slammed was amazing, like perfectly balanced, didn't see it coming, read in one sitting amazing. This book is just perfection. I cannot rave about this book enough. There is not one part of this book I would change and everyone should read it. Colleen Hoover has a serious gift, and I would read absolutely anything she wrote, because it is just beautiful. Her characters were well-developed and I loved everyone of them. The twists just kept coming with this book, like a sucker-punch to the stomach. Please do not read any spoilers for this book, let the surprises be organic because it is well worth it.<br /><br />I really cannot describe it too much without giving it away, so just read it. My Aunt did not want to read it because she was worried it was a little young for her. I promise you it is not some young story with high school drama. It is a flawless rendition of a girl struggling to hold everything together in the wake of her fathers death, and the mishaps that come into her life.
1451648537|5.0|I liked this book very much also ordered for my son and I would recommend this book to all my friends
B0085YOD1A|4.0|This item is pretty basic, but it costs nothing, so, you get what you pay for.Take the thing for what it's worth.
1577314808|5.0|I liked this book very much ordered it for my son and he keeps reading it over and over I would recommend this book to all my friends
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Freaking amazing series! I was on the &#34;notify&#34; list for season 5 and just got it. Soooooo excited!!!! Very addictive show!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Outstanding Action and humor. The supporting cast really makes this movie worth watching - All-Star Cast.  Bruce Willis at his best! Must See...
B00280LYIM|5.0|This book is amazing. The entire series is well written and very entertaining to read. I highly recommend the series.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|Ever a SK fan, not quite noticing Bachman even when I long ago became aware of the shadow-self author.  I am glad I recently stumbled onto this story. RB must have bloomed when I was distracted by child raising, so now, many years later as The Hunger Games echo the Walk's theme, I see a similarity. However, SK, in any form, remains ...the King.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|The story was there but it lacked the depth of the book. They also changed it around a lot and dropped a lot of characters which I detest. I think if the book was great - stick to the book not some Hollywood version of it.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|Really enjoyed this one from start to finish. And free on Kindle. One more classic book read for free thanks to Kindle!
B0085YOD1A|1.0|This is a waste of space, and the 2 minutes it took to determine it was a waste of space.  The only thing interesting is it told me the temperature of my kindle.  It just opens the device tab in settings, and gives you a pretty pic of a battery.  And I now know my battery is good.<br /><br />This app only was on my device minutes.  I'd be mad if I paid for it.  Very disappointing.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great calculator app. It's very useful and works well for its purpose. I do love it a lot.
B00BIVN82M|4.0|I love to listen to Michael Buble. Great CD for the car or just sitting at home with friends and family.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This is the app needed to open pdf documents and it works great for that purpose. I do love it and would recommend it to others.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|I was a kid when Nintendo came out and grew up on &quot;platform&quot; style games.  I haven't finished the 1st level yet. The graphics are good and background. I like the field of depth as you go through a tunnel and can see you are further in the background. I got this app free today and now that I have tried it,  I would say game is worth the normal price. I would buy similar apps like this one.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I was using my phone as an alarm, but this is much better. It allows me to set different alarm settings for different days and times, as my schedule changes from the weekdays to the weekends and holidays. Highly recommended!
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Where do they keep coming up with this crazy stuff? This game is super fun, even on those occasions when the puzzles make you want to bash your head against the wall for inspiration.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|A great game. Pretty scary. Closest I've seen to the pc version so far, other than slender rising, which is unavailable for kindle fire.<br />My only issue with the game is that once you look at him, it takes FOREVER for the static to go away. Anyway, this game is amazing. Keep it up!<br /><br />(P.s. can't wait for chapter 2!)<br />(P.p.s Definetly worth 99¢!)
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I started watching this show when it came into syndication on my local Fox station. How the heck did I EVER miss this show?!? It has become my favorite show ever! I consider it to be nerd-vana! Finally a show with a cast of characters that celebrates everything that is nerd culture and shows that even us nerds can be cool!
B005LAIHR2|5.0|I love the hair band music from the 80's and this DVD didn't disappoint.  It is super cute but I wouldn't advise any parent to show this to anyone under 18.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|With the movie coming out soon, a lot of interest has been poured onto this well-deserving book. Let me warn you right now - this is NOT a novelization. In fact, besides the title and the general theme of a Zombie Apocalypse, the forthcoming Brad Pitt movie has very little to do with this book. And thank God for that.<br /><br />Look, I'm not going to say the movie will be bad. From what I'm hearing, the movie isn't actually even that bad for what it is. But this book, frankly, kills it. This book should've been (and in fact still could be) made into a series, not unlike The Walking Dead. Only TWD got made first, so it's unlikely it'll ever happen. Many of the changes in the movie were made probably to differentiate that series from the movie, as the zombies in this book are definitely of the Romero/RE/TWD variety, i.e., shambling, stiff, corpses. What makes this book stand out is that it is written entirely in flashback, literally as an \\"after-action\\" report by a UN observer (who takes on the voice of the author), and tells, rather than one narrative, but rather a series of short vignettes from people of all walks of life, from all points in the Zombie War, from the first documented outbreak, through the initial stages of the infection, through the societal collapse, and finally the rebuilding effort. The stories are very real, very realistic in approach and psychology, and in fact Max Brooks as said in the past that he based the format of this book on a very similar account of WWII written in the 50s by an actual UN obvserver.<br /><br />The result is astounding.<br /><br />Read this book. Even if you are not a huge fan of horror, read it.
B004SIP7US|5.0|Amazing movie! One of my favorites! So much action and history! Leo does an amazing job as usual, as does Daniel Day-Lewis
145210655X|4.0|This came in very handy when my son's interest in the Star Wars franchise peaked, while at the same time my husband and I were coping with his adjustment to his new baby sister. It helped remind us that EVERY parent, even Darth Vader, goes through rough patches, and that we should embrace the good over the bad. Just don't think too hard about the implications of a man who has murdered his wife in a psychotic rage having custody of his young children, whom he also tries to murder as they reach adulthood. I SAID DON'T THINK TOO HARD!
B001FB55M6|5.0|As usual Jim Carry follows up with his funny movies! Definitely a good choice for anyone's movie collection! Watch it!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I'm NOT one to watch horror movies or tv shows. A friend of mine told me about this tv series which the story line is based on a comic book. I borrow my friend's season 1 & 2 of the Walkng Dead recently....I was amazed!!!!!I LOVE it!:)I enjoyed it soooo much that I had to buy my own. Your heart goes out to those characters and you find yourself at the end of your seat watching in AHHHH and wanting & wondering what the next obstacle those poor characters are going to have to go through next and in the mean time they have to fight off all the walkers...(zombies). MY favorite character is Daryl. He comes off crusty & cold in the 1st season & in the 2nd season you just fall in LOVE with his character. Norman Reedus does an outstanding job playing this character. This tv series is amazing to watch, even if your not a zombie or a horror movie fan. It is bad ass and awesome.
B001KW0C96|5.0|Great movie! Al Pachino and Robert De Niro are great together!! Must watch movie! You will love it! Will keep you attached to your seat
B0094MFITS|4.0|I like all the Jesse Stone movies. Tom Selleck fits this type of part to a T. He portrays this type in his series Blue Bloods on CBS.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Great movie for children and adults alike! I love this movie so much I cant wait until number 2 comes out!
B0029EDMEG|4.0|Another great Jesse Stone movie. Wish he made more. His series Blue Bloods is similar in the character he portrays.
0790729407|3.0|Good movie! Not the greatest but will teach you some things about your Irish heritage if your into that! Kinda slow but in the end a great movie!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Relaxing but addicting. I never get tired of playing spider solitare. That is why l had to get it for the Kindle. I am teaching my 4 year old granddaughter to play.
B001AK3S3U|3.0|XXX: State of the Union isn't as good as the original but still a good movie to watch! Buy it to complete the XXX series
B004JMZPJG|5.0|I chose to give this Camera Bag five stars because for one, it shipped exactly on time. Two, the bag itself perfectly replicates what I was looking for. (The right size [Fits the camera nicely, but with enough room to add a wallet]) Three, the adjustable strap is a lot more sturdier than it looks. All in all, I have had the product for about 6 weeks now, and it doesn't show any sign of wear or tear even after I have used it almost every day.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Awesome story! Great take on a childhood classic! Highly recommended for adults and children alike! Can easily be watched over and over again!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I first downloaded the free version and was really unhappy. But I bought the real version and I l love  it!
B000F9RB94|5.0|One of my favorite movies! Action packed great time! Even better on Blu- ray! Its a great movie for anyones movie collection!~
0345525558|5.0|It is a great story. Very well told. Lots of good information about flowers. Really kept my interest. Loved it.
B000I5XOVY|4.0|Awesome movie! John Travolta plays an awesome roll like usual! Great addition to any movie collection! Will keep you glued to your seat!

B005LAII12|5.0|I bought his movie as a gift for my brother and he loved it!!! Amazingly funny! If your easily offended stay away!
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|Typical Die Hard...I really like the Die Hard Sequels and this is or as better than the others.  Good action scenes.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|We love movies with Audrey Hepburn in them and learned of this title while watching a film about her life.  We watched The Nun's Story, and we really enjoyed it.
B005V5WBFG|5.0|This product is complete according with today's requirements. I like itbecause is very easy to use and install. I will continue to update my computer protection with McAfee now and in the near future.
B0045HCJRQ|5.0|Well, Richard Gere always draws my attention, so I figured I'd give it a try.  Love it!  I had forgotten I had seen it years ago, but enjoyed it none the less.
B00COHIFQS|3.0|The move was worth watching, but it seemed to drag at times and I was not a big fan of how it ends.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Really helpful app. It helps with battery life watching. I had it plugged  in at 41% and it 'bing'-ed when it got to 100%! I love this app! Needs!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This was a truly original way to tell this tale. I really enjoyed the format of the interviews and wold recommend this book as it could be about any war not just World War Z.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great game if you liken to build stuff but updates take longer to get on my kindle fire than my phone.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Mr. Howey has written a page turner, well written and thought out characters, plot is deep and compelling.  I especially enjoy how you get to understand the villain Bernard's reason for his actions, he truly believes he is doing the right thing to save all their lives, no matter how twisted his actions are.  You can see how Hitler could be so successful in controlling a population.
B00CWVFZ8W|3.0|It was an okay movie. I think the premise was good but there was very little back story and it left me feeling like only part of the story had been told.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This item was purchased as a birthday gift for our son who had it listed as one of the items he most wanted to receive.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|Best one yet.<br />Covers many years over time in the life of a brother and sister in Afghanistan. Beautifully written.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This app is actually pretty good and I loved it but the thing is that you have to and I mean you have to have internet access
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I love the fact that I can see exactly where I'm at when I'm playing games. I don't have to keep checking my Power level.
B005HED11Y|5.0|The remastered Original Trek is a great gift to the fans.  Exterior shots are first rate and bring a nice finishing touch to the series Trek fans love.  Back in 60's the effects were expensive so they focused on story quality.  Now we have nice effects to match the stories!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Can't wait for the other books to come . Love, love,love this book!!!!! Hope the publisher's don't take as long to publish the other ones as they did this one!!!!!
B00009ZYBY|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. I bought it so we would have something to watch when there is absolutely nothing on TV. Could watch this over and over because of many reasons. The acting is wonderful as with all Russell Crowe movies. Story line is great, directing is perfect, ect.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I thought the first season was excellent.  The changes in storyline this season were superb as well.  The main characters stay, but the secondary characters this season have been woven seamlessly into the overall story.
B000W8OM5Y|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. I bought it so we would have something to watch when there is absolutely nothing on TV. Could watch this over and over because of many reasons. The acting is wonderful as with all Mel Gibson movies. Story line is great, directing is perfect, ect.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a great game and was only a couple of dollars once you are playing to unlock the full version.  You will not be disappointed if you enjoy this style and genre of app gaming.
B000GW8VTO|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. I bought it so we would have something to watch when there is absolutely nothing on TV. Could watch this over and over because of many reasons. The acting is wonderful as with all Mel Gibson movies. Story line is great, directing is perfect, ect.

B000I9U99K|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. I bought it so we would have something to watch when there is absolutely nothing on TV. Could watch this over and over because of many reasons. The acting is wonderful as with all Russell Crowe  movies. Story line is great, directing is perfect, ect.
0316010669|5.0|A fascinating book about how the brain works for rapid cognition and split-second decision making. Based on many scientific experiments and practical case studies that are interesting, enlightening, surprising and educational, the author exposes unexpected aspects of how we do and should make decisions ranging from trivial to complex. A small part of this book ties to themes related to self protection, but that is only a fraction of the content and focus. On a much broader scale the author helps you to appreciate what is going on in your subconscious versus your conscious mind, and how both aspects of decision making must be better understood for optimum outcomes. Real stories from crime, art, music, history, politics, war, product marketing and more are included. The style of the book is entertaining, easy to follow and kept me up late many nights wanting to keep reading to find out more. You'll enjoy this one.
B00005MP58|5.0|I bought this to keep in my library for nights when there is absolutely nothing on TV. I really like the story, though it is not my husband typical kind of movie, he will watch it with me without grumbling.
B00CE6E6B2|3.0|Not very challenging, same ole routine as other games. Needs to have more variety. Needs to be self relying instead of having to rely on others
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Wonderful show to watch with my children. There are a few 'risque' moments, so it's not perfect in terms of child viewing. Some mild and rare cursing. A few smooching moments, nothing awful, but I had to do some explaining.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|She combines violin with dubstep and other electronic musics very well.  The clean violin contrasts with the bass to create an amazing sound.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Though Gideon and Eva have many issues between them they still manage to love each other. Love their story it has everything from drama to romance. You can connect with these characters completely.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love this app. My normal alarm clock doesn't wake me up, but this woke me up immediately. I strongly recommend this app.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This app is a big guessing game, but it's not you that is guessing. I have had people come up with some very difficult characters to figure out and this game figured out all but one, \\"stepsister\\".  This gameccan be fun played by one person or a group of people. There is even a child setting if you want the kids to play it.
B00CWVG1Z8|1.0|HATE.<br /><br />If there were a stronger word to use for this movie I would. Maybe loathe? Despise? Meh, none seem to do. Way to go Alcon, you really screwed this one up.<br /><br />Where do I even begin? I suppose I should start by saying this post will DEFINITELY contain spoilers. So read ahead at your own risk.<br /><br />Instead of making this a long paragraph form, I think I'll bullet this to make it easier. The following things make this a horrible interpretation of the masterpiece book:<br /><br />-Ethan first runs into Lena at night time in the middle of a downpour. That's why he doesn't see her and almost hits her. In the movie, he runs into her in the day time. No.<br /><br />-Where is Marian Ashcroft throughout the movie? Anyone? Marian Ashcroft is the Gatlin County Librarian and also the Keeper of the Caster Library, the Lunae Libri. In the movie, Amma is the librarian and also the Keeper. Clearly she was meant to be the Seer, not the Keeper. Marian plays a HUGE role in the other books and should not have been taken out. She is a staple character.<br /><br />-Link does NOT shoot Ethan at the reenactment of The Battle of Honey Hill. In the book, there is a showdown when Sarafine, Lena's mother, shows up for The Claiming. She ends up stabbing Ethan and that's what kills him. Amma and Lena's family cast a spell that causes Macon and Ethan to switch places, thus putting Macon in the Arclight (which comes up in a later book) and brings Ethan back to life.<br /><br />-Ridley's eyes remain gold throughout the entire book. That's what sets her apart from the light casters. The eyes of a Light Caster should be green. In the movie, Ridley's eyes change back and forth. Wrong!<br /><br />-Larkin makes his appearance at the family dinner by revealing a snake as his arm in the book. He is also a Dark Caster. In the movie, he just walks in like an everyday Joe.<br /><br />-Abraham Ravenwood is also not mentioned ONE time in the movie. He is the brains behind Sarafine.He is also present when Lena kills her mother.<br />Which brings me to my big rant of the movie...Lena pulls the moon out of time. Yes, that is shown on her sixteenth birthday. However, on this birthday in the book, Abraham shows up with Sarafine trying to get the Book of Moons. This doesn't go according to plan and Lena ends up burning her mother to death. (Now I may possibly be mixing up my books here, but either way what happens in the movie is not even close to what happens in the book.) Abraham shrugs it off and disappears until a later time. She doesn't kill her on her own by throwing her spirit against a wall. And another thing! Sarafine actually shows herself in the book. Link and Ethan are both present at this show down because Link finally finds out that his mother's body has been serving as a host for Sarafine. When they are confined to two trees, Sarafine peels away the skin of Link's mother and he is there to witness it. The only time you see Sarafine in the movie is when her spirit is cast out of Mrs. Lincoln.<br /><br />-We also never see the greats and Uncle Abner loves his Wild Turkey whiskey...not just Amma's pie. When Amma and Macon meet up in the swamp, Amma calls on the Greats and in the book, they appear and they are described as being huge! They don't even exist in the movie..<br /><br />-Lena runs away with Ridley and John Breed in a later book to keep herself from hurting Ethan. The cast that is put on him to make him forget is only put on him to block out the memory of him being stabbed to death by Sarafine. He never forgets that he ever met her.<br /><br />-He and Link never go to New York.<br /><br />-The Lunae Libri is a dark place underground that is led by a path of torches. It is not some fancy stepping stone led path.<br /><br />-The Kelting! Where on Earth is the Kelting?! That is how Lena and Ethan communicate when they aren't together...also a staple aspect in the books!<br /><br />-In the end of the movie, Lena displays one Goldeye and one, what appears to be, brown eye. In the books, her Light eye is a very vibrant and shining green color, not a dark, nearly brown color.<br /><br />I'm sure I am missing some other very big parts but I was very disappointed by this movie. It reminds me a lot of the Twilight series. It left out some very vital parts. Should there be more movies (which I seriously doubt considering they ran multiple points from other books into this one movie but then again, there's a lot left to cover) I hope they mirror the Twilight series and get better with each movie. Who knows?
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was so good. I can't wait to watch the movie! Awesome! I highly recommend it! Thank you Nicholas Sparks for another awesome story!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was great just like the rest of the series. Seriously recommend reading them. They aren't just for teens
B00006ZXSK|5.0|What can I say? I love this movie and the price was amazing! I ama sucker for period pieces and this movie delivers! It is very entertaining and a must have for my video collection!
B001P5M7QE|5.0|I'm not going to try to compete with all the other wonderful reviews. I just want amazon to know I LOVE this movie so that they can effectively suggest other movies for me.
B004SBX112|5.0|I am extremly addicted!  Best game ever!  Don't let &#34;Seasons&#34; keep you from getting this game! All Angry Birds games are very entertaining and challenging regardless of the theme! I highly recommend this game to anyone, all ages!
078322737X|5.0|Great music from my past, enjoyed the movie also. Those were the good old days.Funny to see some of the actors as uyoung kids.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I am extremly addicted!  Best game ever!  Very entertaining and challenging! I highky recommend this game to anyone, all ages!
B000I3UAJ0|5.0|This movie was the oasis in the '70s.  We did not have any Star Trek in the '70s, except the cartoons, and though this movie is a bit slow and it is not close to the greatness of Star Trek 2, it is an epic motion picture!!!!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|The first time I saw this movie I thought it was boring but had not seen it from beginning to end. I love period movies so it kept my curiosity up and I watched it again, and again, and again because I could not get enough of it. Sometimes first impressions are not correct!  I love to watch Kiera Knightly in just about anything and also became a fan of another great actor, Matthew McFayden whose voice is absolutly mesmerizing. His charachter in this movie is, at first, unlikable but you see the chemisty between him and Knightly develop and then all is forgiven. This is a beautiful love story set in the day when a woman's main mission is to find a husband at all costs and a time when husbands were chosen for daughters. In this movie 5 daughters were raised to be free thinkers and were able to choose the husband of their choice but if a suitor were to come along and proposed but was rejected by one of the girls, then the mother was beside herself. Knightly's charachter is ver strong and will not settle for just anyone and wants her heart to be the judge and jury when it comes to a husband,  A beautiful love story and highky recommended!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Was very disappointed In this book and the ending.  Took me about 2  days to read it.  She left to many unknowns and now to wait for the next book. Not impressed
B00280LYIM|5.0|I liked everything<br />I would recommend it to my friends because this is an awesome book<br />can't wait to read more
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Written through the eyes of the dog, it is a great story. I couldn't put it down. Great for animal lovers!
B009JZTP4Y|5.0|Considering it was the first in a series of films to modernize and yet exemplify the tradition of the original series, it fits, period to what Gene Roddenberry had intended. I love all of the original series players as they are the only ones that are meaningful to me. The others are just clones, copies and don't present anything as original and true to form as these characters.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Another great story... I cannot wait to see the TV movie! I recommend you read this book as soon as you can.
B001XV3LSS|5.0|I love Jodi Foster's acting and the role she palys in all of her movies. She is in the moment and displays the passion of the character perfectly. Great effects without going over the top. Excellent screen play, concept and logic. I will buy this film and there's not many that fall into this class. GReat SciFi can be watched over adn over again since its entertaining in perpetuity. I would rate this as high as &#34;The Thing&#34; starring Kurt Russell, Alien, and Blade Runner.
B008133MDK|5.0|Sherlock is a great show that is always entertaining! Each story is witty and well acted. I can't wait for season three.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|The action is almost non-stop with a good stor yline and just enough humor.  Ties in well with the previously released Star Trek movies.
B000I9YWDO|3.0|The movie was OK and had a few funny points, it could have waiting until it came out on watch for free.
6305678715|5.0|Ordered the movie and it was just what I thought it was it was packaged very well and the quality was excellent. Would highly recommend this shipper.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I was so exited to read this book I waited for it for months can't believe the author just didn't continued on to a writing a better ending. I am beyond disappointed and mad at how it ends and really want another book to be on the works!!!<br /><br />So to the readers of the the crossfire novel Entwined with you, this is a good book but be ready to be disappointed with the end of the novel!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I still enjoy watching Prometheus for it's visual impact, but it is miscast.  The space crew is excellent, but the 'boyfriend' is more of a boy-toy than a scientist, as well as the weird archaeologist with the stupid tats.  Hopefully P2 will be deeper.
1416914285|4.0|When I originally heard of this series, I didn't pay any mind to it. It wasn't until I started to see movie trailers that I decided I wanted to read it. I was extremely captivated and intrigued by the story and can't wait for the next book to arrive and for the first movie to come out! I just saw a more in-depth trailer for it when I went to see The Purge and I think it's going to be a really good adaptation with great cast selections. I do have my issues with it, however. I didn't understand why Clary seemed to be so incredibly close-minded and dumb about what was happening around her and how fiercely she defended her mother when she never knew anything about her mother's life before she was born. That really bugged me until she finally saw the light and realized that her mother had a whole other existence that she too was going to be a part of. The twist that was thrown in when Valentine, Jace, and Clary had their discussion was a surprise and that's the biggest reason I can't wait to see what happens in the next book. And also to find out what happens to her mother and how their relationship is going to change after this.
B00003CXC7|5.0|One of the most interesting movies i have seen. All takes place in a small area. I have wathced it more than once but the ending im gripping my arm rests each time.
B001PPLJJ0|5.0|I'd seen this movie many times before purchasing it here and it never fails to captivate me. I do like the book better because it explains a little more about what exactly Hanna was on trial for, but I guess because I saw the movie first and I like the actors in it, and it was a very good production, I have a place in my heart for it too. There is so much about World War II that is so amazingly horrible and inexplicable and this movie doesn't fail to represent one more tale that makes you think. I can't understand Hanna's choice to go to jail rather than explain that she couldn't read or write. I get that she didn't want to be ridiculed for being a middle-aged woman that didn't have those basics of education but I can't understand why it took her so long to finally decide to learn on her own. She was a determined woman and a hard worker, so why didn't she teach herself much earlier in life or seek someone to help her learn? She had to realize that she could have had more opportunities if she did - just like what she was offered at her bus job. She also had to realize that the reason that she didn't learn were likely (as it wasn't discussed in the book or the movie) not her fault so why should she ever let anyone make her feel like she's less of a person for her educational misgivings? There are more issues that I could discuss but I won't go on and on here. In summation, VERY good book and VERY good movie. Great choices for the actors, great screen adaptation. I have and will always be able to watch it over and over again.
0446571415|5.0|David Baldacci is a excellant writer. This series of the camel club is one of the best. If you start to read this series read them in order.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is a fun an challenging game to play.  If you like lots of challenges to play.  Then this is the game for you.
0783240236|5.0|One of the best early fiction films ever made. It does make you wonder if it possible? I watch it over and over.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I bought this charger to charge an iPhone, nexus 7 and various bluetooth devices as I moved (drove) our family across the country. The iPhone and nexus charged very quickly as I had expected due to the full power output this little thing offers for each of the two platforms. The two sets of Bluetooth headphones I was also able to keep charged. In all this is an impressive little car charger and a must have for users of both apple and android products.
B000000OU0|5.0|How in 20 words do you put how great this music is from the Eagles. Im sure some people dont like this music but i cannot understand why. Its my generation. Rap dont cut it.
B001F290E4|5.0|HAD TO REPLACE MY ORIGINAL.  SOMEONE LIKED IT AS MUCH AS I DID.  GREAT PRICE. GREAT SOUND. NEXT PURCHASE IS SOUL 2
0679805273|5.0|I bought it for my 8 month old grandson.  I hope it will encourage his love of books and reading.  I loved the book.
B00BIVN82M|2.0|Not as good as his other cd's. Sings duets on here with movies stars who cant sing and are better off acting! Buble is good enough to stand on his own and doesn't need duets with non singers. Unhappy with this CD
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It's not the same as on the computer. But, it'll do in a pinch. I'm not really that fond of it!
B006O66EFE|5.0|This product is a great product and I really loved it.  Think Jason Boerne but in the mold of a girl....
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|In love with Gideon and Eva.... the story had my heart beating real fast! Could not put the book down... I can't believe there's a next one I can't wait!!!!
B0088WGBC8|3.0|if not for denzel and other guy this movie would never be watched...type plot and typical ending... it's not boring, but underwhelming

B0083GOPSG|3.0|I'm not sure how this movie showed up in my que..maybe some other family member watched this...I have no idea...lol
B00BLSJI80|5.0|Amazing songs. Amazing singer! Love her and this album! Ever song! My favorite song had hot to be Really Don't Care with Cher L!! Loved it! Especially when I saw the two perform it at Kiss Concert '13!
B007BLEKPM|1.0|I didn't like the movie due to the fact that is was way too long and super boring with way way too much focus on his choice of sexuality....
B003YL4LYI|5.0|So good! I can't wait for the next one! Why is there a required word count for a review?... chocolate.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|I love Michael Connelly's characters  He paints Harry Bosch with a real brush--flawed, persistent, human.  After reading his descriptions of the streets in the LA area, I can almost drive them myself even though I live in the Midwest.  Harry never disappoints.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|WAKING Up Married by Mira Kelly was a delicious escape for my delicious escape!  Great beach vacation read. Enjoyed the characters very much.
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|I liked the book but found it a bit tedious in parts.  I would recommend it, especially to those who were born after WWII.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|A very good battery app! This app is a must on your device! It tells me what my battery percentage is, how much time I would have using WiFi, and how much time I would have reading, all in a swipe down!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Was looking forward to this book but again it turned out to be another greedy author who must drag on the series.  Enough already - did Sylvia Day write the Crossfire series for us readers who can't wait to find out what happens or to continue on and on to get folks to buy book after book to find out what happens. Will not buy another Sylvia Day book.  So many other authors to choose from that write complete novels or let you know from the beginning that it's a trilogy.  Very disappointed!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love the big keys. Have trouble seeing and this calculator is the perfect fit!!!!!<br />Thanks for being free. Would recommend this to everyone!!!

B00BSBVLF8|4.0|The usual Cirque &#34;otherworldly&#34; experience. Great acrobatics and sumptuous costuming. A feast for the eyes. The musical score was fun and surprising at times.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|Loving what it does. It's definitely worth it and every time I use it it makes me happy I downloaded it.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Walter is a trip!  John Noble is a fine actor. The entire cast is really doing a fine job.<br /><br />Keep it coming.
B00957T6X6|4.0|Although I have enjoyed the books ,and I would not want the story to end in a haphazard manner , I feel it is being  dragged out.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|I would give this no stars if I could. App rarely ever works properly. Just keep getting loading message but videos never appear.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|I love these books. They are a quick read and entertaining. I recommend her to any fans of this genre.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|What a great movie.  A little hard to follow at first but everything comes together by the end.  I will watch it again just to catch up on what I missed the first time around.  Recommend highly.
B00BEXB18M|1.0|It's so easy to come to this conclusion. I haven't even heard this album or even 13, but keeping a steady ear to everything they did, right up to the first single's off 13 and Supercollider, yes it's easy to hear that they turned into a crap act ages ago. Their last brilliant album was Countdown to Extinction and the last album with ANY good tunes on it was actually the maligned Risk. But Risk was better than anything that came after.<br /><br />People are off the mark for saying THIS album was the worst for Megadeth simply because it doesn't thrash around or whatever. Playing thrash riffs do not make a good album and did no good for their music on anything the past decade. The one good thing about Megadeth is that Dave is more accurate about the state of American affairs than roughly 80% of Americans.<br /><br />The inevitable automatic one star from Amazon I support for their cover of Cold Sweat by Thin Lizzy, great choice of song if nothing else! Kudos for that much!
B000I3SYEI|5.0|this is hands down the best of the original Star Trek movies made!! Although I enjoy the latest movies depicting the familiar characters in their younger years and think the actors do an exceptional job portraying the orginal stars, it's still good to see the old gang again. Good, good movie!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I think these games by teamlava is awesome I wish they would make it for the computers love it, love it, love it play it all the time, I love the challenges.
B00B5A9FLY|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I am as big of a Merlin fan as anyone out there. I loved the first three seasons, the character development, humor and plots were all top drawer. Then came Season Four:  Katie McGrath's transformation into dark Morgana was a bit unconvincing, then  we had the inevitable loss of Uther, admittedly needed for Arthur to become the king he needs to be.<br /><br />Then came Season Five... I realize the Merlin takes a lot of artistic license with the Arthur legend, but: 1.  Camelot is barely touched upon. 2. The romance between Lancelot and Guinevere is barely even depicted, then Lancelot, Arthur's greatest knight, dies before he and Guinevere are even unfaithful.  3. No build-up of Excalibur as the sword of kings, it's not even talked about. 4. No search for the Holy Grail, or Galahad, for that matter. 5. No romance whatsoever between Arthur and Guinevere after all that build up for the first three seasons. A personal gripe is that Arthur never even becomes noble, he's still giving Merlin crap while he lays dying about not telling him he was a sorcerer even though it is obvious by this point that Merlin has saved him many times over.<br /><br />I realize that the producers got told in December that they had to wrap things up quickly, but come on, its like there is a whole season, or two missing! This show does not exactly give one closure, which is a pity because it had so many original ideas in it at one point. I get the feeling that the creators had a different plan to end the show before this rushed one was put in the works. Perhaps one day we'll be allowed to see how they originally planned to marry the modern Merlin/Smallville elements with the more traditional Arthur mythos someday, but this ending leaves one feeling a bit cheated.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|This is a book about children killing other children for entertainment. How can anyone of good conscious read this!? I had to stop because I felt so sick to my stomch the whole time! Given it is written well but can the author think of something less screwed up to write about? And to think kids read this stuff! What is wrong with you people!?
B0085YOD1A|4.0|Nothing special. Very small app. Could use more features but for free app of the day no complaints. Cheeky use if the android battery use.
B001NA6096|5.0|I was really happy with this film. The chemistry between the two main characters are fantastic.  You get caught up in their conversation and before you know it the credits are rolling. Highly recommend this one!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is a great game for the kids.  The graphics are beautiful and I love the way they give the names of the plants and animals.

0446580848|3.0|I have always been a fan of Nelson de Mille's books, John Corey in particular. I have read in some of the reviews that I am not the only reader with this opinion regarding this book. Not enough story line, too much like The Lion - moved! Over inflated with cynical supposedly funny remarks - a fellow reviewer wrote \\"smart aleck\\" - I agree, in fact before I composed the review I had already written part of it in my head even before I finished the book, which I read on my Kindle.<br />Sorry Mr. de Mille - you can definitely can do better[[ASIN:B0076DCT2G The Panther (John Corey)]]
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This app is very helpful.  It has helped me out several times when my phone was overheating. I never would have known without this app.
B00CRYON2S|5.0|I watched all the shows from the beginning two weeks ago, after sparking an interest from a couple of episodes in syndication. Nathan Fillion's cute quirks to the great song choices in the background make the show so great. Every episode keeps the audiences' attention, which is hard to do now a days. I love Castle and Beckett's relationship in the fifth season.
B002W1UEW4|1.0|Plotless, characterless, all mayhem, all the time. Boring. I don't know who would like this. Made for 17 year old boys, but no sex, only violence. Just stupid.
B00D2K40WY|1.0|I like it! It's like I'm in a actual spa. It's fun and if you like to give people makeovers this is a good app for you. I'd give this app if I had a scale 1-100 I would give it a 98!!!!!(:
B0085YOD1A|2.0|On the kindle it already says the amount of charge  it has !!!!the only thing different about this is that it says how long u have to stay on it this thing is not app great . BOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is an awesome app.I would recommend this to anyone who likes hidden object games.There is very few adds.Its great.
8866134627|2.0|The Moleskine Professional Notebook, like the Folio series, differs from the so-called Moleskine classic series insofar as the type of paper used. The professional and folio notebooks appear to use a different type of paper than is used in the regular notebooks. The paper in this notebook appears glossy and doesn't accept rollerball ink, including the ink used in Moleskine's own rollerball pen with its \\"specially designed ink\\". Secondly, the paper feels flimsy with some bleed through, again using the Moleskine rollerball pen as well as the Kaweco classic rollerball. The overall construction of the notebook, at least this particular one that I have, is also shoddy. The concept of the professional notebook is attractive, but I will go back to the regular series, or switch to the Leucchturm notebooks.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Great Series! Wish they would bring it back - it was a wonderful story line - now what? Please, bring it back!
B008BU75IQ|4.0|Another two books to go? This is a good easy page turning read. I think there are a couple of un necessary side lines but it does allow for the usual cliff-hanging, cant-wait-for-the-next-one-to-see-how-this-turns-out, ending.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I love the characters, the dynamics are captivating and the love interests are lots of fun!!  Can't wait for season 2 to go prime!
B0000CFW87|4.0|I could listen to Josh Brogan all day long-so relaxing and such a pleasing voice.<br />It is a welcome addition to my repetoire
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|Though I was able to figure out the scheme before it happened, it was still entertaining.  Personally I believe more attention need be paid to our &#34;pill happy&#34; society!!
B0058A119G|3.0|I am a fan of both Ms. Streisand and the Bergman's, so was kind of disappointed with this particular album. Perhaps I expected too much.  Although it is enjoyable, it really isn't as special as it could have been.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Great time killer, love the Arcade timed mode and the change of pace Mineral mode. Lots of levels to start over after you finish
B0064MPXFA|5.0|We started watching the show in season three, so wanted to catch up with seasons one and two.  We are 15 episodes into season one and enjoying it tremendously.  The characters have evolved nicely and we hope the series continues for a few more years.
B00C7KXUOE|4.0|First off, I can't believe that this show is aired on NBC, as it has more of a FX, AMC type feel to it.  Secondly, both the acting and the cinematography are superb (especially Mads Mikkelson, he pulls off a posh, arrogant, charming, psychopath killer better than anyone else I have ever seen try).  Finally, the show is actually creepy, something I haven't seen on television since the first season of AHS.<br /><br />The first few episodes are a bit slow, and the gruesome deaths that start every show are a bit formulaic now, hence the 4 instead of 5 stars. However, I highly recommend this show and there is nothing else like it on broadcast tv.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|Great court room drama.  Matthew McConaughey  plays an excellent role.  This is one movie I may watch more than once.
B00BLCHZC2|3.0|Vikings  is an interesting show, and the acting and scenery are all nice: the problem is, I have seen this routine so many times that by the 9th episode (all of which I paid for) I still haven't watched.  If you are looking for an &#34;easy&#34; to watch action series, this is better than a lot I have seen, I just wanted something a bit more.
B008Y768XO|4.0|A wonderful story about a man and his dog.  It follows them both as they progress in age.  I highly recommend it for dog lovers of all sorts.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|It works great. I haven't seen it drain my battery, and hey, it's free! Plus you can adjust the colors and such, also the brightness of the color, it comes in handy.
1781162646|4.0|Like Stephen King's previous effort for Hard Case Crime, THE COLORADO KID, JOYLAND is an oddity.  It's not a horror novel...it's not noir...it's not even really a mystery, or a coming-of-age story, or a thriller...and yet, it somehow manages to be all of these things in one.  The plot is like Bradbury by way of, well, Stephen King: Devin Jones, twenty-one, is taking a summer job in North Carolina, working at Joyland amusement park.  He's slowly realizing that his first true love is stepping out on him, and that life isn't all rainbows and butterflies.  As Dev immerses himself in his new job, he and two new friends begin to uncover secrets from Joyland's past, involving a murdered girl and a haunted ride...and of course, there's that beautiful dame and her handicapped son catching Dev's eye as well.  Just like the psychic predicted on the day he applied.<br /><br />JOYLAND isn't King as his finest; like KID, it's King cruising, going over familiar territory.  Which isn't to say you shouldn't try it; there are four stars up there for a reason.  The book picks up as it goes along, and though most everything other than Dev's reawakening takes a back seat--this novel is best described as a character study with a few genre elements--the prose is still gripping and...almost delightful.  I'm still not sure how this novel fits under Hard Case's imprint (same could be said for KID), but hey, it's a Stephen King novel, and we'll take 'em when we can get 'em.  Maybe he'll channel Richard Bachman one more time and give Hard Case something a little more fitting; in the meantime, this is basically King-lite, which even though it lacks the full flavor of the original, still goes down smooth on a warm summer's day.
193700788X|3.0|As the series finally bumps off the road, into a ditch, and skids to a stop, I can finally put away Sookie and stop obsessing over Team Eric/Team Bill/Team Sam.  I started this series to replace Harry Potter and continued reading past the tenth book turning a blind eye to plot holes and day-to-day- fluff she had Sookie doing to fill pages.  But I'm not a quitter, and to quote Liz Lemon, &#34;I'm still watching Smash.&#34;<br />The passion, the drama, it all just fizzled down like a cheap July 4th sparkler.  I didn't care who was out to get Sookie, I didn't care what happened to Eric or Bill or Alcide. I just needed the closure.<br />By the end, I left feeling like I just ate an Easter Peep.  Not satisfied, and looking for the chocolate at the bottom of the basket.<br />Get this book if you need the closure.  (Or wait for a library copy to be available)
B0050DZN4K|4.0|Easy to check up on my favorite blots from Kindle Fire rather than hooting up the main computer.  I found basic \\"how to's \\" by searching the net.  To better organize, etc I do need to be on my Pc rather than the Kindle.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|This book held my interest but the writing tended to be cliche at times and the ending felt rushed. Good \\"beach read\\" kind of book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I honestly love the game I just want to know when 0.7.0 comes out for kindle fire I mean seriously its bothering me so much and it was supposed to come out yesterday.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|If you are looking for a page turning, absolutely fall in love with the lead characters type of book. Its one is it. I can honestly say I've never been so emotional at a single book in my entire life. LOVED IT!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like my horse I think it is worth 4staglre it is a fun game to play if you are ever bored
B009OYSFDM|4.0|Nice series to watch . A lot of fun to pass time... Streams clear on a roku box.. The price is ok too
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Just bought a 3D tv. Avatar is just the perfect movie. Almost as good as in the theateres.<br />Excellent.....Glad I chose this movie.
B0033AI4PM|4.0|Visually, this Blu ray  really pops, but the audio is quite disappointing. No audio options to enhance the viewing experience.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It is a great book I have read the whole Percy Jackson series and all the books to the Heroes of Olympus
B00CKJ2KK2|3.0|Pls add offline mode and I keep getting disconnected despite stable Wi-Fi also when I connected to Facebook for the first time I lost all my progress on the game which I think is unfair I also had to use my Facebook name instead of the username I had before which I also didn't like. Other than that the game is great.
B0058EBNAO|4.0|Love all the cool widgets in this app.  Would have given it 5 stars, but it will not give current conditions in my area. In addition, the last update made the radar even more difficult to read.  As a Blackberry user, I'm familiar with BeWeather &amp; will be switching to that.
1117994112|1.0|This book is an excellent quality paperback, and the print is large, which is wonderful when reading a foreign language.  Unfortunately, the description did not say this is only Part 1, Fantine!  I thought I would be getting the whole book. So I'm pleased with the quality, but I only received one fifth of the story I thought I was buying.  Quelle dommage!
B009NY43NY|2.0|Big let down for the final book in this series. It was if she just wanted to be done with it no matter what. Very disappointed.
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|This is absolutely the best worship DVD I have ever experienced and to have the bonus CD is awesome! You can take the CD for the car and leave the DVD in the house!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I've recently ditched the old alarm clock and rely more on this app to get me up in time. The fact that I can dim it with just a quick swipe makes it really easy to use. In fact, everything about the app is easy to use. For only 99 cents, you really can't beat it. Plus it has some pretty cool displays. I highly recommend it!
B0047SIXGE|5.0|One of my all time favorites.<br />You either love it or you hate it.<br />Classic Coppola<br />No other Vietnam movie comes close
0525478817|5.0|What a fantastic book for teenagers and parents alike! My grandaughter asked me to read this book and I am so glad that I did, that I even passed it on to my mother who is 84 to read. Excellent. Makes you think and discuss the topic!
B002V6RB1C|5.0|great movie with a lot of big stars in various roles....definitely shows the will to push on in any environment.
B00C061I3K|2.0|Very very underwhelming.  I haven't even had the desire to listen to this hot mess again after the third listen.  I have never been a fan of albums where a band has tons of guest musicians.  It waters down the brand.  I don't buy a daft punk album to hear J. casablancas and Paul Williams!  Not to mention two different drummers and bass players.  I get the feeling that some songs are just extended drum solos.  I'm not a Strokes fan so when you force me to listen to Casablancas singing you're never gonna win that battle.  I can't believe this is the best they could do in 8 years!  The Tron Soundtrack is leaps and bounds better than this cheap proto disco drivel.  It's so pedestrian that I'm amazed with the scores it has received by the press.  It's all just hype!  Some reviewer named it the best dance album of the decade! really?  I'm going to have to think twice before I get the next daft punk album in 2019.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I wasn't expecting too much, but wife was out of town. . . .  I've stopped reading the Reacher books because they became gratuitously violent, mindless, and repetitive/predictable.  In addition, there are very few of Cruise's movies I've seen that I felt were up to his abilities.  Surprisingly this one was one of the top.  The character wasn't over played as it is in the books.  The script and direction kept the movie moving along and me interested.  I'd watch another except the word in the press is that there may not be another.  Oh, well.
B0057R5G6E|5.0|Other evaluations posted here about these movies are right.  I tested it in our Sony Muteki audio system, and it really delivers.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|Awesome humor and action. Great soundtrack. We've added this movie to our list of parents' favorite kids movies. Oh, and there's a ton of quotable content for the whole family. Who doesn't like a zombie who gives self help advice?
B000N2HCKQ|5.0|The author's put together an interesting framework to understand how ideas are made to be \\"sticky\\". Good enough that after borrowing it from the library I am considering adding it to my personal library. Definitely a book that I would like to reference in the future.
B00005ASGG|5.0|You take one John Wayne, add some Jimmy Stewart, Vera Miles, with a heaping helping of Lee Marvin, Woody Strode and a generous portion of some good, ole Andy Devine and what you get is a truly classic American western with all the guns-a-blazin' action you could ever hope to get.  Well.... 'pardner'.... what are you waitin' fer?
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I usually only review on Goodreads but I had to review this one with Amazon as well.  This book was really and I really enjoyed it.  I think you get to know Gideon better in this book.  I understand the disappointment that this was originally publicized as being a 3 part series but the actual book was good.  There is not huge cliffhanger and there is lots of hot Gideon Cross sex and who doesn't like that.  If you've read the previous two then this one is a must read.  I hope the next book doesn't take as long to come out but I really think those concerns should be posed to the author and not by giving negative reviews to a good book.  If you love Gideon Cross and can't get enough you'll love this book.  Don't let the negative reviews keep you from reading this book.
0061950726|5.0|I enjoyed how the 2 main characters' similar backgrounds contributed to the story. I had heard about the orphan trains some years ago, but this story really humanized a part of history that many people are just starting to be aware of. I am interested in reading more by Ms. Kline.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|Great app, works impeccably! Control of your PC is flawless and it's like having your Windows PC in your phone. Highly recommended.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Very much like some of his other works but a very moving and good story, it makes you really want the good guys/girls to win.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|The Good Wife is best show on Television due to its writing and the outstanding acting of all their performers.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I've had this app for a few days now. Seems to work fine. I like knowing quickly how much battery life I have.
B0042UFWES|5.0|I really loved this album. I just  wish  he lived a little  longer.  he  would of  loved today  music love it
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|An outstanding story of tenacity, redemption, healing and love,<br />with interesting, believable characters,<br />a revealing insight of life at its worst and its best.<br />Highly recommended.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Use this almost every night to relax and fall asleep. Although some of the sounds are similar their is a lot to choose from. Definitely recommend.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|This album is great. Not a single song is a dud. The album will get stuck in your brain. It might even drive you mad. This is exactly what an album should do.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|It is fun the full version is cheap for a full version its fun im trying to get the full version but i cant find out what my pass is it is a good app u should get it
B004X4R3FE|5.0|What a profile on courage. A must see for everyone. You will have to overlook one profane word in one scene but it Is integral to the story.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is wonderful to have so many translations of the Bible in one app! I have this on my iPhone, iPad, Kindle, & PC. Perfect for Bible Study because it allows you to compare the same text in different versions, allows you to read & study during those little bits of time at the doctors office or while stuck in traffic, and is marvelously convenient to have with you wherever you go! Most translations are downloadable so you still have access offline. Some have audio when on wiifii so you can listen while you work or drive. I also love the many languages that are available so I can share Gods Word with my friends!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This was an absolutely amazing book. The way Chris wrote this book gives the readers a true feel of went on for him and so many other soldiers in the war. Reading some of stories he recounted, I could just feel the hairs stand up on the back of my neck as if I had actually been there. Just thinking about all that his family went through while he was away with the SEALs, and now loosing him here, the USA, the last place anyone would expect a guy with such a deep love for this country. I pray that his family continues to feel Gods love and know that one day they too will be in paradise with him and our Lord, Jesus Christ.
B005544V6A|5.0|Great show! The storyline and characters were interesting and funny. I only wish season 2 was included in the prime membership.
0891419063|5.0|written from the heart and soul. painful to read, but SO well done you can see the actions in your mind's eye as you follow.<br />highly recommended
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Movies are not made like this anymore, enjoy watching my kids watching the movie and singing along to beautiful songs like &#34;Few of my favorite things.&#34;<br /><br />There is a music machine option on the extras feature that plays all the songs from the movie-realy enjoy it.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|my six year old is learning to spell with this game, and my husband and I get a kick out of it too.  Very creative.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked these books. They are not just a weekend read, though hardly more complicated than one. Sylvia doesnt just put two mangled hearts together and let them do the -ahem- \\"talking\\". There is real reason for each of their neuroses and I had a real understanding and compassion for them.<br /><br /> I didn't want to put it down, and I felt riveted the whole time; even though it was deliciously more of the same \\"Bared to You\\" emotions and confusion. A little more desperate I might say. Definitely worth finishing the series.
B008602KQI|5.0|I will be the first to say if a movie based on a book falls short of its literary inspiration, but that is not the case with Hunger Games. It is a 4-star book and the movie is 4 stars as well. I gave it 5 stars because I LOVE Jennifer Lawrence. She is one of the VERY few of the \\"elite' in Hollywood who I wouldn't mind inviting over my house for dinner. Most of the vapid, self-possessed elitists that come from Hollywood would have me vomiting and running to get away, but not Ms. Lawrence. She is fabulous!
B009KKLQVS|3.0|Great sound but obviously lip synced. I was pretty disappointed with that. If they are too old to perform than why even bother? I love the BBs but they should stay retired if they have to fake it in a live performance.
B005LAII08|5.0|One of the most entertaining animated dvds out there for young and old. i can usually watch only about an hour at a time of 3D, but with this one, I watched the whole movie...just took a break to make some popcorn.
0375842209|5.0|The prose of Zusak nears poetry throughout The Book Thief. His gentle personification of death leads to an unusual narrator's vantage point which whirls with delicious descriptions of people and events during the rise of Hitler's Germany.
B004FP1WX0|4.0|I wasn't expecting much from these first-time filmmakers, but Catfish was a nice surprise.<br /><br />This is an entertaining film worth watching.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|My last cable fell apart.  The coating on the wires just got old, brittle and of no use.  I was scared to use it in that condition.  The new one seems to be a better quality.  Time will tell.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This show is well written and well acted.  It is also great to be able to watch it commercial free on amazon prime!!!  Who needs cable or a dvr!!!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This is a continuation of the song of ice and fire and because of that it can not be read without reading the first five books. This is a wonderful series because it is; well thought out with richly developed characters, realistic reactions from these characters, no real good or bad characters when viewed in perspective.
B006Y5H74W|4.0|I love the singing and dancing. It is highly entertaining and well done...always keep you guessing what will happen next.
B003ASLJK4|3.0|I really love the movie, but am disappointed that it skipped quite a few times.. I was not sure if I could return it?.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I have already written a review about the first book and this one is equally amazing! I have read this book before and I will most likely read it again:)
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Perfect! You should add other games like &quot;little inferno&trade;&quot; etc. Great game. I prefer to have it on a computer too.
0066620996|3.0|I'm going to play devil's advocate on this book review. I felt like the book did have some merit because it does highlight key features that HELPED with making these selected companies make the change from Good to Great. But I felt like the companies & their respective CEO's that were highlighted in the book were chosen because they fit a certain criteria that fit the mold they they are trying to portray. Things like the CEO's were brought up from within the company & how these companies had been so static for so long until hitting their stride. Sometimes that stride comes with a market expansion in the sector that the company had nothing to do with, that they just happen to take advantage of. I do like the idea of someone being brought up in a company because they have a very precise knowledge of the company before they see the company from the outside. But sometimes, that can hinder a company. I worked at a company that was ran by family that was brought up in the business, and once their father passed, the company remained completely static because there were no development of new ideas. They had the mentality of \\"We've been doing it like this for 50 years, we aren't changing it\\". This really hurt the company. That, as well as the self-entitled know-it-all attitude, that comes from someone who was brought up in a company. I feel like the best ideas come from someone on the outside looking in.<br /><br />I feel like the book is written in a way that anyone can understand what Jim and his team is trying to say. But the book leaves you scratching your head how a book can be written based on such simple concepts that are second nature to anyone with half a brain. The idea that you need to have the right people getting on the bus & taking their correct seats is a concept in the book that screams DUH! No company is going to put someone in the wrong, or unqualified position. But beyond that it talks about getting the \\"RIGHT\\" people on board. This kind of portrays a model of a CEO with an egotistical \\"My way or the Highway\\" attitude. That the right people are the ones that are going to think the same way the CEO does & jump on board heading in the same direction that the CEO has laid out. In reality you need PERSONALITY in a business, where new ideas can be brought to the table to shift the momentum in directions that allow for an inventive mentality. This is how great ideas are discovered. This leads to two concepts that are brought up in the book, the Hedgehog & Flywheel concepts. They basically say, stay focused & grind away in one direction and eventually you will make it. This could really lead a company, with blinders on, right off a cliff. Having this mentality drives 90% of companies right out of business, or leaves them static for too long. Long enough to where even the CEO loses faith.<br /><br />I felt it odd that some of these \\"great\\" companies face planted after they made it. I do give credit for the book laying out the simplistic ideas of how these companies made it to the top. This book has some basic concepts that would be great for someone who has no idea how to run a semi-successful business. But to say that these are guidelines is misleading. Different types of business & different markets require different strategies. Especially with this huge technology push. These set-in-stone business concepts get brushed right off the table for new concepts that come along for the new decade. It's constantly changing, as it should. I feel like if a company wants to make the move from Good to Great, a book with age old concepts is not going to get you there.<br /><br />If you want a history lesson on a few companies success story & the business concepts, of the time, that got them there, then this is the book for you. Otherwise, you should probably read a more current book that addresses the major companies that have exploded in the last 10 years. That is where business is headed. It's no longer about a long dragged out push.It takes a novel idea, & a market need nowadays. Unless you want a run of the mill, cookie cutter business, that is just going to pay the bills.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|great app makes everything clear and simple. All the info you will ever need to know about your battery is right there and easy to understand.
B00CP2Z5TC|3.0|Ok I love VW and I'm trying to give this album a chance.  I appreciate moving on to more &#34;mature&#34; subject matter.  Frankly, talking about the existence of god (which is obviously worthless) is boring to me.  At the risk of being shallow, the best part of their music is, well, their music.  I mean the brilliant music, including the use of classical instruments and strings, which are painfully lacking on this album.  They abandoned strings in this album, which upsets me.  There are 3, maybe 4 songs here that I will ever consider listening to.  The second half of the album is total crap, in my opinion.  Come on guys, the greatness of your music is largely in the upbeat songs and ingenious use of different instruments, despite what the subject matter is.  I think Ezra has many great poetic moments, but less on this album I'm afraid.  If I'm being honest, I like 90% of the previous 2 albums more than anything on this album.  I still believe in these guys..please don't throw away the classical influence like you have...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is actually a lot of fun. It's challenging and really gets you pumped up when playing. I'm not a big gamer but I really love playing this game and if I like it I have no doubt you will to.

1451696191|5.0|It's a great book and movie. If I had the money I would pay for everyone to have the book and watch the movie. If your lazy just go watch the movie. It was directed by the author and he took his time to make sure every detail was perfect, so just watch. Then if you want more, read the book.
B0018RC7QE|4.0|Enjoyable movie with good acting from Robert De Niro and Maryl Streep/  Hard to beat those two as the main actors.  Good movie to rent on a Friday night.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft pocket edition let you play where ever you want to play. Not like Xbox and pc where your stick in a room. I would recommend this to any one who hasn't played minecraft because it gives you the basic of minecraft, and also very easy to play around with
B00455IVHU|3.0|A nice friendly movie, but fairly ridiculous plot.  A good movie to watch when you are bored, but nothing special.  I would have expected more from Barbra Streisand.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really enjoy playing the game.It is east but fun to figure out how to do the combos.My only worry is the fact it's addicting :}
B003G94BZC|5.0|Just enough vulnerability to be believable, the girl who waited is the best companion.<br />Great series. Kept me hooked. Didn't like Rory at first but he grew on me. And River Song is the best character on the show.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this site. The ideas are endless and makes me excited to get creative. These people who contribute are true artists. Perhaps one day I might have something of my own to share.

B004WOS3P4|4.0|I really like David Cook's music although some of the mixing levels on a couple songs was not good so outcome was not crisp as it should be.  While I do really like David Cook and his music I think too many songs were too similar to each other.

B003F7Y0VU|4.0|This movie was entertaining. My boys ( ages 6 and 10) really liked it. I never watched the series or cartoons so I have no frame of reference other than -if it makes the kids laugh, I'm happy.
B0068FYZ84|5.0|Explores themes of kindness to animals, allowing others to be different from you, best cast, excellent animal voices and expressions. Everything about it works.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely love this game. It can get addictive though, I just wanna play it so often. I like the fact that it travels round the world too so there is a chance to have a difference in scenery. The little extra collectable items add a nice touch as well. The only thing I would say is that, with the collectable items, it would be better not to set a time limit for them. I sometimes get about 2/3 hours per per day in a week, so I'll complete that one in a couple of days, but other weeks I only get 5/10 mins a day so I never get a chance to complete them. But all in all, the game is amazing!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ok so I love this game but for the new update my minecraft won't do it I'm really confused what should I do?
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it because I'm a super fan of scrolls and minecraft and so minecraft pocket edition was the FIRST game I got on my device. It's good for being a portable minecraft but mojang could make it take up more space for more things like; bigger world, a nether instead of a nether reactor, and food and water requirements in survival.<br />P.S. who thinks we need herobrine? I do.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|This book is one of the BEST book I have ever read, and the author, Lauren Oliver, is one of those people that I feel were BORN to write. She does a perfect job at showing the reader why Lena's society is the way it is, and why the citizens behave the way they do. She does not throw us into a world, and tell us \\"Okay, here is how things are in the future, now let's get into the book.\\" There are inserts before each chapter of nursery rhymes, quotes, and old stories about the negative effects about love and passion-it may seem impossible, but there were times where I felt...maybe I would agree with this system had I not known that it is wrong, had I not live in the world that I do now. To convince the readers to see reasoning behind what would otherwise be described as ludicrous-to think \\"Well, I suppose...\\"- is a talent, and the author is VERY talented.<br /><br />Delirium has everything an AMAZING book should have, it is:<br /><br />1.Intense: This book captures the fear locked into dystopian societies very well. To the readers, it is obvious that most societies that aim to be utopias are actually quite the opposite. This is definitely the case in Delirium. It is hard to trust ANYONE in this book, and I really like the main character, Lena, a lot because she reminds me a bit of myself. She always follows the rules and does what she is told because she is scared, scared of everything. So when she starts to see that her home, Portland, isn't what she thought it was she starts to break rules. Each time she rebels, even if it is something small, I feel as if I am right there with her screaming \\"Run!\\" \\"Don't get caught!\\" It's crazy how many heart clenching moments this book has, it will leave you on your toes. I really started to connect with the characters and found that I care for a lot of them...I also disliked a lot of them as well. -___-<br /><br />2.Frightening: I suppose this kind of connects to my first point, but this book was a lot more haunting then I thoughtit would be. In all dystopian societies, there are the majority who follow the rules but there are still a select few who do not fall in line. It is what the government does with those who don't bow down to them that is scary. Before I started getting into the book, I thought to myself \\"There's no way I am getting that operation done, no way.\\" Once I started to read what happens to those who REBEL, well let's just say I was pretty terrified. Lauren Oliver is a gifted writer and she paints beautiful portraits with her words, but just the same, she can also paint terrifying pictures, ones that seem to only exists in dreams or the darkness part of the imagination. After I would put the book away to go to bed, I find it hard to sleep because my mind keeps conjuring those terrifying images. *shivers*<br /><br />3.Romantic: I LOVE LOVE LOVE Lena and Alex's relationship-I rooted for them till the very end. I like how they have their sweet moments, but they can also talk to each other as friends and make fun of one another. Their relationship develops slowly, and there was never a moment that passed between them where I felt was \\"too cheesy\\" or \\"too unrealistic.\\" It is the kind of relationship I feel we all shrive to achieve. Oliver said that the best relationships are ones that makes us better than we would be if we were alone (something along those lines), and I feel that describes Alex and Lena's relationship to the tee.<br /><br />4. Suspenseful: I honestly do not know who I can trust in this book or what I can trust. The government and citizens are so corrupted, that it is hard to tell who is out to hurt and who is out to help Lena. There were so many times where secrets start to unravel that I had to put my kindle down because I couldn't believe what I had just read. There were a lot of \\"I didn't see that coming!\\" and \\"No, I must have read that wrong.\\"<br /><br />I don't want to include any spoilers, but I will say that:<br /><br />All in all, this book was a FAST read like one of those books I HAD TO FINISH. Not knowing what was next, was torture to me. I'm glad that I read it a little late because now all three books have finally came out. With the way Delirium ended, I KNOW that I wouldn't have the patience to wait for the sequel.<br /><br />That's how good the ending was...that's how good the book is.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Pretty cool way to pass the time. Kind of fun. I enjoy playing it because it doesn't require much thought.
B005MMJ84K|4.0|IF YOU HAVE NOT FINISHED READING DELIRIUM PLEASE DO NOT CONTINUE TO READ MY REVIEW-MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS******<br /><br />The first book, Delirium, ended as a cliff hanger. I was so heartbroken when I found out that Alex didn't make it over the fence. Lena knew that he did it on purpose. He knew that they couldn't make it together, so he sacrificed himself so she could survive. The way Oliver described the ending scene with him standing there, getting trampled by the police, was heartbroken. Lena knew she had to keep going, so his sacrifice wouldn't be in vain.<br /><br />In this book, the chapters are split between \\"then\\" and \\"now\\". Between Lena's transition from being scared and lost, to someone who is strong because of her loss. The \\"then\\" part focuses on her time in the Wilds-her trying to adjust to her new life, and forcing herself to forget about the past. Those chapters, I have to admit, were painfully hard to read. Not because they are horribly written or boring, but because they were so sad. I really like Lena, and I felt as if her pain and loss were so real and beautifully written that the words reached out and touched me. I didn't know whether or not Alex died, throughout the book I kept waiting for him to come back the way Lena did. Also, I wanted to know what happened to her family-did they get outcast because of her? What about Grace? Or her mom and Hanna?<br /><br />The \\"now\\" chapters were exciting, especially her meeting with Julian, poster child for the DFA. It is creepy how strong propaganda can be. I found myself fearing for Lena, and once again like in Delirium, wondering who I can trust. As I started to read the book, I found that many things weren't what they seem and many people aren't as clear cut as they portray themselves to be.<br /><br />I also found myself having a hard time connecting to the new characters: Raven, Tack, Julian, ect. The one character I did like dies!<br /><br />SPOILERS: DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T FINISHED THIS BOOK:<br/><br />I 100% support Alex and Lena, and although I must admit, there were times where I thought he died, I still didn't like Julian enough for me to be like \\"Okay, he's not so bad.\\" Julian is good looking from what Lena describes, and sweet, and dependable but...he wasn't Alex. He wasn't funny, sarcastic, or strong. So I was so pissed reading through all their little moments, but I liked the story so much that I couldn't just stop reading it because my favorite character, Alex, is gone. So I forced myself NOT to skim over the Julian parts. But Lauren Oliver gave me what I wanted because Alex is back! WOOHOO!! *applause *throws roses*. If he did die, I kept trying to think what would the point of his death be? To teach Lena about sacrifice? I don't know. Plus, Lena keep mentioning that Alex was dead so many times that heck, even I started to believe it. Yet, whenever she would try to move on, she would mention Alex, remember a time they had together, or something and that would draw me back in...maybe he's alive.<br /><br />SPOILERS ARE DONE :]<br /><br />I didn't like this book as much as Delirium, but hey let's face it, that book was basically perfect. It would be hard to top I know. This was a good sequel though, and once again the ending was INTENSE. Lauren Oliver knows how to keep the readers coming back for more.<br /><br />It was hard to put down because this book is really sad, there are deaths, and heartbreak, and betrayal. It shows human beings at their breaking point. There is voilence, and torture.<br /><br />Yet, I HAD to read it BECAUSE I needed things to get better. I needed some light at the end of the tunnel.<br /><br />I HAD TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT-this book was kind of an addiction :/
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|Please don't ask how, why, when or who, but this album reminds me of the following things:<br />- Stephen Wilson (the guy)<br />- Porcupine Tree (the band)<br />- Camel (the band)<br />- Mike Oldfield (the guy)<br />- The Shawshank Redemption (yes, the friggin' movie).<br /><br />Also, my favorite tracks in no particular order are:<br />Luminol<br />Drive Home<br />The Holy Drinker<br />The Pin Drop<br />The Watchmaker<br />The Raven That Refused to Sing<br /><br />Everything else on this album pretty much sucked.<br /><br />Thanks.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|WARNING: SOME SPOILERS, A LOT OF RANTING (HEHE)<br /><br />This book really fell flat. I don't know if the book itself is so bad or because its predecessors were SO GOOD that I felt that the last book was going to end in an epic manner.<br /><br />Like others have said, the ending felt really rushed and so many questions were left unanswered. But let's start from the beginning:<br /><br />1. Pandemonium ended with Lena finding out that Alex isn't dead. I was EXTREMELY happy about that. I thought no way would someone as strong as Lena end up with someone as wimpy as Julian (sorry Julian lovers), I just couldn't stand it, nope. So when Alex came back, I knew they would end up together, I just knew it. But they barely talked to one another! I know there is more to the story than Lena and Alex's relationship, but this is a book about the importance of LOVE and here is the MOST important love story! Alex and Lena could die at any moment, and it is hard for me to believe that they would spend time ignoring one another knowing that the next day isn't a guarantee.<br /><br />2. Lena's character was so different from the first two book. I felt that I could always relate or at least support Lena. In the beginning, she was basically the perfect model for Portland, a good girl who followed the rules. Too afraid to speak up, or to question her surroundings. I would be just like her if I were in her shoes. In the second book, she learns how to be strong, how to forget the past and live despite the fact that she was sad. In the last book, I didn't know what to think of her. Obviously, she still loves Alex-never stopped loving him-but she toys with Julian's feelings. She runs into his arms because she feels like he is the future, like he is the one she is supposed to be with. However, AS MUCH AS SHE WANTED TO, she couldn't convince herself that Julian was the one, and sadly, she couldn't convince me either. Aside from the love triangle, I didn't really see any character development from Lena. I know she gets stronger, but I found myself kind of annoyed with her.<br /><br />3. THE EPIC REUNION was a huge let down. The past two books, I have BEEN DESPERATELY waiting for Annabel and Lena's reunion. There were so many questions I wanted answers for, so many heartwarming moments that I looked forward to. But no, their reunion was...kind of flat. I still don't know much about Annabel, and I still don't get (how like Alex and Lena) she isn't trying to get to know her mother as much as possible. PEOPLE, PEOPLE there is a freakin rebellion going on! You don't know how many days you have left to live!! I know they are planning to attack, but how horrible would it be if Annabel were to die? And Lena wouldn't be able to tell her what she'd always wanted to? For someone who was constantly missing her mom, Lena sure isn't taking full advantage of their time together.<br /><br />4. HANA-I really liked the narration switch between Hana and Lena. First of all, I missed Hana. She was a really fun, and lively character. She gives us the perspective of life after the cure, and how it really tears all the colors right out of her. She is semi robotic, and a bit bland which is sad because she used to be so vibrant. Her confession: I kind of saw it coming. Don't ask why, I just kind of knew. That was a beezy move Hanna, *shakes head in disappointment. Also, her ending sucked. Where did she go???????<br /><br />5. Family: MORE Grace please! Like when did she finally feel comfortable enough to speak? Where is everyone else? Hello?? I need to know!<br /><br />6. Fred: What the heck happened to him? Did he make it out of the house?<br /><br />7. Cassie: Despite only one chapter on her-basically-I really liked her character. More about her would be nice, like how did she know Fred was crazy? What did she see during the explosion? Anything!<br /><br />MOST IMPORTANTLY: who did Lena choose? For me, this was quite obvious. The author kept throwing hints like freaking daggers throughout the book. Although it isn't 100% spelled out, the choice, at least to me is obvious: LENA CHOOSES ALEX. All the times when they were in the Wilds together, she notices Alex. Notices Coral leaning against him, noticing him looking at her, notices when he isn't in the group. She basically uses Julian, and messes with his feelings. She is mostly cold and rude to him, which although I don't care for Julian, I thought was really messed up. The part about King Soloman's story and how Alex left Lena because he would rather sacrifice his own happiness than her's, was very touching because he did this TWICE: when he risked it all to rescue her and make sure she got over the fence, and when he left the safety of the group because he knew that she couldn't move on with Julian if he was there. I think that was when she knew, ALEX IS THE ONE. She admitted that she could NEVER love Julian the way she loves Alex, and she WISHED she could tell him. The ending, where they end up meeting and rejoicing was also a big giveaway. Although I am TEAM ALEX I found it kind of sad how when Alex asked about Julian, Lena was like uh I hope he's safe. Like she couldn't care less.<br /><br />LASTLY, I didn't like how the author zooms out at the ending. Like instead of focusing on Lena and the people in her group, she starts to generalize talking about tearing down walls. Yes, it was beautifully written, yes it was symbolic. Not to sound heartless, but I would rather she end it on a more personal note. The conclusion left me pissed off, just like the ending of Mockingjay did.<br /><br />LAUREN OLIVER, could you at least have given me an epilogue? Maybe *fingers crossed* make this into a series instead of a trilogy? I know she said in an interview that not all stories have happy ending, but I am not even asking for that! I know the story ends with the note that the rebellion may not work, but the point is to fight-live free or die-and that is the message Oliver wanted to push. But, honestly I just want some answers! I don't want to imagine what happened to everyone, I want to know. I don't believe Lena would just grab Grace and be like, \\"Screw my family, and screw Hana!\\"<br /><br />PLEASE Lauren Oliver, if you love and care for your readers, write another book and turn this into a series. Can I get an \\"amen\\"?s throughout the book. Although it isn't 100% spelled out, the choice, at least to me is obvious: LENA CHOOSES ALEX.

B005K0HDGE|4.0|I've read many Stephen King novels and have typically found them to be a good read and this was no exception. I'm always a sucker for a good book about time travel. My only criticism is about the length: It was too long. I think that King has gotten to the point at which editors are reluctant to tell him to make needed cuts. Still I liked it a lot, and I'm not embarrassed to admit that the book had me in tears in a couple of places. Not his best but still a winner.

I also created a song mix that ended up being Zelda dungeon cave-ish and its pretty awesome.

B0051UP5NQ|4.0|Finding a writing app for 2nd gen kindle fire that actually worked right was a chore and a half.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-It writes well, keeping the italics and etc and paragraph settings.<br />-You can easily loud from cloud, including google drive, and edit documents, saving them back to the cloud.<br />-It has a word count feature, something I really hoped for<br />-It doesn't cut off any text, and the text is in a size easily read.<br />-It does basically everything I want it to<br /><br />Cons:<br />-You have to pay $4.99 for spell check, which is ridiculous. You also have to pay $4.99 for a font set. These should be default, at $14.99 for an app.<br />-You cannot save stuff from one folder to another. &#34;Save As&#34; is not an option. This is especially annoying when trying to work with cloud documents: You have to be online to save and load them, since saving them elsewhere is not an option.<br /><br />Well that's about all I have to say about it. I'm relieved I found something that worked.

B00D6BN9NK|1.0|First,<br /><br />  I was a big fan of this \\"franchise\\", hate that word, because to me it's an excuse to think of a thing as a product in a box, instant macaroni and cheese.  Which unfortunately is exactly what this has become.<br /><br />  The last one wasn't terrible and followed the \\"recipe\\" of the \\"franchise\\".<br /><br />  This one smacks of them trying to set up the new kid John McLane (sp?) JR to take over the franchise and it was a lot like they had Bruce Willis around to provide a touch point / seasoning to help loft the kid into his shoes.  Willis was there, had a goodly amount of screen time and they tried to palm it off as a \\"buddy film\\" of sorts between him and his son.  Unfortunately I found myself rooting for the bad guy to finish the kid off.....<br /><br />  Specifics;<br /><br />  - Okay, grown son, never mentioned in ANY of the previous movies<br /><br />  - Russia (who cares, really, and it didn't help that they used extra<br />  small fonts with serifs for the obnoxious sub-titling for everyone<br />  who spoke Russian.  It's in Russia, I got it, I really don't want<br />  to read sub-titles on a movie like this.  I'll save that for Truffaut,<br />  Fellini, that sort of thing.<br /><br />  - Plot... Well, there were some things in it that would I guess surprise<br />  someone who hadn't seen contrived TV plots over the last 20 some odd years.<br />  What were supposed to be great plot twists were somewhat obvious as<br />  you knew that if they didn't flip the plot, the movie would be over WAY<br />  too soon.<br /><br />  - Chase scenes through Russia...  Well, at least one truck gets hijacked<br />  in short order and mayhem ensues, guess they couldn't afford to hire<br />  Russian police to really get into the chase.<br /><br />  - Major demolition, same deal, in town and in other locations, explosions<br />  just this side of a mushroom cloud and it's treated like a normal day<br />  in downtown Moscow.<br /><br />  Lacking<br /><br />  -  Good dialogue, \\"The McLane family business is Killing bad guys....\\",<br />  that sort of thing.  Meant to be inspiring I suppose, came across as<br />  mostly trite.<br /><br />  -  All of the previous entries had Mclane interacting with at least one<br />  bad guy, verbal barbs, etc.  Really none of that.<br /><br />  -  Okay, Sr and Jr should be able to pick up some of the slack?  Nope,<br />  not that I heard anyway.<br /><br />  -  Action sequences, meh, actually boring except for some really<br />  decent explosions.<br /><br />  -  I found myself rooting for the villain's helicopter, but I think<br />  they even swapped it out for a different model later in the movie;<br />  My Heli had stub wings with missiles, last one, didn't see any of that.<br /><br />  -  Willis did seem like he was on vacation, standing around lackluster<br />  performance. (but I think a lot of that is he wasn't<br />  given all that much to work with.).<br /><br />  Predictable<br /><br />  -  Son won't call Dad, Dad, guess what happens towards the end<br />  (oops, hope I didn't spoil it.)<br /><br />  -  Daughter from previous movie brought in for all of about a minute<br /><br />  -  Family portrait against a sunset sort of thing towards the end<br />  of the movie.<br /><br />  Good news<br /><br />  I only  rented it, and not in HD, so the loss wasn't all that much.<br /><br />  Recommendation<br /><br />  Even for completists (me, for example) You'll never get this time back, go read a good book, I can<br />  recommend some.<br /><br />  Hopefully, if there's a next one, it will be better, but I'm guessing that the \\"kid\\" will try and take the<br />  spotlight (Remember Bonnie Bedalia (sp?), Willis wife? They dumped her off the truck very quickly.<br /><br />  Stick with the first few of the series, pretend like this one didn't happen.<br /><br />  I suppose on some level, if I hadn't enjoyed the other episodes as much, I wouldn't be as down on<br />  this one.  By itself, it's likely a decent enough action flick.<br /><br />  Myself, going to scrub my mind out with some Vonnegut or Ellison, maybe even destroyer - been years since I've read those.kely a decent enough action flick.<br /><br />  Myself, going to scrub my mind out with some Vonnegut or Ellison, maybe even destroyer - been years since I've read those.

B007GCY8FS|3.0|This was definitely not his best work. It wasn't a bad story but it just didn't ring as true as some of the others. There was plenty to keep me glued to my seat with the engaging story line and the fast-moving plot. However, I had plenty of beefs to mar what could've been an outstanding thriller.<br /><br />As usual, this one was filled with Mr. Child's quirks such as his bursts of extremely passive writing. Then there are his trademark \\"He said nothing\\" passages which were spread throughout the pages. At least in this one he didn't use K-turn at \\"every turn.\\" However, he repeated descriptions of the desolate scenery ad-nauseum. Over and over again. I mean, I get the point. Nebraska and Iowa are flat and squared-off. I get it. He didn't need to pound it in at every opportunity and then pound it in some more. And then do it some more for spite.<br /><br />Then there were a few times when I questioned his directions, as in which way the storms were coming from. Though they CAN move from east to west, they usually tend to move west to east with the naturally prevailing winds. At one point, though I might have been confused on directions, I could have sworn Jack was driving west and chasing ahead of a storm following him east to west. That didn't seem right, especially in the middle of the plains and even in the winter, though I could be wrong.<br /><br />I don't have much to say about the twists and turns of the plot. I had no idea what was going on except the FBI seemed a bit too cooperative with him when he wanted to go off on his own even though he wasn't technically in custody, or was he? Everything seemed a bit too muddy and convenient, though I had no big problem suspending my disbelief.<br /><br />I also didn't like one particular outcome in the end though I liked most of the ending. I didn't like losing one person I think should've made it. Oh well.<br /><br />Overall, it was still a decent read, but not up to what I expected from the past novels. I liked the inside jokes about getting to Virginia and his toothbrush (or maybe just call them sardonic witticisms?). Not bad, but not the best.

B00CT2P6VA|5.0|This is a continuation of the perfection of the first two Quell games.  I've played about halfway through this and I find no faults. It's simply a beautifully designed and very fun game. Well worth the price.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Love it. I like being able to known the percentage of battery life left. It does a good job. No complaints.
B00992CF6W|1.0|In my times of playing minecraft Pc I have long awaited for this day. GOOD JOB MOJANG and I hope the next update comes soon.
B00006674X|5.0|Again here is another one of my favorite Elvis movies on dvd. He plays a Doctor working in a clinic in a rough neighborhood in this movie. The Catholic Church sends 3 nuns to help Elvis in this movie. This is one of my top favorites of the movies Elvis made. Mary Tyler Moore is in this movie. I have just recently ordered this dvd. There again if you are a fan of Elvis I would suggest buying this movie for your collection. Thank you, Sandra K.
B007SGM084|5.0|Books were very seductive and kept my attention focused on each word. Mrs. James is a talented writer and her characters are very engaging.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The trilogy is possibly the best books I've read. The characters are interesting and the story is very captivating . I watched the movie The Girl with the Dragon tattoo and think the book is much more entertaining
B00992CF6W|5.0|You should get this app because it is worth the money!<br />So if you like minecraft you should get this app!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Flows well through various applications : Windows 7,<br /><br /> Windows 8, Android phone, and kindle fire. Recommend. Great for business, just wish it linked to a calendar.

B004XIZN5M|5.0|The detailed progressions for bodyweight exercises are priceless and really help all of us who want to build up our strength and stamina the good, old fashioned, progressive bodyweight way!
B0091REZMW|4.0|a little slow processing at times but decent and good casual fun. would like a version that did not require inviting friends to get bonuses.
B00CT2P6VA|1.0|I really enjoyed the first two in this series, but this one wont work on my milestone 2. One star for stealing my money.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|I have just downloaded, but like being able to see how much power remains. It seems to work very well and simple to use.
B004UID2LC|1.0|it doesn't work at all. it kept freezing up. I had to keep shutting down my tablet because it would freeze the screen so I couldn't leave the app. don't download it because its a waste of time. I unistalled. I would rather pay for the songs through the app store :(
B009UX2YAC|4.0|A good diverting game to play :) Its a lot of fun and has kept my autistic boy amused.I would recommend it to anyone.
B004ZJZPWA|5.0|Amazon Prime rocks!!!! Just one of the great choices available for action, sci-fy, horror buffs (we know who we are!). The HD makes it perfect!
0316247545|5.0|I am a mom of 3 girls who just adore these cute ponies. I have yet to give this book to my daughter who is having a birthday next week, but I'm sure of her reaction already!! It is fun to read, you'll get to know all the ponies, good and bad, and their stories. Definitely a great memento to add to your pony collection.
B009JBZH54|5.0|A must for Batman fans who have to have the sole story available on demand. Forgot to get Blu-Ray but still enhances effectively on a Blu-Ray player.
B004HMSYLO|5.0|I've been dying to read this book! It was a little bent up just as described, it even came with a hand written note from the seller, which made up for it!
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|Must see ....great plot loved it not much to say but freakin awesome if your looking for a series that you cant stop watching this is it...

B0064X7FVE|5.0|I can click on the weather and se what is going on anywhere and see the radar and would be lost not knowing
B003OUXECE|4.0|Andrew ryan is a very intresting character and this sees his transformation from idealistic liberterian to finnaly his fall into being forced to act like a tyrant as his beloved city tears itself apart as any utopia eventually does<br /><br />also a poinient example why the liberterian filosofy left to its own devices and the hypocrasy of extremists in this ideolegy as they often fail ot give the marketplace of ideas the same freedom as the marketplace of money
B004JK61K0|3.0|I do not use it I use my g-mail account for my mail  but maybe will try down the road
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|I thought it was a very good movie. Does not match the book exactly though. Quality was good too. Yeah.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|The show is well written and the acting is flawless. The characters are well developed and the performances show subtext and consistency. I can't recommend it enough.
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|I've watched this movie many times.  I love the story.  The music is great.  It's up there in my book with movies like Forrest Gump.
B00CS65QGW|5.0|The song is basic and simple, but it is also undeniably fun and creative.  Sure, the douchebag from Oasis from Oasis could have written it but thankfully he didn't and we get to enjoy a great song.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I bought these for my 13 yr old son for his birthday because he plays all these weird computer games. He has had several others in the past. Before this, his favorites were by skullcandy, but those broke. After reading reviews and googling this product, I decided to buy them. Well, he absolutely LOVES them, loves all of the features, says the sound and mic both work great. They are such a hit that his friends are jealous of them, and their parents have asked me where I got them from because they all want them now. They are definitely worth the price.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I just purchased this and when I go to the app,it says,&quot;unfortunately, this app has stopped working.&quot; Son I just played 7  bucks for nothing!?!?!?Total scam!!!!Don't buy unless you want to &quot;Donate&quot; money to Mojang.What a scam.
B003QSLW0K|5.0|For anyone who was between 8 and 14 for the movie's 2002 release, I probably don't need to convince you it's a great film.  If you're a little older and remember The Little Mermaid and other traditionally-rendered films fondly, I think you'll take the film for its art style alone.  Watercolor backgrounds and some great character art direction make for a really watchable and colorful film, not to mention the fluid and sometimes manic motion seen in Stitch and the other alien characters.<br /><br />If you'd like a really short review, please read the final paragraph of this review.  If you'd like to read a little more about how the movie might be taken, keep on reading.<br /><br />But it's not just a bauble. The plot sees a colorful and funny cast of aliens interacting with a struggling pair of sisters living on Hawaii's Kauai island, just as DCFS asks pointedly if younger sister Lilo is better off living with older sister Nani.  The arrival of Stitch (an alien genetic experiment gone awry) throws everything into chaos for them both, including some pretty great scenes when Nani tries desperately to find a new job only to have Lilo and Stitch ruin her chances accidentally.  It's the best use of a montage I've seen in a long, long time and gives some good laughs along the way.<br /><br />The A plot revolves around a family dynamic which incorporating Stitch by degrees and Nani's struggle to keep Lilo in her life.  The B plot is the alien federation's attempts to secure Stitch (\\"Experiment 626\\") and put him in exile.  The final act marries the A plot and B plot well, and it finishes on a high note.  Not typical 'Disney pie in the sky, everything's good forever' stuff, but Lilo and Nani have a chance at a better life.<br /><br />There are some moments that are pretty painful for an older teen or adult to watch, particularly one scene where it becomes clear Lilo should be placed in foster care, and for some Nani's struggles strike close to home. It's not framed the way most Disney films approach \\"broken\\" families - both Lilo and Nani need each other, but they're both ill-equipped to support each other.  That's not exactly fixed by magic wand at the culmination of the movie, but the new house and a wider support network (including two exiled scientists from Stitch's federation of planets) suggest things might get easier.<br /><br />Most kids will focus on Stitch - I mean his name is in the title!  Trying to cope with his \\"genetic programming\\" and unable to act on his aggression, he comes to terms with not currently having a \\"family\\" as a spliced clone.  He comes to make his own extended family with Lilo, Nani, and a few secondary characters.  In the end he's a hero for saving Lilo from a kidnapping by an overzealous space captain out for Stitch's bounty, and Stitch remains happily exiled on Earth with his new family or \\"ohana.\\"  There's plenty of funny \\"bad boy\\" behavior and trickery by Stitch, and kids and adults alike will enjoy the action scenes.  As violence goes it's bloodless but dynamic, fun, with huge sweeping motions and rolling fight scenes.<br /><br />If it's a rainy afternoon and you have some kids over, pop some popcorn and watch this.  Be prepared for a few \\"pew pew pew\\" sound effects and giggles every time Stitch scurries on six (yes, six) limbs. If not, there's nothing to stop you from enjoying a well-animated movie about family and aliens that doesn't pluck at the same heartstring over and over again.  It knows its marks, it makes it, but it's not cloying, and its execution in animation and plot are both pretty neat.t Disney films approach \\"broken\\" families - both Lilo and Nani need each other, but they're both ill-equipped to support each other.

B005LLSNNE|5.0|I love it, very well done and all the characters are incredible.  I can not wait until the next season
B005PK57IK|1.0|was the land of make believe very biased and lacking fact.  enjoyed the comedic value of the evil corporation vs the corrupt self centered hypocricy of the lawyers
B00899F0G8|5.0|My wife is absolutely in love with this show and Season 3 had her on the edge of her seat the whole time. Every time I came home she had downloaded a couple episodes more and she was gripped watching them.
B00008O31H|5.0|If you like the Black Keys, you will enjoy Thickfreakness.  With all the slick recording out there these days... Thickfreakness sounds like an old blues record.  I like it.
1416550550|5.0|Kate Morton did a great job of weaving this story between the characters and the times they lived.  Well worth the time to read!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this game. Still don't understand how points are scored but love it. I cannot stop once I get started.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Still awesome with great characters and stories, lots of twists and turns and other bits of creative activity in each section.
B009X010RU|5.0|I buy tablets for their size and easiness to hold.  I can't see the point of adding a huge, bulky case to it and negating those advantages.  This case is so close-fitting and lightweight, it is perfect to protect my Kindle from scratches and dirt.
B005SHTXN0|5.0|This is a very Good all around movie... A little comedy and drama mixed... Recommend watching, if you have never seen it before.
B00CUWWLWG|2.0|in order to do well in this game you will need to spend a lot of money, which I do not have enough of to blow on a game.
0143117009|5.0|Just as good as &#34;Guns, Germs & Steel.&#34;  He looks at a wide variety of societies, big and small, now and in the past, and gives us insight about why they might of failed.  It reminds me to take nothing for granted!
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|I just did not like this movie. A real waste of money. The subject mater, massive drug and alcohol abuse, just disgusting and then add to the that the pilot is responsible for all the lives on the planes he is flying.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|Agnetha's  beautiful voice transported me back to her ABBA days. They were my favourite band growing up and i still love them today. Any fan that loved them then will love her new album. It is pure joy to listen to it. Thank you so much amazon for this amazing album.
B002ZG99IG|4.0|This movie was great because it is just so darned creepy! I appreciate the suspense and eeriness of the film to produce scares instead of typical gory nonsense.
B0084670FU|1.0|The movie moved along without developing any solid plot that captivated the audience.  We would not recommend watching this movie.  Spend your time on something else.
0783225482|5.0|Meryl Streep is amazing! This movie is a true classic and I laughed from beginning to end. The price of youth depicted at its finest! A comical depiction of how obsessed we are as a society with outer appearance and the illusion and preservation of youth.
B0085YOD1A|3.0|This app sort of helps out with knowing when to charge your device before it dies so I give it 3 stars
B00BEXB18M|1.0|Why Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine thought this reeking pile of garbage would be a good idea is beyond me.  Granted, nothing Megadeth has done in the last twenty years has ever stood up to their classic albums Peace Sells... But Who's Buying? and Rust In Peace.  They released some mediocre albums; some that were not bad; and one that took them years to live down, 1999's Risk, which was so bad as to influence legendary guitarist Marty Friedman's decision to leave the band. It seems, though,  that Mustaine is a glutton for punishment, or at least a slow learner, as Supercollider is the worst thing Megadeth has created since Risk, and likely to make them the laughingstock of heavy metal for a long time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and very realistic with the moving horse and care u must give it
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Character consistent through 17 books. I've read them all<br />and thought they were all equally good. Hope he writes more.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this app is outstanding .I think it`s addictive.If you havent played this ,atleast get the demo.Thank you for this app,and the demo.I love it so much!
B008M87GJK|4.0|Very easy to use and it doesn't crash my kindle like the CNN one does! Wish there was more on it and that stories didn't repeat under multiple categories taking up slots in the rows.
0399165274|4.0|I grew up reading Frederick Forsyth's books: [[ASIN:0553268465 The Dogs of War]], [[ASIN:B003GDFQX4 The Day Of The Jackal]] and the [[ASIN:0451239393 The Odessa File]].  While I don't think that any of the books that Forsyth has written since are as good as these three, he has never lost his touch. This includes his latest book The Kill List.<br /><br />Forsyth started has career as a journalist and his books are all meticulously researched. At least two of his books were influenced by real life events. The Day of the Jackal involves a plot to kill Charles De Gaulle, which was based on actual assassination plots.  In the case of The Dogs of War, the book was based on what Forsyth has later admitted was his own experience taking part in a plot to overthrow the repressive and corrupt government of Equatorial Guinea, in West Africa. The plot failed, but the result was one of Forsyth's best books.<br /><br />Like his other books, The Kill List is a carefully researched novel based on the modern terrorism, including Al Queda. Forsyth traces the support and roots for a number of terrorist organizations to Pakistan and the Pakistani ISI (intelligence service).<br /><br />Forsyth has an extremely sparse style of storytelling. Reading one of his novels is almost like listing to an account of events from an old friend over dinner. The story and characters are sketched out, but Forsyth is not a stylist like John Le Carre'. I didn't recall this about Forsyth's writing style and at first the novel didn't grab me. As the story grew, however, the book started to become a \\"page turner\\".<br /><br />We learn early in the book that the nemesis is the Preacher, a man who preaches extreme, violent jihad against the West, especially the United States and the United Kingdom. What bothered me as I read the book is that at no point does the Preacher do anything more than inspire. He is, apparently a charismatic preacher. He is the inspiration for leaderless jihad.  But he doesn't even know the people who commit the terrorist acts nor does he take part in their planning. The Preacher only learns of the terrorist acts through news reports.<br /><br />The United States has never stated that it targets those who merely provide inspiration for violent acts.  There have been other Islamic clerics who preached violent jihad. Anwar al-Awlaki was once person.  The Obama administration has stated that he was only targeted when he took part in the operational planning of terrorist actions, not because he preached violent jihad. Similarly, Omar Abdel-Rahman, the \\"blind sheikh\\", was convicted of terrorism not because he preached jihad against the United States but because he was involved in planning terrorist events including the first World Trade Center bombing.<br /><br />In modern times the United States admits no history of killing people merely because of what they say. There are many such preachers throughout the Middle East who preach hatred of the West. Only actions, like planning or committing a terrorist act, lead to such a sanction.  Even if you accept that is reasonable to target people who preach violent jihad, it seems pointless. Doing this does nothing more than sow dragons teeth, from which will arise countless others who preach violence.the people who commit the terrorist acts nor does he take part in their planning.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Hey I really luv this game it's relaxing and fun<br />my name is nunu and my sister name is niya and we are working on  being famous I<br />We got different talent mine is acting and hers is singing and we both Luv mindless behavior
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A great end to wonderful story. It keeps you guessing until the very end and they always seems to be yet another surprise.
0812993357|5.0|I bought this book &#34;used&#34; and the condition was described as &#34;like new&#34;.  This was a 100% accurate description: it was still safety sealed and not dented at all.  I am so happy that I paid seven dollars less for this book than I would have for a &#34;new&#34; copy because it is in the exact same condition.  I would recommend this distributer to anyone!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I like this.  I wanted more anyway. We have discovered more characters. She ended with them some what content. I can't wait to find out more. She is keeping us on the line. I hope others will continue to read with us. Eva and Gideon are a hot couple. I don't think Gideon really killed Nathan so don't worry she'll fix it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|best app! You're should totally get it! :) i use our so the time!  see i even have 5 starts!!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|it's a great app to have.  it seems to do more and tell me more things on my kindle HD than on my original kindle, but nonetheless, it's still a great app to have. I highly recommend this one.
B00992CF6W|4.0|How come kindle fire doesn't get the new update yet?? I'm not mad but I just wanna know. When will the update come out for kindle fire
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|The movement of the show is, for the most part subtle (excluding of course, an occasional extremely brutal homicide) and you have to pay attention to the nuances plaid off between the actors.  As a therapist and psychiatrist, Hannibal is a little stereotypical of the 1950's, 1960's trained doctors.  I little corny, but it works.  I hope to see the characters grow and expand as the series progresses.  it was worth the no ad buy and I will buy a next season if there is one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this game can get you as close as you want to a horse I love horses but I rarely get to see or touch one but I can take care of MY HORSE any time
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I love my kindle and hate when i am caught off guard with a discharged battery! Rather than go through three screens to get an accurate reading i can find it fast and move on!!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Helps me to stay up to date with baterry with my nexus 4 device. The percent us shown at the top left corner of your notification pannel
B000HSKUBE|5.0|My initial attraction to the show arose from the fact that it was the basis for the new show starring Kevin Spacey. Before I knew it, the show pulled me in and never relinquished its grip.<br /><br />The pace is excellent and the writing is superb. The performances are engaging and riveting. Once you watch the first episode, like me, you will want more.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Miami version of subway surfers has some good things, and some bad things. I particularly never liked the jumping shoes because to me they were never helpful, more of an obstacle that always caused me to get caught. I believe that the Tokyo version was better. after the update had come it wouldn't let me connect it to Facebook, which I like to know other people's scores. I believe there should be more of the rockets and magnets, because without those, I seem to only reach small amounts of coins, and not be able to buy more stuff.<br />Thanks for taking the time to read my review, I hope you take my ideas into consideration.
B0077EBWVI|5.0|I have watched this movie several times, and NEVER get tired of it. It's a refreshing alternative to loud movies with too many monsters, aliens and special effects!
B009X01D9U|5.0|My wife loves this case for her device. Not sure what to say other than it's well built and has held up well for quite a long time.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I'm into books that make me think. Not just thoughtless, cliche romance stories or predictable mysteries. And this book exceeded every single expectation I had. I guess in the end, all I need to say is A+ John Green.
B001LM1456|3.0|I enjoyed The Incredible Hulk, it was entertaining and tied in to the Marvel Universe being put together into The Avengers movie, so I was glad that I saw it.  I would not say that it was a Great movie, but worth watching if you like Marvel Comics and know The Hulk character.  Otherwise, I believe you would be bored.  I liked the romantic side of the movie somewhat, and was glad that the two of them (can't remember names!) got together against her father's wishes, but he was so small when he was not The Hulk!  Anyway, if you want the whole background of the movie The Avengers and the characters therein, be sure to include this movie, it is well worth it.
B00C1C0HS0|2.0|This is an ok film, sat down to watch as a family night movie but it wasn't anything that could keep us watching. It's not a bad film just short and predicable.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|I found myself totally involved in the characters and their story in this movie.  I highly recommend it to any adult with historical knowledge, especially of the time period involved (England in the 1930's) just before WWII.  So much that is grand happens and so much that is nitty-gritty happens.  I loved the Queen Mother!  Seeing Queen Elizabeth as a young princess was a kick, too.  The man who works with &#34;Bertie&#34;,  who becomes King, is fantastic!  Watching Royalty mix with a commoner out of sheer basic need was fascinating and so well done!  Bravo to a wonderful movie!
B00D2K40WY|5.0|Awesome app. I love fashion and stuff like this. If u have a passion for fashion, this is a must have app! Luv it!!! (;
B0043JDUNS|4.0|This was a fantastic movie, LOVE Robert Downey, Jr. as Iron Man!  Constant action, a plot that made sense...I do recommend seeing Iron Man 1 first...and lots of fireworks!  You could see this movie if you don't know the Marvel Universe, but you might be bored.  Really liked the romantic side of this movie, it worked for me.  It was cool!
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Highly addictive! Great game for the price! One of the best match three games I've played. Worth every penny I paid.
B000V5Y1SQ|4.0|I was a huge fan of the original Star Trek and never saw this one before.  I'm enjoying this greatly!
B0088P2A7A|5.0|I have been able to find information in a hurry with this particular app.  As far as I can tell, it works every bit as good as the actual website!
B00AF6B22E|2.0|Will really not fly again! LOL Bad Movie both subject matter and acting!  Like Denzel Washington, but not in this movie
B004VMUS9G|4.0|This clock has successfully woken me up numerous mornings.  But it is very easy to accidentally hit the &#34;dismiss&#34; button when you were actually reaching for the &#34;snooze&#34; button.  Grant it the &#34;snooze&#34; button is about as large as Rosie O'Donnell's underwear, anything is quite possible when you are halfway asleep.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Great game!  I was highly surprised by this!  Got it since it looked okay, but man, this game is addicting!  Only thing that sucks is that the game can be beat so fast...but you can keep playing it after you beat it to try to beat your high score.  I still play it even though I beat it, and can play the game for up to an hour, sometimes longer!<br /><br />I highly recommend this game!  Helps with reaction and reflexes!  Really works the brain!
B00632HWOG|5.0|As far as I can tell, this Yahoo Mail App works every bit as good as the real one does.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Very well developed app.  Has many sounds, and it is awesome that you can overlap sounds.  I've used it several times and are great at helping me to relax.  I really enjoy having so many varying sounds to pick from.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is fun. Trying to accomplish all the achievements and daily achievements makes it enjoyable. Trying to save the coins and gems makes the game more fun to help with upgrades.
B002QNTNL6|4.0|This is a cute movie which I had seen before however what was disappointing was I watched it on my Kindle Fire HD and the sound especially when they sang was not impressive.  Disappointed in the sound but still think the movie is cute.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is the best! I would never wake up before but since I got the app I wake up every morning and I love the math method for the snooze. Highly recommended.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This is the best battery monitor that I have ever used. It works as well on my smartphone as it does on my Kindle.  Well worth the time.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I give it a four star rating .  But I really enjoyed this book catching fire sequel to the hunger games
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Awesome game! Really wish it was longer but well worth the price.. can't wait for a new game!!! Very addictive and challenging!!
B00A7W29BE|4.0|Genius Scan is a nice little app that helps you save documents, images, etc that you take with the camera on your phone or tablet.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|If you love amplified guitarist, you will love this...  For the Love of electric guitars and the guitarist that make them sing....Loud!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Books 1 and 2 were great but this third in the Crossfire Series was a disappointment. First because the author is drawing out the story into five books and introducing new characters that I'm not interested in, e.g. Magumi. This first half of this book was a real \\"snooze fest.\\" Not until almost the end did Gideon and Eva start to really rekindle their relationship. This book ended without exploring the problems Gideon has with his mother, half brother Christopher or this Dr. Lucas that was involved in or knew about his molastation. I was really hoping for a happily everafter but got a continuing non-resolution.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|I am admittedly an Ian McEwan fan, but this is a really ejoyable story of spys and a woman living in a highly biased world.  A quick and fun read from a master story teller.
B009NG1Q96|3.0|I enjoyed reading about America and her story. This book was mostly fluff and a quick read. It did keep me interested. I do wish there was more development with the other Elite, but over all it was fun to read.
B006LSZECO|3.0|If you've ever been tempted to climb inside the mind of a psychopath, this is the novel for you.  More than a bit creepy, yet fascinating in a very sinister way.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This is the first book I've ever had to return. Simply put, I feel cheated. Last time I checked, trilogy meant three, not five!<br /><br />I don't generally read series books when they aren't all released yet; however with a release date near, I started the Crossfire trilogy. After reading books 1 & 2 I was content to wait a couple of weeks for the Final book to release, only to have that dated pushed back.<br /><br />I had already pre-ordered the Final book, Entwined with You, so Tuesday morning it was waiting for me on my Kindle. I read & read and kept wondering why not much was wrapping up within the Final book.?.?.? I was at 70% and knew there was no way this was going to put any closure on the story; that is when I started reading reviews already written regarding this \\"Trilogy\\".<br /><br />I am completely disappointed with this book. The information which is learned within this book regarding the characters and story line could have easily been covered in two chapters. If done that way, we could have gotten to the end of the story within this book.<br /><br />I was in love with the Gideon/Eva story after ready the first two books. However, after reading this book I am utterly disgusted with Eva. I can only hope that within the next two books Gideon wakes up and lets her go forever.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Wonderfully written. Incredible & unique storyline. LOVED the characters...Especially Jeff. Lol. But the story ended way too soon. I mean, it was a happily-ever-after, yes, but I guess I just expected more. I am however, satisfied if nothing else. Great read overall. No doubt.
B008XG1X18|5.0|The Interest app for my smart phone is amazing! Now I can pin on the go, search boards for my organizing clients and so much more. Love it & highly recommend!
B00992CF6W|4.0|Apple has the new update for minecraft, but not kindle. Update, soon please.( by  soon I mean in the next 96 hours, (4 days)
159562015X|5.0|Was just the advice I needed--made me a lot more confident about my strengths, and eager to talk about them at interviews!
B000OJFV4C|4.0|This was a good depiction of history.  Well put and drawn but after a while Henry becomes boring and somewhat pathetic.
B0028T6XXY|4.0|I chose this rating because the person i bought it for likes it. I don't know if i like or dislike this product because i never heard him. I'd probably recommend it to anyone who likes Micheal Buble.
B004GTKP3S|5.0|I fell in love with this series.  I want to watch the rest but it only does the first two seasons.  Great!  Loved it!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have really enjoyed the Crossfire novels. The way Sylvia Day writes really makes you feel as though you know her characters personally and you get caught up in their lives. I could hardly wait for what I thought was the final book in the series, only to find out there is more to come. The waiting will be tough but I know so worth it.
B009NY43NY|3.0|At only a third of the way through this book I knew there was just something...different. It just seemed off to me. There were several small sections scattered throughout the book that were written in 3rd person point of view, and if I'm not mistaking, Harris has never written any of the Sookie books from 3rd person POV. This immediately threw up a caution flag for me. Why throw that in now? At the conclusion of what used to be a wonderfully fun series?<br /><br />The action and suspense seemed to be pretty anti climactic for the most part. Ok, well the part where Claude came into the mix did throw me for a second...Maybe I should have seen it coming, but I didn't.<br /><br />Now for Sookie's love life. This seems to be the thing that's setting a lot of people off. I've been Team Eric from the get go(like SO many others). That being said, I've always thought that if she cant ultimately end up with Eric...and be HAPPY, then she should be with Sam. Well turns out Eric wasn't willing to make her happy. I'm sorry, but this big bad Vampire Viking didn't do all he could, in my opinion, to get out of his forced vampire marriage. I think Eric DOES love Sookie, but I think, unfortunately, he loves his Vampire Politics slightly more.<br /><br />So as much as I love Eric, I am glad Sookie and Sam ended up together. I believe Sam's loved her from the beginning and I do feel chemistry between the two when I read these books. Sookie's always stated she loves life and sun and I think she loves Sam too. The ending is fitting, they decide to move slowly, as not to mess things up. I was happy with that.
B001974DG0|5.0|This is the book that started my reading career.  I was one of those people as a child who thought reading was a punishment. As an adult I enjoy reading every chance I get in fact I now carry a book everywhere I go.  I just finished this book fir the third time. I read it every five years or so I love the story and have recommended it to several people. Everyone should have an Einstein but since we can't it's nice to read about him.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I enjoyed Entwined With You. I absolutely freakin' LOVE Gideon, and Eva for that matter. I liked how their relationship grew in this installment. I feel like their finally in a really good place for the most part and cant wait to see what's lined up next for them. I do really want them to have a happily ever after...sooner rather than later! I feel like this couple has been through SO much and that it needs to be wrapped up. This is the only reason for the four star instead of five. The chemistry and the sex in this book was freakin' SMOKIN!!! Even more so than the previous two books. That was a plus too. ;)  This one did seem to end rather abruptly. I'll be waiting...hopefully not for LONG...for the next book. There was a lot of drama and a lot of questions left at the end.
B000JZ45LQ|5.0|It was great. Brought back many memories. Very entertaining. Watched it twice. Great just to have playing in the background while emtertaining too.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|SOA continues to bring great acting and storyline in Season 4. I dread the end of each episode because I know it's bringing me one episode closer to the end of the series. Just when you think the series couldn't get more high stakes, they surprise you. Another great season of SAMCRO shenanigans!
B00BTJMS1A|1.0|I have trained my character to the Max in the gym and now my score won't increase when I go into the dungeon.  I submitted an issue over a week ago and no response and no fix posted to Amazon.  Uninstalling.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I have seen in on TV - I bought the series for my daughter - she has yet to see the series.
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|Does it seem to you that all movie studio's do now is get 1, 2 or 3 &#34;it&#34; actors of the day and stick them in a movie with a script that could have been written by any talented college kid.  The goal of movies is no longer to appeal to a wider audience, but to the lowest common denominator.  It's not that good of a movie, but the problem is there aren't any good movies out any more so this is raises up a level in the company it keeps.
B00932A4XE|4.0|A comical look at how some people have the most wonderful experience during pregnancy and the rest of us well, not so much. Also, funny to see what the men's perspective is and how they find a way to cope :)
B00CHI5F5S|2.0|Predictable and cliche good guy / tough guy movie.  As seems to be the case more and more, no one can make an original film.  stolen ideas from great to mediocre movies from the 80s and 90s.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|The stories are riveting for the most part. The sex is unnecessary and too descriptive, especially considering the time frame. It is interesting mostly from the point of an Englishman at how WWII was won by Russia, and what a small role was played by the US. The stories are more romance than history.
B007SGM084|5.0|Great books! Once you start reading....you will not want to put it down! I give all three books 2 thumbs up!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is really fun if you like survivul games the is for you<br />And if you like ,hate creepers kill them all
B00A77II0U|5.0|this is one of the best games I have ever played.  the pica are great the story line is creeptastic.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|What a wonderfully powerful story for young girls! My girls had to watch this movie over and over. My youngest daughter said, &#34;it's really awesome!&#34;
B00992CF6W|5.0|who would not bye this game?its really cool and you get to play multiplayer.pluss there are updates to keep it interesting.
B00119ZMKW|5.0|Corin Nemec was a great addition to Season 6. A little eye candy is always a good thing! Not that the show was ever stale but sometimes changing things up makes it even more interesting.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I like it. I wish it wasn't going to have more books.  It feels like Sylvia is just trying to make another dollar and that irritates me.  I love Eva and Gideon but I don't think I will spend another dime on this series.  More books is uncalled for and Sylvia you should've just finished with this book and not be so greedy.
B000001F76|5.0|When he died on New Year's Day 1953, at age 29, in the back of a Cadillac,Williams was the biggest star in country music.
B00A7W29BE|4.0|Works very well, very simple interface which is excellent.  The only issue I have is it is hard to get the scanned material into the camera due to the image being reversed so that opposite camera movements are required.  What I do not know is if this is the camera on Android or the Android Operating System on my device that causes this issue or if this is the normal behavior.
B000002I4S|5.0|Coltrane made two giant steps in 1959: playing on Miles Davis' Kink of Blue and recording his first classic.He played flying clusters of notes that declared new possibilities for jazz improvisation and predicted the ferocious, harmonically open lyricism of his mid-sixties albums
B006M6NV0M|5.0|Love seeing all the great action movie stars in one movie - although they should have invited Chuck Norris to the party!
B000005YZM|5.0|Odessey and Oracle wasn't released in the U.S. until 1969-two years after it was recorded and the Zombies had broken up.
B00BI5J9BC|5.0|Although it can be depressing, the music is wonderful, the message of redemption moving, and the promise of forgiveness, priceless
B00008FRMR|5.0|Costello's second album, and his first with the Attractions, is his most &#34;punk&#34;-not in any I-hate-cops sense but in his emotionally explosive writing and his backing bands vicious gallop.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It is fun to have a game that you can play that does not cost a lot of money to play.
B000002KO3|5.0|On this New Wave watershed, the avantpunk avatars became polyrhythmic pop magicians. David Byrne and Co. combined the thrust of P-Funk, the kinky grooves of Afropop and the studied adventurousness of producer Brian Eno.
B00CATSONE|4.0|A must read for all new Tesla owners.  Tesla and Edison's battle is stuff for a movie...excellent; just a little rambling at the beginning.
B00000J7SS|5.0|Davis wanted to connect his music to the audience of Jimi Hendrix and Sly Stone. The result was this double album of jazz-rock fusion.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Reminded me how incredible this series was and so far ahead of its time.. Gene was a true visionary for our generation!
B00CRQV1TY|5.0|Great song selections and well played by guest artists.  The overall sound of the CD is fantastic. If you have a good set of headphones, treat yourself to this album!  These songs take on a new life as John urged the artists to play the tunes the way each artist wanted to present them.  Lots of fun.  2 originals..Train Of Fools and Mystic Highway.  The problem here is that Mystic Highway is so catchy, it makes the other one forgettable.  Still, a five star album from John C Fogerty.
B00BGIBVRG|2.0|I was expecting more, everyone just seemed to be yelling at each other the whole time. Dysfunctional and not really that funny.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I read the first 2 several months ago and was on pins & needles for the 3rd. I am absolutely addicted to Gideon & Eva. The way you capture the reader is wonderful. I am in awe at times and then instantly in a 'WTF' moment and I love it!!! Can't wait for the next installment !!!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love Kindle app because it allows me to get the books I want without having to buy another device. Super!
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I was so excited to get the last book in the trilogy i stayed up to midnight to read. So... disappointed this book was not an ending hell it wasn't even a good read it was more like the middle of a story with no end. I know this is a way to sell more books but at least make it have some kind of ending it just feels like she rushed writing and didn't have time to finish. The first book I have ever returned for refund as i was so disappointed in it.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This movie has hilarious situations along with hilarious characters...an absolute classic. The best of the National Lampoon movies.  Manages to make our cultural customs both funny and meaningful at the same time.  In spite of the hilarity, there is a sweetness about this movie.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Very easy to use.  Well worth the price. The animation is not too cheesy and I have found the app to be fairly accurate.
B0011ZYIZQ|5.0|I love my music!! She is so Amazing with her voice I can't get enough of it at all!! Keep up the good job ;-)
B004IYWN7C|5.0|My three year old loved the music and danced along. we watched it about FOUR times within the rented 48 hours
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I loved it, not gonna lie, I really loved the graphics and that a game as cool as this could be free.
B0055B7IPE|3.0|For an older child and has a lot of cute one liner phrases. The story line was a sweet love tale
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun and addictive game to play...always never have enough coins but I can never put it down! But! It would be awesome if you could use the barrier walls longer, or more available. More puzzles too?
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Every book was better then the last and left you wanting more. This was no exception!  I would recommend this trilogy to anyone but make sure you have the time to read all three books in a row, the will suck you in for sure!
B005CRY2O6|2.0|This is one book where you are better off buying the physical book, not the ebook. The recipes that start with a sauce or other component are unusable because there is no separation in the ingredients, they all run together so it's hard to tell where one set of ingredients ends and the other set starts.
B002VRZEYM|1.0|I chose this rating because I thought the movie was hard to watch. Very graphic with the<br />Chickens and the cattle. I had to cover my eyes.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I bought this mouse to replace the WOW gaming mouse made by Steel Series. I don't really have upwards of $80 to buy another high quality gaming mouse, so I was looking for something cheaper when I stumbled across this beauty. I'd never heard of the company, but the other reviews were highly complimentary, and I'm adding mine to that list.<br /><br />I have large hands and I dislike using small mice, particularly when I'm gaming. This one, while not as large as the WOW Steel Series mouse (a behemouth by any standards) is none-the-less a full size mouse which those with larger hands will have no complaint with.<br /><br />Pros:<br />  The mouse size is comfortable for larger hands, but not so large no one else would enjoy using it.<br />  The design is nice and it looks nice with the rest of my equipment. The lights are particularly nice - especially the<br />  lighted scroll wheel.<br />  The software is exceedingly easy to use - no manual needed. Everything is self explanatory.<br />  The buttons are a breeze to assign.<br />  The buttons are quite ergonomically and logically located.<br />  Performance is stellar. Every bit as good as more expensive mice, and every bit as good as well known brands<br />  Comes with weights to give the mouse the feel people like. I'm using all of them and it gives the mouse a really nice feel.<br />  Adjusting dpi on the fly is a breeze.<br />  Price, price, price, price, price!<br /><br />Cons:<br />  I would have prefered the scroll wheel to be located just a little more toward the nose of the mouse. It's the only quibble I have and it's pathetically minor. I'm already used to it sitting a little further back and it's caused no problem with my games. The company should spend a bit more in advertising! This is a well-made, well-designed, stellar product for a price anyone would be willing to pay. Indeed - many pay more for less.<br /><br />Overall - A stellar mouse for less than half the price of high level gaming mice. The customer service was also a delight, shipping was far faster than expected, and everything I've experienced so far would lead me not only to recommend this mouse highly to anyone, but to stick with this company for other peripheral needs I may have in the future.
B003WGM40S|5.0|I feel as if my generation is lacking stories like these. We expect happy endings and for the underdog to win out in the end. We expect love to have one challenge but not impossible challenges. We don't expect to cry from start to finish. Life though isn't fair and I think this story highlights it in ways that might make most uncomfortable. A woman wronged and wronged over again by a vial man, her own family, community, church and in the end I think she wronged herself. She murdered her own future, a moment of insanity I think as her character was stronger than that. I could be wrong in this though. Maybe I wish for the happy ending after all. In any case, this story is worth watching though I wish I would have expected all the tears. Very beautifully done. A story that sings to the \\"Sorrow\\" in us all.
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|If you like action/adventure with a little humor movies...this is good, nothing great, won't win any awards<br />but if you like good guys against the bad guys with a traditional ending....it is good.
B00A7YZ1KI|3.0|Just a wrapping up of the characters in the True Blood series, nice way to finish, but not that exciting story wise
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|love it or hate it...worth watching more than once...a story and even a message....absolutely worth seeing and finding someone to talk about it.<br />Also the most amazing cast and multiple roles I have seen.
0977326403|4.0|This book is great for anyone who is looking to be a serious entrepreneur or trying to make it in top management within industry. Collins explains the best type of a leader in the hierarchy of leaders--a level 5 leader who's ambition is first and foremost for the institution, not themselves. For those who are already serious entrepreneurs or managers, Collins also helps shed light on how level 5 leaders can create an atmosphere and culture for their employees to be loyal, self-motivated, resourceful and truthful in order to contribute to the institution which can jump the company from good to great. It is explained that having the right employees on the bus is more important than trying to motivate people. The \\"First who then What\\" approach should be considered when finding the right people to bring into a company as employees. Collins explains the Hedgehog Concept in which allows a great company to stay great and to stay focused. The concept is centered around what you are deeply passionate about, what drives your economic engine and what can you be the best at in the world? This is a \\"great\\" book because it defines for one what greatness is and how it can be attained--at from a practical guide perspective.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|This remake is a very contemporary interpretation of &#34;Upstairs Downstairs&#34;.  I enjoyed this version immensely and would highly recommend it.
B00457X8BC|4.0|Appreciate the 'North Country' authors.  The descriptions of the landscape and various peoples are most interesting.  Have to admit that I do not appreciate you telling me how many word that I have to write.  I will never again submit another of your surveys.
B005G8AFFG|5.0|Ana Popivic is my newest fave musician... She is kinda like Kenny Wayne Shephard in female form. Nice beat, great lyrics.<br />First purchased Can you stand the heat and then purchased unconditional.... I drive about 2 hours a day and it is  nice to have some good driving music...
B004W1GCNC|5.0|This intriguing and captivating story involves the wealthy aristocrats upstairs, and the dedicated staff downstairs who serve them.  Set around the time in England of the King's abdication &#34;for the woman he loves&#34;, we are exposed to the political and social events of the era.  We explore the mores of the times including attitudes toward childbirth, the need for educated immigrants to serve in lowly jobs; the secrets kept and revealed among us all. The closing scene was brilliant.
B002DJSBL6|5.0|This movie is a classic! Each time I watch it, I discover new details in the conversations, situations, etc. Love it!
B005MLOOJA|4.0|The Good Wife is simply good television. The excellent cast and writers seem to put together one good show after another with no let ups or let downs. After season 1 it was hard to believe the show could keep on producing one good episode after another but season 2 was just as good, no let down.
B004X6PRO6|3.0|Strangely interesting, but trying to find a plot was difficult until quite a way into the book. Sadly, many parts true.
B002XBVQKW|4.0|Enjoyed watching this movie again.  My 12 year son watched it for the first time and really liked it.  Very catchy songs.  Timeless.

B009NG1Q96|5.0|Wonderful book, live the plot and the writing is  Fantastic!! It's a must read absolutely!!!I can't wait for the third one, I love her and Mason together!! Aspen just<br />needs to leave!.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|A cute story...you wanted the character to find love and he did, but not in the way you expect! I stayed hooked.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This is a well written totally dark book.  I didn't like either character and the thought of them raising an innocent child is monstrous.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|I enjoy every single episode.<br />there is always something new and exciting. I watch one to two episodes every day.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Top notch acting and a great story. It is hard not to see yourself or someone you know in this. It gives an interesting portrait of mental illness.
B0000844I8|5.0|My husband got me addicted to SG1 and I had never seen the movie, so I purchased the movie and loved it. I watch one to two episodes of SG1 every day

B002CNK1MK|4.0|definately in my top 50 movies. Dustin's character is believable and Cruise is extraordinary  . watch now and be amazed
B009NLC1D6|5.0|This movie played by great actors places you in a time and place where a man takes a people to a place they had only dreamed of. Where one man so loved was able to lift a nation with peaceful means to throw off the shakles of coloniesm.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I LIKE THE SIMPLICITY OF SETTING THE CLOCK, I LIKE THE BIG BRIGHT DISPLAY, AND THE PRICE WAS RIIGHT!  THE VOLUME OF MY KINDL FIRE COULD BE A LITTLE LOUDER FOR THE ALARM FUNCTION.<br /><br />I AM VERY PLEASED WITH Y<br />THIS APP.

B00CDT41RY|4.0|I waited a long time to watch this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised and entertained.  An added lagniappe was Tarantino's role in the movie.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|Dialog very hard to follow. Only takes one sliver of Lincoln's life and concentrates on politics of 13th Amendment not on president.
B009O2XY12|4.0|Fun! And, as promised, addictive! The sound is silly and fun. The colors are great. Silly game but great for a break in a busy day!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I couldn't wait to read this book but also didn't want the story to come to an end.  Fabulous!!!!!!! I can't wait for more!
B003WH765U|5.0|If this doesn't bring out your emotional side, I wouldn't know what would. This is a story of love and honor. American Korean War military men fall for Japanese women while US policy disallows the arrangement even by marriage. Keep your hankie closeby.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Finished this book and I have to say I have checked out of the love story. After 3 novels and their same problems over and over I have became bored. I am very devoted to authors however all her other novels seem to have a same root. It's like a never ending story, only its not different adventures. Just the same issues. This is not a memorable series, just my opinion.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun. It's a really good game for children. I hope everyone who buys this game has as much fun as I do.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Easy to use and set up. Continually goes off at the same time without needing to reset or return on
159562015X|5.0|My test results mainly helped me to accept myself the kind of person I am and to have better understanding that people are really that different and that it is normal, it is OK. You just need to find a better way to communicate with them. Some practical tips are also interesting.<br /><br />So I am very glad I had a chance to pass the test. Yesterday 3 more books of Tom Rath arrived.
B004SIP9O2|4.0|The film is tightly woven to the original both in terms of story and performers. Despite the similarity, this stands on its own in terms of its entertainment value. It is still a B picture, but a good one. Not for everyone, of course, clearly this is a younger audience vehicle; however, it mostly saves the muck and guck in the numerous killings and so makes it easier for the older folk to sample this type of film and share in some of the fun.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|It's addictive and fun. Decorate a beautiful or funky restaurant, make new friends, and make lots of different foods.  The quests keep you coming back each day so you can try to finish them and move on to a new fun quest.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Even though I just got this game I think it's awesome and its amazing for young ones too like my 3 year old brother
B008KP6ENE|5.0|It's so awesome because it has a fantastic way of playing I'm gonna buy more games like this because crescent moon games are awesome
B006LSZECO|3.0|it took a while for the book it get  somewhat good. i heard it was a good book so decided to get it from my public library.  it deals with real life marriages and after one hundred pages i started to understand it. still reading it is just ok for now.glad that i did not buy it for twelve dollars.
B00A7W29BE|1.0|Genius scan is useless without some kind of instruction or &#34;how to&#34; page.  I open the app and I have absolutely no idea what to do next.  Sorry, this one in its present form is a failure.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This was AWESOME!  I hate what happened but the characters and the language are so incredible.  Thank God for public TV!
B0095P33IW|5.0|Despite being relevant to modern audiences, this movie captures the mood of the WWII times very well.  Perhaps not everyone was quite as eager to sign up as the hero, but there was a great deal of patriotism and enthusiasm.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Sean Patrick is an outstanding writer who keeps your attention with every word.  His book on Tesla is intelligent, informative, and enjoyable.  Getting to know Nikola Tesla gave great insight into the great man I have always heard about. Sean's treatise on genius is superb.<br />Thank you do writing.
B0094M2SCI|4.0|Underworld is a great source of inspiration for those who enjoy role-playing games based on vampires and werewolves, whether LARP, tabletop, or computer.
B000K8EQ5W|3.0|it was okay i liked it, especially the little twist at the end which i didn't see coming so overall it was good entertainment.
B0011FL7FA|5.0|great beatle music and a wonderful story line you will watch this over and over again and the sound track is worth buying.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|I liked this CD from the first time I listened to it.  I've played it over and over and never get tired of hearing the songs.  Wagon Wheel is a great sing-a-long song either in the car or at home.  In my opinion, Darius Rucker has one of the greatest voices in music.  I've loved him since his Hootie and the Blowfish days and now as a country singer.  His voice is smooth and easy to listen to.  Great CD!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This was a typical Grisham double-crosser. Less legal-oriented and more adventure. A fun read for those daydreaming of life in the fast lane.
B004P7CNE0|5.0|Great action, acting, concept. I really think Chris Bale is the best actor out there. He really needs more parts. His energy is not to be toyed with. Put it to work. Action packed.
B0085YOD1A|3.0|I thought this app would have more deatil to it just show how much battery u have. I don't ghik its worth 99 cents I got it for the free app of the day
B0034G4OXQ|2.0|This was a disappointment to me. I exspected more from the film. Matt Damon did not have his whole heart in this one. Found it boreing, and a bit slow. Was not meaty enough. Matt needs to stick to more action films. Those are believable.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have always wanted to to get this so I finally did and I don't regret it. It is awesome!!! It works great on my kindle fire.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is simple by design but do not let that fool you. It requires some finesse with the gas and brake to traverse the terrain without injuring the driver.
B000T46O52|5.0|I consider this one of the best all-time movies.  I have watched it multiple times and always enjoy it.  I'm not sure &#34;enjoy&#34; is really the right word, but meaningful and thought provoking.  Both Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington deliver outstanding performances.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I have bought four or more of this particular case. I like it so much that I buy it for everyone I know that has a 4/4S.  I wish this same case was available for the iPhone 5. The frost case for the iPhone 5 is not the same and not as great. This case fits like a glove, provides great protection, and is made of TPU and slips easily into anywhere, any pocket without picking up pocket lint or other lint.  I would suggest this case to all. A+++
B000WDSZ8E|5.0|I have seen all the seasons and I love How I met your mother! Its funny and just a good show to watch
B0053O89JM|5.0|I own all the other seasons of House so this is a great addition to my others and it being the last season even better.

B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Nothing that I expected but better!  It made me laugh out loud and brought tears to my eyes.  Loved it!
B004SBX112|5.0|Lots of fun.  Great game to play on down time.  Angry Birds never lets you down!  Alway a good time.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|I read the reviews and decided to download this  game. I love this little guy. Started playing and couldn't put it down. The grafics &amp; controlls are great. My grandchildren are going to love it also. I can just hear us laughing. I like it that the pictures are not little and see them. PERFECT and FUN.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|This is a wonderful movie for anyone with kids or just a kid at heart. Its such a great movie and my kids and grandkids love it!
B00AEFYS8G|3.0|Let me first state I am a HUGE Sergio Leone fan.  Perhaps one of the BIGGER ones of the western genre.  When I found out he did another western (this one), I was ecstatic and bought it.  Sadly Leone tries so hard to break from what made his other westerns a success that this one snakes in and out of brilliance, mediocrity and finally boredom.  There are two main plot lines, Sweetwater Ranch and the mysterious relationship between Charles Bronson and Peter Fonda. The Bronson/Fonda scenes save this movie from being 2 stars. They are classic Leone, brilliantly done and Ennio Morricone's music is better than ever in the final showdown.  Both actors are excellent in their roles!<br /><br />The other major plot is just weak.  It's long, uninteresting, convoluted and downright boring.  Don't get me wrong, watching this I even said to myself &#34;wow he finally got a decent budget&#34; and the set pieces, music and visuals are outstanding for a western.  It just doesn't help that it takes so long to get from point a to point b in this major plot line though.  Leone screwed the pooch by trying to be un-Leone in his last &#34;true&#34; western (even though his next Duck, you Sucker! one is a pseudo western). Sadly the movie as a whole does not hold up due to this and is uneven.  Watch For a Few Dollars More or The Good, the Bad and the Ugly before this if you want to appreciate Leone's work.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love this book it was amazing ..I'm hoping for more of the hunger games please write something like mockingjay part 2
B000PC6Z48|4.0|Excellent score, great visuals!  The opening scene, the Gatling gun battle are epic as is the finale.  It gets a little tedious and slightly confusing with the whole Mexican banditos gorilla army middle set piece, but get over that and you can see why this movie has inspired the passions it has.  From Reservoir Dogs cutting off the ear to the first bounty hunter in Star Wars being named Jango to the brilliantly done Django Unchained, which pays homage to this heavily one must see this to appreciate why it is such a cult classic.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I think it was great not that bad news and events in the game people<br />buy little bit more of the people and more little blue balls not seeds.
B000QGAU4E|5.0|Not for the faint of heart or main stream utopists.  Cuar&oacute;n was brilliant with this piece of work. Most dystopians  stick with the standard script...Nuclear holocausts, mass viruses, pandemics and epidemics, and catastrophes. This was an exposition of the situations that we deal with in world crises.  Almost a mere caricature of the \\"global incidences\\" that occur and how we negotiate each event as individuals and \\"mass populations\\" (collectively--no reference to communism rather to our mutual existences).  Categorical and dialectic, yet precipitous and cumulative I would not recommend this feature for those who are seeking Mayan prophecy of annihilation or a large reoccurring meteor that repetively threatens humanity.  This movie is entirely hypothetical, and illustrative, and a new and extraneous perspective on human behavior.
B000FA5STS|5.0|Keeps you on the edge of your seat not knowing who to believe or who are good or bad guys. You keep wanting Jason to be alive
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|This is a nice little app that even tells you the day which is great because I forget sometimes......but I also like to use the overnight thing so I can listen to music and have the clock screen up at the same time so I don't lose battery.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I had the free version of this game and was frustrated when, just as I was hitting my stride, I couldn't continue unless I bought the full version. I resisted for a few months as I hate being coerced but finally purchased it. So glad I did!! It's a great game with an interesting plot and clear graphics. I haven't finished the game yet but I am looking forward to it!!
0307352153|5.0|This is a nice combination of research and easy reading.  Maybe I enjoyed it a lot because it validated many of my own opinions.  Business is dominated by those who talk the most and don't necessarily have the best ideas.  As a teacher for many years, I also knew that cooperative learning wasn't for everyone. This was my Book Club selection for this month and I'm looking forward to the discussion.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I can't wait for more Gideon and Eva! I know there will be many more trials for them to prove their love is undying as they have time and time again.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|Like many others have already stated, this is a fun set of pinball tables. Prepare for giving up some time enjoying this on your device. Kindle fire HD works well. Not sure what else to tell you to meet minimum response.
0765337541|5.0|I read this back years ago when it first was published.  The my husband read it and loved it.  Then, to try to increase my son's reading when he was a preteen, we gave it him.  We're all hooked on the series.
B007N8RULO|4.0|It's different.  Makes you think a little harder as least for me.  Sometimes I need a different game to play
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I like having music playing in the background when I do other things on my kindle.  With this relax melodies app I think I could even use this with going to bed.  Great tunes, and the fact that I control what to play is the best.

B000LTAY1U|5.0|Great quality at a ridiculously low price....much more than one would expect for an item &#34;On Sale!&#34;<br />I own a blue strapped, blue-faced and the OD version, as well.....strong stuff for general use and quite an anti-fashion statement for those of us who believe that wrist jewelry need not be bulbous or multi-functional to an obtuse degree.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I've been through all kinds of weather & I have family that lives in tornado country so I like to keep up with what's going on.
0425263924|3.0|The good news is there is more to come about Gideon and Eva!  I love them as a couple and in this book they evolve more as a couple, less stress more playfulness.  The dialogue is fantastic..she is feisty and funny, he is strong, commanding and starting to loosen up!  And as for the sex, really hot!  Here is why my review &#34;evened out to 3 stars&#34;....this book had less memorable scenes.  Far less turning points in the story...beyond the obvious big moment for them as a couple towards the end it was like other reviewers said &#34;filler&#34;.  And too much story was given to side characters..the love lives of Megumi, Mark and Cary took away and sidetracked from the progression of the story.  Who ever came up with the idea ..whether it was the publisher or Sylvia Day to drag this out to 5 books gambled wrong.  It's great to know there is more Crossfire to come but not at the expense of the readers.  This is one of the more expensive kindle books and now to have to wait again for their story was a poor decision.  This book did just up and end ..so it is obvious it is being dragged out.  I love the way Gideon and Eva's story is written just disappointed that this 3rd book didn't deliver a bit more.

B000063TE5|5.0|Growing up with my father listening to Cat Stevens, Jim Croce, America, Paul Simon and the like on an old turntable weekend mornings when we would stir from our beds and slowly move about the morning... I've yearned for something in my generation to match those experiences. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is that album. Quiet yet upbeat, introspective in some places bouncy in others this album is perfect to get your body and mind moving. Not originally a fan of Wilco, I am Trying to Break Your Heart (1st track) hooked me into the album which grew on me... And the album hooked me on Wilco. Personally this is still my favorite album. The Vinyl version comes with CD so you can have those Vinyl Morning Moments or skip off and listen about. Highly Recommended!

B008M7JODC|4.0|The concept is that personal IQ to the extreme allows some people to do extraordinary things, both moral and immoral, and that a balance exists between good and evil.  Impossible evil things occur yet one man is able to say what caused such things and allows to end the evil summarily.  Its a chase series beginning to end. Acting and filming were well done and that keeps your interest for awhile.  Of course the corporation and its massive wealth is the root of all evil so conspiracy theorists will love this one.
159463176X|5.0|Hosseini weaves another tale--actually, intermoingled, intergenerational tales-- that lend insights into his native land AND the human nature we all share.

B00006WKSZ|5.0|Excellent example of European rock at its best... I've seen them live, and they deliver. They don't make bands like this any more.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I got this for my wife, who is a Friends fan, and she loved this gift. The way the discs are organized is a tad bit strange at first, but it is better than each season having it's own box because it saves A LOT of space. Our friends have all the seasons with each season having it's own box, and it is huge. The packaging of this is great.
B008Y6QBMS|5.0|Hilarious from start to finnish. This movie is great for the whole family. If you have not seen this film het you are in for a real treat.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I liked this book through about 80% then it began to go in circles and just ended.  I didn't feel any satisfaction in the ending, nothing was resolved to my satisfaction. When the end lets you hang with the story unresolved to my satisfaction its not a good read.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|This book was so good. I loved the different point of views about the situations that they went through. It was very inspiring and makes you want to be a better person. To be &#34;kinder than necessary.&#34;

B001AQT0RC|5.0|Since everyone else has already provided their summaries of the storyline, their opinions on the acting and everything else, I will, as I always do, only focus upon the quality of the transfer of this film to Blu Ray.<br /><br />VIDEO....It just goes to show you that you don't need the highest Mbps rate to create a good transfer of the video to Blu Ray.  The Mbps rate varies from the high teens to low thirties depending upon the action's needs.  Forget all that, how does it look?  This is one of the very best transfers of video I have seen.  Absolutely no artifacting, no motion blurs which would have been real easy to see for many of the scenes in this movie and no false colors either.  The colors created in post production are simply beautiful to look at and skin tones are spot on.  There were a couple of scenes where the contrast was so good, it was almost like watching it in 3D.  Contrast throughout the entire film is excellent and I do believe this transfer could and should be used as a DEMO worthy disc.  I do not have this film on Standard Def DVD so this review is not a comparison and I can not say whether or how much they did any remastering but the video is just gorgeous.<br /><br />AUDIO....The lossless PCM 5.1 audio shows how much audio editors can do when they put their minds to it.  There is a full usage of both the front and rear stages as well as many scenes of discreet channeling between the rears and front as well as pans of audio all around.  The very first scene will wake up your audio system and let it know it has some work to do.  The LFE channel is not called upon as often but it gets its own workout in many scenes. The dialogue is clean and very transient and transparent.  Audio levels are set properly so you will not have to roller coaster your remote's volume control.  If you know your chapters with this film, the audio is also, totally demo worthy.<br /><br />Extras consisted of making of documentaries cut to individual chapters mostly focusing upon how they created the various composite scenes in the film for special fx.  Also included were two trailers and 3 different commentaries( a touch of overkill IMHO)  Also included was a music only audio track.<br /><br />I bought this film on a lark, hadn't seen it in years but now am very glad I did.<br /><br />All my reviews focus solely on the quality of the transfers to Blu Ray of both video and audio and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase decisions and that I am on the correct path with this type of review.<br />Thanks for reading.ing upon how they created the various composite scenes in the film for special fx.

B0044C3RB4|5.0|J.J. Abrams is a talented storyteller.  The actors are great.  They convey so much story with facial expressions or the movement of their bodies.  I love the interaction between the characters.  The stories are great, even the second time around!

B005K0HDGE|4.0|I really liked this book. It was an interesting idea to contemplate. If we could go back in time and change the outcome of some &#34;watershed&#34; event, how would it affect the future. Would it improve the world, or cause a plethora of problems. Good read.  Liked the history, too.
B005SAJJHM|5.0|In other word you can watch it over and over, and still find some thing new every time. This makes a great show.

B001AIG41K|5.0|checked these guys out on amazon bought the firewater album bought this one on my next order.both cds are great.more people should know about these southern bands.Whiskey Myers, Turnpike Troubadors ,Blackberry Smoke we should be hearing this stuff on the airwaves.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|After so much anticipation this was a flop. Big time. I found myself skimming a lot of it just to try and figure out where the story was going, but there was no depth. It was just a bunch of redundant sex scenes and an abrupt ending. I won't read the next in this &#34;trilogy&#34; so disappointed. Ugh.
B00CX7OX6U|5.0|The first time I watched To the Wonder I was underwhelmed. The film appeared to verge on self-parody, with Terrence Malick's penchant for long silences, meditative voiceovers and random rambles by the protagonists making the film come off as offcuts from the directionless Tree of Life.<br /><br />The second time I watched it I found myself pulled in Malick's world. The cinematography is gorgeous, almost every scene painstakingly constructed, poignant and beautiful. The back-story of Javier Bardem's priest whose faith is tested daily by a life of solitude and service among the poor and suffering was both sad and inspiring.<br /><br />It's not an easy film. It subtly raises hard philosophical questions without providing easy answers, and it leaves you with a sense of unease as the final credits begin to roll.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|If you're like me, then you have been waiting with bated breath for seven months for Entwined With You, the third book in the Crossfire series by Sylvia Day. You counted down the weeks, the days and even the minutes until you could reunite with Gideon Cross and Eva Trammel. When the book appeared on my e-reader I screamed with excitement. As I began reading, I fell in love with Gideon and Eva all over again. Entwined With You was definitely worth the wait.<br /><br />Gideon Cross is not your average romance hero. Sure he's gorgeous and a billionaire. But he's quite flawed. As a child he was molested and he still bears the emotional scars from not only the abuse, but his family's denial of the abuse. Eva Trammell is also a flawed individual. She too suffered childhood sexual abuse at the hands of her stepbrother.  Each is amazed to find someone who loves them despite their past which causes them to be insecure in their relationship. It is this insecurity that provides a lot of the drama in Entwined With You.<br /><br />Entwined With You picks up just two weeks after Reflected By You. Gideon and Eva have to work through the murder of Eva's abuser and Gideon's role in his death. Several of Gideon's exes also add to the drama as does Eva's ex-boyfriend. But the story's main focus is their evolving relationship. Eva and Gideon worked on their commitment and their efforts paid off as they get closer and closer.<br /><br />There is a lot of sex in Entwined With You, and I mean a lot of sex. Gideon and Eva connect emotionally through their physical contact. Gideon needs it to bind Eva to him and Eva needs it to know that Gideon loves her despite her past. Ms. Day is a master at describing the passion and heat that her characters feel.  But Entwined With You is not just about the sex. Eva and Gideon have an important relationship outside of the bedroom. Their relationship is built on mutual love and respect. Gideon loves Eva's mind as much as her body. Eva loves Gideon's generosity, thoughtfulness and more that are part of his personality that only few are privileged to see.<br /><br />Entwined With You is absolutely not a standalone. There is too much history with the characters to follow the novel without reading Bared To You and Reflected In You.<br /><br />Some of the complaints of Entwined With You are that additional drama has been added to create material for more books. I must disagree. Yes, there was more drama, but all the new issues that were raised seem a natural extension of the storyline. In fact, it seemed to make more sense that things would not be conveniently wrapped up and Ms. Day has successfully added additional layers to the story that intrigued me.<br /><br />If you are expecting happily ever after at the end of Entwined with You then you will be disappointed. Entwined With You does conclude with Eva and Gideon together so there is no relationship cliffhanger. Several storylines have been wrapped up, but there are enough new ones and new questions to fill up another book. And in fact, Ms. Day has announced on her website that Entwined With You is not the last book in the series, but that she actually has plans for two more books. And while this may leave you frustrated, the good news is that we don't have to say goodbye to Gideon and Eva. That is certainly cause for celebration because I have grown to care for these two damaged but passionate people. I just hope that the wait is not as long this time.erosity, thoughtfulness and more that are part of his personality that only few are privileged to see.<br /><br />Entwined With You is absolutely not a standalone. There is too much history with the characters to follow the novel without reading Bared To You and Reflected In You.<br /><br />Some of the complaints of Entwined With You are that additional drama has been added to create material for more books. I must disagree. Yes, there was more drama, but all the new issues that were raised seem a natural extension of the storyline. In fact, it seemed to make more sense that things would not be conveniently wrapped up and Ms. Day has successfully added additional layers to the story that intrigued me.<br /><br />If you are expecting happily ever after at the end of Entwined with You then you will be disappointed. Entwined With You does conclude with Eva and Gideon together so there is no relationship cliffhanger. Several storylines have been wrapped up, but there are enough new ones and new questions to fill up another book. And in fact, Ms. Day has announced on her website that Entwined With You is not the last book in the series, but that she actually has plans for two more books. And while this may leave you frustrated, the good news is that we don't have to say goodbye to Gideon and Eva. That is certainly cause for celebration because I have grown to care for these two damaged but passionate people. I just hope that the wait is not as long this time.
B004SKQAJI|3.0|This CD was OK, not quite as good as the first one.  The original seemed to be longer with more dancing.
B00BHMF578|5.0|I remember this time in history well and the celebration that took place after all the hostages were released from Iran, but was not aware of the story behind this group of Americans in the take over of the American Embassy in Iran during the Carter adminstration.<br />If you like true stories of real people in unusual circumtances with unexpected heros this it.  Compelling is an understatement.
B00BJDARA0|2.0|I was excited to hear the new songs live, I own EVERYTHING Mr Coverdale has ever released and, some bootlegs , The sound quality is great BUT< the band is tuned down a full step from standard tuning, Most non-musicians would not notice this, and as a singer myself understand the purpose , But, it ruins the integrity of  The songs. It makes it sound more like Knickleback, and, that is not a good thing.. I wish I would have not purchased
B0041D843M|5.0|Most provocative book on nutrition I have ever read  Now to make the change after a life time of meat, potatoes, and gravy
B0052RDHTM|3.0|It,s a good book, but I had already read and did not realize it until I started reading it on the Kindle.
B003O86FMW|5.0|To what seemed to be just an excuse to make some extra revenue the slow start to the book kept me at bay.  Luckily I was wrong! I didn't put it down unless I had to use the bathroom or couldn't keep my eyes open any longer. Exceptional!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Little glitchy sometimes but overall it is a nice app, easy to navigate. I do not recommend setting as automatic update, it seems to want to update a lot.
B00AH8FTT2|3.0|The plot was very predictable, and the book was very short.  I bought the kindle edition because it was cheaper; but I really don't see spending $18 for a three hour read!<br /><br />I'd only suggest reading it to get some closure; but get it from the library, it's a waste of money.
B006Z9SP3E|5.0|Having read Chronicle 1 at a normal pace, and it having left me with the cliffhanger, I jumped into this book with a passion. Characters well developed. Unexpected twists. Typical Archer.
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|Like a previous reviewer said I loved the first three books but then got a little bored, but this amazing author has come back with a vengeance.  Excellent book which it was longer just so I could still read about this amazing couple. PS love the angel series too
B00AKFG15S|5.0|I am sure a fourth chronicle will come. I read the second and third in about four days - cancelled sleep! Another cliffhanger ending.
B00CWVFZ8W|1.0|Everything about this movie is just terrible. The cast may be the only exception not counting the two main \\"love birds.\\" I wish I never rented this movie...
B004XVN1T4|4.0|Typical Follett. Fast-paced, astonishing with all the usual double twists. I enjoy Follett's writing and chose this book because it was Follett. He did not disappoint me.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Was fast pase and entertaining ,ended well ,  but it just didn't have the kick that some of the other Harris books have .
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is so fun to play. I play it all night n day. the hard part is when you have to run from the cop.
B008RJ6TTC|4.0|I love Colombo, and this set has them all. Every episode AND every movie?!? You Crazy Amazon. The show is set up as a reverse whodunit(you see who commits the crime in the beginning)  and you spend the rest of the episode watching Peter Faulk try to gather enough evidence through his false ineptitude to catch his murderer. Forget about police procedure and your rights (I don't think a single person was ever mirandized  before confessing to every detail) the show is just fun to watch.
B003M6FGTE|1.0|Fiancée forced me to watch this, at first I felt a little weird inside so I went to the doctor and found out it gave me cancer.
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|I am enjoying the new or old outlook on the Fae and the different powers they have.  It is so interesting and entertaining. Love the program.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really enjoy playing subway surfers and I like how there are daily challenges and missions and you can unlock different characters.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I am sooo upset that you made us wait all this time and never really told us anything? Then only thing that really happened in this book was Eva  and G had lots of sex.  The way you ended the book was just wrong.
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS GAME IS DA BOMB! I absolutely love it I play minecraft all the time. Once I start I just can't stop playing.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Great game.  With so much going on, it keeps you interested, and definitely on your toes. The battles to defend your kids kingdom are fast-paced and engaging. I recommend this game 100%! You won't be disappointed.
1781162646|5.0|This is a different side of Stephen King that is terrific reading.  Just received on the 4th.  Ordered early, cause i was dying too read it first.  So far, so great.  The whole Amusement thing is scary period.  Plus, I live at the Jersey shore and as a kid in the winter when the amusements were closed a lot of wierdness went on.  That's a book right there!  &#34;Carneval of Souls&#34;  like I couldnt believe it when i read it, much less saw the movie.  This is definently on the Mickey Spillane side.  Once again, King rates.  And the next time I get to the city I want to see that play he wrote w/ John Mellencamp & some one else.  Mellencamp & King 2 peas in a pod!  Another Tower book in the making?  Shining next for me.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game was fun and lasted for a while. I only gave it 4 stars because a few of the animation scenes did not play, including the final scene when I finished the game. I played on a kindle fire HD.
B00CO6QGCE|5.0|This app is amazing and I believe that if this app stays this good u will get a hole lot more buyers
B00628SJJS|3.0|Wonderful but sad book. Book was superior to the movie by far. Read the book first before you watch the movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The Most Amazing Game I Have Ever Played In My Life So You Should Play This Game Its Very Addicting
B00AHSGNJM|4.0|Ordered for my GRANDKIDS but find myself watching it too. Relaxing funny and up beat for all ages and a feel good movie
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I am so tired of this new trend of publishing books in serial form.  I would call it a trilogy trend, but Sylvia Day had to ruin that too.  Yes, I am another reader irritated that the trilogy is now a five-ology or whatever.  I like romances because they have a happy ending, emphasis on the ending.  I try not to buy books that are part of a set about the same couple, and waited to buy this series until now.  So much for that plan.<br /><br />Beyond the fact that the whole thing annoys me, there parts of this book that I really liked, I admit.  But I am done with Gideon and Eva.  I would probably give this book a three star, except it deserves a one star for the bait and switch.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I have always love pac-man and to be able to still play with a Arcade machine is awesome.... Great to be relaxing and playing
B009UAO1ZG|2.0|Having read Olson's &#34;Troubesome Young Men&#34; about pre-war Britain, I was disappointed with &#34;Those Angry Days.&#34; To be sure Olson covers the very public fight between Roosevelt and his interventionist allies( along with British Intelligence) against the leading isolationists of the day, Charles Lindberg and Burton Wheeler, she leaves much out. Phillip Roth covered similar material in his 2004 novel, &#34;The Plot Against America&#34; which handled the subject with greater acuity.<br /><br />My  main problem with the book is that Olson avoids the role of the Communist Party and their fellow travellers in their anti-Nazi phase up to August 1939, their isolationist phase from August 1939 - June 1941 and their all out intervention phase from June 1941 as they diligently followed Moscow's orders. Thus she paints the false picture that isolationism was solely a creature of the political right, when in fact the political left was a very active force for isolationism for most ofthe period she covers.<br /><br />As an example Pete Seeger and Woody Guthrie have cameo roles as the great folk singers that they were; they hardly innocent of the machinations coming from the party line. She also leaves out the role of the American Peace Mobilization which was a party front group. Parenthetically the tactics used in 1940 were replicated by the anti-vietnam protestors of the 1960s.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I chose the rating because I really ,really like this one too . It really get you to think.A fun game to play while relaxing.
1781162646|3.0|This is an entertaining book, but contains a fairly significant plot flaw that should have been caught by King or his editor Charles Ardai. Without going into detail and spoiling the plot, a character urgently needs to use a phone number at a climactic moment on page 256, but can't get it because it's unlisted. King seems to have forgotten that the character already had the phone number on page 192. Sounds minor, but it's VERY important at the moment in question. One line saying the number had been misplaced would have taken care of it, but instead alert readers are left annoyed.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|This is a good LITTLE bag for a small collection of equipment.<br />I carry a Nikon 5100 with lens, an extra lens, a yongnuo flash, and a twelve pack of AA batteries. I still have an entire side with three compartments. There is room for another 10 vertical inches of lens or flash. The dividers are padded Velcro so the size can be adjusted. This is all in the main body. There are still several Velcro and zipper pouches for lens clothes, rocket blowers, sd cards, and other nick nacks to carry.<br />The problem is the backpack is small. It does not fit on my back. Across my back it is very small. Like wearing a child's backpack. I wear it with one shoulder stap only. If I am walk a distance I will connect the waist strap. I wear a 46 inch jacket and if I get both shoulder straps on I can not put my shoulders forward. The chest strap is a joke, 3 inches short. The waist strip is at the bottom of my rib cage. This is really only wearable if your assistant is eight.<br />I would buy a full size bag and carry it around mostly empty.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I really don't write to many reviews for movies! but I certainly read them before I rent one. So I felt that this movie needs a review to help those on the fence about renting or not. If you like zombie stuff, then you will like this different view of zombies. If you are a zombie purist them you man not like it. If you are looking for a complete complicated story line then keep moving. This movie is entertaining and one to add to the movie zombie list if you liked movies like Shane of the Dead.
031603441X|5.0|one of my very long time idols; it was so great to find out his history, songwriting and family life.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|I love this movie and the best part is that my 2 year old love it and will actually sit still and watch it when we go to doctor apptments.
0547884591|2.0|Received the Book Quickly via Amazon...<br /><br />Good book if you're looking for a mini-encyclopedia of how to Show-off or be cool...This is basically a capture of interviews of &#34;100 Best of the World&#34;, each case study in 2 pages, in some cases without regard to personal or medical safety, apply learning with caution, and research (Fortunately ran one past doctors and they noted cautions). Would have given a higher rating if it had the appropriate medical or safety precautions on the appropriate pages. See the other critical reviews of this book, and you'll get a better flavor of the book.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I choose this cd to give it like a present to my mommy. She loves the music of Andrea Bocelli, and it is the last album.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Best game ever you must have this game for you or your little kids or for your friends tell them to tell there friends.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Best cd he has done in a long time  ,,he is back to what he does best..<br />I would buy it again .
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|I bought this for my grandkids as they had just gotten a 3D TV.  While I am not normally a fan of 3D this movie was quite impressive in 3D.  Their ages are 5 & 9 so it is often hard to get something they both can enjoy -- this one seemed to do the trick.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I've never been much of a believer in the binaural beats theory of behavioral affectation, but if that's your thing, then this app is a competent and comprehensive choice for you.  There's a lot of content here and it's conveniently laid out in an easy to use format. Starting a sound loop is an easy touch of a button, but I sometimes found it difficult to turn off a sound because I had to find it through so many screens of icons to touch it again.
B0051BVQFG|1.0|This, quite simply, one of THE worst movies I've ever seen. Boring, stupid, loud, pointless, cardboard characters, crap special FX.  Have I mentioned that this is one of THE worst movies I've ever seen? Okay, then.
B009CRJLHU|5.0|Who does't dream of taming a bad boy with \\"our\\" love.  Great read, with moments of heartache, tension, and finally homecoming.  A must read!
1933492929|5.0|This was a birthday present for my daughter who loves to draw. She couldn't put it down. The book contains tons of inspiration for animals and fantasy creatures both in a realistic and cartoony styles. Great quality printing and and great content.
B00992CF6W|4.0|you should get this app. it's worth the cost. but if you have it on kindle fire it updates late
B00992CF6W|5.0|I hate how people are ranting about how they have not made the new update for kindle fire. You should already know that they always come out a few days later than ipod and iPad. This a great game for people who have a big imagination.
B0081336FO|5.0|Always like sherlock, limited episodes, but always keeps one thinking.<br />I think there is more to the season than just a few cases.. build up for?
B003PM5Y4M|5.0|One of my favorite movies, especially when watched on my kindle fire HD.  Robert Downey JR's portrayal is amazing.  There are soooo many quotes get me laughing....  &#34;I'm a Lead Farmer M****F&&&&R!&#34;
B00499NHLC|5.0|Sherlock always leaves one guessing.. or thinking.<br />Wish there were more episodes to this series, but so far there are only a *very* limited number.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|I went into watching this movie knowing little about it, I'm not sure I ever watched a full trailer, and I like it that way. This movie was such an adventure, it is everything and more I have been wanting in a movie lately. I found myself lying on my stomach, hugging a pillow, and smiling through the entire movie.
B008602KQI|5.0|This is an amazing movie...even better if you've read the books and you know the whole story.  I really can't say anything else other than that I love it...love the characters...it's wonderful!!!!!!
B009R9WB34|2.0|Rihanna's follow-up to the dance-tastic &#34;Talk That Talk&#34; fails to live up to its predecessor. Instead of songs that belong on a lively party playlist (&#34;We Found Love&#34;, &#34;Where Have You Been&#34;), the songs included on &#34;Unapologetic&#34; can be downright depressing at times- in the dubstep-inspired ballad &#34;What Now?&#34;, Rihanna sings &#34;And there's no one to call 'cause I'm just playing games with them all&#34;. Albeit a good line, that pretty much sums up the vibe of this album. Yes, there are the standard, hedonistic dance-pop tunes like &#34;Jump&#34; and &#34;Right Now&#34;, but they lack the sparkle and pure fun of songs like &#34;We Found Love&#34;- this formula is getting worn out, in my opinion. And there's also the auto-tuned messes of &#34;Loveeeeee Song&#34; and &#34;Phresh Off the Runway&#34;, which grind on listeners' ears and are straight-up dislikeable. That's not to say this album doesn't have its standouts- I personally love &#34;Love Without Tragedy&#34; and &#34;Half Of Me&#34;, although that's probably because Emeli Sande co-wrote &#34;Half Of Me&#34; so it was bound to be a great ballad. Regardless of its standouts, this album isn't worth purchasing the entire thing- I reccommend &#34;Love Without Tragedy&#34; and &#34;Half Of Me&#34;.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I Decided to pay for it because I enjoy the show so much it was a little perk for me!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love that it gives you the warnings from the NOAA weather center. The quick links give you the latest weather updates.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I recently lost about eighty pounds. Which is great, but unfortunately I didn't tone up. I needed something that would kick my body into gear and this video is it. I'm on my seventh day and you can see noticeable changes. It's hard but if you want your body to change its a great start. I mix this 20-25 minute workout with her No More Trouble Zones Dvd and the results are amazing.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Cool game, reminds me of Super Mario bros, pretty cool and chill game when there isn't anything else to do (X
B001230RKC|4.0|This album is a must have if you like Jackson Browne for the load out and stay if nothing else, it's a great track live about the roadies cleaning up after the show. There are several great tracks on here but I bought it for that one as it never seems to end up on a compilation album.
0307951529|5.0|IF you want a book that tells it how it is without the motivational fluff but is still informative at the same time, this is the book you will want to read.<br />I am not yet a business owner but this book has shown me more insights than the many business breakfasts I have attended and the other books I have read.<br />It discusses real peoples journeys. The ones that worked, and the ones that didnt.<br />I have already passed it on to family and friends and that have already recommended it to others. The most underated random book I have ever read.Worth it!
B0040GURF8|4.0|If you like like John Mayer you will like this love compilation. He covers most of the hits plus covers a few hits of others well. He does a nice job live and it's pretty true to the studio versions on most o them.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This game is pretty good. This game has some pretty good graphics and a good game play. so I'm giving this game 5 star's
B00B1MHXY2|5.0|There are some great pre Rumors Fleetwood albums don't get me wrong. Peter Green was great with them and some if the early stuff is fantastic, but this is the one that put them on the map. The addition of Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham and the love triangle that occurred with them and Mick Fleetwood sparked some of the best writing in that genre. It is a no misser if you like them at all not a single b side song on this one.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|This game is fun and addictive i wish i could play all day but id rather play Dragon story ok
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|This game is strange yet fun. Not really sure I like it but can't stop playing! Poor tutorial-weird to follow at first the scoring system.
0440238153|5.0|I Bought this book for my son. He was so excited!!! He has read a lot of Philip Pullman's books. He could not put the book down until he finished it.
B00066VMC8|1.0|I have been searching high and low for this DVD, it is a collectors items and something I planned to treasure deeply. When I received the disc, one which, mind you, I paid almost $40 dollars for, it was not able to play on any of my DVD or Blu-Ray players because of compatability issues. This was highly disappointing. I now have an extremely fancy visual reminder of what might have been, and if I ever go to Europe, I will rest easy knowing I can play this disc, the so called PAL, on the televisions of any friends I may make. For future reference and in the interest of disclosure, please put what format the DVD is in, so before spending this kind of money, I can see what I am getting into. Thank you and remember, were it not for the formless, queer and half educated, the horizon would not wear so wide a grin. . .
B005GIS1WA|5.0|This was a great movie I could watch with<br />my 8-year-old daughter ...!movies from this genre are fewer. & forger between to come Long, so I'm glad I gave amazon prime & a Roku player !
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|My 11 year old son loves this!  It is sometimes difficult to find books in his &#34;reading range&#34; for school.  Some books are inappropriate for his age level, but they need to read books in a certain grade range.  This was great, he read it and stayed interested, and received a perfect score on his &#34;AR quiz&#34;.  He is now looking forward to completing the series just in time for the summer reading requirements.  Thanks!!
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|This is a great blend of characters you can care about, multi-level story telling, and stunning visuals while giving the viewer a clear insight into what life was like for the Vikings. There has been precious little accessible content on this subject before but this truly does justice to the subject matter.
B001F6ZIXW|4.0|It is entertaining and keeps me wanting to come back...like season one very much!!!  The characters are very real and Donna's end??  No way...
B000I3SYEI|5.0|I loved this movie. It takes place years after the original encounter with Khan. Will keep you on the edge of your seat if you have never seen it. This is truly a classic.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I love Sylvia cross series however, the end of this book was totally wrong in so many ways. The second book inform her fans that this was the end and now just when you think you will learn the end she comes up with this. wrong Sylvia. You will lose me as a reader because I do not get to the end of the fifth book and learn there is a six. Enough is enough
B009FZHYKU|5.0|After 3 season you would think it would get old, but this show just keeps on finding new ways to play this out. I have not read the graphic novel so it is all new to me. They finally got out of that freaking farm in season 2, now they have new people to deal with and new scenarios to spin from season 3. I do hope they leave the prison though, a few of the crew who came there will stay, but they need to move on. I can't believe a walker can still gross me out and make me jump after 3 seasons, but on occasion they do. Bravo WD team.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|It helps me when I'm studying or maybe reading a book so I know how much time I have left. There is no  flaws really except that it will glitch and go bad.
B009R659L8|4.0|Even if the subject matter is about some killings. There are great reading and positive good people in her books
B009HNDCC4|5.0|The actors, writers, and plots, stay consistant in the 4th season;  a good thing, as you still feel connected to the characters, and their world.  If you liked the past seasons, season 4 won't let you down.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|Love this album! Every song is great, but my faves are Tessellate and Breezeblocks. Beautiful music and I love the way he sings the lyrics. Very different! Love it!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|When I need to order anything, I go to eBay first.  It's so easy to click, look & order.  They make paying a breeze & if you can't find it on eBay, you don't need it, haha.  Love eBay!!!
159463176X|4.0|I liked the book, but before you read it be warned - this is a rambling story, moving through literally decades and widely disparate geography before finally tying together the ends. At some points, you think \\"this is interesting, but is it going anywhere? Is it connected to anything?\\". Not the best book I've read, but the characters are developed well and it's an enjoyable read.
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|A beautiful, compelling story that begs the reader to step outside of the box. It's the best love story I've seen in a long time, and it isn't hard to follow as long as you pay attention and engage yourself.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was incredibly well written and the story well crafted. I liked it so much I read part of it to my mom just to get her interested in reading it. If you haven't read it give it a chance.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|Excellent script.  Captures something essential about that phase of life just as Before Sunrise explored the psyche of the twenty-something.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is a great series, matching fantasy with gritty, believable cases.  Good acting by all, including consistent personalities with just enough comedy.
B001DCQI9G|1.0|Superb performance. Concerning sound quality I ignore whether the original issues are better, this happens quite often. But here is a collection horribly transfered into CD for cheap collectible concertos; sound is compressed so distorted.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I absolutely love this series. If you are a fan of Fifty Shades Grey you will love it too. I actually think that it's better and I can't wait until the next one!
0800141601|5.0|This movie  keeps you captivated all the way through. Very enjoyable and we watch it over and over again and enjoy it each time.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I am a big kid lol. I love playing these kinds of games where you build you own city. It is very addicting for me I could easily spend hours playing this game.
B0064MGU98|5.0|My husband and I both are crazy for this show.  Great character development and always interesting plots.  We can't stop watching it!
0375842209|5.0|This book is set in Munich during WWII.  The narrator is Death or &#34;The Soul Catcher.&#34;  Each character is unforgettable, illustrating the indomitable human spirit of love.  Though we've read much about Germany and the Holocaust, this is a story about an unusual German family, a Jewish man harbored in their home, all set in the heart of Nazi country.  I'm so happy I did not miss this jewel.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I liked the book, it is an easy read with simple, clear instructions.<br /><br />I have recommended it for my friends looking to publish.
B000FC0ZAI|4.0|This is an interesting book... it's actually 6 differnt books, set in 6 different time periods with a thin line running through and combining each story.  As you complete the first half of each of the first 6 stories, you return in reverse order to finish each story and pull them all together.  A fantastic, imaginative read full of mystery, plot twists, and creativity.  The exact opposite of the movie.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Even as a young adult, I really enjoyed this video. The storyline is simple enough for young children to understand and complex enough to entertain older audiences. A great movie to watch with your family or just your friends.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|WOW what a GREAT movie!  I pretty much cried through the whole thing thinking of what these people had to endure during the tsnaumi that devasted Sir Lanka and surrounding islands.  The director absolutely made one feel a part of the tragedy.  It was absolutely realistic!  This is based on one family's true story.  A MUST SEE MOVIE.  5 stars all the way!!!!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This is the best tv series I've seen by far and I would recommend it to all of age people.
B008JJM88Q|3.0|It's fun, just like the old 20Q with people. I must have missed somewhere that it HAS to maintain a connection to the 'net or it won't launch. That's lame. 20Q fit it all into a package smaller than a tennis ball.
B00C7DGRL4|2.0|Well it's sorta gory. Can be amusing in parts but its missing a lot. Like a script. Acting  a clue. Really bad. Save your money. I love horror movies. Unfortunately the trend has been to many special effects and to little sense
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|It was a great read as is all of her books..but I would really like to see this one wrap up..lingering
B000UZNRS2|4.0|This book is one in a series that's a good read.  Must read series in order to understand the characters. First book in series is a slow read, but a must read to follow the series.
B003102IR4|5.0|I really am enjoying the longer versions and instrumentals on familiar songs. Glad I bought it!<br />It's great to hear Bob singing in a slightly different way on some cuts that I was used to hearing on other albums.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|This was a fun book, I enjoyed the writing and trying the experiments. Some I still have not perfected but others I have and it might just change the way you look at reality.Give it a try!
B000I3SYEI|5.0|You've got the great chemistry of the original crew pitted against a pretty awesome villain from the original series, what's not to like.  The story is interesting, action-packed, and suspenseful.  This one and the fourth movie were the best!
B00BPXKWGS|5.0|R.E.M. is brilliant and the music sounds as good today as it did twenty years ago!  Wish they were still making music. .......
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Control is good for kindle but could be better. Game is fun to play and semi addicting. My son hooked me on it.
B003E48AYC|5.0|I love this movie! Came as advertised without any issues and couldn't beat the price I paid for it! Definitely a great movie to see if you haven't!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Truly a book worth reading and while it is not a sequel to The Kite Runner, the setting is the same but 20 years later.

B00AVF8USS|5.0|I love this movie, I have seen it 5 or 6 times.  The extended version is better than this one, it explaines things better.
0060825219|5.0|The subject of romantic obsession evokes very strong passion and emotions in people.  It touches upon our very existence, and awakens deep hope, and terrifying need.  The probabilities are unknown, endless, and limited - all at the same time.  This novel is about all of that, and in Paulo Coelho's BRILLIANTLY CREATIVE STYLE, fully engrosses his reader to go on the journey.  All you have to do is open the first page and begin reading.  Hope, fear, longing, illusions, erotic longings....be prepared for all of it.

0722533942|5.0|Like all of his books, I could not put this down until I was finished.  The Valkyries is an authentic  metaphysical tale of Paulo Coelho's mesmerizing experience with the Light and the Darkness.  In part, he speaks through the voice of a mentally ill woman, as he tells you of his face-to-face meeting with Darkness, and where his search for the Light took him.  Everyone has a personal angel, and Paulo, being extremely sensitive and spiritually aware, journeys to find his own.  The Valkyries were a group of women who had dialogues with their personal angles, that they encountered face to face in the desert.  Paulo is no stranger to the battle of Darkness, and has diligently worked to use the Light that he found to make amends where he had to.  This is a very spiritual book, and is centered on the themes of self-discovery, courage, light, darkness, love, faith, passion, and forgiveness.  Reading it is transformative, and it will have you contemplating your own life, in light of the rich ideas discussed.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Wonderful!!! Loved every minute of it!!! Can't wait for the next book...just hope it doesn't take as long as this one did..
0786880708|5.0|I highly recommend this book to anyone that is seeking contact with their deepest self.  In this beautifully written book, Jon inspires us to experience and embrace the present moment, and the high price we pay for not doing so.  He also reminds us of the inherent value of each breath we take, and the dream that lives in each one.  Jon Kabat-Zinn has thoroughly convinced me to pay attention and listen to my heart. It is so simple and straightforward, laced with wisdom, simplicity, and obvious experience.  A real case to bridge the mind, heart, and soul, lack of which causes so many human ills. This book lays a golden path for you to walk back into the castle where your real self awaits you.  But you can only get there through mindfulness meditation in your everyday life. Are you ready to travel there?

B0071XO8RA|2.0|Not one, not two, but /three/ doomed couples, destroyed by a secret that we learn virtually nothing more about after the initial exposition. Hugh Howey knows how to grab you by the lapels. He then leans in and... spends twelve hours giving you about an hour's worth of story.<br /><br />If, prior to reading this book, you'd told me that being able to pull you in and make you keep reading is not the same thing as being a good storyteller, I'd have called you naive. But what Howey does here is pure mechanism: he doles out story points so incredibly slowly (sometimes a scene adds /nothing at all/ to your understanding) that the perspective changes become excruciating. You have to keep reading because you've already invested in something happening, and when it doesn't happen, you've invested even more time and have to keep reading. I thought, &#34;Surely, a guy who can put the ol' 'Rime of the Ancient Mariner' strangle hold on me this effectively also has a story to tell?&#34;<br /><br />He does. But it's a Barbie-sized blanket on a queen-sized bed. A couple is torn apart because she understands the dark secret of the place and he does not. When he finally follows her, it is too late. We get all of this in a short story that I'd rate at 4.5 stars if it weren't the first section of this particular &#34;omnibus&#34;, so there /is/ a story here. Next, a couple that doesn't know it's a couple is torn apart because she is working out the particulars of this same dark secret and he is not. It is again too late for their love. Finally, a budding couple is torn apart because she is discovering the dark secret and he is apprenticed (far too reluctantly for real dramatic tension) to the guy who keeps that dark secret under wraps.<br /><br />I guess I'm responding in kind, spending far too long talking about this. I don't begrudge him the cyclical nature of the story. I appreciate the setups to the second and third stories, even if the characters feel thin. What frustrates me is that you learn too quickly what the world is about, and nothing ever shakes that up. The &#34;cyclical nature of the story&#34; begins to feel like wheels spinning with no traction. Personally, I like to get somewhere for this kind of time and money.<br /><br />In the immortal words of Dr. Seuss: &#34;My hat is old. My teeth are gold. I have a bird I like to hold. And now my story all is told.&#34;

B0057VDGNK|5.0|most bets are, you are like me and will whip out an extra couple of bucks for this fantastic Soundtrack. Yes, the high-lights of this soundtrack are the remarkably kick-ass 80's songs (which are actually not 80's music!) but the Cliff Martinez music is great as well, but not necessarily for repeated listening. Just push this mother into your car's CD drive and your night rides will never be the same, because now YOU will be &#34;The Driver.&#34;
0060955775|4.0|What is so compelling about Paulo Coelho is that he talks about life issues in a very creative, engaging way.  Life and death have eluded us since the dawn of time.  We are uncomfortable talking about the dark side, including when a person has lost their will or interest to live.  It is healing just to read a book about this subject, where the author is fearless in bringing forth such issues.  Paulo talks about his own struggles, past and present, and that makes him so real and down to earth.  In all his books, and in this one, there is always a message of hope and inspiration.  At the very minimum, it's that there is an author who uses highly creative language to talk about what goes on in everyone's mind at some point.  He just found the words and the means to present it in his uniquely gifted way.<br /><br />-Rivka Edery, M.S.W., L.C.S.W.<br />Author of:  &#34;Hear Me Sing: Book I&#34; (2016)<br />“Trauma and Transformation: A 12-Step Guide” (2013)
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Wow what a great read! Finished in 3 days! Now the waiting game for book 4. Ugh I hate waiting.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Time is not linear.  Time is a wiggley woggley timey wimey thing.  You wouldn't understand unless you saw the show...
B007MNV5WU|1.0|I guess I should have known....I have Kindle Fire, this edition doesn't work with the fire. It's a no go...don't waste your time! Why give the option of using it for the Fire if it doesn't work? Learned a lesson!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I'm not sure why I love the Crossfire series but I do.  So I'm not saying I didn't enjoy the book because I did. However not much really happens in this book. Lots of sex and drama which is great but none of the big issues make much progress or get resolved.  And then Day just ends it! The end of the book is like the end of a chapter. CHEAP!! I feel a bit like she lead me along and shamelessly sucked me into purchasing another book (which I will shamelessly do as soon as it's available darn her)! For a series which always finds it's climax, this one finishes just before you reach the big O.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|I like it better than cut the rope because you don't have to deal with timing. Each level ads new challenges. The 4 star rating is because you have to buy helps. I am relentless in figuring out the 3 star way to beat the level but a child might not be able to progress if they get stuck.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|The story was unveiled nicely.  The protagonist's thoughts were a bit juvenile making this character 's self narrative sound a bit Gumpish as in Forest Gump.  Perhaps he suffered brain damage from ECT?  I would guess a diagnosis of bipolar disorder based on the main character's behavior.  It was hard to believe that he was a history teacher.  Since when do English majors think they are superior to history majors?  I never had a coach teach history.  They usually taught math or chemistry and P.E.  Believe it or not, I liked the book.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This books just leaves you hanging.. of course. It was ok. This series is too drawn out. It seems like the same things keep happening.
B001BZRUR4|5.0|It was a total surprise.  Extremely well written.  Uplifting.  A message for every human being. I want to read more from this author.
B0089OBLDO|3.0|I know adapters for arcade sticks have a bad reputation, but I figured I'd give this one a shot.<br /><br />I bought this mainly so I could use my MadCatz Xbox 360 TE arcade sticks on a PS3.<br />The big problem is it &#34;holds&#34; your directional input on occasion, probably for half a second.<br />This obviously makes it practically unusable with my arcade sticks<br />Tried all settings on the arcade sticks, and looked up if anyone had problems with this same adapter. No luck.<br /><br />It worked fine for my standard controllers, however.<br />Can't say for any other arcade sticks yet, either, but I wouldn't trust it for that purpose.
B002RI9HUM|1.0|I thought this book was a waste of money a very boring read full of rubbish backwards and forwards a load of rubbish
B00A757EFW|2.0|if this is the free version it is okay, the one that you'll pay for is not much better, I would not recommend buying this
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Another great story and an addition to the Crossfire series, not trilogy.  I just love Gideon, but Eva needs to grow up and mature. It wasn't the usually can't put down book that Sylvia Day usually writes. The sex scenes were hot, but when you do it over and over again every chapter it gets boring and predictable. There were parts that were too detailed and others that needed more.  I'll keep reading the Crossfire books because of Gideon and because Sylvia is one of my favorite authors, but don't rush a story just because your fans are driving you crazy.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is so easy and good that my 4 yo sister plays it for hours, i one for myself enjoyed the game as it is like evrydaylife bt what we controll and what we . Actuly dont see unless where on ra building lookin down, only probldm i have, is the cars keep breakin down
B00BHU261S|2.0|Could not get into the film due to constant stopping and reloading of film.  Did not even get to watch this film to the end.
B005I6EU48|5.0|Works great as a cover for my refurbished Kindle Fire.  I am very pleased and proud to use it on my Kindle.
0345536886|4.0|The last two Grisham novels that I've read (this one and The Confession) have solidly proven that the guy has jumped the shark and veered into high camp territory.  Let's start with the characters.  There is always at least one morally-flawed lawyer - he's either a drunk, can't keep his hands off the ladies, unethical, or all three (Wally Figg is your guy in this one).  There is also a bitter, burnt-out protagonist with a hot wife (David Zinc), cartoonishly evil politicians, prosecutors, and/or defense attorneys, a plucky secretary, and at least a few tarts along the way.  Could the story's token deadly pharmaceutical 'Krayoxx' be any more obvious of an allusion to real-life bad drug Vioxx?  Meanwhile, Grisham takes us for a ride on an obvious political agenda of his own (The Confession was staunchly anti-death penalty, The Litigators is funnier and a bit more subtle, but is still anti-mass tort/big pharma).  The plot takes all of the predictable Grisham twists (save for one, which is partially spoiled in the back cover synopsis anyway), and in the end everyone gets exactly what they deserve, complete with the mandatory and trite epilogue which sees our hero ride off into the sunset, presumably to make millions and have at least half-a-dozen kids.<br /><br />Despite the cliches, it's still a decent light summer read with a healthy sense of humor and self-awareness of its intentions.  And because it makes fun of lawyers and lawyering in general, most people will enjoy it.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|So far, so good. I just wish there was a battery saving option. Also, I like how it shows the temperature and voltage of the device. I will continue to use this application, and recommend it as well.
B00BFBSV72|4.0|I got a kindle for my birthday last year, and quickly saw the difference between the kindle and the I-pad.... mainly the I-pad had far cooler apps.<br /><br />So when I heard there was two different sonic games available for download, i immeadetly searced for them, only to find out that it was only for apple devices!<br /><br />Being the hardcaore sonic fan i am I almost went out and bought an ipad just to play these games, then I found out that Sonic Jump had just been made available for the Kindle! Instanst Download!<br /><br />So how does the game hold up? It's actually very fun! I didn't expect much from a downloadable game, but this one delievered! The gameplay mechanics are so simple my children can play, and it's not too easy were I can get bored easily. That being said SOME of the challenges are pretty hard, and can frusterate after awhile. It takes way too long to unlock other characters and it's kinda short, I just bought it this week and already I'm almost done with everything it has to offer at the moment.<br /><br />Am I sorry I spent my money on this? No I am not! It's a good game and quite addicting! If your A Sonic fan, defititly check this one out!
B00BB22GQM|5.0|One of my favorite albums ever, every song is awesome and ridiculously catchy. Now if only Vampire Weekend could go on tour near my city...
B0018J2QB8|5.0|There was a ton of suspense and tension without being painful to watch. The writers do a great job of keeping the show light through dexters character. Although I did lose one of my favorite characters...
0345529057|4.0|I cant wait to dig into this series and was glad to find the first 4 books together so cheap.  The only complaint is that the books are very flimsy.  The pages are thinner than the normal cheap paper back and probably wont become a hand-me-down.
B000JO9JHW|4.0|Great show. Not as gory as I thought it would be, thankfully. Good characters and the writers don't feel the need to kill off everyone you like
B00992CF6W|5.0|OmG a great game for kids!  It is very addicting, so worth the money.  You have to get this game if you love killing monsters and mining for diamonds!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It is a nice app and it keeps you occupied. It is also a good game for kids and is slightly educational. I would suggest it to younger kids.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|In my opinion this app is one of the best battery apps out there and for free you can't beat that.
B00AECDDYY|4.0|This game takes a little  while to get out of tutorial mode, but it has plenty of levels to keep you playing. The game mechanics are simple and won't take you long to master. There are five difficulty levels, but don't bother trying once you beat it on medium, it's pretty much impossible to win on hard difficulty.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Amazing app I play it 20-4-7 it is awesome I could play it all the time amazing and cool I mean it's just a perfect 10
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This game may have the best graphics I've ever scene in a puzzle game. It plays similar to an escape the room game, but instead of breaking out of a locked room, you're breaking into an ornate box. My only complaint was that the game was too short, with only three long stages after the tutorial. I look forward to the expansion.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|These books by Baldacci are indeed difficult to rate accurately. I am speaking of only nuances separating stars ratings. It, to me is very subjective and I find it difficult to rate and be objective. When I select a star rating I am being very subjective and basing the rating solely on the degree of suspense that I enjoyed in one book as compared with another book. Suffice it to say, all his books are excellently written and well thought out and as far as this one man is concerned there are no better writers extant this day and age than David Baldacci.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|All I want out of my chess game is the ability to play as white or black against an opponent as competent at the game as I see fit to make him, and this game delivers that. I've lost as often as I've won at this on medium difficulty. If you like chess, I don't see why you wouldn't want this game.
B0095P31L6|3.0|Enjoyable and clever but somewhat melancholy. The acting and animation were excellent. My 5 year old was able to sit through it.
1433502410|5.0|This is a great study bible!  It is my first study bible and is very complete so far as I can tell.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Just a joy to watch, very involved character development and plot twists. On a par with Revenge Season I. Hard to stop watching--just be sure to start from the beginning.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This series is awesome! I love the way that the author has such a gruesome topic to write about and makes it into a story that is dependent on being in love to survive.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|I'm not usually a fan of scary movies but my husband really wanted to watch it so we did. It was scary but not in a gory/torture scene way. More Sixth Sense or the Ring kind of scary. Had a plot better than most scary movies too. I would recommend it.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|Like the movie  it was an adventure..  but would love it even more if when you purchase the disc.. it could be on your amazon prime  streaming video....
1594136238|4.0|The story was interesting and, as a parent, really hit home in spots.  I stayed up late to finish it, and it had a strong ending.  However, I felt the narrator was too unreliable to really be believed, and I felt that the author missed the mark a bit.  You wonder how parents could really be so clueless, and I felt that Jacob's character wasn't explained well enough.  I guess when all is said and done, I just didn't &#34;buy&#34; the characters.  And yet, I gave the book to my daughter and encouraged her to read it so we could talk about it.  And I'm still thinking about it!  Go figure.
B000JLTR8G|5.0|I've seen it before and I actually got it for my husband cause he really loves the movie.  He enjoys movies about samuri fighting.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I first downloaded this game for my galaxy. I had so much fun with it I got the whole thing for my kindle.It's great. One word of note, this game is five dollars, not three. You will really like it, go for it.
B005PK57IK|4.0|It is smart and interesting. I didn't loose my interest. Though, it's a good enough show I can see the network pulling it, like all the other good ones...My So Called Life, My Name Is Earl, The Tick, Better Off Ted and on and on.
B008WCP2PG|1.0|Dreadfully lame project. Virtually no story line of interest. Poor acting to say the least. Matthew McConaughey is an embarrassment. He should do well as the \\"before\\" picture in a shampoo commercial. Don't waste your time.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I had heard that this was a great show, so my husband and I started watching it. Hooked!  Great characters. Love Katey Segal!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I missed the series for five years! I was hocked form the first minute. I will be watching the entire 5 seasons.
B007A2O3FO|5.0|I always look forward to Maggie Smith. This is a surprise, low level film that has fun characters and an enjoyable plot. Not for the super sleuths, just for fun. Great to See Julian Fellows too.
B00992CF6W|5.0|well i love it truley. but for the next update could you add :boats and minecarts with rails with buckets and a higher mineral spawn rate. that's it great job though!
1452000255|5.0|This book is great. I have to admit that at first I wasn't sure what to expect, and it really surprised me how much I enjoyed it because it isn't something I normally read. Like always I try to review without spoiling the story.The descriptions given were so clear in my mind it felt like a movie was playing through my head.In this tale we join Peter on a magical adventure where he meets many strange and unusual characters along the way.I would recommend this book to young and old it is very well written. In fact my son is currently reading it and once he finishes it I will add his thoughts.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I really like this app. It sounds relaxing and has a timer, if you wish to use that. My wife likes it so much, that she is considering using some of it as soft back ground music on some of our home videos. I gave 4 stars only because I want to reserve 5 for &#34;out of this world&#34;
B009EEFTMC|4.0|i really like this game it doesnt get boring quickly like most games do and if you like mahjong you will like this game also. easy to play.

B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Totally enjoyed this!  Very well produced, visually stunning.  I struggled a little with getting puzzle pieces to move the way I wanted them to....but maybe that was me.  Looking forward to the next!!!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Andrea is my favorite male singer.  I own all of his CD's  I could listen to him 24/7.  I enjoy his relaxing music.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It was really fun but one day I went to play it and it deleted all of my stuff so I stopped playing it
B00CL50KDY|5.0|This movie had two things I would never put together sweet zombies. It has a great soundtrack and every character is likable. It's refreshing to see something new from a genre that's, sadly, being exploited to death.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|I love this Stone Sour album it has some really good jams on it. I know I will never tire of listening to it along with the rest of Stone Sour's albums. I know their music will stand the test of time. It is rare to find a band these days that you know you will still be listening to for decades to come. Don't miss out on the House of Golden Bones part one or part or part two.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|Every song reminded me of a different scene of the movie. I would recommend it as necessary addition to any Twilight fans collection
B00BAB6CNC|5.0|Again Stone Sour has put out another great album. This cd is a must have for anyone that appreciates good music:)
1563899426|5.0|I love this book its just what Id expect from Fables comic, recommend it to anyone young at heart with and edge for mystery.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love this game. I play it everyday. I love the graphics and background music. This game is addicting. This is  a must have game.
B00CXN2JNS|3.0|like i said It's Okay! It kind of Reminds of how i felt about When &#34;So Far So good So what&#34; or &#34;Risk&#34;  came out. you know the next will be Great!!!! It always is!!!
B005COO1X6|3.0|The story serves as a quick read to fill a little time. Not one of king's best but good enough.

B00005JPS8|5.0|Since watching The Avengers my son has been obsessed with Iron Man ( and Captain America). My husband and I had seen Iron Man several years ago and enjoyed it; so it has been fun re-watching these movies with my kids. Robert Downey, Jr. is such the perfect Iron Man just as Mark Ruffalo is the best Hulk.
B001UV4XIS|1.0|The movie is great, but the DVD wouldn't play after chapter 5, it would just freeze completely and you couldnt't even skip the chapter!
B00BC24NT4|2.0|Weak for The Master. Totally implausable. But it will have to do until the next Lewrie sea story comes out. Hero uses trite spy formula to end it. Yuck.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Watching this movie in Blu ray quality gives an overall different experience than watching it in DVD.<br /><br />The much more vivid colors and the quality of the sounds make you feel like you are part of it!
0399159347|5.0|This book should come with a warning label, as it became difficult to put down until I was finished.  The Husband's Secret is initially a little confusing because of the number of characters and storylines that will eventually become interwoven, some more than others.  The title comes from a secret that the husband of the main character has from his past, which she accidentally discovers.  Without giving away the plot, I felt the main character was a victim of her own curiosity, as she opens something she wasn't yet meant to see - and then she has to live with the consequences of knowing something she wishes she didn't know - her husband's secret from his past.  This proves to be a life changer, as she is unable to hide the fact she knows from her husband.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Liane Moriarty and have read all but one of her books - The Hypnotist's Love Story, which is on my TBR pile and being saved for vacation.  I found The Husband's Secret to be the most serious of her books to date complete with people like we meet in every day life carrying secrets or a heavy weight that are invisible to the rest of us.  It reminds you that nobody gets through life without some problems, pain or sorrows.  As with all the others I've read, you begin to feel as if you know the characters and care about them. You feel their indecision, their anxiety, as well as their joys and sorrows.  However, it wasn't depressing, perhaps in part because it was suspenseful - but it wasn't lighthearted either.  This book was written from the perspective of several people, so you not only heard a character's inner voice, but you saw them from the perspective of the other characters, which makes for a more multi-dimensional person.<br /><br />Once started, The Husband's Secret consumed all my free time until it was finished.  The only negative I can say is that books this good tempt you to rush through because you want to see how it turns out, so you don't get the pleasure of reading them atas leisurely a pace as you should to fully savor it.  I recommend the book, but with this caution - don't start it unless you have some serious reading time available!!
0307891372|5.0|this book covers every aspect of skyrim.<br /><br />while most of game information can nowadays be searched online, there is a wealth of detail that I could only find in the book and made the game experience much more satisfying.
B00AKYRCNY|5.0|I chose this app for my toddler for the color, subject matter and for the challenge of working a puzzle.  From the first time he opened the app, to almost everytime he has needed the &#34;entertainment' , he goes directly to this app over others.
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|Watched this movie last weekend and my husband and I thought it was pretty good. Has a few good unsuspecting twists that keep your interest up. I would recommend this and at some point we may watch it again.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|If this is the only YouTube available app for the Kindle then is awful. I'm using this as a distraction for a 2 year old who likes to listen and watch videos. And this app blocks them. The want to make you pay the upgraded version.

B004GBIE3Y|4.0|Good cast, well paced. Although I found parts of the story a little predictable, I went into the movie having accepted that predictability and was able to just enjoy the ride. Also, even though it's a story about people spending time in a mental ward, they managed to keep things from getting overly sentimental.
