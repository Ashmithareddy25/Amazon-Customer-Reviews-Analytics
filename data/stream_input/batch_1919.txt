B005OCFGTO|5.0|My son-in-law is a huge Harry Potter fan and loved the complete collection when I gave it to him for Christmas.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Enjoyed this movie so much. Clint Eastwood still &#34;has it&#34;.  So refreshing to watch a movie that is not fraught with violence and swearing!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I chose this rating because the book keeps u glued to it. I would recommend this to ages 10-16 in my mind
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Take life from the viewpiont of a dog, a smart one.  A good read.  Has some good thought on living (and racing in the rain)
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love playing it on Facebook and was glad they had the app available for the iphone and ipad. Downloaded it immediately. Totally addictive!!!
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I don't normally really like JRPGs. Kind of an open world, fallout/skyrim kind of guy. But do yourself a favor and try out this game. Solid story, game play, and the music is awesome. Never once did I get tired of just the random background music. It all fits very well.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I have been playing hidden object games for years and this is one if the best I've  played in a long time. Great graphics and good story line.
B008PZ69Q6|1.0|I think its terrible to sell people this thinking they are goin to see elvis in concert its,wrong they should do it all over and make it right .im very very disappointed with concert on this .the music sounds good but the taping very disappoiting
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I loved thinking of this story from all angles of history..... I think that it changed the way I view being able to go back and change events in the past...I now realize things happen for a reason and fixing them might not make things better...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I've rated this game already, but that was a lazy review. I think Subway Surfers deserves a full explanation. You must run from the station inspector and his villainous dog. You speed up the father you run and it gets more difficult each time. There is a pogo stick that makes grab coins from the top, a jetpack where you can get more coins,a point multiplier,a coin magnet, jumping sneakers,a mystery box with a whole bunch of prizes. And so much more. I really enjoy this application more than other running/chasing apps.Please get this app it is just amazing. Thank you creators off this application, and did I mention this game was free. But you can also buy keys from the Amazon Store.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Again.  There is laughter and tears and rereads and sharing and passing on the story to my friends to read.  I JUST love his work...
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was great. It had alot of detail and specification. The whole series was funny and I hope there are more books to come

B003JTHXOK|5.0|cannot wait for the movie!~ I love everything Nicholas Sparks writes and look forward to each book and movie as they come out.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|This is the most amazing book I have ever read, it models what young love should be like, and the honest moral of true love.
B00307OTDE|5.0|Excellent collection of classics - product came and downloaded quickly.  I have it on multiple devices.  four more words required!!!
B0084BMUFA|4.0|It was slow at first, but sped up towards the middle. It was difficult to read because it was written so long ago, but overall, I thought it was a somewhat good book.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Nelson De\Mille returns to his successful formula plotting and writing style seen in his earlier satisfying works. This is a well crafted, mostly believable, work of fiction that has finely drawn characters and tight plotting;  The Panther was a good read.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I enjoy seeing family I haven't seen in a while and catch up on what is  going on with family
B007WEQ3K8|2.0|you get one lousy game Free then have to pay for the rest, bit if a Swindle, why not just say it costs 99 p at the start?
B003O86FMW|5.0|This us awesome. This is so stupid i have to review a book. Not likeing amazon right know. Peace out !!!!
B00AB0AR2U|5.0|This film, has some moments where you say out loud: \\"HOW is it possible that they or this just HAPPENED to be there?\\"<br /><br />Those parts, irked me. A lot.<br /><br />But, it continues the series and I'd say that it is in 3rd place so far.<br /><br />The First being:<br /><br />RE: Apocalypse<br /><br />Second being:<br /><br />RE: Exinction<br /><br />3rd being:<br /><br />RE: Retribution.<br /><br />With the worst being RE: Afterlife! It was an abysmal filler movie (Just like Underworld: Awakening)<br /><br />I love Milla. She needs to be in more movies.<br /><br />Her powers are awesome. She wouldn't be who she is without her abilities.
B0086700CM|5.0|every one knows temple run. thevname speaks for itself. just try it trust me U WILL LOVE IT iam a game cridit so get it from an expert
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|My 3 yr old loves it, even though some scenes were a little scary for him.  The movie is based on a more innocent time
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|I think it was a humorous and super funny book.I also think Jeff Kinney should keep writing these super awesome books.
B005VPRF0M|5.0|Item arrived quickly and on time.  Item was easy to track and was packed efficiently.  Got it in time for Christmas!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've seen the movie so many to times, but finally read the book completely and feel it's 10000000000 times better.  It helps put faces to the characters having watched the movie, but it doesn't hold a candle to the book. The detail s that you have and the emotion you feel...IT'S A MUST READ!
B009CPJHY4|3.0|This was interesting, funny, and<br />at points touching until the seemingly<br />inevitable gay element was thrown in.<br />This happily politically incorrect viewer<br />was unhappy.
B0076DELIG|5.0|It's amazing To me that Connelly continues to write such captivating stories. Harry continues to develop into an interesting complex character
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Morton's initial description of characters mixed with<br />flashbacks caused me to make a diagram of family<br />names and hair color to follow the plot.  Once I got<br />the hang of it, I enjoyed the end.
B007X6SMD6|5.0|This guide provided a good start for newcomers. It introduced me to Amazon services in a quick and easy way.
B0013TTLDE|3.0|The only thing that drew me onward in this<br />book was guessing how it ended, and then<br />I was sorry to find I was right. Morton's use<br />of a dying woman's memories with flash backs<br />and flash forwards worked in her other books,<br />but here it cloyed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My nephew actually started this app before I did and he is dang good at it but when he got it it was 2$ and I said I'm not Paying two dollars for a little app. But then I got my awesome kindle fire and it was free so
B007EDYN36|5.0|This is the 2nd book I've purchased on my new Kindle and I can't turn it off once I start reading. Since Christmas I've gone to bed late each night, trying to finish this so I can get to another Kindle book. Not just a book about a drummer, this is history of New York City rock and roll and the drug excess of the late 70s. If you're not already sober, you might wanna be after reading this tragic \\"Rags to Riches Back To Rags\\" story  - kids, don't try this at home!!
1594487154|5.0|Dan Pink has transformed my perception of sales.  He clearly makes the case that we are constantly moving and influencing others, and in fact others, as we learn and grow.  His usual strong research and useful tools result in a great and useful book.  I am already using this with clients!
B00785P2QC|3.0|Ok but need more options and can end up costing you a lot of money if your not patient and want instant results.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|Simple moving platform and ball game, there are plenty like it so just find the one that you yourself enjoy playing the most and stick with that.<br /><br />CJB
B000JMKTLO|2.0|I'm not sure what to make of this book, whether I love it or hate it. The book is beautifully written, but it describes the ugliest and most disturbing things.  Ultimately, it  left me with a bad taste in my mouth and I question whether I would read the other two books written by the author.
B00913DPW2|5.0|I think it is ok, just not my preference. But didn't really have any problems with the game itself so good job devs.<br /><br />CJB
B000VYX8PE|4.0|I read this book years ago but i don't remember any of that happening. But it was  very good book.
B002RVCD6O|4.0|Like the idea of being able to stream Harry Potter movies online, on demand.  Had missed this one first time around.
B004TI5N38|2.0|The plot is so far fetched that I could not sustain my interest.  The characters are not fleshed out, and it is difficult to develop any kind of attachment.  I did stick it out and managed to finish the book but it was a struggle.
B008DM4OTA|1.0|Wont go up and down on floors always trys to go back to top on the nabi 2.<br />Just a waste of money wasted the 1.99 on this not happy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a good game and a good way to kill time. I like the idea that you have to unlock each level.
0393342212|5.0|A Godsend for parents! I love all the books by these authors, based on the work of Dr. Gunnott<br /><br />Ingrid Fischer van Houte, parent and grandparent.<br />Certified Life Coach,<br />Certified Energy Healer

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great read.  This is at the top of my list for favorite Grisham books.  Once I started it I wasn't able to put it down.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|Not ready for prime time yet.  Do not buy for Kindle Fire HD to access Google drive docs.  Doing so will cause the program to shut down rather ungracefully...everytime.
0824835921|4.0|35 kanji per day, the title of this review states. I gave it four stars simply because I don't know what lies ahead, but this is my third day, and I just finished reviewing my work for the last two days. I've done two lessons per day, and it looks like my rate of learning will be 35 kanji per day, on average. At this rate, it shouldn't be more than 60 days before I've recognized all the kanji of this book.<br /><br />It takes about three hours for me to go over two lessons--writing the kanji, making a note on the explanation, forming ideas that help me best remember the kanji, and then reviewing by saying the meaning by looking at the kanji, and finger-drawing the kanji by looking at its meaning.<br /><br />I can tell already that my ability to draw kanji from the meaning is increasing in speed, and my confidence grows every time I review. Nobody likes to sit down and run through papers and notes, but after my time with lessons, and my personal tests at recalling what I've learned, my results have surprised me each time so far. I'll definitely stick with my current rate, and just add an extra 5 minutes per two lessons of review each time!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This is a nice change from ZeptoLab because cut the rope is a green guy shows up at your door and you have to get candy to him and it is free.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. This is a great read for everyone. I can't wait to get started on part two.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Pretty cool app. Just about some sort of mini game for people of all ages and backgrounds. I am not even a big gamer and I enjoyed it as well.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|Meh.<br /><br />Gives a bad name to the others in the series. Too long, comic book plot. Regardless, I still wont see the Hobbit.
B003UN409Q|5.0|Outstanding job of  Val kilmer playing Jim morrison....he became Jim Morrison all over again!!!!!  I would like to see Val Kilmer play more roles of Jim Morrison!!!
B003D5X3VM|5.0|I have seen Gregory Porter in person. He is a great singer and I enjoyed the CD and I gave<br />my Nephew one for his birthday.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|Death is not a subject that many would find entertaining.  But &#34;Departures&#34; is a touching movie on an unemployed cello player who responds to an ad for a position with a small firm who prepares and places bodies in coffins.  It is interesting to see Japan's customs concerning how they deal with the departed.
0711974594|2.0|I really should have read through some of the reviews before purchasing, as I normally do but seeing how I own several other books by this author and am pleased with those, I went ahead and bought it.  First, you should understand that it does take a lot of time and effort to transcribe every song by the Beatles and if Rikky actually did this, then kudos to him for trying but this book missing the mark in several places.  First, as other reviewers have stated, the book should be spiral bound and a little larger, the latter being not as important to me as it being spiral bound.  Second, the author states that he states that he left barre chords out of most shapes because they can be tiring on acoustic.  I found that the non-barre chord shapes he used almost impossible to create and would have preferred to use a barre chord instead.  So then on to the actual songs.  My 8 and 12 year old like me to play them to sleep with my acoustic guitar and Beatles are always a favorite, one of these being Hey Jude.  My daughter especially likes this one.  I normally play this in F with a chord progression of F, C and Bb but was missing a couple of other chords and took a look at Rikky's.  Everything was great until the bridge and this was completely wrong and I am not even sure what Rikky was listening to when he wrote this.  At this point I looked at a few other songs noted some other odd shapes and simply incorrect chords.  This is when I jumped back on Amazon to look at other reviews and noted the errors.  Rikky does a great job (albeit very brief) explaining how the Beatles often tuned down a half-step on some of their songs and also explained some other differences but I found that on some of these, the chord progressions are inaccurate.  I think when one puts together a song book for GUITAR chords, that the act of transcribing isn't sitting at the piano learning the chord and then simply transcribing that chord into a guitar shape.  Hopefully that wasn't done here.  I did find the book enlightening and definitely, like in Hey Jude, I was able to use part of what Rikky transcribed and then adding my own corrections so it is a good learning tool from that aspect.  However, this is not what I expected when purchasing the book so I am going to be returning it, unfortunately.  Upon other advice, I'm going to pony up the 55 bucks and get [[ASIN:0793518326 The Beatles - Complete Scores]] instead.  I still recommend Rikky's other books including [[ASIN:0879309598 The Songwriting Sourcebook: How to Turn Chords into Great Songs (Fully Updated and Expanded Edition) (Fastforward)]] and [[ASIN:0879309423 How To Write Songs On Guitar - Revised]] which I found both to be excellent.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|Okay, this movie had to be mine, after taking myself back to the theatre 3 times to view this story again and again... much to do with the shots of men, lined up with longbows and arrows flying. And Russell Crowe. And dreams of me and Russell Crowe (bumping off Marian) which may be past-life influenced, but whatever. This one is in my collection for keeps!!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Couldn't get this app to work on my Kindle. Not sure why but love it on my Iphone. Play it everyday.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|The streaming keep freezing... Netflix streams well....support was frustrating.<br />Support wanted me turn off and on ruko after stating that I was able stream Netflix..
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was definitely a page turner! I read this book in two sittings which is very unusual for me. I loved it!
B006UKFFE0|4.0|This is a terrific how-to book, giving step-by-step instructions for launching and running a lean startup. Four stars instead of five because while he says you can apply it to any kind of product, it really is geared toward software development, or perhaps toward a single product that gets improved over time. I'm having to guess at how to apply it to a clothing company.
B009K0P10K|5.0|So glad Amazon has the missing episodes available on line! And the quality of the video was great and no commercials!
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|They are a great band, glad to see they are doing so well, very talented. Can't wait to see them again.
B005HS00ZU|4.0|In fact you don't need to see it in 3D so, if you are looking for a great 3d concert, perhaps this won't &#34;fill&#34; you eye... BUT if you are looking for a great concert, you muy see this piece of art. All new musical arrangements with a great and big orchestra makes it!<br />Gabriel do looks old but his voice is intact!
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|The story-line had nothing to do with the book but I thought it was a great action movie. I guess there is a back-story as to why they didn't follow the book which didn't bother me, although they could have just given it a completely different name to avoid confusion. Anyway, Renner was great, the weaving in of past movies was well done and interesting as well.
B00A757EFW|4.0|This app is fun, I have always loved pack-man. All though I would recommend the full version that you have to buy because on the lite version does not have all the levels it just has 1 and like 3/4 levels and the full version has all the levels, but other than that it is a great and fun app!
B004I2K4E8|5.0|This 25th Anniversary DVD was a wonderful experience.  Every one of the cast members was incredible with great voices. This is a total treat for Les Miz lovers!

B005V5WBFG|5.0|I have used McAfee before, but I want to know why I can't just add my Kindle to my already current account...I have one on my HP and when it becomes invalid I will try to do that.
0345803493|5.0|My girlfriend brought this on our vacation to Mexico. Because of it she woke me up in the middle of the night and did not let me go to sleep for quite a while. Best interrupted sleep of my life :)<br /><br />Needless to say I bought the over two books in the series ;)
B005BCE7FQ|5.0|This was purchased to be viewed by my grandson. The movie turned out to be great for the whole family. It is colorful and is a 5 star movie to us.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|I give the whole plot a good 3.5 out if 5. I personally liked Matt Damon to have been in this even just a cameo would have been good. Jeremy Remer and Edward Norton did a good acting job like always.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Its Laugh out loud funny. There are very few movies someone can say that about.<br />You should watch this movie.
B009SJ3H8Q|1.0|I did not like this episode. It was nothing like season 1. I expected the second season would be more like the first one but it was not.
B004LWZWBU|5.0|This movie has a lot of heart and a lot of charm.  It's also an amazing advertisement for travelling the USA, with fantastic scenery.  It's a movie about families and friendship and being true to yourself even if people think your passions are odd.  The whole cast does a fantastic job and I don't think you have to love birds to be completely charmed by this movie.  However, I have felt the urge to drag out my binoculars and do a bit of birding myself.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|I thought that perhaps if I waited a few weeks, I would have time to reflect on this book and be better prepared to write a review about it. I was mistaken.<br /><br />It was fun while I read it, but overall I did not find it to be a memorable book or one that I would want to discuss with friends. The characters that I found to be most interesting were not the main characters (parents, friend who lost his sight, etc). The lead male was almost too perfect (great for a Dawnson's Creek-type storyline) with an ending that would make Nicholas Sparks jealous.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game has beautiful graphics and smooth gameplay. It's definitely a game to have in your collection if you are a HOS fan. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. It was not what I expected. I love it and will play it over again.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|The structure of the book is interesting. As a reader, you never have the opportunity to grow tired of a character or story because they conclude so quickly. If anything, I wanted more, more, more from some of the stories.<br /><br />I would suggest this book to those who do not have the attention span to read a long novel, who are traveling or who just want to mix things up a bit. You can easily put the book down and pick it back up again after time passes and you will not have to re-read previous chapters.<br /><br />The writing style is a fresh approach to a (now) over-played genre. It isn't too graphic for those with a weak stomach.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I enjoyed this book immensely. The language of flowers was relatively unknown to me, sure I knew certain flowers had meanings but I didn't realize how subtle. I also liked that the end of this book was realistic and followed the characters abilities rather just ending up one big happy family.
B005LAIIKI|4.0|I could watch Christopher Walz for hours on end. The other actors are good as well, but Walz, thanks, you made the evening for my wife and me.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|Before I review the actual DVD and its content, I will first talk about the movie its self.<br /><br />  The film was made in 1978 and was shot on low budget of $325,000. Supposidly it grossed $70 million world wide but this number has climbed drastically as of 2012 (last year). It was directed by John Carpenter and produced by Debrah Hill and John Carpenter.<br /><br />  Basically this is a slasher. The whole film takes place in Haddonfeild Illnois, where we get to fallow the lead protagonist Laurie Strode, along with here friends. This film is full of frights and fun moments, the last maybe 25-30 minutes are the best. Really, The whole film is just fantastic. Very creepy setting throughout and an equaly haunting music score. All the actors and actresses did a fantastic job at there rolls. I appreciate the corny acting, I like the low quality of the film. To me thats what makes it such a fantastic movie, one of my favorites actualy.<br /><br />  Ok, now for the DVD and it's content. This dvd of Halloween is by no means the best there is, if you really want the fullest aspect of the special features then buy the 25th edition. This is great version if you just want to own the film, WHY WOULDN'T YOU!!!<br /><br />  This DVD has got some good features like a docummentery which is always wonderful to have and some other little things. It also has some nice packaging with the slip case and what not.<br /><br />  Definitly pick this DVD up by all means, even if you own the 25th edition its nice to have a backup. I love this movie and it got a good DVD realese although there are better versions of it. This version is not to bad. Great movie.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|LOVE this app. Use it daily. Great purchase. Need more apps like this one. Everyone should get this app.<br />great price too.
B001HN69B8|5.0|This movie is Wonderful Out there and so different. I recommend it to anyone that like movies where you have to pay really close attention too.
B009J2VQSK|4.0|I just watched the movie and thought it was great. Also the Soundtrack! But now I am missing some songs? I am sure I heard Led Zeppelin? Is there a different Soundtrack Cd somewhere?
B005LAII80|5.0|Short review....Karl Urban OWN's DREDD!  Period!  I saw the movie twice in 3D at the theater and because I have a killer 3D TV I will be getting this one the day it comes out...amazon style.  I personally liked it better than the Dark Knight Rises...which was in my opinion a huge let down...but I am not comparing the two...just saying that the subject matter and visuals were a hard \\"R\\", and that is the way DREDD is suppose to be.  Cult classic for sure, not to be missed.
B0076DELIG|2.0|Michael Connelly has been one of my favourite authors for many years.  He let me down in the novel The Black Box.  I like reading paragraphs with more than one sentence.  This book had so much dialogue that wasn't appropriate for the written word - more appropriate perhaps for one of those low budget &#34;action movies&#34;.  As a result, I won't hurry out to buy his next release.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I love this! The series is awesome and I most recently got one of my older sisters hooked on the program! We can't wait to sit and watch season 3!!
B007DIQC90|5.0|Originally posted at Nose in a Book<br /><br />Very rarely does an album make me fall in love quite the way this one did. Of Monsters and Men is an Icelandic band that won M&uacute;s&iacute;ktilraunir, a music contest in Iceland. Although this band formed in 2009, it has started to pick up steam in 2011, and more momentum in 2012.<br /><br />They say that certain music comes into your life at certain times that you weren't even aware that you needed it. This is that album. This is summer 2012 for me. That fact is important to point out for me. I assumed Mumford & Sons Sigh No More would be my album until Babel came out. (A month! A month!) But then Of Monsters and Men's My Head is an Animal took over my life in the best way possible. All I do is listen to this album. At work, in the car, while doing homework. This album is playing. My BFF and I are going to Vegas in less than two weeks to go to a book signing with Tina. I'm the driver. If they don't like My Head is an Animal by the beginning of the trip, they will by the end. Or they'll suck it up because I get amazing MPG in my car. We'll see.<br /><br />The album starts off with \\"Dirty Paws.\\" Nanna Brynd&iacute;s Hilmarsd&oacute;ttir and Ragnar \\"Raggi\\" þ&oacute;rhallsson make it clear, this is our sound and we know how to rock it. And rock it, they do. Along with the rest of the band. They own their sound in the best way that they can. Then \\"King and Lionheart\\" comes on. This is my song. If only one song on this album can be my summer of 2012 song. This is it. It sums up about 90% of my friendships with people. And \\"Monster Sound?\\" Can þ&oacute;rhallsson just sing to me 24/7. I mean, I can't pronounce his last name, but his voice makes me overly calm and content.  They can even slow it down. Or really slow it down with songs such as \\"Slow and Steady.\\" Of course they pick it up quickly with songs such as their current hit \\"Little Talks.\\"<br /><br />Just give them a shot, I promise you'll like them, and if you don't please don't tell me. I don't deal with review failure well. I do blame them for getting me through Summer of 2012 grad school classes.l with review failure well. I do blame them for getting me through Summer of 2012 grad school classes.
B006WWUDGQ|5.0|My 12 year old daughter loved it and plays it on her Kindle Fire HD.  Good price for the product.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Originally posted at Nose in a Book.<br /><br />I know, I'm back with another CD review that isn't the new Mumford and Sons, miracles happen! This album, by the Lumineers, is in my top three albums of the year (the other two being this one and this one.) I am almost too much in love with this album and this band. I can read to this album, I can do homework to this album, I can bawl my eyes out to this album, all of which is a good sign.<br /><br />I have that addicting type of personality. If I read one book in a series, I have to read the whole series. If I fall in love with an author, I must read their complete collection. I told you, addicting personality. I wish I was joking when I say that for the last two years my favorite song has been \\"Little Lion Man\\" by Mumford and Sons. No, it has never wavered. That has been my favorite song to the point of being a joke among by friends including Tina and Lauren. But this album, is giving Mumford and Sons and \\"Little Lion Man\\" a run for their money.<br /><br />This album is full of slow songs, but full of heart. A whole lot of heart. The band is a trio who you can tell love what they do. There isn't a single song on this album that I have a need to skip. Which is hard for me because as much as I have an addicting personality I also have this need to skip through CDs. One of my top three CDs of 2012, I skip through. I know, the shock!<br /><br />Led by Wesley Schultz on guitar and lead vocals, the Lumineers album make it feel like they are able to read your soul and sing straight to it. Wesley is backed by Jeremiah Fraites on percussion, drums, and the like and Neyla Pekarek on cello. But this band isn't Wesley's show with two back up artists, this is a true trio. They all get along, they all have fun with each other and one can hear that on the album. It doesn't matter if it is a slower song like \\"Charlie Boy\\" or a upbeat happy song like \\"Ho Hey\\" you can feel that they love singing and playing together, which makes the album even better to listen to. Plus, I had a chance to meet them recently and they all three are super nice and excited people, which to me is important, because if an artist is mean in an interview or to a fan it is harder for me to really enjoy their music. But don't get me wrong, if they were horrible, I'd still be addicted to this album.<br /><br />I'm thrilled that this album is one of my top three of the year. And no, I won't tell you the order. No matter how often you ask. But really, you should give them a shot, you know how hard it is for me to recommend music. That's more panic inducing to me then recommending books. You can stop laughing now.lbum even better to listen to.

B000VDDDVO|5.0|I have always loved this movie and usually watched it on TV with commercial interruptions.  what a pleasure to watch it straight through and IN COLOR.  I wasn't sure we'd enjoy the color but our experience was quite the opposite.  The color (which is subtle and not overpowering) added a very realistic feel to the movie.  I'd highly recommend purchasing this DVD.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|Saw it once, would recommended for a good laugh. Glad I did not pay full price  for this at the theater.
B003NFM3JU|4.0|Watching this movie each Christmas has become a tradition in our home.  Having the DVD now makes it easy to watch when we decide and the 3D or blu-ray is great.  The only somewhat negative thing is, the DVDs doesn't let you re-size the picture to fill our 16:9 screen.  It's seems to be set in the &#34;theatrical size&#34; which won't allow adjustment to full letter-box size on some DVDs.  That said, I'm still very HAPPY I bought the movie and can enjoy it all year long at our convenience.  Worth the price paid.
B005LAII08|5.0|Went and saw this movie with the kids when it came out and of course had to buy it when the movie was released. Really great movie between mother and daughter.
B002ZG999U|5.0|I could not find this product in the stores that I shop in.It was easy to purchase online and it arrived before the expected date.<br />Thanks
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My 6 year old son loves this movie, they watched it in his classroom and he told me about it so I bought it for Christmas for him.
B004BJMEO6|5.0|Great movie!  I highly recommend it.  I could totally relate to the two women in the movie.  It was a very realistic depiction of love between two women.
B00942S4OY|2.0|I don't know what the hype is all about. I don't like it but I love my daughter so i bought this for her.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Christnas Vacation, Elf, and A Christmas Story all celebrate the season and are the core of our Christmas viewing. SNL favorites from the past still bring laughs - even when you know what's coming. Not quite a cult classic
B004J64QSI|5.0|Excellent production. I really enjoyed the music and the singing was outstanding and the acting was great. The orchestra was unbelievable.
B00A9X9ORI|1.0|If you want a movie that, regardless of its sappy final message, glorifies violence, mass killings and assault weapons, this is for you. Take Terminator, remove the characters you care about, throw in a pinch of The Omen and a strong dash of Quentin Tarantino's films (without the style and humor), and you know exactly what kind of movies this young writer/director was raised on. All in all, depressing.
B009FZFONO|5.0|awesome show. I Had to order it to prepare for the new season!!! It streamed fairly well to my laptop.
1594487154|5.0|As a sales professional, sales trainer and sales coach, one who used to hate selling, I've found Daniel Pink's book to be a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />Dan Pink has written an outstanding book about sales that helps to demystify the profession, helping to exorcise much of the mumbo jumbo that has surrounded this subject for time immemorial.<br /><br />To Sell is Human starts out by stating - and providing data to prove it - that we're all in sales now. Most all of us are engaged in what's stated in the subtitle, \\"Moving Others.\\"<br /><br />I'm especially intrigued by the updated definition for the common selling admonition \\"ABC\\" - Always Be Closing. Pink's research led him to identify Attunement, Buoyancy and Clarity as the new \\"ABC\\". In addition to these essential qualities, Pink identifies three key abilities: Pitch, Improvise, and Serve - with examples and opportunities to practice these qualities.<br /><br />What I found most helpful is the Sample Case approach used by Pink to amplify the new \\"ABC's\\", and three qualities, including a section on What to Do providing opportunities for application of what's been learned.<br /><br />A super read to help start off the New Year, as I will be using the information provided by Pink to enhance the sales training and sales coaching I provide.<br /><br />NOTE - I received an advance copy of this book for review, but was not compensated or influenced in any way to write this review. This review reflects my honest opinion of this book. Also, I've purchased multiple copies to share with my most trusted colleagues.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Great game.................BUT!!<br /><br />My daughters both had a kindle fire HD for xmas, and downloaded loads of stuff which was then available to download on the second kindle.  This was until Toca Hair Salon 2, which didn't appear on the second one.  When I contacted Amazon, they were a little suprised as I was, that the company which produce it, limit the game to just one copy per device, so be aware if you are buying for more than one device, you will have to pay for each one - something which slightly goes against the whole principle of linking Kindles to one account, and against the grain a bit if you have more than one child to buy apps for!<br /><br />  Shame on you Toca Boca AB !!<br /><br />further to my first review, i have now managed to download it to the second kindle.  for some strange reason it didnt show in cloud, but when i found the app on the second kindle in the store, it was ready for download!  i have accordingly changed this from one to five stars, as the game has kept my 2 x 8 year olds occupied and entertained for ages! i have also let the game devloper know so others arnt wrongly advised as i was!
B009DJB8I2|4.0|Well, this is a pretty good soundtrack. I didn't have any problems with my packaging like some people had mentioned. Arrived in one piece. Got my TF2 promo code which is sweet. The invite for DOTA 2 is nice as well. That having been said, I kind of cannot believe that Exile Vilify was not included on here. You'd think with 4 discs it'd be a little more 'complete'. It probably has something to do with The National's record label, but if that's the case, come on! I think The National owes a significant debt to Valve for the ridiculous amount of exposure generated by Portal 2. If it was something else, all I can say is...<br /><br />...<br /><br />ಠ_ಠ
0062060562|4.0|Having grown tired with the same old crime mysteries, this one is a winner.  A mystery with a completely unusual plot.  I did not start putting the pieces together until the last 30 pages.  If I have one criticism of the book, it is that the ending doesn't pull all the pieces together in as tidy a way as it could have...not entirely explicit as to how they came to find her and how she was removed from the scene at the end and what became of the not real Ben.  Don't want to give too much away, but it did leave me at the edge of my seat.  Not a classic piece of literature, but a better than solid mystery that doesn't rely on cookie-cutter plot elements.
B003WJQ74E|4.0|I would not say I \\"enjoyed\\" this book, in the sense that it is not uplifting, but it was well worth reading.  It's a classic and as such not much new I can say about it.  My main complaint is the same as most of the characters, that Charlie becomes a bit insufferable after his transformation.  One of the interesting things about the way it's written, since it's in the form of first-person narrative, is just how much do you believe what Charlie is saying or remembering, whether it's his own flashbacks, or his interactions with people, or whatever.  Clearly he misunderstood his relationships with his \\"friends\\" at the bakery; what might he missing as a super-genius?  And what is he choosing not to tell us?  Anyway, there's a lot here to think about; probably ripe for essays and theme papers in high school English classes.  I read it in a couple of days and probably didn't go as deep as it could stand.<br /><br />I haven't read through other reviews, but I bet the word \\"poignant\\" comes up a lot.  That may be cliche, but I think it's accurate.  We post-moderns like to think we are very up-to-date and advanced, and we don't throw around terms like \\"moron\\" and \\"retard\\" anymore.  But just a couple months ago I heard a story on the news about a guy with Downs' syndrome shot and killed by police in an armed robbery gone wrong - apparently his \\"friends\\" (aka gang members) used him repeatedly as the fall guy who would get arrested, or in this case shot at.  So not such a different attitude from Charlie and his \\"friends\\".  Unfortunately I think this story would be lost on such people - I can totally picture most of the kids I went to school with completely mocking this book and slugging each other and calling each other \\"Charlie\\" for a couple of months, until moving on to whatever's next in the high school literature progression - \\"Catcher in the Rye\\", maybe?  Which come to think of it, Charlie reminds me a little bit of Holden Caulfield, but not as funny.  Good topic for a high school essay.school essay.
B005NPBT5M|5.0|We were actually compelled to watch this, whock horror, in my sixth form flim appreciation class - something held when it was too cold or wet to go outside and play sports.  The start of the demise of Pink Floyd as Waters began to build his own wall, the last bricks of which were &#34;The Final Cut&#34; album which followed a couple of years later.  A must have for all Floyd fans, but some will still prefer the pre Waters-self-pity era, me included.
B007KB15BA|5.0|If you love the 80s Accept sound in &#34;Metal Heart&#34; or &#34;Balls to the wall&#34; , you will love this album.
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|It typifies government at it's worse which is what I believe it to be today.  The good guy came in first this time.
B003KJF2WE|5.0|this was a well done adaptation of a comic book, into a modern movie. plugs into the &#34;Avenger background series&#34;
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|A good movie but nowhere near the epic tale like the first 2.  It is worth watching but not much replay
B00979CS50|1.0|I purchased the 3 disk vinyl version at $70.  I was really wanting to like this LP, but after a few plays, I gave up and returned it for a 50% refund (ouch!).  This is something I've never done.  I have most of the late 60's early 70's LP's and I love them.  This release did nothing for me.  The long jams don't seem to have the fire of the older stuff.  I really wish I would have sampled some of the songs prior to ordering (as far as I can tell, Amazon did not provide samples for this release).  I would have probably kept a CD copy of this, but I felt that even with the 50% hit, I could purchase new or used music that I would enjoy better.  Some additional points about the vinyl release.  While it is technically 3 disks, one side has no music.  Side 6 has a cool etched/pressed Crazy Horse image, but I could do without that.  There was probably no way to avoid this as the running time and level cut dictated the number of sides.  But it added to the cost of the package.  This project was created to fit within the modern CD format and does not translate well to LP.  The long, Drifting Back track had to be split between two sides of an LP.  I found the title track Psychedelic Pill to be unlistenable due to the heavy handed use of a flanger across the entire mix for the length of the track.  I also found the included booklet to be a cruel joke.  One of the joys of vinyl is that the large format provides an easy and fun to read package.  In this LP, there is a tiny booklet that seems like an afterthought as there are no liner notes on any of the covers.  The artwork and packaging are well done, but why not put some extra effort into the booklet?  Finally, I have to comment on the audio quality, since Neil is such a stickler about the ills of bad digital audio.  I found the LP to be dark, lifeless, and dull. Compared to almost any other LP in my collection (over 3000) and on several systems, the sound quality fell far short of my expectations.  This really floored me and was the final straw that caused me to return the LP.  I'll be interested to hear a CD copy and see if the issue was LP mastering or if this was the intended sound of the project.
0894803123|3.0|The majority of the recipes are nice, but some included raw eggs which didn't sit well with my family and I.  I actually contacted the maker of my icecream maker and asked about raw eggs in an icecream recipe and they did not approve.  Other than that, It's nice.
1401235417|5.0|I really think Scott Snyder is the best Batman writer of all time! I have read a lot of Batman comics and his The Black Mirror and The Court od Owls are the best batman stories ever! I recommend them to everyone!
B000NQRE1E|5.0|I remember loving this movie when i was younger when it was released... and still love it today. I cant say anything about the 3d version but this 2d bluray is great! The picture quality is amazing and is crystal clear, they obviously spent lots of time getting this transfer to be as good as it could be. The DTS HD audio is also superb, lots of great sound and some nice surround effects as well as some nice LFE from the ships engines and the sinking sequences. If you like titanic you need to own this bluray.<br /><br />The audio commentaries are also very cool, James Cameron's commentary is great and the the commentary with the two historians is good too, with lots of neat info and facts to go along with the movies.<br /><br />The second disc also has alot of nice behinds the scenes features and programs.<br /><br />Overall one of my best blurays for sure!
B0086700CM|4.0|this was a fun game to play.my son downloaded this on to his tablet and he likes it a lot.
1416594795|4.0|I found this book a good read, i am not much of a reader but i was able to read this in about a week. If you are interested in the subject of evolution this is a great book to read. It explains alot of evidence and talks about numerous experiment with conclusions that support evolution. I found it great and learned quite a bit, there was a few instances where it gets a bit more difficult to follow( depends on reader) as it gets a bit technical a times but its not too bad. If you have a basic understanding of science its a good read.
B005HSL626|4.0|ths is a super fun game to play. my son downloaded this game and he liked it  a whole lot.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Heard all about &#34;Looper&#34; being possibly the best time travel movie ever. Well, it was relatively entertaining, but ultimately fell well short of my expectations. It was a decent sci-fi flick that kept my attention for the full two hours, but I can't say much more. I mostly enjoyed guessing at how everything was going to work out in the end.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|my son downloaded this game. he seemed to like ti a lot. he is fourteen. it is a fun game to play according to him.
0756655307|5.0|This book is awesome! It lists most of the characters in the Marvel Universe, with facts and bios about each of them. There are a few missing, but then again the amount that there are more than make up for it. Very content with my purchase!
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|total rip off of Notch's game Minecraft and did nobody read the threat from majong?  well i did and RUFUS u beyter shut down ur game survival craft and give.people their money back
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Saw it at the theaters and of course we loved it. My daughter received this 2 disc set for Christmas and was very happy.
B00992CF6W|4.0|ok i love the game<br /><br />piraters u r thieves and should get ur own ideas dont steal awesome ideas<br /><br />price baggers grow up it took a lot of work to make the game and the cp version costs 26 bucks so shut up<br /><br />i luv the game right now but seriously majang AB u need to start updating ur pe version a lot like the cp but yet we still dont have pumpkins and redstone is only used for light riht now plz update soon and servers would b great
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|really well done film on all levels fthe ensemble cast works well together and you can feel the insanity of Guy Pearse.<br />The cinematography and direction all deserve kudos for a job well done.
1250000971|5.0|I enjoyed this 2nd book in The Clifton Chronicles. In fact, I had a full day to read it and enjoyed it enough to happily stay with it throughout the day - and on into the night. Can't wait for the third book!
0399230033|5.0|We first got this book at the library a couple months ago, and he wanted us to &#34;read&#34; (it doesn't have many words) it to him over and over again.  He loves pointing at the animals in it.  I bought it for him for Christmas, and he was so excited.  He stood up right away, sat in my husband's lap, and asked for him to read it right away.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this was an excellent read.  i read it it in one day and cant wait to read the second one.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Once again another winner from Michael Connelly!  Great story line and I can't wait for the next Harry Bosch adventure.
0385536828|3.0|\\"Sweet Tooth\\" has got to be the girliest spy novel ever written. The central character is a young woman hired by Britain's MI5 in the early 70s to recruit up and coming writers to help fight the culture war against the Soviets. Problem is the young lady has a Taylor Swiftian tendency to fall for every attractive man she meets.<br /><br />The spy intrigue here is little more than office politics, and very much secondary to the young woman's romantic entanglements. And there is a regrettable amount of ruminating about the significance of the creative process. Precisely the sort of conversation idealistic young lovers of literature would be likely to have. Still, it doesn't make the dialogue any less eye-glazing. Then there's the writing itself. McEwan is an accomplished stylist of course but is this bit of description really necessary?<br /><br />'Which is why it was easy to summon up his explanation over breakfast in the cottage, early summer sunshine pouring through the open door with its countless inexplicable rivets, across the flagstones, to illuminate the lime-white lath and plaster of the dining room's far wall, where the Churchill watercolor hung. And on the table between us, muddy coffee made in a special way, by the \\"jug method\\" with a pinch of salt thrown in, and undercooked toast like stale bread piled on a pale green plate with spidery glaze and bitter thick-cut marmalade made by the housekeeper's sister.'<br /><br />By that point in the proceedings I didn't much care who made the bloody marmalade.<br /><br />\\"Sweet Tooth\\" is not a bad novel but a disappointing one, from a writer who had previously set the bar so high.
B007B6VOG0|4.0|I have always been a fan of The Format and Fun. They are great in concert, are perfect for running around and dancing to, and are especially great for car singing (guilty as charged). Some Nights has some good songs but I don't like it as much as their previous album that had more horns and less electronics. In any case, love the band, not disappointed in the album.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because of the richness and depth of Professor Dawkins' explanations.  His perspective is refreshing and in my opinion, liberating. I recommend this book to anyone who is questioning their faith, but I would also recommend it to anyone of faith who are open to being challenged.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Love her voice and her attitude. When my friends and I are getting ready to go out, this album plays and we dance around the house a bit. Fun album.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Had seen the author on several TV shows promoting the book. The way it was written and the detail of the information made me realize once again that God cannot be boxed into my limited perspective. Dr. Alexander's religious skepticism at the beginning of his story versus his change of attitude after is NDE is explained methodically and in a way that confirms my beliefs. Great read! I already bought it for my skeptical son...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put it down, never boring.  I can't wait to continue the series, I have no idea what to expect
B00A0SJWQU|2.0|The streaming HD video quality on a Roku was great.  Has some interesting visuals.<br /><br />I am pretty good at suspending belief enough to enjoy most sci-fi, but this was pretty unbearable.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Community is my favorite show. The order said was going to take at least a week but ended up at my house in less than 2 days!
B00AMBH70S|4.0|But something seemed to be off in post production.  The reused scenes from the previous movie were either filmed using different cameras or were processed differently.
0439023491|5.0|I enjoyed reading all books in the Hunger Games series and would definitely recommend them to young and old.  Thoroughly enjoyed the series!
B005MYEQ9U|4.0|This beautiful, intense opera fell out of favor because of a preference for love stories and novelties. But in 2011 the work was revived for Anna Netrebko, perhaps the greatest dramatic soprano of the decade. The staging for the Vienna State Opera production is basic, and the costumes show that they are made of light, modern materials, but the singing is incredible. Netrebko as Anne Bolyen and beautiful Elina Garanca as Jane Seymour are outstanding, especially in Act II. There is no sign of strain in their voices, even in what seem like extremely difficult passages. The recent Met production with Netrebko was visually more compelling, but I think this production is a little better. The last few minutes -- in which Boleyn's young daughter, Elizabeth, appears wordlessly and sees her mother's (simulated) execution -- are striking. This two disc set is something that may lead you to go out and tell others about it.
0439023483|5.0|I enjoyed reading all books in the Hunger Games series and would definitely recommend them to young and old.  Thoroughly enjoyed the series!
B008HK3XYK|5.0|I bought this for my wife and she loves it. Fits the 7&#34; HD Fire only. Snaps right in and stays.
B007SY3CEW|5.0|This game is a lot of fun! I enjoy playing all of the songs from easy to difficult - would definitely recommend purchasing the game.  Worth the money!
0891419195|5.0|The events depicted in this book are jaw-dropping. None can compare to the Marines who served in the Pacific Theater. Sledge does a masterful job of conveying their story.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|My sister uses this on her Kindle and hse seems to like it. There don't seem to be a lot of bugs.
B009JZTOG8|1.0|not worth anything just a review of the previous season. Not a single new thing. What a waste of money
B004SOR4H6|5.0|It works like a charm, just like the other Twitter apps which we weren't expecting since some of the Kindle apps are full bugs. Pleasantly surprised.
B002ZG97M4|5.0|my daughter wanted this for Christmas. It arrived as expected or sooner and she loves it!<br />Would recommend film wholeheartedly.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|The camera is decent enough for pictures and the videos seem good but the layout of it isn't user friendly and that's kind of disappointing. I'm hoping there are updates to this that will allow for better reviews.
B009POCG0Y|5.0|`Killer Joe' is a GREAT film!<br /><br />Matthew gives his best performance since 'A Time To Kill', but completely different and very daring, particularly for Matthew who has unfortunately been wasting his considerable acting talent on insultingly ridiculous films such as `Failure to Launch', `Fool's Gold', and numerous other insipid offerings.  We seemed destined to wait for `Dallas Buyers Club' to catch even a glimpse of Matthew's talent again, but `Killer Joe' rescued us with an uncharacteristically risky, rich, and surprising performance by McConaughey.<br /><br />I recommend `Killer Joe' to anyone who can appreciate an R-rated film (Killer Joe, originally NC-17, is not rated on this recently released DVD.) We've seen so much nauseating unnecessary violence in films that had nothing whatsoever to offer; whereas this film has an overwhelming amount of entertainment value along with its violence.<br /><br />The entire cast was pitch-perfect with a particularly understated but rewarding performance by Thomas Haden Church. Wm Friedkin at 76 delivered an amazing directing job and Letts' writing was top-notch!  The edgy dialogue was simultaneously jolting and smooth.  Best of all, the humor was startlingly black, but oh soooo delicious!<br /><br />'Killer Joe' is a stunningly 'different' film that stuns and entertains every sense!!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The harder levels are so much easier because of the size of the screen but the game is still challengingly fun. Good job.
B00A17P7OQ|5.0|Don't miss out to see this movie. Sweet story, great actors and the atmosphere in the movie is just great especially if you like Israel.
B0067RQYNW|4.0|I had this phone my phone and it didn't work so I was worried that my sister had downloaded this on her Kindle for no good reason, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that it worked for the most part when she used it.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|It does what it is supposed to do, providing convenient cleaning aid for light jobs. It is a fragile tool, so you need to handle it with care. Cleaning the hair that gets tangled is very hard, and thus teh reason for the 4 stars
076780421X|5.0|I have seen this movie probably thirty times...it is always joyful, funny, and superior romcom.....<br />Does anyone know if there is a directors cut or extended version?<br />When i saw this on rental there were scenes that are not on my purchased dvd.<br />Wish they would have made a sequel.....signs are everywhere......you just have to look for them!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I've purchased and played the majority of games in this genre available on the appstore, and this is one of the best I have played. Graphics are good and fit the eerie storyline well, and the storyline is better than most. But where the game really shines is in it's variety. Good hidden object sequences, and an abundance of different mini games. Quite a bit longer than most other games in this price range. Hint button is handy when you can't figure out where you need to go next, as there are quite a few different areas in the game. Great job, and I am very satisfied with my purchase.
B004WGIXX4|1.0|I watched this crap because of the 3 1/2 stars but after reading the reviews, and going back 6 pages of 1 star reviews (I'm sure they went further). I have no idea where the 3 1/2 stars even came from, only way I can see this movie having as many as it does is if the producers paid to have a minimum which is apparently 3 1/2
B005ZTFPFQ|5.0|My husband is in 7th Heaven over this app.  He has reverted back to his childhood.  Suddenly my Kindle isn't mine anymore.  Ha!

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Fun interactive game for me & my kids! Awesome graphics!!! Worth everything!! Everyone should get this game. Keeps me and my children entertained for a long time plus has a hint button when you get stuck.
B00280LYIC|5.0|My kids and their friends are totally enamored of this book.  They were also psyched to find out there was a movie too.  But they still appreciated the book so much more.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|If you have seen the movies, then you know how great the story is. After reading the book, realized that some elements were left out of the movies. Definitely worth reading again.

Recommended for everyone who needs - and love -  to have a great time!

B008ASLK8A|1.0|The movie not well done.  It is very low class. Did not care for him in the role at all.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|Fun app! Hours of entertainment. Wish you got more cooking products after level 72! I refuse to buy diamonds and earning them can take a significant amount of time.
B000002JEV|5.0|This was a perfect gift for my husband.  It seems that you cant find this kind of music in stores anymore.
B00448SE4S|4.0|I liked the movie.  It was campy and catoonish.  I knew it was going to be like that and I appreciated it.  I loved the supporting characters: the gay roommate, the F word girl, Knives, Scott's bandmates and his sister.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Not only did I feel empathy for this creature but it struck a chord in my heart since I have a pet that is a cousin to this breed...a &#34;Shiba&#34; who just happens to have similar coloring.  It's this dog's loyalty to his human friend that brought me to tears!  When we show them loving care they will repay us many times over.  Warning; if you are a lover of dogs or any other creatures; make sure you have a box of tissues handy before you press the &#34;play&#34; button!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Our family had heard this was a great T.V series but had never watched.  We watched Season 1 and 2 through Netflix but then needed to do more catching up with Season 3 until the season picks up on Feb 10th.  Great way for us to stay up to date.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|The first two books were so captivating. This book really went in an unexpected direction.  I'm not really sure what message the author was trying to give or what story she was trying to tell. It's not the conclusion of a love triangle and saving the world that the first two books Lead you to believe is coming. Katniss goes on this big \\"mission\\" but never really has  any convictions of her own . And then in the end of her \\"final\\" mission is pointless the same thing would have happened if she would've have stayed in bed. I guess in the end everything is wrapped up but overall I'm disappointed. On another note for all you parents out there I know these are young adult books but the are very violent and gruesome. I wouldn't want my children to read them at all. As an adult parts were disturbing.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Loved this book and reminded me that there really has never been an author who captivates you like Charles Dickens..  Read it over Christmas which was rather cliche but loved every page.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book. Can't wait to read the rest of it. I have more required words so I'm writing this sentence.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This is a really cute and fun app although it can get a little boring and game is great for me cause I love ani.also I think it's perfect. But every ones differently so I hope this helped and have a good day.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Delivered as promised and on time, this movie is just the best. sorry that more people in the US of A didn't check it out. if you go in expecting &#34;Aliens&#34; then you'll be disappointed. but if you want to see just good sci-fi and special effects, and a plotline that'll leave you asking questions, then this is for you. plots flawed, especially the lack of precautions taken when they encounter the alien cobra-like being, but overall the movie's a winner. &#34;spoiler alert&#34; : i was sorry to see Charlizes' demise. the sequel would be so much more interesting if they were both travel companions.
B005R32L66|4.0|I have only used Skype several times for video calls, but it appears to work seamlessly and smoothly. When installed. it configured itself automatically to my tablet's mic, speakers, WiFi & camera and worked well on the first call. The only reason I didn't give it five stars at this time is that I had to stumble through the menus and selections to find the features  and actions I wanted.
B00005YJMX|3.0|No comment on this  as it was a gift for my son. amazon delivered as promised.<br />my son has commented on this one way or the other, so i'm neutral on this particular item.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|My daughter insisted i watch this with her.  I am so glad I did.  It is truly a feel good movie.  The music is catchy and amazing!
B008GFI3QE|5.0|It's just want I was looking for. Thanks!! I was glad I was able to find this online. Thanks again! I haven't seen it yet.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Very cool game, takes along time to download and you need a wi fi connection to do it, but worth it.  Awesome graphics and love the option to play a game to finding HOG rather than wasting hints!
1936608898|5.0|It will be hard to convince people you're not crazy or &#34;depriving&#34; yourself, but following the guidelines in this book will improve your quality of life.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Really enjoyed watching this with my teenage daughters! We enjoyed the dancing and the story line was good too. Some \\"worth repeating\\" one liners
B0074QGGK6|5.0|So much good advice--or just Austin's opinions. I kept saying yes and then yes again. I plan to internalize as many of these ideas as I can recall. Any creative person  should be inspired<br /> by this book. I will share the title with friends. Love it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|if you enjoy solitaire on your computer, smartphone, or with just a plain deck of cards...this app is just as good. Many features allow you to set the game how you want.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I guess it would be OK if it didn't freeze. I had to completley reset my kindle. Do not get this app
B00A757EFW|4.0|Exactly the same graphics, exactly the same sound bites and music, exactly the same control.<br />You know, like when your trying to get Pac-Man to go down and he goes straight, usually right into a ghost? Yeah, it's like that.<br />Perfect for those NAMCO diehards.
B009B8YZIK|5.0|good time was here on. and very fast to get here they met your expectations.i like this a lot good bye
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|The one that started it all, Angry Birds ground breaking, LOL game. No tablet is complete without it. Get it, not because you want it or like it, but because every one and their dog has it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|LOVE IT!!!! The only game I play on my kindle is Minecraft Pocket Edition. Too bad I can't summon Herobrine with the Pocket Edition totum, but still a cool creative game. Haters of minecraft must try it, can't hate minecraft until you try minecraft.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game cracks me up, especially when my son plays it. When he loses, which you have to do to end the game, he get's these bombs, and he starts laughing, saying; &#34;I blew up my dead body!&#34;<br />I love this game, and have recommended it to many of my friends.
B001VIMCW4|4.0|A slightly dull plot holds this film back but the action and acting is superb as ever. Daniel Craig knocks it out the park as Bond. Another thing I appreciated was the small callbacks to the original bond series. A must watch for any fan.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Of course this game is super fun, it's Angry Birds. Aren't angry birds the leading, most downloaded app around. My rating, good or bad means nothing. Just download it, every ones doing it. The bandwagon awaits.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game, it is awesome and lots of fun to play! I can hardly put it down when I start to play!!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Yep, Angry birds. It's still fun, but it's just another Angry Birds. Pull back, let-er-rip, smack, oink, poof, Hillbillies cackle.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved it!! I cannot wait to read Fifty Shades Freed.. I am also anxiously looking forward to the movie.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|If you've played one Angry Birds game, you've played them all. But hey, it's still fun no matter how you cut it. And as usual, Rovio rocks the app world.
034580404X|4.0|I couldn't put them down.  I read all three in 4 days!!  The story line is still on my mind and I think about it often.  Great character development.
B004QMW1NM|5.0|This is my favorite album of 2012 by far! Took my first listen and immediately played thorugh a second time. I continually go back to this album even though I buy new music. I try to listen to other artists, but something about The Naked and Famous and the beats of these songs that really get me.<br /><br />I highly recommend you buy this album! You wont be dissapointed!!
1451695195|5.0|I welcome the Doctor back to Earth Conscienciousness and I found his journey rather exciting ...and reassuring!!  Esp since<br />he confirms under medical terms that he was brain dead and unconnected to his gray matter!<br />It is comforting to know that our dear and loved ones are on such a timeless journey with immediate answers and they<br />are ready to welcome us with enthusiasm and love.  A must read.
1603427244|5.0|Although I've been knitting for 40+ years, this book showed me things I never knew or tried. A perfect gift for both the novice and the experienced knitter.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I choose this rating because I have been reading Jeff's books since I was in 2nd or 3rd grade.And ever since they have been great!And I hope Jeff has more coming for me.
0783225725|5.0|This DVD was very inexpensive, and what's better, it was brand new! This is one of Eastwood's best westerns; it features pretty women and plenty of bullet-riddled bodies. I would recommend this seller to anyone.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|My favorite author is Nicholas Sparks, I have read almost every single one of his books I don't know when or what book I started with but all I know is I can't stop reading his books. Out of all his books I have got to say this is one of the best. I love how he tells the story from the three perspectives. I can't wait to to see the movie but I doubt it will be any better than the book!:)
B000N2HBSO|5.0|After seeing the movie Lincoln, I wanted to read the material from which it was based.  It is a great book and filled with so much research
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Could not put it down.Great story spellbinding.Another great book by John Grisham,the whole story was very entertaining,and keeps you guessing until the end.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is a great movie.  The acting is superb and the development of the characters<br />is excellent.  I have seen the movie twice and recommend it highly.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|I thought the movie would be funnier. Had some good moments but just an ok movie. I liked the cameos and a fan of Mark Walberg- creative plot.
B001U0HAYS|5.0|Great spy thriller.  has a good beginning that sucks you in right away and keeps you interested throughout.  Has  a great endinding witha cat and mouse scene with two different villains at the end and keeps you guiessing til the end.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved Slammed, I thought Point of Retreat was great, but this one was beyond great.  It was her best story yet and I can't wait to read more.  When Colleen tells you a story, you live it.  You see the characters, feel like you know them personally.  Great author, great story, keep up the good work.
B002N5N5R0|5.0|Watched season 1 couldn't wait to put in the next which was season 2 it kept me on the edge of my seat.  I bought this for my man and I enjoyed it just as much.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a joyride that would not stop long enough for me to get some sleep at night. These people were a neurotic trainwreck that I could not stop watching. Enjoy. I did<br />.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Love the series so far.  Nice way to forget the day and relax from life.  Looking forward to next book
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|From the first page to the last, I couldn't put the book down. Such an amazing storyline and when I thought I figured something out ahead of time I was wrong. Would definitely read this again!!
B008Z9L8QI|4.0|The Mellon Collie 28 original tracks remastered by Bob Ludwig sound better then ever before. The drums and bass are louder in the mix and great clarity in vocals and sound. The 3 bonus disks have some great songs including &#34;Ugly&#34; and &#34;Eye&#34; acoustic demos and various takes on &#34;Ruby,&#34; &#34;Beautiful,&#34; &#34;XYU,&#34; as well as countless other classics. A must for the Pumpkin fan...oh yeah..the box, velvet disk holder, giant book, lyric book, and DVD are a nice compliment...
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is the second time I have read the book and I am just as awed as the first time. It's so raw and I smiled giddily throughout the whole thing. Although Travis is troubled, he's simply amazing . My favorite book, hands down.
B005PWPUW6|5.0|I bought a sound bar because I did not like the sound from my new Vizio HD TV - Problem arose when trying to connect the two. Seems the audio output from tv was optical and input to sound bar was Red/yellow/white cable.  After visiting all of the local stores(with no help) I did a search on Amazon and low and behold there was the solution!!!  The difference using the sound bar is amazing!!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was amazing! I liked how there was different people telling the story.  I didn't like that in one part of the story there was no punctuation or capitalization, but it probably something the Kindle did.  I loved the ending but sadly it ended.:)
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Never before have I seen such emotion in a book. Thus book has been loved dearly and I couldn't put it down once I started. And u wonder y
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This little pocket sharpener is super easy to keep in the kitchen drawer and touch up my knives on a regular basis.
B001BC2ZS6|1.0|I thought this book was overrated and disappointing. The plot was undeveloped and lacking and the characters were not lifelike. the ending was abrupt and silly. Overall the book was a major disappointment and not worth my hard earned money.

0345803493|3.0|I'm so bummed. I wanted to love this. It has a great plot and original ideas, but it didn't work for me.<br /><br />I am bothered most by the timeline. At the end of the book, Kate, Ana's best friend, mentions only being gone for sixteen days. Which means that the first two books of this series took place within a little over a month. ...Really? It just isn't believable to me. It was totally and completely frustrating. I believe in love at first sight, but this was ridiculous. Letting a man control you that way after such a short period of time? In love, or not, it doesn't make sense to me. Ana really needed to control her own life and there wasn't much of that.<br /><br />Ana wasn't as spineless in this book. That was one thing I really enjoyed. She stood up for herself much more and wasn't afraid to state her opinion. Though at some points, she relented too fast for my taste, but it was much, much better than the first book. Although, the fact that Christian wouldn't budge on any of Ana's requests, when she shouldn't have to request? That was utterly annoying. Their interactions at most parts in this book make it seem like more of a dictatorship than a relationship.<br /><br />Also, this book had too many \\"big words\\" as my sister would say. It seemed like the author checked for a new word whenever she could. It wasn't necessary in the least and really took away from the story. It made everything more complex and personally, I don't want to have to look in my thesaurus every few sentences. Big words don't make the plot or the characters. This is especially so when the words weren't always used in the right context.<br /><br />It still follows the same plot as the fan fiction. I see no difference. Which is both good and bad. I wish the author had changed it up a bit for publishing, but I respect her choice.<br /><br />I will read the next one, but I don't think it will be the very next thing I read. I need a little break from the madness.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I read this before when it was a fan fiction and I really liked it. I still really liked it, but I'll admit it's nothing near the pedestal that I put it on.<br />Ana is too meek. She isn't a strong female character in the least and that's one reason this really worked as a Twilight fan fiction because Bella isn't exactly the strongest lead either. And the whole \\"inner goddess\\" thing started to really annoy me after a while. Ultimately, Ana is not my favorite character, in this or really any novel.<br />I loved \\"Fifty Shades.\\" But there are some points where he's too much. I don't know how the author manages to write a protagonist who can stand him in his entirety like Ana does. There seems to be no give and take with this man and that's not what a relationship should be. It should be 50/50, not...100% fifty shades. (I liked that pun, excuse it if you must.)<br />The BDSM part of this novel is very minor. It is erotica, and that is completely obvious, but I don't think besides a few scenes that I would classify it as a BDSM inspired book. So that's a little misguiding.<br />Now, don't get me wrong. I didn't hate this book. I actually really liked it. It's an addicting read. There are just some details within the novel that really bothered me.<br />I love Kate and Elliot. Loved them a lot! And Ray, God, Ray is an awesome father. I loved his character with my entire being. The characters were written really well, but we never got to know Ana. There were a lot of mysteries  about her. I couldn't honestly tell you her favorite color.<br />Also, the fact that I originally read this as a fan fiction, it threw me off a bit to read the name change. I understand that to publish it, it had to be done, but it still didn't help when reading it.<br />I like how this book ends. With Ana finally sticking up for herself and doing what she needed to do. Though with the time span of this novel, if I were her, I would've done so a long, long time ago. I wish throughout the book, Ana would've stuck up for herself more. Christian, at one point, calls her a strong woman and I would never have picked that adjective to describe her. She has a lot of growing to do, which is understandable seeing as she just graduated from college.<br />I liked the drama. I'll admit it, I'm a drama obsessor. So that part of the book really worked for me. Ms. James writes drama very realistically. I was able to feel like the characters as I read through it. Not all authors can do that.<br />I've read both negative and positive reviews for this one. I personally liked it, but didn't love and obsess over it like I did when it was a fan fiction story. I will continue the series, and I'm sure I'll feel about the same about the next two books. I hope that I can love them, but I don't think that they will be as amazing as I once thought.uld've stuck up for herself more.

B000MCH5P4|4.0|The film Babel is a drama that takes place in 3 different countries. The story starts off in Morocco when a farmer buys a gun to shoot the jackals that are killing his goats. The farmer gives the rifle to his two sons that take care of the goats. The two sons are about 12 and 15 and start to shoot random things. They then see a car and try to shoot at it from a cliff to see how far the bullet goes. One of the boys shoots at a tourist bus and actually shoots a lady that is riding in the bus. The film then jumps ahead of time to a house in the United States where a nanny is taking care of these two children that are Caucasian.  The nanny wants to attend her son's wedding that is being held in Mexico and the parents of the children are not back yet. (The parents were on the tour bus and the mother was the lady who was shot). Since the nanny can't find someone to take care of the children, she brings them along to the wedding. The story then jumps to Japan and introduces a Japanese teenager that is deaf. She feels that no one loves her because of her disability so she desperately tries to get attention from males. Her father is a business man that is never home and tries to take care of his daughter but feels that he is failing.<br /><br />The movie was pretty good. I usually do not watch movies like these but I enjoyed this one. There were some things that I did not like about the movie though.  The movie keeps going back and forth through time and it got pretty confusing at times, but it starts to make better sense as the movie goes on. Another thing that I did not like was the teenage Japanese girl. I felt like she was a character that had nothing to do with the story and even though the movie makes you feel bad fer her, I felt like most of the time she was just in the way of what the story was about. I did not like how the father was barely a part of the story even though he was the original owner of the rifle.<br /><br />The things I did like about the movie was how one action had created all this commotion and drama that goes on on the movie. I also felt like the music was well done.  There were moments that captured my heart and I recommend this movie for everyone that likes to watch movies that are in the drama genre.w one action had created all this commotion and drama that goes on on the movie.

B0084IG8TM|5.0|So over the weekend I went and saw The Hunger Games. I personally thought it was a good film adaptation because a book that turns into a film always has its flaws.  Now, I'm not going to write about what the film is about because it is originally a book and that's Emily's job. What I will be talking about is how the film was as an adaptation and as its own film.<br /><br />First of all I really loved the book and if you haven't read it by now, you seriously need to go to a book store and buy it! The film had all the major characters that the book introduces so that's a thumbs up. Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) was just as I imagined her to be. Peeta ( Josh Hutcherson) was superb! What I really loved about the film is that there were scenes of Seneca Crane (the gamemaker) and President Snow that were not in the book but I thought that the scenes were very helpful to make the audience understand because the book barley talks about Seneca Crane and President Snow really isn't in it.  Overall, I really loved the film as a book adaptation.<br /><br />Now, as its own movie? I felt that even if someone went to the movie theater to watch it without  even knowing what the book was about they would fall in love and get hooked on The Hunger Games. The film does an excellent job to explain just exactly what The Hunger Games is all about and the acting was pretty awesome. The only thing that I was not a big fan of was how the camera got really shaky during intense moments. This just gave me a headache and made everything feel awkward because I was trying to figure out just what was happening whenever the camera got shaky.  I don't want to give anything away for those of you who have not seen it but the scene that really bothered me was when the games first began. Everything had gotten so shaky that I did not even know what was going on until the end of the scene. That was the only problem that I had wit the film but overall I really enjoyed it and I'm sure that you will too!

0312641893|5.0|Cinder is the most interesting take on a classic fairytale that I have read thus far. Cinderella was born into a world without technology, but Cinder, the main character of this novel was born into a life of cyborgs, moon people and hover crafts.<br /><br />From the first time I heard of this novel, I was intrigued. I've been on a dystopian kick ever since I read The Hunger Games series by Suzanne Collins. There have been quite a few books in this genre that have not been very good. This is definitely NOT one of those books. Cinder was phenomenal! I loved the characters, the situations and the struggles. Everything about this book just clicked.<br /><br />Cinder is one of my all time favorite female characters. She's strong, brave, true to herself and really cares about her loved ones. You can see that within the first few chapters. She loves her step-sister, Peony. Those are the female protagonists that I enjoy reading about - the ones who really care about their family and have great, relatable characteristics! Plus, she's a mechanic! That just tells you how fierce she is. She doesn't let what others think of her really affect what she does or who she is. In a world where cyborgs exist, but don't have the same rights and are unliked by the rest of the population, she does what she needs to do to take care of herself, her companion, Iko and her step-sister, Peony. She is a true heroine!<br /><br />Don't even get me started on Prince Kai. He's so swoon-worthy. I just love his name too! All of the names in the book are really interesting! Ms. Meyer really does a great job on creating characters and giving them the perfect names. Two thumbs up, for sure!<br /><br />The villains in this book are also really awesome. The villains are usually what make the book, because they give the main heroes and heroines something to work against and they truly make the plot. If you don't have a good villan, it is hard to really get into a book. Cinder has a perfect villan that puts Cinder in many difficult predicaments  There are multiple villains that really range in evil-ness and that really helps the book by giving it more conflict.<br /><br />The major \\"twist\\" in this story is not really a twist. It's a bit obvious, but I still bounced up and down when I read it. The way that the author wrote it really made it work. My breath literally was taken away and I actually made little, \\"SQUEE!\\" noises. (Judge if you will.)<br /><br />My brain is in jumbles over this book. It has everything you need! Mystery, a subtle romance, action, adventure and a dystopian society that has a treaty with humans that live on the moon. I recommend it to everyone. And I am dying for the next book. I literally need it in my hands right now! Fantastic!Cinder in many difficult predicaments  There are multiple villains that really range in evil-ness and that really helps the book by giving it more conflict.<br /><br />The major \\"twist\\" in this story is not really a twist.

B00AMBLXP8|4.0|You can't get over the fact that the bear has Peter's voice from Family Guy and they address that issue within the script. It's raunchy no doubt but what do you expect from Seth McFarland? It does end on a touching sweet note though that even guys will get and love. I would recommend this movie to any Family Guy fan and to anyone that just wants a good laugh.

B009YP9L7U|5.0|Megan Scott has plans. Self assured, confident, and on the right track; a relationship just wasn't part of the picture. After a bridal shower in Vegas she wakes up with a handsome stranger in her bed. But it turns out he's not a stranger. He's her husband. Conner Reed isn't part of her plan. And he doesn't want a divorce.<br /><br />It has been twenty years since I read a Harlequin romance. After reading a few I didn't think they were for me. But something about the cover, the description, and the fact that Mira Lyn Kelly is a USA TODAY best selling author intrigued me. And I am so glad it did. My reintroduction to Harlequin could not have been better. I read all 224 pages in one day and am happily looking forward to reading my next KISS collection book.<br /><br />Waking Up Married is the perfect combination of new romance, angst, flirtiness, and sex (not so much it makes me blush but not so little it left me wondering). While I've never been in Megan's position, I love being swept in a romance that for just a little while makes me feel like a young twenty something. And Kelly made it so easy to be that person.<br /><br />If you love romance with just a little bit of sex and love and....then this is for you.

B00A0SKFLG|2.0|Some rave that this is just different enough from the original to make it entertaining. Well, it may be just that but it's not different enough from a hundred other modern action films to make it entertaining enough. The cast doesn't measure up to the original - nor does the environment. Mars made the original a real sci-fi film whereas this could take place anywhere on Earth. Here, this could be any one of a hundred different films and you couldn't tell the difference. Sure the effects are better than the original but not enough to win an Oscar like the original did. It's sad to see how easily entertained people have become in the last 20 years. Farrell doesn't have anywhere near Arnold's presence, who was surprisingly good in the first one. Plus he had the physical build to make it much more believable that he could take on big opponents.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Rarely does a book get my mind so entwined that I think about it allllll day.  This one did.  The passion between the characters was so intense. Anyone could melt from their chemistry.  However! To the point midway thru the book it turned dark and disturbing and frankly I skimmed the rest. To each their own but I don't like (spolier alert!) stories of child molestation. Its just disturbing and not what's I look for in a book. Romances need drama yes, but not depressing disgusting nighmare provoking crap.  I'm sad because I was loving it do much. Seriously disappointing.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|This review is of the bound, soft cover edition which I purchased a month ago from Amazon.  For some reason, they will not allow a review of the product until March, when they say it is scheduled for release.  How then did I buy it from Amazon in November?  In any case, I had to file the review under the Kindle version.<br /><br />This post-apocalyptic work is a collection of five previously released novellas which focus on life in an underground \\"silo\\" following some kind of apocalyptic event that made life on the Earth's surface impossible.  At the time of the stories beginning, this underground life had already been in place for hundreds of years.  My first thought is of a missile silo, but the scope of the facility seems far in excess of any such missile silo, consisting of 144 levels, connected by a spiral staircase; and each level is clearly larger than 8-10' high, as it might take two hours to traverse 40 levels.<br /><br />The concept of such a life is fascinating, and the author touches upon several of the more interesting facets, from petroleum exploration, electricity generation, water use and conservation, food growth and distribution.  Perhaps most interesting, however, is the psychological toll that such a life takes on the inhabitants.<br /><br />I've read numerous post-apocalyptic stories and am fascinated by them.  The best are the most realistic works, whose premise and landscape are utterly believable and therefore the most impactful.  Cormack McCarthy's The Road comes immediately to mind.  While this collection is very good, and engaging, it fails to measure up to others I've read.  There seem to be several instances that border on the silly and strain credibility.  In an underground bunker that sports generators, refineries, IT and mining operations, and takes days to traverse from top to bottom, would all supplies be transported by porters?  How long would it take someone to develop the idea of constructing a simple hoist to move goods (and perhaps even people) up and down the various levels?  Perhaps this is all part of the \\"control\\" exercised by the ruling class, but I see no benefit to backpacking food and other necessities the vast distances required.<br /><br />And how high are the ceilings on each level?  It takes 3 days to walk 144 flights of stairs?  Many of the levels sound like standard 10 foot ceilings, while others may be somewhat higher, but in order to take 3 days to walk down 144 flights of stairs, each \\"flight\\" would have to be about 100 feet.  Makes no sense. Little things like these, and several others that involve revealing spoilers, lessen the believability and therefore the enjoyment of the work in my eyes.haps even people) up and down the various levels?

B0071BGOJC|3.0|Love Ken Follett generally but this book for me was a bit of a let down with a rushed ending or maybe part III should just not exist? Anyway it is a good historical account and a lot of history to bring in but lacks detail in the story around each person - too many key people? Emotionally it did not grab me at all. Not of his usual standard.

B00423BDUC|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1LEK61DP0A613]]Hi, thanks for checking out my review...<br /><br />Since you're probably already familiar with the film, I'll just say it's a wonderful movie and I love it, and stick to some of the technical details that confuse a lot of people.<br /><br />First, this film was never released on DVD here in the U.S. Therefore, if you want a copy of the movie on DVD you have to get a copy that was released outside the U.S. Namely Europe.<br /><br />Here's where it gets confusing for some people...<br /><br />For technical reasons I won't delve into here, when DVDs are released around the world, they can be digitally restricted to only play in certain regions, and not others. Hence the term 'region codes' when talking about DVDs.<br /><br />Here in the U.S. (Region code 1) we use a video formatting system called NTSC. Whereas in Europe (Region code 2) they use a different video formatting system called PAL. These two systems are not compatible with each other.<br /><br />So, because most of the Electric Dream DVDs you'll find here come from Europe, they will be Region 2 using the PAL formatting system. This means they will not play in most DVD players sold here in the U.S. (Although there are some exceptions)<br /><br />Here in the U.S. most DVD players can play only Region 1 discs formatted in NTSC. However, there are some higher end players that are Multi-Region and can convert PAL to NTSC. If you have one of these players, as I do, then you will be able to watch the movie just fine. Check the specs of your player to be sure.<br /><br />My personal situation...<br /><br />I ordered my copy from a seller in Italy. The disc was Region code 0, meaning it was Region free. But, it was still formatted using the European PAL system. Therefore, even though it was Region free, it would not play in one of my DVD players. However, it was able to play in my other one, a high-end Oppo DVD player, which is capable of playing both NTSC and PAL formats.<br /><br />When Itook it to my girlfriends house, her new Panasonic Blu-Ray player would not play the film, so we just played it on her laptop using VLC Media Player, which worked just fine. We connected the laptop to the TV with an hdmi cable and it looked wonderful.<br /><br />So here is my recommendation...<br /><br />If you want a copy of this movie on DVD, then just order one. Don't worry about the region code or the formatting. If your DVD player won't play the movie, then just watch it using your computer or laptop. It should be able to play just fine on a computer. Then, just patch your computer/laptop to your tv, and enjoy!<br /><br />If it does not play using Windows Media Player, simply use another media player such as VLC Player. If you're not familiar with VLC, it's a very popular media player that can play almost any media file known to man. Then, just plug your computer to your tv using an hdmi cable, and there you go.<br /><br />Anyway, I hope this was able to answer some of your questions. I will try to add a video review if I have time so you can see the disc I received from Italy. I'll also attach some photos.<br /><br />Hope that helps...

0307454568|4.0|I am forever a fan of Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy, centering around the misfit, but brilliant hacker Lisbeth Salander. I thoroughly enjoyed \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\" and \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire,\\" as this book was just good. I give it the benefit of the doubt, because Larsson intended to live and make this a ten-book series. In fact, he was working on a fourth in the series when he died a sudden and tragic death.<br /><br />\\"The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest\\" follows the results of \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire,\\" which brings up the question as to whether or not Lisbeth Salander can care for herself and live on her own. If she's deemed incapable, chances are that she will be forced to return to a psychiatric center where she was overseen by the same specialist that treated her poorly and followed up episodes of hers with undesirable consequences (real undesirable, not child-style discipline). Much of the first part of the book is filled with interviews preparing for the court case. It leads up to the case and the aftermath.<br /><br />If you are a devoted fan of the series, you should definitely pick this one up. It's not in the same league as the first two and has one eventful moment within the first part of the book, but it picks up as it goes along and goes at a pace in which a book from this trilogy should go along. What a fantastically hardcore, pedal to the metal trilogy!

B0041KVW2K|5.0|This is a great box set and I cannot understand all the negativity. My set arrived today undamaged and the records look and sound great! Of course, it helped that I purchased this set from a seller from ebay, who shipped my box set in the original Capitol packaging with styrofoam inside, which kept the box set from moving during transit to my home. But the seller also placed the Capitol Box inside his own box so my new unopened box set was basically double packaged. At first, I was uncertain wheather or not I should get this box set since I own all the UK 1st pressing originals of the Beatles studio albums and 45 singles, but I am glad I gave in . The box set, which is was packaged nicely, was money well spent and is the perfect compliment to my original records. Also, it's great to have the 252-page hardcover book. My only knock, though only minor, would be that I saw some differences in the record labels, album sleeves, and album jackets. They are not exactly carbon copies of the originals, but they are decent reproductions. My Beatle originals will always be superior, but this wonderful box set is great to have as a supplement! Highly recommended! :o)

1558809562|5.0|Few motion picture remakes are as good as the film they're based upon. Director Martin Scorsese's 1991 version of CAPE FEAR is a rare example of a reworking that actually exceeds the original. Here's why:<br /><br />1.) Bernard Herrmann's glorious score is powerfully enervating in Dolby stereo.<br /><br />2.) The De Niro Max Cady has better reasons to torment Sam Bowden, an attorney who betrayed and helped convict his own client (Cady) by holding back exculpatory evidence. In the original version, Bowden's eyewitness testimony at Cady's assault trial helps to procure a \\"guilty\\" verdict. While stewing in jail, Cady convinces himself that Bowden is solely responsible for his eight-year prison term, rather than his own wrongful behavior. It's unsustainable illogic, thus a poor reason for revenge.<br /><br />3.) The family dynamic. In the '91 film, daughter Danielle is rebellious to both parents and even welcomes Cady's attention, to a point. In the earlier work, daughter Nancy is a good child who is simply terrified of her stalker. Nick Nolte's Sam is more 3-dimensional than Greg Peck's wooden lawyer; he's also a heel who cheated on his wife. The original movie has no hint of infidelity. Leigh Bowden (Lange) isn't a complete innocent, either. She's been psychologically torturing husband Sam over his indiscretion for some time now.<br /><br />4.) Max Cady himself. Robert De Niro plays him as a genuinely ferocious demon, while Robert Mitchum is sinister but far more low key. De Niro drew upon early efforts with director Roger Corman for the coarse mountain-accented Max. In Corman's [[ASIN:B000SK5ZFC BLOODY MAMA]] (1970), he was Ma Barker's psychotic son, Lloyd.<br /><br />5.) Superior special effects in Scorsese's picture make the climactic stormy river sequence a nerve-shattering experience, especially on the big screen. The freedom to depict graphic violence also means the newer film packs a more powerful punch.<br /><br />6) The finale. De Niro's demise is unforgettable; perhaps his best screen moment. In the original, Sam shoots Cady in the shoulder and the wounded Max quietly lays there while Sam crows that he's going back to jail for life. By contrast, the '91 Max gets everything that's coming to him, including a partial immolation at the hands of Danielle. Mitchum's bad guy doesn't suffer nearly enough for what he's put the Bowmans through.<br /><br />Watch 'em both and make your own comparisons, but by all means see this one first!<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(7.3) Cape Fear (1991) - Nick Nolte/Jessica Lange/Robert De Niro/Juliette Lewis/Joe Don Baker/Robert Mitchum/Gregory Peck/Martin Balsam/Fred Thompsonle; perhaps his best screen moment.

020530902X|3.0|Following artificial rules of grammar have never been my forte.  When writing for pedantics this book is probably a godsend.  Yet, because I'm involved in academia, especially with philosophy and history where we constantly see how languages adapt and change over years, I just don't see the point in getting all up-tight about someone \\"breaking\\" arbitrary rules.  Geoffrey K. Pullum has a better critique than I could ever come up with: [...]<br />The Good:<br />Satisfies grammar Nazis and formalists who are more concerned with rules than content.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />Stifles free thought and creativity, horrible for people who actually use language for a living.

Which I appreciate since I'm not a big fan of off-the-wall ridiculous science-fiction stories stories (which this kind-of is).  I found myself feeling genuine anxiety and impassioned resolve as I cheered for the protagonist as she deals with overwhelming gut-wrenching hurdles in life.  Through the book I was constantly in awe that someone (Ms. Collins) actually thought this story up in her head!  That is a true wonder of the world for me.<br /><br />The story is an interesting backdrop to discuss real world questions relating to social stratification, desensitization of violence and other issues. I might even go so far as to suggest that this could be a response to Atlas Shrugged depicting one possible outcome for society after John Galt and friends retreat to the valley.

B008IJTFYW|5.0|Does what it says and has a lovely interface. there is a much larger selection of music and sounds than I thought there would be
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|A straight up awesome movie, with a deep plot, imaginative use of Batman's villain lexicon, and a near heartbreaking ending that is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat!
B004XANKVO|5.0|Product is fantastic-just as described.  Thule has thought of everything.<br />I researched laptop backpacks for MONTHS and decided on Thule.  I am not disappointed in the slightest<br />I have only had the product for a day but so far so good.  Perfect for the busy executive who uses an airport for an office a good % of the time.  The build quality is outstanding as well.  Looking forward to many years of productive use
B0043WDK2G|5.0|I just LOVE the chemistry between Castle and Beckett! I'm so addicted I just bought Season 4 to watch on Amazon!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Not exactly perfectly written but great book. Keeps you interested and on edge waiting for more. The descriptions are AMAZING!
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|I moved tho the kindle from the iPad. I had the iPad for a year and the drawing apps are amazing the're . I was anxious to make the move but the graphics program helped mask the transition easy.  same look and feel.  I can resume my doodles adequately again.
B004LWZW6U|5.0|If you love a good laugh this movie is great!! It's soooo stupid its hilarious! 3D boobs, who could ask for more!
B0054TKB8I|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE! No other words for it. I enjoyed the acting, the actors, and the show. It was very well done.
075669812X|5.0|My son loves this book!  There is a lot to read and look at time and time again. Well worth it.
B0000CABJ1|4.0|My brother loved the best of Donna Summer.  The tape was in excellent quality and he really enjoy listening to her sons.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love it Love it Love it!!!!!  I purchased this book for my LONG flight overseas.  Needless to say I didn't get drowsy on the nine hour flight!  : }
0062082353|5.0|Really hard to put this book down! And i liked the fact thats Chris's wife adds to the book in a whole new way giving perspective on what its like for the family while in the teams!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This was downloaded for my sons' kindle & I must admit it is extremely addicting.  I don't usually like games, but I do like this one!
B00992CF6W|4.0|This application is really good but there are some better block creators like Survival craft. This one is ok , but could be better like updating more often. But the price price is very good for minecraft.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Although the book was very entertaining and held my interest for the whole 2 days it took to read, I felt sad for the main character, Anastasia, when I was done.  To me this story is about a handsome, rich, untouchable man who takes advantage of a sweet, naive girl.  It's the age old story of trying to change a person when that's just not possible.  I was left dissatisfied by the poor writing as well, though, again the story was entertaining enough.
B007UXSPK2|3.0|Its entretaining, classic Mission Impossible movie. Lots of actions, special effects and a classic plot. If there is nothing better to do, its OK to watch.<br />Amazon service on this movie was bad. It load very slow and pixelated and didn't have an option availabe for subtitles.
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|Loved it. Great film with action with some american history thrown in.  Not your standard run of the mill movie plot.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The displays are clear and crisp, playing is simple.  The settings are easy to understand and customize.  The game is just a lot of fun
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Very well written. Enjoyed the twists and turns. Amazed by the boldness of the detail of the games and events that occurred.
B000N3ST7A|1.0|I just received my shipment and instead of a CD I received a DVD. It was not even the real thing but rather a copy. No original cover, nothing. The DVD won't even play on my DVD, computer, or any other device.  I am so upset about this and want my money back.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very entertaining and addictive.  Love playing it and can't keep it off my kindle.  What else should I say about it.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Fun movie that knows what it is. My teenage kids and I really enjoyed the music and juvenile humor. Not great but good for some laughs.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|hello I think that twitter is the best social media there is. besides Facbook. so people with Facebook accounts. Join Twitter.
0345803485|1.0|I wish I could give this zero stars! What a disappointment. I cannot believe that this book is a New York Times bestseller! I mean, come on is this a joke?  It really scares me that so many people think this is a wonderful book! It is poorly written, as if written by a teenager!  How can EL James walk around and make herself believe that she wrote a good book? This really baffles me!! I bought her book after I saw her on Katie and I wish that I could get my money back. I've read books that were given to me by Amazon for free that are much better than this piece of crap! The story is simply unbelievable and apparently she didn't read her book once she wrote it, because her storyline contradicts itself over and over. It feels as if she copied and pasted sentences over and over. Maybe her hand cramped as she was typing therefore she decided to copy and paste sentences galore!  if you take off the biting of the lip, playing with the hair, Jeez, holy crap, inner goddess, the book will be down to less than 100 pages ! If you want a book that repeats itself over and over, then this is the book for you.  however; you have been warned! Don't waste your money and precious time reading this crap. I definitely have no interest in reading any of her other books!!!
B00AA7O22U|3.0|Liked seeing all the action stars together, but the script seemed to be lacking in a a few spots. So it's just okay.
B0072PUC7W|5.0|I love Armin's work, when I listen to his tracks, i literally get goose bumps! Armin never ceases to surprise me!
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I was amazed how Josh Brolin spoke just like Tommy Lee Jones. It made the movie more enjoyable. Loved it!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks has done it again! This book was everything I was looking for. Love, hardship, with a little suspense. I couldn't put it down!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was excellent.  It was a very easy read, and contained an action-packed explanation of the Bin Laden raid.  It was written better than Lone Survivor which is, however, another great book.  Anyone who enjoyed Lone Survivor will appreciate this book and vice versa.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I had been a fan of Mr. Albom for many years. I love all his books, the Time Keeper has a beautiful message. We should enjoy every moment and day in our lives and stop counting the time for everything that we do!!!
B0053O89IS|5.0|Bones is an all around great show!  The character dynamics have changed for this season, and it is just as lovely as always!
B005LAII8K|3.0|This is an OK movie with an OK plot. The acting is really good and Cid (Pierce Gagnon), the little kid, saves the movie. Bruce Willis is well, ...Bruce Willis nothing exceptional, nothing earth shuttering. Just your usually Bruce from Die Hard.<br /><br />The year is 2040 (...or around there) and people live a peaceful life in a futuristic society with a lots of poverty and cars that look that were made in 2000 (!). Time travel was not invented yet. But, it was invented in the future (30 years later) and immediately was outlawed and only available on the black market. In addition, the mafia (in the future) cannot kill people freely because everybody has an ID and it is difficult to make someone disappear. And as always the mafia found a solution. They send the victims in the past to be killed by the \\"loopers\\". The loopers are just killing machines. They kill people and make them dissapear. Essentially the victims never existed. However, now and then a looper must be terminated too (closing the loop). So the mafia sends the looper back from the future (older) with a lot of gold. Basically the looper kills his older self. He has 30 years remaining in his life which he can enjoy by spending the gold on drugs, hookers, air bikes etc.<br /><br />And life goes on with everybody partying, doing drugs, sleeping with hookers, until things are getting complicated because Joe (the young version played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) fails to kill the old Joe (Bruce Willis). However, Bruce Willis is mad (as always) because the mafia killed his wife (in the future) while apprehending him. So he sends himself in the past to find the guy who changed society drastically (the rainmaker) and kill him while he is a 10-year old kid. Like this his wife will not be killed (in the future). Here, now you have the plot! Deal with it...<br /><br />There are a lot of things wrong with this movie but the cars are the most important inaccuracy that jumps at you. All cars look like today's cars. Even the cars around 2070 look like todays cars. The pickup truck that Emily Blunt drives (Cid's mother/babysitter) is like the one that was made yesterday. So while we have invented time travelling we just didn't make anything better than an SUV or a pickup truck? Hum...Another problem: Emily shoots young Joe in the right shoulder, old Joe (Bruce) feels it and touches his right shoulder were he has the scars, and two scenes later Emily is taking care of young Joe's left shoulder. Come on people, check the scenes, don't be so arrogant, and make an effort. Why are you (the Hollywood crowd) assuming that some people are not going to notice? Not everybody who watches movies is an idiot, a low information voter. This attitude makes total sense with your political convictions and the fact that you really believe that you are part of some kind of \\"elite\\" (or the \\"Hollywood nomenclatura\\") and the little people (us) don't know much. Wake up! You depend on us.<br /><br />This is an average movie with an average scenario/plot and of course an ending that MUST be politically correct. That is the problem with the Hollywood movies. They must be PC. While the ending was somehow unexpected, it didn't make any sense. If the ending stands, then the movie and the plot should not exist (...probably for the better). Old Joe wouldn't have all these problems because old Joe.....!!<br /><br />Three stars because of the kid (Cid). He is just an unbelievable actor and he has great facial expressions.<br /><br />PS, If you really want to understand what I mean about having movies with PC endings, watch the two versions of \\"The vanishing\\". The French version has a realistic ending, while the Hollywood version has a PC ending.he cars around 2070 look like todays cars.

B0053O89KG|5.0|Castle is one of the best shows on television today.  It has a wonderful mix of comedy and serious situations that make it like tv crack :-)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is very good. How the story unfolds before your eyes is simple breathtaking. A very good read. Your sure to love it.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|This show is one of my favorites.  It is worth it to buy the complete series rather than the individual seasons because it is compact and it has special features that are not on the individual seasons :-)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book.  It kept me on my toes the entire time. I can't wait to read the sequel.
B003YBUSMW|4.0|If you spent $5,000 to build your own cockpit so you could &#34;properly&#34; play Flight Simulator, then this is not the wheel for your racing games.  It doesn't have gears or ratchets; it doesn't burst into flames when your car hits a wall; and it doesn't make you an espresso to go along with your Italian driving shoes that you wear when heel-toeing around Imola.<br /><br />However, if you would like to gain two or three steps toward a more realistic driving experience, and can suspend your disbelief that you are not actually, you know, moving, then you might just like this wheel.<br /><br />It is responsive, gives you a bit of rumble when you veer off the track, and most importantly, provides a reasonably happy tactile feel of actually driving a car even while sitting on your couch.  The pedals are responsive enough.  No, there isn't a clutch; get over it.  I've witnessed the faces of kids and adults alike, lighting up with joy as they tried their first race -- all remarking how much fun it was to use the wheel/pedal combination.<br /><br />Again, if you want to be Lewis Hamilton, I am sorry to inform you that no amount of money spent on your gaming wheel will help you.  I sincerely doubt supermodels are sitting next to you on your couch anyway.  But if you want to step things up a notch or three, this is the wheel for you.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|Great and funny. I really loved it Greg was good in it but I really liked Roderick he was cool.
B007SGM084|5.0|What a wonderful love story! Loved it! I heard all the talk and thought I should give it a try and instantly I was hooked. This is definitely a series I see myself reading over and over.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Not much of a plot but verrry fun and exciting. I really like the book, it gives you a different perspective on things
B008B68IUY|4.0|This is a great addition to our daughters monster high collection!  It was a little pricey though, but worth the look oh her face when she opened it!
B00005V9IL|5.0|Classic old movie, very funny and great effects for the time. A bit of harsh language, but great family movie. A+
0671449028|5.0|Hopefully will entice a little tyke to be interested in the print. I love the product. We will start to read it right away to our 2 months old baby.
B0053O89WY|5.0|We love the big bang theory and watched the whole season in just a few days. Now I am already waiting for season 6!
B006H5120E|5.0|The 3D was excellent. Shame it is in 2 parts over 2 Discs.<br />Picture quality was great. Nice to finally see it in 3D.<br />Enjoyed watching it again.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the kids play this, and they got mom hooked.<br />now dad is playing it too. maybe grandma and grandpa are next??
B002WY65UQ|5.0|Very nice cover artwork. Much nicer in my opinion than the Australian cover.<br />A fun movie that re establishes and Updates St Trinians from the 50s.<br />Also sets up the story for the sequel.<br />Great chemistry between characters.
1451695195|1.0|I can see people being swayed by the fact that Dr. Alexander has extensive medical training.<br />But given his background, he doesn't spend much time convincing you, other than saying that<br />his brain was shut down.  How does he know ?  How shut down could it have been, if he had a<br />full recovery ?  Other trained neurosurgeons have not backed up his medical evidence.  Not<br />one I'm aware of.  They have ducked going on the record.<br /><br />As far as the book goes, it is a book for money plain and simple.  What Alexander tells you<br />can be distilled down to a one page magazine article.  He gives you a tiny glimpse of what<br />he says is heaven, then goes back to what is happening in the intensive care unit, all for<br />the purpose of filler, i.e. to make it a book that could be sold.  After the 3rd time or so<br />of this, it's maddening as hell.  I really don't care what the person holding your hand back<br />in the hospital is doing.  Make your case already.<br /><br />He says he was told he would \\"learn many things\\".  What things ?  We aren't told. Many ?<br />Really ?  How many ?  What ?  That we are all loved and we can do no wrong in heaven.<br />Is that many ?  I take it back, that cannot fill a one page magazine article, no less a book.<br />Maybe Alexander said more, and I didn't get to it.  I've gotta admit, I had to put the book down.<br /><br />I do think Alexander believes what he's saying.  I don't think he's a fraud.  But<br />the proof was lacking, folks.
B009IF7SWG|5.0|Funny as hell. One of Will Farrell's better movies by far.  Some crude humor but its not offensive by any means and you laugh the entire movie.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A great book. Have not finished it yet so no spoilers here.......and no, this is not a book report. It's simply a review; my two cents worth on how I liked the book. I downloaded the sample and simply couldn't put it down. I was quickly drawn in to the story and the character.<br />Well written, quickly paced and plenty of humor. Was a little put off by some the the language at first but the author makes it work. And it's certainly not over the top considering the main characters situation.<br />About fifty pages to go so will finish it off tonight and looking for more from this author....good job Andy.<br />I love the authors humor and there is plenty of science. And for under a buck at almost 350 pages, it's another great Amazon deal.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I love the way this story was written.  The dialogue has the wonderful accents that I enjoy and can imagine hearing the person actually talking.  I forgot I was reading and really got into this book.  I would recommend it as just a great story.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Besides the fact that this is a headline story, the author has done a very good job of keeping politics out of the story.  It  comes across as an honest and straightford telling of what it takes to be on the team that took out Osama Bin Laden.  Also a very good narrative of the actual event followed by a very personal account of the impact on the author's life.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing book I'd read it again if I could. Surely a blockbuster book and the movie was great too. Read it.
0307730697|5.0|OK so I'll fess up.  I enjoy reading books about Navy SEALs.  I worked with SEALs decades ago during the Vietnam gig and my respect for them never waned.<br />Most books about SEALs start with the training and sometimes get into actual operations.  Fearless is different.  It is a book about Adam Brown.  By the standards of the Navy SEALs and specifically the \\"1-percenters\\" of the SEALs, Team Six, Adam Brown was truly an exceptional individual who overcame  unbelievable barriers in his life to become an adult, a husband, a father, a child of God, an all-around man who cared more for others than for himself, a good friend, a professional, a giver and still...........a vulnerable, mortal human being.  If this book was fiction it would be hard to believe but it is not fiction.  It is non-fiction, assembled by the author through interviews with those who knew him, worked with him, helped him survive, loved him, a biography, a look into Adam's soul.<br /><br />This is one book that I would recommend to anyone with no reservations.  I plan on giving away some copies to some special people.  I would recommend it to teenagers.  I would recommend the book to those struggling in life, to those who can't seem to get out of their own way, to those who seem to sabotage their lives by their own misdeeds.  Hope.  Persistence. Love. Those words jump out when trying to describe the book or to put it better, the life of Adam Brown.<br /><br />This book should be made into a movie. There wouldn't be a dry eye in the house.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I truly don't have the words to express what an AMAZING book this is.  This book expands over a 3 month time frame with some flashbacks thrown in but i have to say that the range of emotions you feel during this journey is endless.  I have never felt so many different things while reading a book.  I laughed, I cried, I got angry, I felt the love and many other emotions.  I can't truly give an accurate review of this book without giving things away...so I am not going to do that.  So all I have to say is this book is a MUST READ!!!!!!  There are so many twists and turns to this story it will keep you intrigued from the very first page to the very last page.  I loved both Holder and Sky...they were amazing characters and such strong individuals.  Read this story, you won't be disappointed.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I was really disappointed about half way through the book. Don't want to spoil it so that's all I'll say. It did get better again.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|Of course I'm gonna love this, it's my favorite TV show!  Shipping and handling time was good, don't really know what else to say about this....you either like the show or your don't
B0094BB4TW|5.0|it works fine , have no issues , Had to get it for my kindle fire .. no complaints here
B006LSZECO|5.0|I usually don't like mysteries with multiple points of view, but I'll make an exception for this one. Flynn's use of two viewpoints isn't contrived, it's integral to the story, the plot, and the character development. The writing is fresh and insightful as well. All together, I have to say, it's a complete package of reading enjoyment. I'd put &#34;Gone Girl&#34; on the short list if you want a really great contemporary read.
B008CX2A2I|2.0|According to customer support, this product, or the receiver, does not support Bluetooth 4, at least from my smartphone. I bought it hoping to be able to stream from my (T-Mobile) Galaxy SIII, but it didn't work. I see now the product description says it works with Bluetooth 3, but that didn't mean anything to me. I had no idea what version of Bluetooth we were at, or if it mattered (aren't most things backwards compatible?). It does work with older devices, but if you own the latest and greatest gear, better check first. I was, however, able to stream through the receiver using DLNA.<br /><br />I will keep it for guests, but I probably would not have bought it if I had known about the compatibility issue first. Onkyo customer support says they are aware of the problem and may be able to fix it in a future firmware upgrade, so check first.
B007T99ENE|4.0|A little self indulgent at times but widens to a nicely rounded story and ending. When you think about it some of the twists were not surprising! All characters were beautifully personalised. An easy and interesting read. Highly recommend. Well done.
B00000J048|5.0|This is so creative and well made - it is one of my favorite gifts to my grandchild.  All of us love playing with this toy.  It was well packaged - as well as the shipping  packaging.  It arrived on time in great condition.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|This case is very stylish and effective.It is made sturdy with smooth,nice leather on the outside. My only complaint is the case is designed so you can either and the webcam facing you when propped up or and the charger accessible from the closed position. Besides that it matches up to the $45 dollar cases for half the cost.This is a great case for your Kindle Fire HD.
B0098VXBIA|1.0|Proof that star power is not enough to save a movie this poorly written. I tried to stick it out for an hour but to no avail. Save your money and watch something else!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game is a lot of fun &amp; is a great way to pass time. I really enjoy playing it on my Kindle Fire.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|good and fun game, i purchased this game from amazon.com i dont have it on my phone so i just downloaded it to my kindle
B0035FQ1UU|1.0|I couldn`t hear it.  Can`t you make the audio on your products louder???<br />All of the trailers I watched had the same problem.  Please turn up the volume
B0083P1QUM|4.0|This book follows the usual characters that Cornwall has in her books but, has a twist from the beginning.  A turtle is found entwined  in a fishing net with  the first victim of the novel .
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I love how it has big buttons to press and how u can hit the history bar and see how they worked it.Also good for working out homework or hard math problems.It's fast easy and ready to use although it does not do fractions and I don't like the clear bar either so but other than that it's awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  (:!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Brings up many questions in your mind concerning a child getting trouble with law enforcement while the parent is a DA himself.<br />I read for a book club and know it will have alot of issues to discuss.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I love this book, everything makes sense and falls in place naturally. The characters are believable and the storyline is realistic. Overall, the book shows that falling in love is inevitable when you find your soul mate.
B001U3Y5XE|3.0|I\\"d love to give this a higher rating as it's a very cute concept.  My 5 year old son and I had a lot of trouble, however, with creating the pictures on the cards.  We ended up laughing at what the game directed us to build (like a canoe) without any curved pieces.  We gave up trying to follow the game rules and just played around with the pieces, which you could do with any set of Legos.  I'll give it three stars though because I'im sure someone more creative could recreate these pictures...it's just not us.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was really good and unexpected if you like the other Dairy of a wimpy kid books you will love this one
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is the best game I have ever played. The best thing is that there is no ending, just endless fun!
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|Amazing book! Finished it in less than two days! I could not stop reading it! I absolutely loved it a lot!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Since I downloaded this game, I have lost track of time! I forgot that I have books to read on here too...lol! Now I wish they would come out with a Pyramid game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is definitely on of the best books in the world but i am mad that there is only ons more book.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|While I was reading the book , really caught my attention ,about Charlies life .I had a great time reading about his  life , that I felt like I was this friend , like he said I was . Great story
0763644765|5.0|&#34;I did it!&#34; was my son's first sentence.  &#34;I did it&#34; is the bright exclamation this cheerful, wiggly toddler uses when he successfully uses the potty.  The potty training toddler in the book is not sure about ditching the diaper and using the potty so he tries to make sense of it by seeing what his dog and cat do when they use the potty.  He finally gets that everyone has their own routine and all he has to do is sit down on his own potty and be patient!  At the end of the book he gets his reward... UNDIES!!!!  Another of my toddler now favorite words.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|What a refreshing book. While a lot of stories today mash in so much manufactured action just to fill space, this book kept everything just as intense without cheating with added fluff. Some reviewers were fatigued with &#34;too much detailed science&#34; but I found it an exceptional way of drawing me into the story. Granted there were a few necessary departures to make the plot work ( like the force of the wind....). I appreciated  the humor and banter as much as the anxiety of every near death experience. Wish there were more authors willing to keep it factual and not just placate the Ritalin crowd. Didn't see anything else from this author. Hope he will write something else real soon. A super buy for .99! I will read this again before too long. Great stuff!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|So far, I have had no problems. It works okay, but it  doesn't always auto-refresh. I don't use it often, but for now it gets the job done.
B00005N6KG|2.0|They are so light weight I feel like I have to hold them on. The fit is odd too. The speakers face away from the ear canal. I guess I will keep looking for a good headset to run with.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Great examples and easy to follow advice without being &#34;preachy.&#34; If you want to get rid of bad habits or start new good habits, this will help you crack the code. Now, I can't guarantee that everyone has the will-power to take the advice and apply it to their lives but the book spells out how habits are formed and changed with fantastic and relevant examples. It was a pleasure to read and very easy to follow and there is nothing to sell here. It's also not a gimmick book touting seminars or other needless junk.
B0053TMP24|5.0|READ THIS BOOK! But read the first one first!  Lol moments all over! Fantastic and epic awesomeness of awesome! Read read read!
1449415881|5.0|I bought this for my husband for Christmas and we love the laughs we get from Dilber and his co-workers each day!  My husband works in a similar environment and many times he has told me, &#34;That's just what I've experienced!&#34;  Lots of fun!
B0010V4TZU|5.0|A new discovery for me , I love the afro-pop beat and the clever lyrics. I play it loud and often.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|this game is seriously addictive!  I love it! I have played until my battery runs out and start first thing in the morning.
B0095XPZBC|4.0|I'll keep this one short since so many people have pointed out the main pros and cons of these discs.<br />Pros : These discs look way better than the DVDs did. I thought the DVD releases looked terrible. The upgraded HD special effects are wonderful and you never feel like you are wathing something newly created like the original series did (which I liked, but they gave you the original version too so that was nice). The extended version of MEASURE OF A MAN IS NICE.<br /><br />Cons : Yes it is true, the film transfers have some ..... I'll call them mistakes. I'm a film maker and I used to shoot 35mm and 16mm so I know what a good transfer should look like. While the images are nice and sharp someone seemed to think that you should be able to see detail in ALL  of the shadows and in some of the space scenes. There are a few scenes where the stars of space are on a more dark gray background instead of the blackness of space. On the ship the bridge shots often look too bright and grainly with the blacks of the uniforms have grain as if they were trying to make them lighter.<br /><br />In the text intro to Measure of a Man many of the remote control functions are blocked. I was not able to press pause during the text intro. I am a slow reader when text is on a television so it would have been nice to be able to stop it and take my time reading. To play it over I had to leave the episode and go to another and then come back to it because the Blu Ray was designed to remember my position in the episode. Just annoying. Plus you are forced to watch all the fbi warnings and such at the beginning of each disc.<br /><br />I didn't notice too much on the extended version of MEASURE OF A MAN but then I can't say I've seen that episode enough to know all the added scenes, but it claims to be 13 minutes longer which is cool.<br /><br />With all this said I'm very pleased to have purchased the set and think it is well worth the upgrade. I actually think this set has some scenes that look better than Season one, but perhaps that was the changes in film stock.<br />enjoyt look better than Season one, but perhaps that was the changes in film stock.<br />enjoy
B000VDDDVO|5.0|Still worth watching once a year.  Some parts may seem a bit cheesy and dated, but you will still cry at the end.
B005HSL626|5.0|The most fruitastic ninjas game ever seen by man or creature. I just love it so much. It really does a good job keeping the kids busy.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I have never played a doodle game before. This, without a doubt - has to be the coolest, cutest game that I have ever played!
0821221841|3.0|This book was not what I expected. Please be advised that this is a textbook that primarily focuses on such things as tripods, types of cameras, etc. Exposure chapter was useful. Everything else seems a little redundant. I'm assuming this was written for the absolute camera illiterate.
B00A0SLTCU|4.0|We really enjoyed this new version of Total Recall.  Loved the way the stay with the original story but different!  The visuals and the city, wow -- really would have loved to have seen this on the big screen.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|I love how easy it was to purchase and then view this product<br />More episodes than I thought were available
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Fantastic Movie. It isn't for people who have an issue with people speaking like they did during the slave era. I looked over it and enjoyed the movie. Everyone did a great job and left me feeling like I got my moneys worth. critics and movie goers finally agree on something.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|Freezes up sometimes, but ok. not as quick as my last samsung.<br />camera is very slow to take pictures. I hope they print as well as they look.
B006BDHAX0|1.0|I do not remember ordering this. I can not find it on my computer. Sorry. I can not review it. Thanks.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book was hard to read at first because of the style, but I soon became engulfed in the prisoner's life and his perception of things. Very wonderful book.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|Seriously?If i could give it zero stars i would...normally i think of a crappy movie with Mila as a good movie..even her 3 second naked slinky babe from the side view can't save this(but of course-now you'll watch-my apologies for giving away the obvious,,Want more?How bout nonstop shooting back and forth for two hours(Yawn)and absolutely every pop up zombie seen imaginable(you'll have more suspense petting your cat...The CG is suffocating..and just when you thought it couldn't get worse you get scenes that actually look like they came out of a Child's Coloring Book(i swear this on everything or anything you could swear something on...Truly i am shocked-to see so many good and great reviews of easily one of the Worst Movies Ever made,shlockey over the top everything in the worst way,,,didn't Paul Anderson have his name on this?What a shame....Watch any other movie a second time or a 2oth time...please do yourself a favor-Skip this...don't send money to the creators of this tragedy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004IWF64Q|5.0|Great picture quality.  Didn't have any trouble with online streaming.  Only wish the Disney films were free with Prime membership.  Only drawback was the fact that we had to rent it.  Price was similar to other online services.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|Although many Bourne enthusists swore they would never see this Bourne movie, since Jason Bourne (played by Matt Dammon) is not even in it, I found the movie to be action packed, non-stop, and keeping with the back story of Bourne, Treadstone, and CIA black ops in general.
B007FRHZ4A|4.0|We bought this on a flash sale, at $6.75. What a great deal! My 4 year old son loves playing with these sets. My husband went out and got him another set to combine with it.<br />Our other kids and my husband have spent hours playing this game. Its a hands on version of the game, and just like the app, its not as easy as it looks.
B005LAIISA|4.0|I would recommend the latest itteration of the Ice Age series for any family who enjoyed or loved the first three!
1401937519|5.0|Anita Moorjani gets to the heart of why we are here. Love, or God, is both the driving force of the Universe and the essence of all. Moorjani encourages each person to &#34;be yourself (which is love) fearlessly,&#34; thus fulfilling each person's unique raison d'etre.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Excellent story, drama, characters and setting. Highest-rated series. Can't wait for Season 3. This is written giving the importance of the lives of the servants the same interest as the upper class in such a pretensious society is remarkable writing.
B000001ESN|5.0|This has always been one of my fav rush albums. Lost my original copy had to replace it. Once again shipping was quick product was in great shape.
6305428387|5.0|I had this movie on VHS but wanted it on DVD.  The whole family love this funny, moving movie based on a true story.
B00008OWZC|4.0|Well,this is a really cool CD. sounds good and Sep sounds great live. I just wish there were more deep cuts live than always getting same old songs.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I've been a fan of this game for a very long time. Works great for me, never crashes. I do wish that you could pick your own layouts.
075669910X|5.0|Anyone interested in paleontology should purchase this book.  It has great photographs of fossils, and gives narratives on each subject matter.  Would highly recommend.  Gave it as a gift for Christamas and the recipient absolutely loved it.
0812993357|2.0|Though I have huge respect for Mrs Coddington's work for Vogue and I was anxious to read this book, I would not recommend reading it. It's not well written and lacks focus. Basically it's a running stream of anecdotes without giving a true insight to herself, her life decisions and career. After reading this book I still don't know anything about Mrs. Coddington. There's no introspection, something I expect to find in a memoir. I also blame the editor, some chapters are plain boring and should have been left out. On the upside, it has lots of lovely pictures and drawings which give you a feel for Grace's professional development throughout the years.<br /><br />All in all, not a good buy. It's a bad memoir for such a great woman and professional.
030758836X|5.0|This book encompasses me until I finished! I don't think I've bombed through a book in my life as quickly as I did with this book. I could not put it down until I finished.
1451695195|5.0|Purchased because I saw the author in a television interview.  Book is enlightening and well documented. I will be re-reading it over time.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|great product on my kindle. I can change documents and email them on the go. cannot beat the price Thanks kingsoft
B006LSZECO|4.0|If Your're one of those readers who can't handle a story that ends happily try another romance novel instead. This book really blew me away. The intensity of the characters in this story is captivating. The character developement was outstanding!! the main characters in this book are so raw, so vulnerable, and at times so unlikeable. It really gives a good picture of the nature of humans when threatened or in a compromising situation. The book starts with a mixture of diary entries and storyline. The characters are both sort of at their wits end in their marriage when suddenly the wife is kidnapped, and the evidence left behind is not looking good for the husband. The book is mainly written through the husband's perspective, which is interesting because you don't want it to be his fault, but at times you also kind of suspect him. Gone Girl Gone really is a head game in a lot of ways. I think I was at times thrilled with the plot and at times disappointed when I uncovered all the answers, but somehow I still managed to love it by the final page.
0061777269|2.0|This may be a little premature to write a review since I am about half way through the book. However, so far I find that the author's &#34;science&#34; doesn't seem like science but more like faith. The book has provided a lot of the different theories of Near Death Experiences, but they are rebutted with statements that seem based on the faith of the author.  I would have rather seen the book ask a series of questions and then provide scientific answers and let the reader interpret those answers into his/her own conclusion.I guess it does do that a little bit, but I still feel there is a lot of faithful sounding answers and not scientic answers in the book. As a spiritual person, I lean toward believing in an NDE (or at least WANT to), but this book has, so far, left me questioning more.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|very good game but I'm tired of the same old characters time after time. there r a lot of things to do though so that's the reason I'm giving it 5 stars :)
B004RF2KAC|5.0|I love Jennifer Hudson's music and when I saw this in your music library I just had to purchase and download it...:p)!!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book was an amazing collection of short story like interviews dealing with everything from civilian panic, military doctrine, and the attempt to maintain political stability. 10, would read again and again.
B00A72989U|5.0|Alisha Keys is one of my favorite singers and I love this cd especially the &#34;That's When I Knew&#34; track and the &#34;Brand New Me&#34; track... Love this cd...:p)!!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Awesome series of books this one does not fail to keep you wanting to read more.  Movies should have more in common with the books than just the Names of the characters.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|The delivery was fast, althought I live in Germany and it was Holiday season.<br /><br />The DVD itself is great, the first Teen Wolf season on three DVDs with lots of extras - gag real, shirtless szenes.

B00942S4OY|5.0|I purchased this for my granddaughter. She is in love with this group much like I was at this age with the Beatles. This is their best so far, says she.
B00A1EOBJQ|3.0|The music sounded so great on the show.  I was baffled by the selection on the CD.  Eg. The two little girls singing, ugh!
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|There is a lot of action, but just not as good overal than the previous ones, especially the first one.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. The story and characters drew me in so it was hard to put down. I can't wait to read the rest of the series.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Mahjong deluxe:<br />Very entertaining<br />it gives the player enough time to think the plays<br />it has a variety of settings to choose from<br />Recommended for mature people
B00785P2QC|4.0|Cool application for what it is just wish we could make the credits a bit faster lol but all in all a good application .... I also. Like that it goes on when you are not on the game.
0393088774|5.0|Extremely good discussion of how to fix the economy. Should be required reading for our congress. The CONservative philosophy has not helped the economy the last five to six years. Yet, they keep calling on it to fix our issues.
0143118757|5.0|Everyone in any field should read this book.  The main point is not to take a position or a side in negotiations.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|This CD was the reason I was able to get into the Christmas spirit this year! I am still listening to it, and will be even when it is 85 degrees. As always, Michael has produced another set of songs that will melt the hearts of women and soothe the savage man! :)
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't figure out how this would end...a sure fire way to keep me reading! I will read more from this author.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|great movie one of my personal favorites. blue ray enhances the experience the parts filmed in imax are incredible and the audio is fantastic. this is a must own blue ray and I give  it 5 0ut of 5 stars
B0043GAZYS|5.0|As great as I remember... oh the joy! Love it in Blu-ray, it's fantastic. Not like some other movies, like A-team, which sucked in Blu-ray.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|This book kept me reading. I couldn't put it down. There was so much suspense to find out what would happen next.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|I realy injoyed it! More than the Mars version of Total Recall!  Colin Farrell & cast showed me a storey that seened real!
B001F290E4|2.0|I wasn't as impressed as I hoped to be.  The most joyful songs sound depressing.  Too much styling, not enough feeling the lyrics.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|This was a great begining!  When is the next one due?  Where are the going & what will they find next?
B009Y6OIWC|3.0|I wish the calendar was such that I could go directly to the day and fill in my to do list without going back and forth so much from screen to screen.  Over all it is ok.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|It never worked on my KIndle HD so I dumped it like a bad habit.<br /><br />I get my weather from NOAA, instead.
0345803507|5.0|This book was amazing as everyone has since found out.  I cannot wait for the movie of this series to be released.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Even better than the first one! It really surprised me and I can't wait to read the next book in this series!
B005VPRET4|5.0|The kids really loved it and would recomended to anyone who likes legos, I would certainly buy this item again
B004I2K4E8|5.0|I have seen this opera live, and on PBS stations. This disc is the first Blu-ray disc I have bought. Great quality, no issues with the disc. My wife and I have watched this many times. We love the music and the story. Very glad we bought this, very glad the company of players were blessed with the great voices they have. The extra walk-ons by previous voices was a real treat. This is a very moving story that you must enjoy for yourself, you owe yourself this treat.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|No suprises, at least off slides.  Have 1000's of negatives that I will attempt when the 900+ slides are complete.  Unit is simple to operate and with a 4gb SD card, 2000+ pics can be created before needing to transfer to other media.  My goal is to move the digital media to a media server (Win 8) that was obtained for Christmas.<br /><br />Product is as described and works flawlessly.
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|Move kept me engaged, some of it was a spin off the original. Overall it was better than I thought
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|It leaves no blood stains, therefore nothing to clean up except the expended bullets and the mortally wounded victims oozing life.
B000YHG72E|4.0|Is it just me or is he the same in every movie? We enjoyed this movie quite a bit given the holiday.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Can't wait for the next one to be filmed.  This was so cool as a combination of all the individual movies.  Would like to see more individual movies, as well.
B0077ZNCE2|3.0|Lots of pale people and slow moving. A solid meh in the twilight saga. Probably won't bother with part 2.
B006C1DH92|5.0|Saw the fruit Ninja on the &#34;Today Show&#34;, my son just went nuts, had to hae the game.<br />searched Amazon, found this version of Fruit Ninja, gave it a try...$.99 cents why not.<br />great game cant put it down

B009JBWOU0|5.0|Great item and enjoyable collection. Son loved getting this collection for Christmas. This sucks to have to use 15 words.
B007C4ZJ0S|4.0|Steven Soderbergh delivers a tense and pretty intense very physical and gritty even amidst its elegance thriller.  Gina Carano was critiqued as being \\"strong, fast, relentless\\" and I'd have to agree.  She more than holds her own as Mallory Kane, a black ops badass who is about to get out of the business but is pulled in for that one last job.  After reading what I just wrote I can see how many people would groan, but you need not!  The story is packed with verve and visceral fights, showcasing an engaging Carano in one-on-one knockdowns as well as beating up multiple bogeys.  But it is the one-on-one fights that really shine as she goes against men that look the bigger and stronger.  It certainly doesn't hurt that Soderbergh pulled in a lot of stars (from the \\"it\\" man Channing Tatum to Obi Wan Kenobi himself, Ewan McGregor).  The story contains a few twists that are tidied up by story's end and it all ends satisfactorily for our heroine.<br /><br />This actioner plays by the rules for the most part and doesn't try to twist your brain inside out or make you think than it is more than it is.  I appreciate that especially when the film is exciting.  Two scenes that stand out in my mind still after watching it several months ago are the coffee shop ambush where Carano goes up against a brutish and heavy-handed Tatum and in the hotel where she and her partner, spies posing as a married couple, do a brutal and bashing dance to the death.  This was much more satisfying (and even felt believeable) than anything that, say, \\"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\\" ever threw at us.<br /><br />If you like action movies then check this one out.  You'll likely look forward to the next Carano stint.
B0058YPL66|5.0|One of my new favorite shows! Definitely worth the buy-won't be disappointed! If you love the classic fairytales, you'll love this beyond all measure! :)
B009P5S11G|3.0|Overall,Rihanna new album was an hit and miss. I do like a couple of songs,the rest is just there. One thing we can't deny about Rihanna is her consistency.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|If you enjoy Seth MacFarlane, then you will probably enjoy this movie.  If you don't... then you probably won't. Word.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Anyone who likes or liked the first season of Sherlock will love the secons season. If possible it's nothing but better than the first. A MUST SEE!!!!

B000002UTY|5.0|This is one of thee landmark recordings of American Rock n Roll.... it's so good that it really transcends the late sixties hippie context in which it was created... it's mind expanding yet rooted in the earthy bo diddley beat and songbook.... it's loose as a goose yet contains inspired guitar improv and singing... please remaster this, along with the 1st album, the three first albums by the steve miller band as well.... and for the weirdos.... throw in Mad River, already!!!! (ok.... nevermind... Culture Factory remastered the Quicksilver albums, Edsel has done a nice job on the first 5 Steve Miller Band albums, and Sundazed, bless them, has released the first Mad River on vinyl.... hoping a CD is forthcoming.... wheee.... just can't stop listening to my teen age trips!!)
B0086700CM|4.0|This is a very fun and adicting game.I have it on both my ipod touch and kindle fire.If you like this game try subway suffers.In fact I think I play that game more than temple run.Temple run is a good game but subway surfers is just as fun.
B005LAII12|5.0|A friend suggested I buy this movie as she thought it was hysterically funny!  Even though it was delayed in being released, it was well worth the wait.  Loved it and will watch it many more times!!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|The best of Croce I love face book and who wouldn't so get it like write now if you want to be connected
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book is a walking disaster I couldn't look away from and found myself loving.<br /><br />What can be said that hasn't already been said about this book? This is a book you are either going to love or hate. This couple is a walking disaster with \\"Needs Therapy\\" written on their foreheads, but I still became so completely absorbed into this story. Would I want to be in this relationship? HELL NO! Is this real life? I sure hope not. But I did love it still.  I can't even really explain why.<br /><br />Abby Abernathy is starting over by starting at a far-flung collage where no one knows her name. She just wants to be normal. \\"Normal\\" doesn't quite happen for her when she meets Eastern University's Big Man on Campus, Travis Maddox. He sleeps around, is tattooed, pays for college by participating in an underground fight club, and he's set his sights on Abby. They become unlikely friends with the entire campus speculating about them.<br /><br />Why did I love this story so much? I'm having a hard time coming up with an explanation. All the haters have very valid reasons WHY this book didn't work, and honestly I can completely understand and agree with their reasons. Yes, Abby and Travis are completely co-dependent; they can't seem to live or breathe without the other; Travis has anger and jealous issues; the College seemed more like High School than College.  But the story of their friendship, romance, trust, and growth just sucked me in.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|She was so excited and loves it.  She has watched it all in preparation for season 3 this weekend.  YEA!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Loved these 5 books in one so much that I wanted to rate it 25 stars, 5 for each book! My husband could not wait for me to be through with this series so he could start reading it because he said he had never seen me so \\"into\\" books before. There is nothing more I can add than has already been said many times. I can't encourage you enough to read these books. I gotta go now though because I have to start on another one of his books!
B00004Y6NX|5.0|Absolutely one of the most brilliant rock albums of the '70s-80's. Mark's supremely evocative finger-style electric playing quite literally burns up the fretboard with lyrical beauty. .BUY THIS ALBUM. This is one of those \\"Desert Island\\" must-owns. I bought it when it was first released and play it to this day. . .
B00A0SQBDM|1.0|It takes up entirely too much space. I tried to download what everyone is finding out is actually a demo and it's slowing down my kindle and it never finished downloading. So now I'm stuck with this game downloading and I cant stop the download ugh. Calling amazon support asap!
B002HWRYJE|1.0|Abrams' Star Trek is one of those rare movies that gets worse the longer you think about it. First, there's the thrill of all the blinking lights, lens flares, and 'splosions. Then there's the nostalgia of Spock Prime meeting his younger self. Then there's the sickening realization that everything you just saw was a beautifully wrapped pile of krapp. The lasting impression is of a roomful of film editors furiously splicing together outtakes from \\"ST:Wrath of Khan,\\" the god-awful \\"ST:Nemesis,\\" and the quite excellent Star Trek: Enterprise, and running them through a video effects processor. The result is a pointless revenge plot involving a bald-like-Shinzon, genetically-engineered-like-Khan, vaguely Romulan super-villain who possesses a doomsday weapon like the Xindi weapon crossed with the Genesis device and the theleron radiation gun. And in the place of our stalwart Federation heroes, we get \\"Star Trek Babies\\"(tm)... a widdle Captain Kirk who needs his nappy, a thumb-sucking baby Spock, Uhura Barbie, the Talking Scotty doll, and Junior Chekhov. Bleh.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am addicted to this great solitaire game. It is not explained that each time you ask for another deal of the cards, an ad will come up. You have to tap on the bottom of the screen to bring up a hidden menu that lets you skip the ad. Otherwise, it's similar to the Solitaire game that came with the Windows OS back in the 80's when it was included for people to practice using a mouse.
B006HL9G10|5.0|This is a great app. The free version has all the features you'd want - timer, bell tones, connectivity to others using this app. The best part about this app is the way the timer starts. You click start, and it gives you a few seconds to get settled before it  begins the count down. The bell tones are lovely....just like hitting a real bell.  Great app!  And super easy delivery through the Appstore.
0823023494|4.0|I thought this book was very insightful. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in animation drawing.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|I am a J. Depp fan, so ofc i liked this movie.<br />I would rate it as being kind of like<br />Death Becomes her
1423134206|5.0|I gave this book as a gift to my niece that is currently in her final year at MICA (an art school in Baltimore, MD). She loved it. Her career path is animation and who better to learn from than Walt Disney.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|good movie, i enjoyed it, something different.<br />all the characters did a good job.<br />I will watch it again soon
B001706I5I|5.0|A family classic.  We watch this one every year.  So much going on in it, I catch something new each time I watch it.
B002SQ364Q|5.0|Ang Lee at his best!<br /><br />A good picture of the sixties.<br />What more can I say except watch it, eh?
B000YHG72E|5.0|We watch this one each Christmas holiday.  The snowball battle scene is a classic.  A first-rate cast included along w/ Will Ferell.
B008OHV4PG|3.0|Avid Neil Young fans will probably like this better than me.  Footage of solo concerts has too many close ups andNeil really does not swing very well on this tour.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Well written, quick read.  The information about the flowers was new and enlightening.  Good Story - a little depressing but worth reading.
B001EN71DG|5.0|Just received this in the mail and was almost upset because I thought I was buying the original version.  The selling point was saying that remastered is on disk one and original was on disk 2, but there is no disk two.  After putting bonus disk in computer and letting it start on it's own only then did the original version pop up.  Had to go right to Greedo to check it out and was pleased.  I bought this to replace my 1992 VHS tapes that I know will crap out on me someday.  Very happy Star War Fan here.  Also for the people who want the remastered original version without all the added stuff, it will probably never happen since Lucas has sold out to Disney, so be happy with this, I am.

B006O6F932|4.0|5-star portability! Folds to a few inches but expands for a floor full of play space! Lots of little details and clever dual sided objects.  Tons of accessories and furniture.<br /><br />Certainly not for very small children and furniture could be slightly larger as it can be hard to sit some of the dolls.

B00574P9EQ|5.0|I bought this after my kids had read all the book series.  The story line is so &#34;everyday&#34; for my house, but it is hilarious to watch someone else living it.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Amazing! I rarely give 5 stars, but this film makes you want to smile.  Offers great singing, dancing, laughter and overall just a feel good movie.  Entertaining for any age. I loved it.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|Paid for it, clicked to download it,,,,nothing, nada. Won't buy anymore movies from here. Need six more words...can't use the ones I'd like
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Good read but don't like how she became weaker as the books progressed.  Just disappointing that she did not become stronger.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Nice big numbers and buttons. Extremely hard to tap the wrong number. Perfect for those with vision problems. Keeps track of your calculation right below your total in smaller and lighter numbers. It does have ads but they're at the very top and don't get in the way at all.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|This is pretty good there is a lot of action and the game is also good graphics and has a lot of action<br />Overall the game is good
0756405890|5.0|I warn you, you will be distraught almost to the point of being inconsolable when you end this book.  I don't know how to write a great book review, I do know a great book. I urge you to read this book. I have now read books 1 & 3 twice. That must speak volumes. I have never seen the point of book reviews that tell you what happen, you can find that out by reading the back cover! However, let me tell you a little of how I feel about Kvothe. I am emotionally invested in his life. I am angry with him, for him and at him. He has flaws but is relatable. You will be mortified to discover that this is a trilogy. I feel Kovthe deserves more. Now, stop reading this pointless review (which is essentially me gushing!) and read the book!
061301328X|4.0|I liked the hard cover, although I thought it would be bigger. However, the book was very interesting and I am looking forward to reading moreof Clavell's work.
B002RI9UBS|4.0|The propmo for the movie was the reason for me reading the book.  The story kept me intrigued for most of the book and i only fast forwarded a couple of times.  The ending was thought provoking as it left you wondering which story was the real one.  I wonder how well the book will transfer to film which appears to be rated as a family movie as portions of the story in the book are quite horrific.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|This game is so cute and so fun! And great for people who love dragons! Like me. But the downside is that you wait so long for things to load.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. Kept me entertained while stuck in bed with the flu. I recommend it to every person!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved it such a sad ending I hope Ana and Christian get back together I can't wait to read the next book!
B000NHG7BQ|4.0|This movie is pretty graphic on the subject of revenge.  However, it does show that going in or out of where you have<br />obligated your morals can have a high price.
B0044XV684|1.0|It was okay.  Didn't try to make any recipes . Don't have any other comments to make. Just was curious about the book.
B000641D2Y|5.0|This movie would have been just as good without some of the words and suggestions.  It's still an all time favorited when<br />the grandkids need a humorous pick me up.
B000W93CXQ|5.0|It was just a great deal of something to do<br />I would suggest this awesome book to my best friend
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|**SPOILER ALERT**<br /><br />I really wanted to like this book and appreciated that it was a fast-paced read for the most part.  However, I couldn't get passed the inconsistencies with Sky's age.  She thought her 18th birthday was in September 2012 so that would make her birth year 1994.  Then during her flashbacks and also what Holder revealed to her, she realizes her actual birthday is in May and she has another several months until she turns 18, so that would make her birth year 1995.  However, her flashbacks are mostly, if not all, dated May 1999 and speak of her 5th birthday, again making her birth year 1994.  Anybody else notice this?  Am I missing something here?<br /><br />I agree with other reviews about Six and Breckin fading into the background.  They were both great and it would have been nice to learn about them more.<br /><br />Sky and her crying.  Lordy.  She lets out a tear, saying that's the first time she's cried since she was 5... then suddenly ALL SHE'S DOING IS CRYING!  It got redundant after a while.<br /><br />Overall, it's a decent book but I'm not keeping it to read again.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|A thrilling and satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, although it certainly leaves one hungry for more of the adventures of Kalle Blomkvist and Pippi.
1416955070|5.0|This is a really good story.  My only complaint is that these are teenage New Yorkers, unsupervised.  There behaviors are a little uncharacteristic of such. Again I know it's YA, but I know good and well that teenagers use colorful language. Doesn't need to be raunchy just a little more realistic in how they speak and interact with each other.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is just about the best book I have ever read. The author not only describes the experience with incredible detail, but gives a glimpse within the life of a SEAL. A must read.
B00899F0G8|2.0|Episode was great but the title is misleading.  It said, \\"Entire 3rd season\\" which lead you to believe you were downloading it all.  If I knew it was just 1 episode, I wouldn't have purchased it.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|I was so impressed by Scott's journey and his holistic approach to health. I am a vegetarian and have wanted to make the switch to vegan for a while. His recipes convinced me that it can be a delicious and satisfying diet.
0394721772|5.0|My Mom LOVES Julia Childs so this book was a gift for my mom. She loves to sit and read and find new ways to cook old dishes. Definitely recommend!
B006LSZECO|4.0|What a twist of events. Like the individual chapter character perspectives and narratives. Worth reading and sharing. And why is my review required to have so many words - shorter is often better!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This was a really funny movie! I also really enjoyed all the singing. If you like Glee or groups like Pentatonix than definitely give this movie a shot!

B0025KVLUQ|2.0|First: the music is fantastic, this is not about the music, but I am greatly disappointed in the quality of the sound. With all the rave reviews, I thought they had really captured something great in this re-master.<br /><br />I am a Baby Boomer and grew up in the magical era of The Beatles. I have decided to try to find the best versions of the Beatles collection, preferably in digital format. The effort is really about finding superior versions to the ‘thin sounding’ Parlophone CD’s from the 80’s (it wasn’t their fault, they didn’t understand the depths of converting analog tapes to digital).<br /><br />So, I’ve tried to learn audiophile-ese, which involves things like spectral analysis, dynamic range, frequency analysis, EQ, limiting, loudness wars and on and on. I’ve tried converting my own original LP’s to digital, tried the Capitol CD's, tried the Ebbetts and Mirror Spock bootlegs, tried various pre-2009 re-masters (found that “re-master” really means “our latest interpretation of the original”) and, finally, the 2009 re-masters.<br /><br />After reading millions of opinions on the sound of the various versions, the test method came down to: “How the h**l does it sound in my car, then on my moderately priced headphones and then on my moderately priced audio system in my living room?” Plus, my friend (who claims to be an audio expert) helped me run a test on all of these versions on his more expensive audio system. I listened and listened and ranked and ranked. Fully recognizing that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, here is what I found:<br /><br />This 2009 re-master of Abbey Road is significantly better than the 80’s Parlophone version and, since it’s easy to buy and relatively cheap; buy it if you aren’t that picky. However, in the case of Abbey Road, my 1983 Toshiba Black Triangle (which is expensive now) blows away this 2009 re-master. Surprisingly, so did the digital conversion of one of my original LP’s (I havea relatively unplayed LP - bought duplicates for recording onto reel-to-reel, back then). Who knows, maybe the 2009 versions do sound better than any other versions on multi-million dollar audio systems, but not on mine or my friends'.<br /><br />My friend also has the entire 2009 box sets in stereo and mono. We put those to work and, in general, they sound muffled (like this 2009 Abbey Road re-master) as compared to my originals, the Capitol CD’s, the Ebbets bootleg and the Mirror Spock bootleg. In fact, for pre-Revolver, I think the Capitol CD’s are, by far, the best. Some of the 2009’s sound as good as the other options and I chose the 2009 stereo versions of Revolver, Sgt Pepper and most of the White album to use ...that’s it from the 2009 sets!<br /><br />Why is it that the Toshiba Black Triangle digital version of Abbey Road and the Capitol digital albums are so much better than these 2009 re-masters (assuming I have a relatively good ‘ear’)? Is it just the re-mastering preference of the 2009 re-master engineers or could these 40-year old master tapes be wearing out and this is the best they can do? My old reel-to-reel tapes sound pretty muffled after all these years (I know: their tapes are maintained a little better). Yes: I also know about the ‘Dexterizing’ of some of the Capitol songs but, guess what: that’s what we learned the Beatles were in America.<br /><br />I’m starting to think that; the closer you get to the 1960’s release versions, the more pristine the sound will be. My gut tells me that if they were to take original mint vinyl and re-master those, professionally (much like what Ebbetts and Mirror Spock have done), rather than the original master tapes, they would get a better sound and one that is closer to the original sound.<br /><br />Too bad this wonderful review will be lost, in a few weeks, because it’s the first group of reviews that get the high numbers.

The idea of drawing things on your own to get thru' the levels is very original and is done beautifully in this game.<br /><br />It all depends non how you overcome one environment by drawing stuff on screen using your fingers ([[ASIN:B004GCJEZU Stylus for Touchscreen is better]]) will determine which level you unlock next. Each level is filled with hidden secrets and achievements and the simplicity in the game is truly fantastic and deserves Kudos to the developers.<br /><br />There are no evasive permissions and the price is just right for a well crafted game. If you love puzzles and would like to play in an environment that you have your own drawings show up and interact with the surroundings this would be the perfect game for you that will provide hours of fun and replay value.<br /><br />Highly recommended! Full Five stars!<br /><br />Cheers!

B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Victor Hugo's magnum opus \\"Les Miserables\\" has enjoyed a long life, first as a novel published in 1862, more recently as a musical, and now finally as a movie based on the musical. Viewers be forewarned: if you like musicals, this movie is an excellent one; if you don't, it is a long movie with virtually every piece of dialogue done in song.<br /><br />The plot borrows from the novel. The French thief and convict Valjean (Hugh Jackman) is paroled after a long sentence. He has a life-changing experience after the kindness of a biship exposes him to the love of God. Valjean will skip his parole and attempt to build a new life of good works. In pursuit is the relentless police officer Javert (Russell Crowe), unshakeable in his sense of duty and in his conviction that Valjean can only ever be the thief he once was. The two men will confront each other repeatedly over the years, as Valjean rescues Crossette,the orphaned child of the unfortunate prostitute Fantine (Anne Hathaway), raises the child (Amanda Seyfried as the adult Crossette) as his own, and later rescues her fiance Marius (Eddie Redmayne) after he is wounded in a revolution in Paris. Along the way, Valjean will have also to suffer the mischief-making of the thief and con-man Thenardier and his wife (Sasha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter).<br /><br />The movie is incredibly well cast. Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway are outstanding, carrying long pieces of the narrative with good voice and acting. Russell Crowe adds depth and almost sympathy to the role of Javert, although he is the least accomplished singer in the cast. And who knew that Amanda Seyfriend was such a good singer?<br /><br />The production values are absolutely first rate. Many of the scenes are on location in England and France, and even the studio scenes are not necessarily obvious. The special effects are kept to a minimum, but they pack a punch. Perhaps the only obvious challenge was in delivering some of the expository songs in camera closeup, where the effect is different that it might be on stage. On the other hand, the closing scene would have been less effective any other way, and should rightly have the viewer in tears. \\"Les Miserables\\" the movie is very highly recommended.is different that it might be on stage.

B0041KKYEM|5.0|Amazing movie!  Highly recommended if you like ballet!  I always loved any ballet movies! Had to give it away due to moving though :(
B000006NUW|5.0|I was looking for some selections from my past and the music that I use to love. Today's music isn't bad but sometimes you want that &#34;sounds of the early 60's-70's&#34; and this fit the bill . I also use it to increase my speed on the treadmill ,so with this I get into the beat that I remember and kick up that old feeling of my youth. The quality of the era is there and the songs are a great variety ! I would recommend this to anyone who likes the sound of the Motown !
B00168OIOE|5.0|A nice all combo in one!!  Have been searching for something like this!  At reasonable price which it is good!  Love this movie - good for kids!
B009NOVCTM|5.0|This set is an excellent investment for anyone that Loves Mick Jagger and the boys aka The Stones ! All of the older stuff is here as well some new things that I can listen to as well. No matter how old they get , no one can give a &#34;vibe&#34; like Mick Jagger.....I would definetly recommend this set to anyone who loves The Stones.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|Very nice price for all combo in one!  I always loved this movie (I still do!!)  I used to say lines with my friends and she would response back with the next lines!  Good old times!
B0085KGHI6|5.0|No matter how old they get , they still have the sound and the vibe that only Mick Jagger can give ! I love the fact that all of the old songs are here as well as some new stuff that I like too. This is a &#34;decent set &#34; for the money and I'd definetly recommend it to anyone that loves &#34;The Stones !&#34;
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|Wasn't funny and beneath these actors to be in a movie like this. I would not recommend this movie if looking for good entertainment.
B008ASLNN2|4.0|Robert Downey Jr continues down the martial artist path from the first movie which I quite like.  The story is decent and the character involvement is worthy.
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|This is another example of excellent Scandinavian crime fiction. The story is full of twists, and is very gripping. Hard to put down. While better than some, the translation still leaves a little something to be desired. Aside from that, it is a great book that I would recommend to any crime ficiton fan.
B003MAQM6Q|5.0|If you have not seen fight club I wonder what is wrong with you!  You are not your khakis...figure it out.
B005CRQ2DK|4.0|it was a great book for all ages and i even laugh out loud when i read it. I keep on reading them and i get sucked into them
B00A6N7BS0|5.0|If you're a fan of Benicio you will dig his role in Savages.  Selma and the rest do not disappoint as well.
0761171703|5.0|The photos are inspiring and creative, and it's a good value. This is a great gift for dance instructors, and the background information for each photos is interesting.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|This had all three movies for less than one usually costs. The movies were quite good, and the case was nice. This was a good buy.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|It is a romance.  You need to enjoy that type of reading.  Overall was not so bad.  Would I read something else from this author?  Probably, if the synopsis seems interesting enough.  I usually don’t write review for that type of reading, I just klick on the like key.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|My husband was happily surprised to get this for Christmas.  We have watched it and didn't encournter any problems with it.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Enjoy the upbeat, classical themes throughout music. Love the movie themes (Bourne, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings.)<br />We started listening on You Tube and are hooked!<br />And my 17 year old daughter started cello lessons~~thanks Steve! :)
B002HWRYJE|5.0|My husband was happy to get this for Christmas.  We haven't watched it yet, but since it arrived in great condition, I don't expect any problems.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|Can't they make a decent movie like this without all the cursing??? Not much of a baseball fan, but interesting.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Everyone has been talking about this series so I decided to give to my husband as gift. Something we can watch together. It has met all our expectations. Love it!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is a beautifully written book! It is funny, smart and sad. I cannot believe the author did such a good job writing from the perspective of a young girl. Just brilliant!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Such a great book right up to the very end!!! I could hardly put it down but I'm a girl that needs some closure!
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|So this is a pretty cool time bender flick with a good cast of characters; we certainly enjoyed the show.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Was looking for something like notepad for my Kindle, found it, &#34;Evernote.&#34; I haven't used it a lot yet but it looks to be a great program that will  do what I want and more, thanks Evernote Corp.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|Terrible! They need to stop making Resident Evil movies as they keep getting worse with each and every movie. The action sequences are so far fetched.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Got it for my brother as a Christmas gift and he loves it! Any Potter fan would love this box set
075669812X|5.0|My son was thrilled to get this. We have been going through the story line learning Loy's of new things that we didn't get from the show. And it come with the coveted \\"Green Lloyd\\"!
B007JWKLMO|4.0|Not sure what to say as I purchased this for someone else.This had previously been viewed on TV, Just bought it so that he could watch it anytime he wanted.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Excellent movie and very funny ending.wHAT MORE COUD YOU ASK FOR? THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING ABOUT IT. YOU EAT MY S***!
B000A0GP4K|4.0|Have a collection of some great Dylan live performances. Didn't get to see him often in my life time,but when I did I was truly entertained.When I'm in the mood I can sit and watch my DVDs anytime.<br />I like the fact that I am able to purchase almost anything from Amazon.It arrives quickly and the prices are great.Don't have to go out hunting down something I want and not being able to find it. They may order it for you,but the cost is more. I purchase many gifts this way and make a lot of people happy. Wouldn't shop anywhere else.
B00973CGXK|5.0|Although different from other killers albums (as each album has a different flavor), I absolutely love this album like the others.  Initial songs that I didn't love have grown on me as I can't stop listening to the entire album! My favorites include battle born, MAB, Flesh and Bone and Here with me...a great album from beginning to end!
B009A87ZKG|4.0|Four stars for the movie... it's a classic with a bravura performance by George C. Scott in a role he was born to play!<br /><br />Four stars for the newer 4k film restoration... far and away superior to the first Blu-ray release (avoid at all costs!!) with most of the glorious grain and detail, that 1080p can deliver, intact!  Not a waxy face to be seen.<br /><br />And, unfortunately, two and a half stars for the audio restoration.  Many times the audio is clipped and distorted, especially when someone speaks loudly or there are big explosions. Some of it may have to do with the original master, some of it may have to do with not watching the levels carefully during the digital remastering process.  It's hard to say, but Lawrence of Arabia's new restoration, with audio tracks predating Patton by almost a decade, sounds many times superior.<br /><br />Since this will probably be the best release until 4k UHD media is made available, I say pick it up and support the older classics in HD!!  The studios need to know that catalog titles are still viable for release and in the finest condition possible.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was like nothing I have ever read before.  First you think one thing, then you think another.  So twisted, but really good.
B008Y1YK0I|4.0|As glorious as this restoration is, I cannot help but think how much better it would have looked and sounded if Sony hadn't crammed such a long movie on one disc.  If they had properly split it at the intermission, the compressionist could have jacked up the average video bitrate and included a full 24 bit lossless DTS-MA track.<br /><br />This classic originated on 65mm stock, was shot by the best DP in the business at the time, and though Blu-ray is only 1080p, you still need every available bit of data you can squeeze from the MPEG-4 compression codec to make a large format film (or any film, for that matter) look its best with a severely compressed codec like MPEG-4.  You cannot do this with an over three hour movie on a single 50 GB disc.
B00000K3CR|5.0|It was always one of my favorites.  I pondered buying this for years before I finally went for it.  No regrets.
B0098460O4|5.0|Have enjoyed this CD.<br />Very talented teens starting out on their own.<br />I wish them well, and thank them for the music.
B00004TS0E|5.0|So glad I finally bought this version of &#34;Miracle on 34th Street&#34;.  I had thought about it for years, could not find it in any stores, finally came to amazon...YAY!  I am a huge fan of the original and this version is a nice companion to it.
B0000844MV|5.0|Comparing with Destination Tokyo the US submarines are better equipped and had more space for the sailors. Is it true? The U-boat had to hang their ham and sausages in the cabin, even in the control center. German applied grease on the exterior of the torpedos. Does US have the same practice? Did U-boat have refrigerators? How do they keep the food fresh for 5~6 weeks in the ocean?<br /><br />At the beginning of the mission every officer have their hat on (I do not think it is real.). 40,000 people served on the U-boat and only 10,000 survived. The German Torpedo design were not that great and there are a lot of failures. It looks like it was a suicide mission. No wonder these sailors were so drunk before the mission.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Too much tongue in cheek... in fangs... fun.  I am so glad I decided to pick this up.  Highly recommended!
B002BSHWUU|1.0|This was a FIVE STAR REVIEW before I got the MONO box.<br />The MONO box discs are actually made in Japan and sound...OHHH SOOO GREAT!<br />I was already excited about the sound on this Stereo box, until I heard the MONO one.<br />One Stereo box for sale...cheap!<br />Acquavinyl here<br />Cheers!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I was looking for this game for ages so glad I found it! my cousin has this on his ipad and its really good on that.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|very fun game. easy navigation and zoom. not just your average hidden object game. interesting story line and great graphics.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I loved both seasons, they are really good. They aren't afraid of killing off star cast members in this series! It'll keep u on the edge of your seat, and I am not a sifi person!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I rented this movie and laughed the whole time. I'm not a fan of musicals, so I didn't want to give this movie a shot. I'm glad I did. It's not what I thought it would be. I watched it the day I rented it, then again the next day. It takes a lot for me to watch a movie twice, but this movie was worth it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Even though it's at it's early stages, everything has to start somehow! I couldn't get the PC version, my friend told me to get this, and it's worth every cent!!!! :)
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I can hardly tell there are advertisements and there are several versions of angry bird included. This free game is more than awesome for the price of free.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is great for all ages!! It is hilarious and realistic! Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
B005EHQGTS|5.0|I am pretty amazed at how well this works on my Kindle Fire 8.9.  The windows screen is small, and I would like that to be bigger but overall, I am pleasantly surprised at how well it works and how easy it was even though I have a LAN work computer.
B007THA4FI|5.0|J.K. Rowling proved through the Harry Potter series her ability to write fantasy, and now she has proven her versatility and talent as a writer of realism with the publication of The Casual Vacancy. The thread that runs through all her work and gives it universal appeal is her deep insight into human behaviour and her ability to weave it into compelling, compassionate stories.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was amazing and I  was crying when I thought peeta was dead. anyway I thought it was good, romantic and a good read and I hope you will think the same :-)
B008MEM24S|4.0|I like this game, it fun and it gets your mind going.You look at the picture and think this is a kids game, but believe<br />me they have some levels that require a lot of thinking.The only thing a don;t like is if you cannot get enough of<br />your PI birds you have to pay to get to the next level. This is where you put your mind to work and finish the levels<br />so you don't have to pay.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|fun game if you like building games like the Sims. only downfall is having to pay to get more gems.
B00785P2QC|5.0|If u like design and architecture this is your game! So much fun to see your city rise from the ashes
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game its the best and so addictive too. It is so much fun and its not like any of the games ive played
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A book that I couldn't put down. Amazing how much detail, making me feel like I was there. Love the heart warming moments. Great action that almost stopped my heart at times. This is a must read novel. May the odds be ever in your favor.
0345803493|5.0|This was one of those books that I could hardly put it down. It was a great book. I read it several times.
B001TKD4ZI|4.0|A little bit of a slow start to getting to the point but overall good.  A lot of different things going on in this book.  Definitely need another one.  My only problem is not enough closure for the couple at the end.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|it was easy to use. Very customer friendly and I am able to go from chapter to chapter and verse to verse very easy.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game so much. It is so much fun and addicting. If you want a free game this is definitely the one to get.
0345803507|5.0|This is a great book. I had a hard time putting it down. What canI say? I have read it more than once.
B005SO6TLM|4.0|I was introduced to this record by a former colleague of mine. This is classic soul from a wonderful talent. You can tell Charles Bradley sings from the heart and means every word he sings. What is delivered is a classic sound full of feeling. Credit is also due to the incredible backing band and producer that recreate the sound and vibe of some of the best albums of the 60's / 70's.
0345803485|5.0|Wnderful well written book. Some of the language was hard for me to read in the entire series but the storyline was great. I read it several times.
B004V5A7K8|5.0|Fun great game. Highly recommend it. Easy to figure out and is fun for adults and children alike. Worth the money
B005HV6Y84|5.0|What can I say? I really loved it. It was a very good movie. I enjoyed it a lot whole lot.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I enjoyed the character's banter.  The unique setting and situations were everything they should be.  Space, Aliens, War, Love, and Genetic Manipulation... What's not to love.
B000AM2L1O|3.0|Ok first of all it is a cute doll but nothing special when compared to a $15 dollar doll you can buy at Target. Yes, it smells like vanilla but your 1 or 2 year old won't care. Second of all, the package says 12 inch doll as did the product description on Amazon. It is not 12 inches (at least not by my ruler). It is about 10 inches. I was actually shocked to see the size the instant I opened the package but hoped my daughter would be more impressed. My daughter had 3 other hand me down dolls from sister and when I gave her the brand new doll for Christmas she was not impressed. As a matter of fact I only saw her pick it up once or twice only to throw it in the toy box to pick up her old dolls. So I'm a bit disappointed as you can imagine. I would honestly advise you to shop wisely and not spend thirty dollars on this doll when you can buy one equally cute for half the price. Toddlers don't care about vanilla scents or brands!<br /><br />Here's the part of the product description that states this doll is 12 inches(this is also on the box the doll come packaged in).<br /><br />What's in the Box<br /><br />One 12-inch Corolle Mon Premier Calin Charming Pastel Doll with pink one-piece pajamas and matching stocking cap.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I'm a stickler for quality, and on a budget.. so I did a lot of searching & reading reviews to come up with my decision to the Marware Vibe Standing Case for my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;. I can say I am very very pleased with my decision! The material is very nice quality & soft. Everything was made well, and my Kindle fire hd fit into it perfectly!, It stands very nicely, and with the coating on the inside it stays puts too. Very nice over all & the color is true to picture, the purple was very pretty.
1451695195|5.0|I am a Christian. Religion and spirituality is a personal belief. This is a book that I would recommend to almost anyone, including someone who is agnostic or atheist. With Dr Alexander being a physician/scientist his account is particularly compelling. This book came to me at a time when I really needed His spirit. I wish I could afford to buy 10 copies and give it out. Life changing book.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I realy like this game its fun to play and I have been very pleased with Amazon and will buy a lot more through them.
B0061S073A|5.0|Although, I have found that I must double check that the app is on before I let my children play I find this app to be one of the better ones.
B007N8RULO|5.0|i like this game to pass the time away it works good on my kindle fire i would recommen this game to any one who likes card games.
B004U8VWLE|4.0|My lady really wanted to watch this and i had no expectations of the movie.  This movie had its bloody parts (you may need a strong stomach for that) but over all it was a great movie.
B009CG3M1C|5.0|Battleship is awesome a great movie I really liked it.<br />if you like transformers you'll like Battleship<br />a must see
B0059XTTW8|1.0|I don't know why anyone thought they could improve on the excellent Alec Guiness version.<br /><br />The storytelling is terrible.  There is just too much backstory that they left out, or thought that people in this decade would not understand.<br /><br />The set design and costumes are terrible, too.  Everything is too modern, expensive looking, and slick.  The 1980s version accurately showed the drabness, the dumpiness of the British and the Russians.<br /><br />This was one of the worst remakes I have ever seen.
B0055OK2T0|5.0|Very creative plot, would watch it again in a heartbeat. If you liked the 1st matrix you would love this movie.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|Everyone told me this book was even better than Ender's Game (which I loved). Well, reality check folks, it isn't. It is a great book in its own right; but whereas I couldn't put Ender's Game down, I paced myself quite a bit more with Speaker for the Dead. The story is very good, but the ending is only decent. The reveal of the big mystery of the book was a bit of anti-climax and left me feeling a bit let down. I would definitely recommend purchasing this book if you are a fan of Card's work... just contain your expectations a bit better than I did.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I liked the premise and it was fun.  2.99 was not a bad price for the hours of fun. Would recommend it.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|This was a very nice movie to get me and my family in the  Christmas spirit we watched it  a day or two before Christmas and we loved the story line and the creativity
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I was so happy to see google on my Kindle Fire. I have used google search for years. So helpful
B000YHG72E|5.0|Got for daughter who likes the movie.  We got it to watch for coming years as a family.<br />Was a good price as well
B004GYY714|5.0|TuneIn Radio has every choice in stations you would ever want.  Makes the work day go by. Music and Talk Radio to News
B0083P1QUM|2.0|I was disappointed in this book and probably won`t read another by this author. The characters lacked development and the ending was weak. I did finish it but could have stopped at as any point and not felt that I`d missed anything.
B002WY65VU|5.0|I love this movie. It is so hilarious. Has to be one of the best zombie comedies I have ever seen.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|waste of time and money fuuny is one thing and that is not this movie at all only watched 15 min and removed it<br />worst one I have seen all year
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I love vampire diaries. I have the other two season's as well. The show is well written and entertaining. Me and my hubby loves it!!!
B004HO6I4M|4.0|This is a cute movie. It is not my favorite of all of the animated movies...I think the storyline could be stronger and the whole movie seems pretty short. I took my daughter to see this at the movie theater and at the end I felt as though we just watched a long cartoon.<br />However...the animation and vibrancy is BRILLIANT. Gorgeous animation. It also sends a good message.<br /><br />We received this as a Christmas gift this year and the kids have already watched it numerous times.<br />Kid tested Mother approved? Yes.
B003YWUTKM|3.0|Good album, not what I expected. I was hoping to hear more Floyd music to ambient sounds...It is great for background, mellow music though!
B0002HWJY6|3.0|This is a very cute toy.<br /><br />It is pretty small and the roof comes out to put the smurfs in. I think it's used more for looks in play and less for actually putting the smurf inside...as there is really only room enough for the smurf and no room to move your character around.<br /><br />Otherwise, Great quality. We will have this toy for generations to enjoy.
B004BBV88M|4.0|This isn't one of my favorites of the Harry Potter series, but I like Gary Oldman.  There are a couple twists that make this one worth your watching.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Although the passion of these two is remarkable, even more gripping is the love they share and their shared maturation process. This book is written in a manner that puts the reader in the room - completely captivated.
B001CB8NQE|5.0|Terrific space opera, great CGI, good plot, lots of action, terrific villains, food for thought.  Also has lots of humor.
B00899F0G8|5.0|Love love love!!! I can't wait for the rest to come out, i'm always glued to the tv when I'm watching this series..
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I am reading the series again since the movie will finally be made. I love it the same now as the first time.
B008NW67IQ|5.0|My daughter who is 19 saw them in concert recently. The crowd was much older but she said it was a great concert. They do swear allot so if that is not your thing don't go see them. I highly recommend any CD they put out.
B001JNNDGA|5.0|The greatest story ever told. This particular version is realistic, very bloody, and violent. I do not recommend this for kids. You may NOT want your kids to view this version; the older versions are more suitable for kids, like (King of Kings or Jesus of Nazareth-1977). The cinematography, sets, period wardrobe, acting, and sound are all stunning. The only problem is that this movie is not filmed in English, you will have to select English subtitle. This movie is done in the true language or close to the true language of the time. That’s a major Negative in this movie and Mel Gibson should have known better than that! Otherwise this is a great movie, recommended on Blue Ray only of course!  Please don’t  be put off by the fact that you will have to read English subtitles as this movie is filmed in a way that you almost don’t need to read anything, as you will understand what’s  going on especially if you already know the greatest story ever told about our lord Jesus Christ. Thanks
B008C1O8CA|5.0|I purchased this, TRE!, and DOS!. All great Cd's and worth the price. Buy used if you can. There is no reason to pay full price. I did it this way and saved money.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|I would highly recommend this action film for anyone who enjoys the genre, Liam Neeson is very convincing as a former government agent.
B008G59IKO|5.0|I recommend you buy this CD. There was not much publicity for this or the other 2 CDs because the lead singer went back into rehab right when they were released. I say good for you and keep rockin on.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|They can't get enough of this game! They play it most of all their games on their Kindle. No glitches that I can tell. Definitely worth the download.
B008G59IBI|5.0|Highly recommend this and the 2 other CD's. Yes there are 3. Good music. Can't wait for them to come back out in Concert.
B003JA5NVE|5.0|Who doesn't love Gilmore Girls??!! I was glad Amazon offered it so I could rent it and view it since I missed it's original airing.
B008NABUU8|5.0|Easy controls, good difficulty, and fun to play! This game runs great on the GS3. I highly recommend it! Stupid word count requirement... I got my point across in seven words.
B004FP1WX0|4.0|I love reality movies and shows and I really liked this. You never know what things are real and what are not, but I liked this doumentary.
B0091REZMW|4.0|love this search game! cant wait to get home from work and play! sometimes the energy can run out too fast but other than that no complaints!
B004JN1CW4|5.0|This series was by far the best I've read! There better be three movies following these books, or I'm going to be depressed! Good job James Dashner!!!!
B0093FNZT6|4.0|I enjoyed reading the book but the write-up promises more than it delivers.<br /><br />Dr Alexander tells us that he was telepathically given information about how every thing works, heaven etc.<br />I kept reading looking for some revelation but there wasn't any.<br /><br />It kept my interest all the way through and his personal story was interesting too.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|An easy read which appears to be factual. Gives insite into the life of Navy Seals from first person perspective.
0385667833|2.0|I didn't do too much reading from this book, even though it was assigned to us for class. It's probably not a book I would choose to read in my spare time.
0452289963|4.0|bougtht the movies for myself , very good quality, i have watch them more than once, bought the games<br />for my five year old and he loves them , i would highly recomend these products from this site to all my friends and<br />family
B0053O89WY|5.0|Excellent price .  We very much enjoy this show and  look forward to  the last season on DVD.  Funny sitcom
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Simply, a must see. This is such a classic love story that everyone will love no matter what age. GET IT
B0038P59A0|2.0|The movie was a convoluted mess. Rachel McAdams was awful, and the story was weak. Don't waste your time and money.
B002RVCD0U|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I saw it in theaters and had to own it. I've been a fan of &#34;terminator&#34; since I was very young. A lot of people were disappointed with this installment, but I definitely was not. Everyone in the movie did their roles justice.
B00846TTDG|5.0|Great movie!!  I was a little hestiate at the acting skills of the seals when I first started the movie, but they ended up doing a great job!!  This movie is awesome! What incredible and crazy lives Seals have.  Seals are bad a**!!  thank you for all that you do!!!
B007TK77QE|2.0|i did not enjoy this book ,it did not hold my attention i taught it drag on a bit would not recommend.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|This review is solely on the movie not the release of the Blu Ray.<br /><br />I'm going to be bold and say this about this Antebellum Opus. This is Tarantino's Best movie and finest movie. Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown following close. From the writing, to the photography, to the actors, to the story, and the music, Tarantino did not disappoint. He is the best American Director out there who doesn't follow Hollywood guidelines and churn out drivel every year. The man can write as one can see from his early Screenplay of True Romance and bubble gum chewing dialogue in Pulp Fiction. Some would say he got too indulgent, too wordy, too long of monologues, such as in Kill Bill Vol. 2, Death Proof, and Inglorious Basterds. The man knows how to write tense scenes that make you hold your breath, chew your nails then have it burst with visceral violence. The running time of this movie, clocks in at 2 hours and 45 minutes, it goes by at a fine pace. Unlike the tad draggy Inglorious Basterds. We all know his movies are homages to what he loves of certain movies and actors. I feel his direction has become tighter and his collaboration with DOP Robert Richardson shows what he wants in a scene. Sadly his long time editor and collaborator Sally Menke passed and was a great editor and knew how to piece a scene together. All Tarantino fans might notice the different cuts of this film where it did feel a little choppy and some of the subtleness she brought that was inherent in all of her other work on Tarantino movies was not there. Then there is the music, Tarantino knows how to match scenes with music. This movie has a vast array of Spaghetti Western instrumental to 1960s songs to modern day rap. Another director that comes to mind that does this well is Wes Anderson (Second best director working that doesn't make a movie for the sake of making it)  One of my favorite scenes in DU is the one where Jamie Foxx is pleading with Big John not to whip his wife and then a cut of them running away, the color pallet is grainy and an almost washed out feel. Because it's a flash back scene. How he cut this scene with the music, it's heart breaking. A beautiful scene indeed. He gets 100% out of his actors, it's great seeing Di Caprio as Calvin Candie, playing a despicable human being, pushes the role to a level where it doesn't reach absurdity or over the top, he does indeed steal the movie. Same goes with Samuel L. Jackson playing his loyal house slave Stephen who has more power than one would think,and Christoph Waltz as the German mentor/ bounty hunter who as the only white man treats Django as an equal and does not consider him lower than he. And Kerry Washington as Broomhilda, Django's wife, she is so beautiful, I could not believe how Angelic she looked in one scene. I was in awe. After a second viewing-- I mean come on every Tarantino film deserves a second viewing in the theater--- Jamie Foxx did a very fine job with his character/ role. So nuanced, low key in the beginning, then he ramps it up in the second half. Foxx was the right actor for this role. I have heard Tarantino had a 3 hour cut and had to be trimmed, do hope for the DVD we get these scenes. I hear it goes more in character development with Django and Broomhilda, and scenes with Stephen  & Candie . Some will say the violence is very gratuitous even for Tarantino. Could it be a dig at critics when they said Inglorious Basterds didn't have enough action? A self wink to Quentin who maybe thought well ok they want action I'll give them lots of bullets and buckets of blood. In my opinion, this is an homage to Spaghetti Westerns. They did have outrageous shootouts. This does too. Tarantino delivered everything I hoped for. That is why I am saying this is his best film to date.ing away, the color pallet is grainy and an almost washed out feel. Because it's a flash back scene.

B00AMBH70S|3.0|Kind of just a repeat of scenes from the first 3.  Seemed like the plot could have had more depth.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I love this game!! One of the best free apps in a long time. So much fun. I just wish that it would have multiple accounts so my daughter and husband could play their own games instead of mine.

B0000CAXIC|5.0|Wow. It's great. I would seriously recommend it even if you don't like the Foo Fighters, because after listening to this album, I'll guarantee that you will! I didn't need to skip a single song while listening to it, I'm not kidding, it's that good!
B002RI9PKO|5.0|Like his other books Malcolm Gladwell provides great thought provoking stuff! I have enjoyed the Tipping Point and Blink and this was just as good.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a good ending to a very spellbinding, unusual story. It kept me glued to the book till the very end.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I had a different view of animals and what they need. It was a compelling read! I read it because of the movie and I have heard it ran true to the movie.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I  truly couldn't wait to dive into this after the The Hunger Games and I wasn't disappointed. I honestly know more adults that read this then the young adults.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|awesome show and great acting. the best combination of creepy and scary. i became instant fan of the show. Jessica Lange is amazing.
B004TI5N38|4.0|As usual Baldaci writing style is quick-paced and an interesting plot. John Puller is a new hero to me, but definitely an interesting one. I recommend taking the time to read Zero Day.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|The Art of Racing in the Rain is a moving, insightful, and well written from start to finish. I recommend this book
B00756GKBA|5.0|Great album for those who love Madonna!  Came with extra songs.  Get it now if you love Madonna and don't have it.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Offers a challenge but is not so hard that playing becomes frustrating.  Forces you to reason through the consequences of your actions so you can ultimately achieve the desired result.  Quite an enjoyable game.  As both a teacher and as a parent I highly recommend it.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|I got this for my son for Christmas and he loves his music and he was so happy when he oppened this up that it made me so happy that I got it for him.
B00A757EFW|3.0|Good to hear the sound again of Pac-Man but game play is sketchy at best due to obvious control limitations.
B000JMKO0A|4.0|This book was selected by my book club. I don't know if I would've selected it on my own. Although sometimes it didn't keep my attention...it only seemed to be &#34;slow&#34; for a page or so before picking back up. Most of the slow passages seemed to be in the diary entries. In general the plot was interesting. There were a few moments where it seemed a bit contrived. The writing is good and the main characters are well developed. It also reads quickly.  A bit racy in spots, you should expect that based on the synopsis though!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is only the second book to captivate and consume me like it did. Highly, highly recommended. I'm speechless right now, but I need to tell everyone I know about this book.
B000641D2Y|5.0|I really enjoy this movie, as much as the first.  I had to show it to my son and he thinks it's hilarious!
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Simply a great, short book on the creation of really anything meaningful and all the demons you face throughout that process. I highly recommend it!
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This is a movie from my childhood that I love now just as much.  Reminds me of simpler times and less worries.  I introduced this movie to my son and he really likes it.  Especially Chunk!
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|why do they offer such stupid apps do they test it out before they give it to companies to put it on there appstore if they tested out the game then they would know its easier just to open the browser then to go through this challenge.
B000067FP8|5.0|This movie is a classic for me.  I loved it as a kid and had the joy of introducing it to my son.  He loves it, too.
B009A9BEHU|5.0|Love it. Such a good concert. I wish I could have seen it live but this the next best thing.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is my go-to movie when I want to get the Christmas cheer started.<br />It's funny and great to watch again and again.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|I was stuck to the screen the entire time. Very cool effects. I would recommend this movie to anyone. Worth the 3bucks !
B000KJT8IG|5.0|This video works great and the quality is wonderful!  We love this movie and have watched it several times already!
B007XF0X6G|5.0|This movie exceeded my expectations.  It has the best 3D I've seen so far.  There were several instances when I had involuntary movements because I thought I was going to be struck by objects coming at me.  It is a good adventure and fun to watch.
B00785P2QC|5.0|A fun app to play and hours of fun! My wife has already yelled at me numerous times to put it down.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|It was a Christmas gift for my niece. So nice and affordable, win/win for us. Perfect gift, she loves it!
B000002KOO|5.0|I bought this on vinyl decades ago and even though I gave up all my vinyl in the late 1990's, I always remembered this as being one of my favorites.  It has withstood the test of time and I am discovering more great songs as I usually only listened to a few choice tunes when I played the record.
B003O86FMW|5.0|But kept me on edge shocked to the gills horrified. Gotta finish this Trilogy and get bragging rights to feel complete.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Like most people I adore most of the Pixar movies and this was my first purchase in their collection.  Most pleased with the film and have already watched it several times.  Always delivers!  First rate script, excellent editing, top notch animation, and the voices are spot on.  A keeper for all ages.
1451627297|5.0|I had broken up with Stephen King years ago.  In the beginning - all those years ago - I read every book he wrote, but along the way he became too gruesome for my taste.  However, the hypothesis of this book was very intriguing and I couldn't resist.  At 800+ pages, it was too long to borrow from the library, so I bought it and took my time reading it.  It was well worth the investment in time and money.  I was a young woman in Fort Worth, Texas in 1963.  This “novel” was full of interesting bits of actual history and told of many events surrounding the assassination that I never heard reported by news media.  A good read – entertaining as well in informative.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|It is a classic! I love this dvd,excellent condition,fast delivery and no commercials to ruin a wonderful christmas classic but best of all,,Chevy Chase,He is a class act by himself,,Love this movie!!!!!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|A well written account of one of the most anticipated military operations of the modern age.  Even though this book had to be written without divulging operational tactics or classified equipment, it still evokes suspense as the author takes you  through his thoughts and experiences.
0345522478|3.0|Kevin Hearne's Iron Druid Chronicles (of which Hounded is the first book) follows in the vein of other popular books that imagine the characters of mythology as real and living in our present society.  Unlike the Percy Jackson series, though, this is not a series for younger readers.<br /><br />Atticus O'Sullivan is the last living druid, living his life in Arizona, minding his own business, and trying to stay off the radar.  Unfortunately, he has made several powerful enemies during the course of his long life.  Hounded is the story of how one of them, Aenghus Og, looks to get revenge and take back the magic sword Fragarach.  The story is filled with supernatural creatures, most notably Celtic myths, vampires, and werewolves.  Atticus is quick-witted, and his sidekick, an Irish wolfhound named Oberon, provides a great running repartee.<br /><br />The story flows very quickly, with little down time.  There are many pop culture references thrown in, and a lot of humor.  Atticus also is very worldly, making time with some goddesses, getting drunk, and getting in touch with his inner-druid.<br /><br />Altogether, I found this novel okay.  I liked the humor but could do without some of the extracurricular activities.<br /><br />I was provided a copy of this book by Netgalley and the publisher in exchange for an honest review.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I love this movie. I can watch it over and over again! Where can you go wrong with all the superheros!!!
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Could not put it down.Great story that held your interest! The story goes between the past and the present and eally pulls you into it!
B00APUQMD4|3.0|I have all the Resident Evils and have played all 6 games. This movie had its up and downs but it wasn't as good as I expected it to be.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great free read! Read it in one day because it kept me in suspense! Would recommend to anyone who likes great love stories
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This delightful game is fun and challenging, not to mention cute. I can't wait for more levels. Everyone should give it a try.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Enjoyed reading this book from beginning to end. Story kept you<br />guessing who the mother was. Surprise ending, Hard to cheat<br />and read end of book on a kindle.
B0017TYPIG|5.0|I love this movie. The cast is second to none and the story line is so reminicent of the days of past when the law really worked. The blu-ray version is more pronounced as far as sharpness to the picture and the sound clarity is perfect.
B001KDQ4KQ|1.0|I  would have given zero stars if that was an option.i am thoroughly disturbed and will officially never read another of her books. DISGUSTED.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I downloaded Subway Surfers for my 5-year old grandson on the Kindle Fire (2nd Generation) his father and mother gave me for Christmas and I love the game because he is able to use it easily.  He loved the game and played on it until I had to recharge my Kindle--which meant around 2.5 hours.  He didn't want to give up my Kindle!  It's fun to play and watch him play!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|This is an easy read that leaves you with a good feeling. Things can turn out good when  everything  seems impossible.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have read all three books in this series, each one more than once. Would like too see another book in the series.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|It was a good movie to watch again.  It had been a while since we watched it.  Good action movie.
B001NSAJ3G|5.0|I've had the LP for years, but I seldom get around to playing my old favorites on my turntable. I saw this on sale, and I knew I had to have it on my iPod. This way I'll play it more often, and enjoy what I think is their best album.
1451695195|2.0|The author is a practicing medical doctor, who contracted e-coli meningitis, which is said to be very rare for adults in the U. S.  As a result of the illness, he was comatose for a few days.  “Proof of Heaven” is a detailed account of the period while he was hospitalized.<br />Did the author describe a journey to heaven or a dream induced by severe illness and effects of various medications on the human brain?  There is no doubt the author was extremely ill and not expected to survive.  While the existence of heaven is not embraced by all, some will find this writing indisputable proof that heaven exists.  Skeptics will view it as the fevered ramblings of a very ill and heavily sedated individual at death’s door.<br />After publication the book was highly publicized. It is disappointing because it is essentially a medical case history of the author’s illness and descriptions of family and relationships.  The vision of heaven is mentioned and described only twice—once early in the book and at the end.  The medical aspects outweigh the proof of heaven.<br />It has a bibliography on the subject of near-death experiences. It is speculative, though, how the bibliography in any way either elaborates or authenticates the author’s experience.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wonderful writing style. I can see why they made it into a movie. I truly enjoyed reading this book, and I am looking forward to continuing the series.
B007SGM084|5.0|Have read this book THREE times and have not tired of it. I've never read any book more than once.
B007FEFLTO|1.0|Ordinarily, I would have trouble staying away from Follett, however, this series just leaves so much to be desired. Not even on the same planet as Pillars of the Earth series.  Disappointing to say the least.
0061124265|3.0|I really, really enjoyed the Alchemist and figured I might enjoy some of his other works as well.  It really was just okay.  Worth the read if you can borrow it??  Not that it is terribly expensive just not what I was looking for.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Page turner and very creative on the author's part.  Super book and a great movie (I saw the movie after I read the book).
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|This is a great and original show! Although it is a sitcom, it also has some drama. Involves great acting and improvisations, and very intelligent scripts. It will surely impact the sitcom Modern Family, which is steadily failing and falling after the first season. The DVDs have some interesting extras, but not as much as Seinfeld’s. Totally recommend New Girl’s first season for 30-40 years audience.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|It took too long in the &#34;build up&#34; to the confrontation with the Panther.  My attention got sidetracked a bit.
B000002GB6|3.0|While it is very similar to the original album, it is missing the performances with Esther Staterfield (e.g. Lulabye for Nancy Carol).  Disappointing.
0763655465|5.0|A great second picture book by Mr. Haughton. Little Owl Lost is also a good one.<br /><br />Illustrations are well done and story is short and cute. Keeps child's interest as well as humors the adult. Win win.
B001B67VR2|5.0|She is bomb diggity and getting better! I wish I could actually see her and get a huge hug!! Yes!
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Was quite good. Would gladly recommend it for most people.<br />Nothing more to add to this and I feel silly.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is an essential app. runs so smooth both in basic and advanced math functions. I love how clear it is on my kindle fire screen.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|I bought this item in the end of Oct. 2012.  No longer works.  I thought a Kindle product would be worth the extra price but it's not.  Only a partial refund is offered.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|5 stars I love this novel it was amazing and the story engaged me in everyway It is a hott, sexy!!
B003B02O7I|5.0|One of my favorite books.  I have read this story many times and it always feels like the first time.  Action and adventure and courtroom drama.  What more could you ask.
B00846REIS|5.0|5 stars all the way, I am a fanatic of this novel as well as many others like 50 shades and the author Eden bradley is amazing, This book had amazing scenes and story just took the right turns at the right time its was sexy, hott and intriguing
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|I don't think much of this book.  Don't waste your time on it, short as it was.  Too many other great books to read that have interest and substance.  Wasn't even funny.
B005R7DAWG|5.0|Always a good read, no matter what language its in.  Even better when you can get it for free on Kindle.
B003L77GRO|5.0|I know Dexter is done now, I will miss this show.  True to form Dexter gets the bad guys and frankly we have a lot to get.  If they escape the police, well Dexter you have work to do.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game is my down time game, my relax, my way to escape for just a little. Not to hard, not to easy, just right. Keep up the good work.
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|true to form, I love it.  Now the pressure is on Criminal Minds since Dexter is done, There are are plenty of bad guys to catch. From prior seasons I still cannot watch the one where they chopped the girls and fed them to the pigs as that happened 15 miles from my home,
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I've been ever seen like this game. I really this game. I believe , everyone likes this game. Try it! Also easy game.
B009H442DG|5.0|The CD starts off with \\"Baby it's cold outside\\" and their banter is so much fun and with the guest singers makes this Christmas album a must have for anyones Christmas collection.<br />The proceeds of this CD goes to charity, so buy a delightful CD and help the Olivia Newton-John Cancer and wellness Centre and the Jett travolta foundation in the process.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The notifications do not work on the app. This makes it hard to do other things while waiting for someone to respond to a message.
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|Such a different and cute love story. I love a romance and found this movie in top 100 lists. Was thinking there was no way I would like this movie but loved it.
B005V20JKI|5.0|Took 3 attempts at installing on Kindle fire HE before it actually worked; but none the less addicting! Well worth the 99&cent;. I'd place this game among other great ones like Angry Birds, Temple Run, Toca Hair Salon, etc.<br />Definately recommended.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|This book wad obviously written for a younger age group, bug was still able to keep me reading it. It was very enjoyable though.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I choose a five star rating because I liked how  Rowley got Abigail instead of Gregory and that Rowley was the wingman and he still got the girl.
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|My son loves this game.  His favorite out of all his apps  even the ones we paid for and this was free!
B0091REZMW|2.0|energy use for each explore that you only get to play two rooms a time.  boring! Cost Is too high for the fun.
0694004162|2.0|The book arrived without the doll. I returned it for a full refund. It was a Christmas gift so I had to shop elsewhere.
B00ARAO0WM|3.0|Premium Rush was enjoyable as a rental movie, but I'm glad I didn't pay to see it in a theatre. It fit well on my flat screen and I don't believe I would have gained much from a larger venue. And certainly the extra costs would have lessened my enjoyment. Fun, but inconsequential entertainment.
B0049VZ222|5.0|I started watching this show at the beginning of Season 3.  I was excited to be able to catch up!
1451695195|5.0|This book by Dr. Eben Alexander seems to be a work of love given as his witness to his supernatural experience, or near-death experience (NDE) . Not only is it very descriptive of the afterlife, it is a very strong validation of it because of his neuro-medical expertise. This book should be read by all believers and non-believers alike, especially those who have a fear of death.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I started watching this show at the beginning of Season 3.  I was excited to be able to catch up!
B009CPJHY4|4.0|I selected the movie for the actors and was not disappointed. Of course, I am in somewhat the same age bracket so the storyline was more realistic to me than action movies.  Humor, love, realism about the end of the life decisions we all make, and all in India.  Delightful.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I was a little let down when I read the book because there had been such hype surrounding it. But it was a good read and well written. It did remind me of an updated version of &#34;the story of &#34;O&#34;&#34;.
B0044XRIMW|5.0|What's not to love?  One of my favorite movies.  Julie Andrews at her best.  A movie for the whole family.
B009JBZH54|5.0|The Batman set is unbelievable !! Its beautiful outside and more inside :) I recommend this item to any Batman fan, best 3 films of Superheros
B004J64QSI|5.0|You will never be sorry you bought this DVD..The music is fantastic, the story is wonderful with plenty of happy and sad parts as the story unfolds. You will be hearing the songs in your head for days after watching this great musical.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|Great pace.  Terrific twists and turns.  If you like American crime stories, then this is one of the better ones.
0761163808|5.0|Wonderful gift for my 10 year old grandson! I try to give him books instead of electronic games. He loved it!
B009VLXMJA|5.0|i love every song in the album! I don't own any of her previous cd's but this one was definitely worth the purchase!
B004HYDM0A|5.0|This was fascinating and perfect for my teens to see so they are stay aware of the creepers on the internet without their &#34;parents&#34; trying to scare them all the time. We now watch the TV series. I would love to see all the people Nev contacts that don't want to be met. That would be pretty funny.
1451695195|5.0|Second best NDE story I've read. Since it is written by a medical professional, that gives it so much more credence.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|My nephew LOVED this. But he finished it in one day. It was very small, much smaller than it looks in the pictures. The pieces are tiny so be aware of that.
3832755934|5.0|The pictures are of great quality. The paper is thick, so it will survive the 365 days. And the spaces are ok for writing. Plus, it come sin many languages.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This movie has become a classic! One of our favorites to watch at Christmas. The whole family will love it.
0345803507|5.0|Wonderful book!!! The author really did a great job with making you want to read all 3 books.  I loved all these books.
B0086700CM|5.0|Per 11 and 9 yr old girls - This game is awesome!  Cool, fun  game.  You have to run from these monkeys, collect things and you can keep playing even after you die because you just keep starting over
0345803493|5.0|E.L. James should make a movie from these books!  The entire trilogy should be turned into a movies and I would be first in line.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Protects my Kindle Fire while in my purse or just laying around.  The stand is a simple,  folding flap but it works well with a gentle touch.  Doesn't add too much to the weight.
B0096PYUE2|1.0|It just sits there and looks like R2D2 and I just don't use it.  Love to remove if I could.
B00540G3G6|5.0|They got the remastering right for this title!  The picture quality is impressive with no complaints here!  It is nice to have the combo pack to use in different players in different situations.  This is a classic Halloween movie that has been a tradition in my family and it have only gotten better with Blu-ray!  Highly recommended!
B002VQ7PVS|5.0|This was a very well written mystery/suspense.  I liked going back and forth between the mother's history and what was happening in the daughter's life.  Kept my attention the whole way.
B009JBZH54|5.0|The BluRry technology and Dolby sound is nothing short of amazing!  The screenwriting and production of the movies is exceptional!  If you are Batman enthusiast, it doesn't get any better than this!
1608871517|5.0|When I first ordered this book- I was thinking it was going to be a big picture book with labels of the peices of clothing. It turned out to be much better and longer.This book contains many great insights about Michael's interesting fashion sense. Shows many conversations Michael had with MichaeL Bush about how he wants the style to be with the clothing. The book turned out to be much bigger and bolder than I expected. It contained many amazing and bold photos. Had great imformation about his creativity and style. It was great to learn Michael's favorite peice of clothing was. I have always woundered this. The book is very cool and I would highly recommend this product
0553108034|5.0|This is the second book in the series and my son was pleased with this gift! I placed the order late and was thrilled it arrived before Christmas!
B007GEMQ2I|5.0|Got this in addition to pet shop grand emporium and fire brigrade. Glad i got it. They r gonna b worth something later on. Biggest tallest. Love the height and detail on all floors. All floors have a theme, love the elavator
B009WO7NQO|2.0|LOTS OF HYPE, VERY LITTLE SUBSTANCE. BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH ANGRY BIRDS STAR WARS BLAH!!!!
B0047SF41G|3.0|My boyfriend is a collector of all things Alien & Predator; books, comics, sculptures, films, you name it, so I got him this missing piece of his collection for Christmas. Unfortunately all the special features and collector's editions are now only on bluray. In spite of this being nothing but the bare bones I am assuming it is good quality in both sound and picture, as he would have told me otherwise, lol. The case did seem a little flimsy.
B0013ND30M|5.0|I bought this dvd for my daughter to replace her old one which we ran into the ground. It arrived quickly with plenty of time to be wrapped up and put under the tree.
B002KECK1G|5.0|This is a timeless, almost prophetic piece, and out of all the versions out there this is the best in my opinion. I love it, Two thumbs up for this masterpiece. Don't forget to read the book by George Orwell!
B000AGTPUK|4.0|I had never seen this movie before, but I programed the song \\"Believe\\" for our winter concert (I am a band director). I thought it was a cute movie for the kids, although they didn't like it very much.
071815780X|5.0|Highly instructive and easy to follow with lots of short cuts for preparing good meals fast, would be happy to recommend.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|I love pinball and this game is very realistic. So much fun! If you like pinball this game is for you!
B0026P3G12|4.0|Love Susan Boyle's voice. I have all her CD's and don't think this is her best CD, but that's ok with me!I make regular long trips in the car and I love to hear her sing - and I can sing along with her too!
B00005JKDR|5.0|It was so well liked by my 9 year old grandson that we have purchased more movies of Monsters Inc.
B0024FA9IM|4.0|Great movie, i like the special efffects. I used to watch the show when i was a kid, thier chose of actors was right on.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Rod Stewart never disappoints.  I played it twice as soon as I opened it.<br />Good standard Christmas songs, a carol or two and a couple of surprises.
B003QSOE0U|5.0|Really captures the history of the time.<br />Very realistic as the Battle Ship Missouri appeared to have been used as a substitute for the USS Arizona.
6302794331|5.0|The story is told as true to the Dickens version as a Muppet can tell.<br />Gonzo and Rizzo the rat are great entertainment.<br />The spirit of Christmas Present is unrivaled.  He is the best ever.<br />it is easy to join right in the spirit of the movie.<br />I have given this to each of my grown children and it is also their family favorite for holiday viewing.
B008KW43TE|5.0|This album is priceless poetic music.  Frank Orange is more than just a musician he is a poetic who has managed to master the art of music and words.  If you don't believe me just wait until Grammy night when he walks away with several honors for this masterpiece.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|This is a cute little girl that grows into a headstrong woman.  I like more feminine heroines but this is good.<br />It has a witch. It has humor, And a terrible spell that helps the girl realize the importance of family.  I liked that.<br />Graphics are super and are the reason I got it in the first place.<br />I've never seen so much red hair.<br />I believe there was an effort to be true to the norse culture, or as true as it was understood.
0395389496|5.0|I bought 3 of these for my children. They are very nice books. I am very pleased with this purchase.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|put on your elf hats and elf pajamas and get out the chips and soda pop.<br />This is funnier than I thought it could be.  The premise is kind of &#34;out there&#34;<br />It softens your heart and makes you laugh at the same time and before you know it, you believe.<br />I recommend it to everyone that likes to laugh.
B00139XSBA|5.0|Excellent book. I don't live in the states but it goes a long way to describe the hysteria that must have existed around the time that this took place.
0060919760|5.0|That is the message I get from all of this author's books.  He is an enabler.  He helps us draw strength from many sources and direct that strength and knowledge to our best use.<br />I have many of his videos and books.  I read and re read them because the information makes sense.  The information in them is true and therefore very valuable.<br /><br />If you are unhappy with your current self, this book can help you see with new eyes
B006PAO2FS|5.0|I have long since been a huge Diana Krall fan, as well as Sir Paul of course! I enjoyed this album very much and applaud all the musicians involved in this project and their efforts. This is 180gram vinyl pressing will be one of my favorites for quite some time!
B00005JNS0|4.0|I ordered Cars 2 and got this movie instead.  It hasn't been viewed. It will be returned.<br />That's all to say about it
B00A3ATW4M|5.0|Especially love Darren Criss new song, Dark Side. Prefer the old Glee gang to the new one but basically bought it for Michelle Lea and Darren Criss.
1449410243|5.0|A gift for my girlgriend and she loves it :D this comic and stories are great, if you're a fan is a must buy
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I purchased this gift for a Christmas gift after hearing them on Youtube,  They are very talented and a gifted.
B003TH14H4|5.0|This show is very engaging and entertaining.  These were episodes I hadn't seen.  I caught the previous show and was left in suspense so I had to see part two.
B000002MUN|5.0|I would recommend this CD to anyone that enjoys music from T.P.  In my opinion there is not a bad song on the entire disc.  Tom and the Heart Breakers laid down some great tracks.  I would rank this up there with Damn the Torpedoes as the best music from this talented artist and band.
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|I still like the original but thought that a grittier rendition would be interesting with refreshed technology.  Unfortunately it is a movie about running pointlessly.  Phillip K dick is rolling over in his grave.  A real shame
B0039TD7PY|5.0|I gave this to my Mom as a gift. She loved it. Carole king and James Taylor sound great together. I would recommend this C.D. and DVD to you.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  Maintained the mystery and interest throughout every page. I could not put it down...and the ending was...Wow!!!!!!
B000A2UBN4|5.0|I gave this to my father for a fathers day gift. He loves those dark sailing movies. He is a sailor himself. He loved it. I would recommend this movie to you.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|This soundtrack is great! It love some of the songs that they mixed together in the movie. It has been fun to listen to all of the songs over and over since the singers have such great voices!
B000VSBX34|5.0|I gave this movie to my Mrother for a gift. She said it was great. She loved it. I would recommend this movie to you. She has Beatle Mania
B000P6XU56|3.0|This DVD is for HD player only. I did not read as far into it as I should have. Will resale as used, but I never viewed the DVD.<br />My fault only.  Ordered another one that I could view on my DVD player. I imagine that this DVD would be a lot better in HD than standard.
B00004WG2F|5.0|This is a great movie. I gave it to my Mom as a gift and she loves it and thinks Brad Pitt looks mighty fine in this movie. When I ordered it I also got to watch it on my computer as an extra treat. I love it. I would recommend this movie to you.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|It was somewhat entertaining. Very predictable. Followed the typical pattern for the other Batman movies. I don't know if the other ones were better, but I enjoyed them more.
B0000542D2|5.0|I gave this movie to my Mrother for a gift. She said it was great. She loved it. I would recommend this movie to you.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am new to the workout scene - approaching 40 and I &#34;just haven't had time&#34; for all these years. It's an excuse a lot of people use, but it really is true. I truly do not know where I would find the extra time in a day or even in a week to change clothes, drive to a gym, do a workout, drive home, etc.  A co-worker mentioned that she just gets up a little earlier and works out at home and I had an epiphany. Why couldn't I do that?<br /><br />So, for the last 3 months, I've been getting up 45 min-1 hour earlier and working out. I started with some DVDs I got at the local big box store - dance/aerobics/zumba type DVDs that were fun, but I found myself skipping some of the routines because they were just too long.<br /><br />I did a search on Amazon and Jillian's videos popped up immediately. When I heard 20 minutes, I was eager to try it. I'm SO glad I did. The 30 Day Shred is not easy, but it's not so difficult that a beginner can't do it. The first time around I tried to progress to level 2 a little too quickly and ended up hurting my knee. I took a break over Thanksgiving, did some research about form, and started over. I often follow the beginner/modified assistant, but I am still seeing results and I feel great the whole day long.<br /><br />I really like the structure of this workout. I also have some of the Biggest Loser DVDs, but they seem kind of loose and disorganized compared to 30 Day Shred. It's nice to see the Biggest Loser contestants doing the workouts and struggling (like me!) but I really like the professionals on Jillian's video so I know the right way to do the moves.<br /><br />I have finished the 30 Day Shred (lost 7 pounds in 30 days!) and I've moved on to Ripped in 30, which is very similar. I was nervous about Ripped in 30 because I loved the 30 DS so much, but so far I like it a lot, too. If you are pressed for time (or even if you aren't) but you want to tone up and feel good, Jillian's videos are definitely the way to go.
B002ZG98C8|5.0|I gave this movie to my Brother for a gift. He said it was great. He loved it. I would recommend this movie to you.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Oh, Ms. Adele how we love thee! Bought this for my mom for Christmas (her request). She loves it, as do I. I'm burning a copy for myself...*gasp* did I say that??
B00122S688|5.0|My boyfriend introduced me to this song. I downloaded it. I liked it. I would recommend this song to you.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|One of the best Teacher novels I have read in months. Keep um coming.<br /><br />Thank u very much. Looking forward.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|Fifty fantastic years of writing and performing great music. I love it so much, it makes me feel great. This is a great window into their long career.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|Music is subjective so with that being said I think this was a wonderful CD. First time I have heard this artist as it was requested and given as a gift. I was gifted back in being able to listen to it as well,
1419705849|5.0|Ordered two for two very different youngsters and both thrilled to have the most recent edition. Arrived on time. Great price.
B0073XV2W2|5.0|Once again Daniel knocks it out of the park.  This near science fiction takes today's events and technology and moves it forward in a compelling way.  Well Done.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|This product came as expected.  It was very easy to set up and also very easy to use.  I can hear the caller and it appears that they can hear me too.  Glad to have it.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Don't buy this book!  It is awful.  I rarely put a book down and don't finish it.  I really tried to fine a reason to finish it and it just got worse.  Don't waste your money.
B005IZNM0W|5.0|My nephew loved the gift and it was given to him on Christmas eve, he was very excited - the gift was worth the wait.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|My husband and I saw it at the movie and bought it to share with our grandchildren.  Enjoy Enjoy Enjoy!
B005WUHAX8|2.0|This Lifeproof case is different than the authentic cases we have - it has some micro dots on the screen cover and bubbles so it's not flat against the screen - It's a pretty good counterfeit but definitely not the genuine article.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|Such an AWESOME Show. I am very glad that they created this show and I keep recommended it to everyone.
B0063IH60K|5.0|works well... I've tried almost every game of this type this one just works... Downloaded it more then once.. Just want the update to work...
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|Such an AWESOME Show. I am very glad that they created this show and I keep recommended it to everyone.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Just when you think you know your heart.  The book was funny and heart felt great combination. Connor thought he had it all figured out. LOL
B005OLF6BI|3.0|The footage of the concert was okay and the sound was not so great.  Too elaborate of a stage set-up.  Would have preferred just simply singing her music.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|A well told story with good imagery. Well worth the read, though it can drag on a bit when it's following a character you don't like.
0385344333|4.0|I really like Lee Child and most of the Jack Reacher stories however, this one seemed to me to miss the mark. I liked the story, somewhat, but really not his best Reacher novel.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I'm the facebook app I'm pretty terrible but I'm all you got.  lol<br /><br />bllaaa blablanjdjkdjdjddkdkjdjdjdjdjdjdjdj d d d d dd d d d d
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Boring & not a good movie. We got really sick of swearing. Not much entertainment. Very disappointed. Not worth the purchase.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I wanted to find the definition of trafficking cuz I've been hearing that word all day. It had what I needed.
B0053Q9DHW|4.0|Item was rec'd within around 7 days.  Some wear on the outside and a small hair like scratches are on the DVD, but it works great!!!  Thanks to all involved in getting me this well proced item to me so quickly - it has already been enjoyed!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I've of the best games u have ever had the pleasure of playing before now!!!! Everyone should try this game it at least once
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i think that this is the best ever!!!well matter of fact I would say,&quot; i know this is the best game in the world!!!!&quot;like if you agree!!!
0307887448|5.0|This book was one of the most fun to read.  A lot of great characters and obscure '80s references.  I recommend it to anyone who loves video games and pop culture
B0052REUW0|5.0|This is a fantastic book, well written and researched, and narrated fantastically. I have listened to about 2/3s of the book thus far and feel not only enlightened but entertained. I highly recommend that you pick up this audible book.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I like all of John Grisham's novels.  He goes into depth with all his characters.  It's fun reading.<br />As I read his novels, no two are the same.  He seems to have a lot of knowlege about a lot of different subjects.
B003L5LEYW|5.0|Learn something and teach something by buying this album. A perfect mix for the Afrocentric or conscious mind. Great Lyrics
B0091THDOM|4.0|Pretty tight fit but it works. The inside of the pouch doesn't seem to be as soft as I had hoped.
B001RIY4WE|4.0|Good quality for a remastered movie and very good audio but it takes a while to load the disc as it always try to connect to the Internet to &#34;activate&#34; some content (not worthy). That feature cannot be disabled and would it take about three minutes to let you &#34;cancel&#34; the connection to Skynet (of course).
B009KHBDUU|3.0|This was a cute movie. We rented it because it was a vampire movie and Johnny Depp was starring in it. We giggled and laughed it was worth the rent.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I really like this app. It is right on for the weather in our area. Like being able to get 10 day forcast, hourly & 36 hour as well as the right now information. Lets you know about severe conditions, also.
B00ARAN9JW|3.0|This one is not as great as the previous Resident Evil movies...I think it's time they stop making them or do MUCH better next time. Was not exciting at all like the others.
072325804X|5.0|I had wanted to find a story book for my daughter that had as many of the B. Potter tales as possible.  This book is wonderful and of course you can't have the Potter tales without the illustrations, and these are gorgeous.  I'm so happy with this book and I absolutely recommend it to fellow Beatrix Potter lovers.
B009R5GR1K|1.0|Several words that I have entered have very weird definitions, such as the word h e l o t .it was changed to jelly! And I paid $3-99 for this version.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Its free and at the very least,  encourages introspection and provides guidance in the MOST contemporary fashion! I have the app on my laptop,  tablet,  and phone and use them all! Best investment ever!
072325804X|5.0|When my mother-in-law was at my house about a year ago. She was reading the little Beatrix Potter books to my toddler. She mentioned how much she liked them.  The collection of all the seperate books was way out of my budget.  This book was great...When she opened it for Christmas - SHE CRIED!!!  She loved it so much...and that I remembered :)
B004CFBMRY|5.0|OMCH (Oh My Cowboy Hat)<br /><br />Isn't it insane that a book can capture, inspire and piss you off at the same time.<br /><br />Life changing...literally
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Quite simply amazing! another knock out hit!!! You will not be disappointed!!! Hope she follows up with another one!!!! \\"HOPEFUL\\"
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|I really wanted to like this movie but it fell short in my opinion.  While some may find the language and other material offensive, it's on par with other movies in the similar category.  Really the only funny parts are the parts that contain offensive material to sensitive viewers (so they would not find these parts funny like myself).<br /><br />Anyways, I'd pass on this one if you can help it.  I wish I had.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game makes use of the touch screen and challenges the player to swipe the screen in order to slice falling fruit while avoiding bombs.  The gameplay is fast-paced and arcade-like.  The slicing motion makes it more physical than a game like Angry Birds or Bejeweled.  It's a nice break from activities like reading or watching videos.
0375507256|5.0|I'm a fairly well educated man who takes pride in my vocabulary, not that I'm perfect..... With that said, I have recruited my dictionary throughout this whole book. It's a bit daunting because I'm  so busy with work that I only have time to read for a half hour at a time where as my typical 4 hours at a clip. But even if it takes me a year, I will unravel this complex plot structure. Highly recommended!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book sparked my interest from page one to the end. I am not someone who reads much but I never wanted to put this book down. I want to watch the movie now to see if it follows the book. One of my favorite reads ever.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love the convience of buyingon amazon & watching Our cable provider does not offer this channel. We LOVE this show. Will definately continue buying them from Amazon!!
B008MEM24S|5.0|get started on this game and you will loose time. is a challenge between my kids and I who can get all the knomes first.
B007EECSFA|5.0|The Secret Keeper is the first book I've read by Kate Morton and I'm hooked!  I love her ability to transport you back in time to  make you feel as though you're in the midst of the plot.  She is truly a talented author and I look forward to reading more from her collection.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|love it!! so addictive...my kids love watching me play too...they love trying to do it themselves and they r 3 and 4...
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Kate Morton has the ability to transport you back in time, and make you feel as though you are a participant in her story.  I felt as though I was being pulled through the maze with the characters themselves.  I couldn't put the book down until the last page, and truly a wonderful experience.
1450400957|5.0|i need this book to study for an upcoming certification exam and it has already been so helpful. i can't wait to buy other bookts from this author.
0679805273|5.0|I love this book! Each of my children has a copy of this book and each year, I get their teachers to sign the book and write a note to them somewhere inside the book. I started in preschool and will get a teacher each year to sign it and then I will present the book to them at high school graduation. It's a keepsake that will be irreplaceable...
B004UID2LC|1.0|Doesn't work. Need to get a YouTube app that works Have deleted from carousel would likes an app that works
0439813786|5.0|This book is just awesome. I cannot say enough great things about it. It's fresh, inventive, and entertaining. We enjoyed it so much we went to see the movie, which we loved as well.
B0086700CM|1.0|You do not want to get it even though it's free  after a while the game won't work if your looking for a fun game get ninja chicken it does not have that dumb stuff like farting and killing.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Absolutely love this app! Its very addicting, I highly recommend if youre someone who likes a bit of a challenge. One of the best free apps out there!
0738727326|5.0|I love this deck!<br /><br />It has a great and convenient size, good quality and the artwork is just amazing! The art work has so many details and painted with such beautiful and uplifting colors.<br /><br />This deck has quickly become my favorite,
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|This wasn't a bad movie, however I do think it lacked a bit of storyline. It had a good ending and maybe some lessons can be learned from this movie as well.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|IVE READ ALL OF THESE BOOKS AND I JUST ABOUT CRIED WHEN IT ENDED PLEASE RICK RIORDAN HURRY UP!!!!!!!!! PLEASE!!!!
B00846TTDG|4.0|Acting was poor, it sounded scripted. However, the concept of the movie and battle scenes made up for it. Its a must see, but you must look past the acting ability of the actors.
B001T6PXFG|5.0|great actors/acting, an amazing and inspiring story, well done. Very much true to the historical facts. This movie is highly recommended.
B009329Y30|5.0|This was a great movie. While the movie was sad it had a  great ending and I would recommend this to anyone that likes romance movies.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Very well written. Plot keeps you alert and on your feet. Can't wait to see if the film adaption does the novel justice!
0811879542|5.0|I was so glad to find this book.  A teacher friend of mine told me how her 5-7 year olds had loved it, so I bought it for my grandkids, and I made sure I read it to them before I left their house.  It was really fun to see their reactions as they thought they had changed the dots.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this game.  It is very addicting.  My kids think I'm crazy.  I'm 65 yrs young and love this game.
B0034G4ORC|4.0|I bought this for my daughter who had requested it.  She was happy to get it and has watched it already.  Now she and her Dad have to find time to watch it together.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it and eagerly anticipated the next installment! I never saw the movies - and, frankly, was not terribly interested at the time - so I had no clue what was upcoming
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I purchased this book months ago but didnt have the time to read it until a couple of days ago and I must say I loved it! Once I started reading it I couldnt put it down and immediately started Catching Fire. In my personal opinion I enjoyed the book more than the movie.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|AGAIN, loved it!<br /><br />Only 4 stars instead of 5 because I thought the ending was a little bit abrupt; however, this may be only because I WANTED MORE!
B009SQRL4U|5.0|I thought this movie was well done and should be a classic for families along with other Christmas classics.  The storyline creates a believable Santa, to include how he is able to deliver gifts on that special day.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Loved the idea of a living teddy bear with an attitude but the one-note character grew tiresome way too quickly.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This is the original and best PDF file reader available.  Simple to use and quick to load.  Usable by most users.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|It's Game of Thrones. Come on. We all know it's awesome and worth the money. Utmost quality and special features included that make it worth your time and money.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is a unique and challenging puzzler which will keep you interested for hours. The variety in difficulty guarantees you to find something to enjoy<br />Definitely worth checking out!
B0057EYACI|5.0|Jim Croce is my favorite songwriter of all time. This collection includes his 3 popular studio albums and a great collection of stuff on and off his lesser-known releases prior to becoming famous. Every song is a hit in my book and the value is so high and costs so little; every fan should jump on this if they don't have an album or two.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Do not purchase unless you are willing to keep purchasing items to keep playing this game.  Offer is deceiving, this game is not free in the long run.
B00999CZKG|5.0|I was expecting something great considering it's a new release and they wouldn't release something awful but this is some top-notch stuff! The vocals are actually more bearable than I expected and the playing is superior to anything before.<br /><br />I'm glad I bought this set over getting each separately. Quality case, printing, and the booklet is awesome. The 2nd DVD features are a cool addition as well. Really great stuff and well worth the price. They play all the hits and really do an amazing job. They can still shred.<br /><br />If you're a fan and collector, buy this. No hesitation. It's amazing.
B004D9FLJE|5.0|Priced right. Exactly what I was looking for!! Arrived just in time for Christmas. Lots of funny episodes to watch
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|It was the one my son in law wanted for Christmas.  At a great price, I couldn't find it anywhere.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Excelente producto, casi nuevo solo le falto el plástico , estoy muy satisfecho con el producto, lo volvería a comprar.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|I'm not much on the type of comment that critics come up with.  I'll simply say that I enjoyed the movie throughout and never felt bored or that it was overlong.  I'll definitely watch this movie a number of times.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Excelente producto , muy satisfecho con el producto, el precio , la calidad, la autenticidad  todo estuvo como fue descripción.
B001P06GX4|5.0|I got this for my almost 5 year old daughter for Christmas.  She loves it!<br /><br />While she isn't as good as the adults, she quickly caught on to how you play the game and works hard to try to block people.<br /><br />Love that the rules are so short and simple.
B0048KXRR6|5.0|This was so cute, just like the first Nanny McPhee!  It is a great movie for kids (and adults, too)!
B0055PMJMW|4.0|I enjoy reading Harry Bosch stories.  Connelly is a great writer who keeps u guessing amny times as to what or who has committed the crime or who is guilty and why.  Of course I like is longer books, but these were free and well written.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love the hunger game series and I have always been a fan. I couldn't stop reading! It is definitely one of the best books I have ever read. I can't wait to read the next book!!!!
B000NYT1M6|4.0|Grandson loves it. Little lite of weigh than what I thought it would be but has stood up to my grandson hard playing.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Very superb. Interesting and suspenseful.  The touching story of a dog who cannot be held by men. So, he turns to the wild to seek vengeance against men who killed his master. Jack London's greatest story ever.
B005PK57NU|4.0|Season 3 delivers on drama, suspense, and awesome court cases. Loved the story line and where the characters are taken.
B008476HBM|5.0|It's important to remember that Pride and Prejudice takes place during the later reign of George the Third at the beginning of the 19th century. The period was one of war and revolution that severely threatened upper class privileges. Conscription at home and reports of endless damger can never be comfortable news from across the channel and on the seas of the world. There was also the threat of invasion that Napoleon planned but was ultimately unable to execute. Yet war is never mentioned in the novel. There are soldiers, officers only of course, but their sole military duties are flirtation and to supply dance partners.<br /><br />The true conflict, in fact the only conflict of the Bennet family, is the struggle to marry off the eligible daughters before their father dies. Primogeniture is the evil djinn of the plot and Mrs. Bennet and the daughters are never unaware of the perils of their situation. They live one heart beat away from being thrown out of their estate by the male heir, their cousin Mr. Collins. Their only options are marriage or a life of dependency on a relative's charity. The girls are untrained. They can never earn their livings and the only skills they possess are those required of a wife, a companion, and a homemaker. Here I am thinking of Jane and Elizabeth. The youngest, Lydia, runs away with a scoundrel officer and almost brings the family to ruin. The other two daughters, Mary and Kitty, are mere bookends of little note, useful perhaps to illustrate the unlimited production of Bennet daughters, and to highlight the misfortune of never having produced a son.<br /><br />Every unattached man the family encounters is defined by fortune. Darcy has an income of £10,000. and Bingley £5,000. Once these two are corralled, the fate of the rest of the family is secure and the novel ends with satisfaction. The great peril is that these two wealthy bachelors will not be induced to perform their assigned tasks, finding and wedding two suitable wives from an otherwise often embarrassing Bennet family. Among the great delights of this novel are the nuances of character displayed and the modulations of the central personages as fortune and misfortune threaten and abate.<br /><br />Loss of place and social ostracism run behind every line of text and the wonder of Jane Austen's novel is that the threat of material want is ever present and yet is rarely noted. In polite company such matters are never discussed, but they are implicit in every second of existence. The stress is desperate and the courage of the characters immense. Since it is never expressed, it is possible to imagine it lies hidden in their minds but never given place in speech.<br /><br />Dialectical materialism can understand and find clarity in the situation of the Bennet family. A rereading of Das Kapital might be a useful sequel to this great novel.m an otherwise often embarrassing Bennet family.

Blinking stars to clue you where you can move keep the game moving, although at times I would like to turn that feature off. limited time for each level keep it a challenge.  Very good!
B005VT42BS|5.0|I manage both my home network and the network in my small office.  There are times I need to find the IP addresses of all of the devices on my network.  For example:<br /><br />- Periodically, my router loses its mind and remaps the IP addresses of the computers, printers, and other devices on my network.  When users try to print, Windows can't find the printers because their IP addresses have changed.<br /><br />- When installing new printers, sometimes the Windows print installer can't locate the printer, so I need to tell it the IP address of the printer.<br /><br />There are various ways to find all of the devices on your network, and their IP addresses, but none I've found is easier than Fing.  I have this utility on my iPhone, my iPad, and my Kindle Fire.  In a matter of seconds, it scans the network and shows me the vital stats (IP address, MAC address, etc.) of every device.  It's much more convenient than hunting for the addresses of devices.  This is a really convenient utility -- one I use surprisingly often even for my tiny little home and small office networks.  Great functionality, and amazing functionality for a free app.
B004HD61KE|5.0|I enjoy the author's ability to mix scientific fact into his thrillers.  I also enjoy the explanations and reference sources so I can read other authors on the science he mixes into his books
0811869261|5.0|I bought this for myself, but my three-year-old immediately usurped it.  It is full of cultural references, so there is a lot for a child to learn, but at the same time the tiny subplots (help find someone's lost shoe, look to see who stole the missing sweets, find the children hiding from their father, etc.) make it fun and humorous for kids.  I haven't let my child use the stickers yet, since I was intending this for myself, but they are beautiful too.  The pages are thick and glossy and the book is big, which makes it even better for laying out on the floor and looking through for long periods of time.  Great find.
0399256385|5.0|I prefer this over Good Night Moon, but we read them both a lot. A great bedtime ritual for the very young.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Some parts were rather slow, but I'm getting used to that from Nolan.  As a more than fair-weather Batman fan, the plot twists were fairly predictable, but nicely done, none-the-less.  I'd have liked it better if Det. Blake had been, I don't know, Det. Grayson, or Todd, or Drake.  Throw a bone in for the fans, y'know?  I'd have given it that last star if they'd 'stuck' the ending, as well.  But other than these, relatively minor, reservations, it is a good film- well worth watching for a fan of Batman, Nolan, or both.  (Just, not as much for the fan of comic-books, perhaps.)
B003ES5ZPK|4.0|I got this to prevent an HDMI cable from sticking out from behind my TV and it does the job. It is bigger than I expected, which wasn't a problem for me but could be for some applications. Take another look at the product image and use the male HDMI end as a frame of reference.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Season 2 was interesting but I don't think it was as good as season 1. I enjoyed how they use the same actors as different characters.
B000YN369A|5.0|Great album. It's calm enough to listen to while I work, yet upbeat enough to keep me from getting sleepy. If you enjoy the big hit off this album (such great heights) then you'll love the rest of the songs.
0446573027|4.0|I recommend this book if you're looking for a few hours of escapist reading. It's a great book to read on a vacation. The main character is an Army CID investigator so what we have here is a murder mystery. It kept me well engaged and I genuinely enjoyed it. I liked it better than the last several books in the Camel Club series.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Lee Child as I am, (proud to say I'm a \\"Reacher Creature,\\") you may think this book is a knock off. Perhaps Mr. Balducci was influenced by Lee Child, perhaps not. For those Reacher fans who think he ripped off Lee Child, let me point you to The General's Daughter, by Nelson DeMille. I think Balducci's main character has as much in common with DeMille's main character, Paul Bremmer, as he does with Reacher.<br /><br />Who cares? There's plenty of room here. As a fan of all three authors, I say, \\"Get over it!\\" Rather, enjoy each.

140272666X|4.0|Having co-read the entire classic start series with a young one, I can say this is a good introduction to Mary Shelley for children 7-10. Much of the original language is lost in the retelling, as are the finer points of character development, but the basic narrative is maintained and flows in such a way that 2 or 3 hours of sustained reading is enough to digest it. Every Classic Starts out there has something to offer and represents yet another stone laid in the foundation of a child's early literary education.
B004J4XGN6|4.0|\\"All business books are wrong; but some are useful\\", to paraphrase GPE Box.  Eric Ries' \\"The Lean Startup\\" is no exception, with both good and bad aspects to it.<br /><br />\\"The Lean Startup\\" has important things to say about entrepreneurial management.  Eric Ries may have had difficulty selling these ideas to the established business community, but in my opinion, his methods are sound and practical, and he has done an excellent job of articulating these in the current book.  For example, they:<br /><br />1. address markets with high degrees of customer and technological uncertainty<br />2. assert that management is required, not optional; even though markets and technology are uncertain, you can't `just build it'<br />3. redefine accountability around cross-functional teams that are allowed to fail (validated learning)<br />4. define central roles for customer acceptance and market growth in product and model refinement<br />5. place learning, experimentation, and failure in a central role; strategy, accountability, and organization are diminished (`build-measure-learn' dynamic)<br /><br />The book is written in an accessible and enjoyable prose, and contains case studies and many practical messages for would-be entrepreneurs.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the strengths of Ries' personal experiences and insight are undermined by the occasional misstatement, on the one hand; and uncritical examples of some companies that are poster boys for bad management practice, on the other.  Some of the latter is simply (I believe) gratuitous logrolling - for example HP, recently notorious for a sequence of embarrassing management shuffles.  I suppose Ries is interested in being invited into HP for talks and consulting gigs; and I suppose he would not be invited were he to trash them for their improprieties.<br /><br />More concerning is his carelessness in summarizing case study business models - good and bad.  For example, he pillories Enron and Lehman Brothers as Ponzi schemes - neither was.  Enron failed because it tried to make markets in Internet bandwidth, waste water, energy and a lot of other markets; there were about 400 other B2B markets doing this at the end of the 1990s, but Enron fraudulently hid its losses offshore (not good).  Lehman Brothers was as competently managed as other big banks in 2008, but got caught in the political backwash of the Bear Sterns bailout by the Fed of NY.  Neither was a Ponzi scheme.  In contrast, Groupon, which has been described as a Ponzi scheme by its investors, gets nothing but good words from Ries, in contrast to most reporting on the troubled company.  Again, maybe this is just logrolling, but it detracts from the credibility of the book, and I docked it a star because of this.<br /><br />So, in summary, \\"All business books are wrong; but some are useful\\", and Ries' book falls into this latter category.neither was.

B009MCRHH6|5.0|Finally a FAOTD that I personally am able to 5 star it!  It looked ridiculous at first but installed due to cust reviews.  When I finally started playing I couldn't stop!  There aren't enough unique yet enjoyable games out for me.  It was a bit confusing at first trying to figure out what to do but I caught on rather quickly.  Even some of the signs were more confusing than helpful but with trial &amp; error I figured it out!  That's the point, to figure out new ways of meeting your goal!  If I was able to figure it out then it wasn't that difficult if you actually tried rather than tapping all your phone's buttons &amp; interacted w/the game's screen.  Even the preview pics here give you an idea as to what you're suppose to do to be able to try to accomplish what you seen here.  Just some food for thought.  Give it a shot BEFORE giving up &amp; use some sense.  Not everything in life is going to have instructions &amp; it's time people start using some sense anyways!

B00AQF8CJ0|2.0|This is a pretty good looking game. The graphics are fun, the characters are lovable, and it's fun to play. But while it's fun, it's also too easy.  Give this game about two hours of your time, and you'll be done. I sat in the car and played this on my phone and I was literally going through a level for less than two minutes at a time, and the difficult ones at that. I got the full three marks, and finished all the bonuses too.<br /><br />There are much more entertaining games you can buy at $0.99 instead of this one, and you're not getting very much except not having to see ads in this HD version.
1475143389|5.0|I'm a 30 year old woman, a mom, and I've been working hard this last year to get strong and lean. It's been a slow, rewarding process. But reading this book catapulted my progress and my concepts of how to work out and eat for the most dramatic, sustainable, healthy change. Matthews is unlike anything I've read before and the number of actually useful, inspirational, and customer-centered emails I've got from him after signing up on his website has been really encouraging. I just finished reading this book, Bigger Leaner Stronger, and I've changed up my diet and weight routine with what I've learned. I didn't realize there was another book for women when I purchased it, but it seems that the science is the same and I'm at a place where I'm really trying to get stronger and look more sculpted, not just lose a lot of weight. I found the straight forward approach Matthews lines out with practical, research based techniques to be immensely helpful. If you've ever been intimidated, confused, or unmotivated, buy this book. If you want to know exactly what to do to get the results quickly, buy this book. If you have someone in your life who wants to get in shape, but is wasting their time eating special-k and running on a treadmill for hours at a time, buy them this book.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I first heard about these books from a friend. When he first told me what it was about I wasn't really interested in reading them but decided to try and read it anyway.

B005LAIIGC|5.0|What can I say about this movie that explains how amazing it is? I don't think words can even describe how amazing this movie is. I am a 15 year old boy and love animated movies. I can't get enough of them. I love what Dreamworks has done in the last 4 years. They have stepped it up and brought us Megamind, How to Train Your Dragon, and now Rise of the Guardians. I think they really captured each character perfectly. Jack Frost, Santa (North), Easter Bunny, Sandman, and the Tooth Fairy. This movie made me believe in these characters and made me feel like a kid again. It was dark a certain parts, but that is what is different about Dreamworks movies. They always have a sense of darkness in their new movies, that I really love. I don't really call them kids movies, I call them just animated movies. Labeling them as kids movies to me would be wrong. The story in Rise of the Guardians was fantastic and sad at times. I don't want to give anything away, but I will say be prepared to be surprised and shocked. This movie was visually stunning in 3D. If you are going to go see it, see it in 3D if you can. You will not be disappointed. The voice acting is brilliant and each actor and actress fits the role perfect. Many people thought Chris Pine's voice would not fit Jack Frost, but I think it fit perfectly. All the actors brought the characters alive and gave them a since of realize that make you believe they are even more real. Why do I give it a 10 out of 10, well because it deserves the best rating for making me believe and feel like a kid again. Not any other movie has ever done that before. Go see it for sure, even if you don't have kids to bring with you.

You need a bit of time to play but it should definitely be part of any family collection of games.  Last summer we played at camp and the neighboring family joined in.  Their precocious 5 yr. old had been playing online!  Lot's of great memories.  We are saving up for the 5-6 person extension but not sure whether this adds time.  Seems as though it would.

0525952926|5.0|After so many years of pumping out international thrillers, Ken Follett is still at it with his latest magnum opus, \\"Winter of the World\\". Following in the example of \\"Fall of Giants\\", this equally engrossing epic tale attempts to capture the lives of a new generation of the same old families of pre-World War I Europe. This time, their ambitions and dreams take them to new spots across the western world: London, Barcelona, Berlin, Washington, Buffalo, Cardiff, New York and Paris. However, the lives and times described here, like in the other book, are not ordinary times. The Great Depression is on, Fascism is on the march, and fortunes are harder to come by. It is the Thirties and Europe is on the brink of another world war, and yet the children are off doing their thing to make the world a better and more interesting place to live. Some of their personal choices will put them in direct conflict with the traditions of their parents and their peers, while others will attempt to buck the popular trends of the day. All told, every decision they make will force them to adjust to the dangers of a very volatile world. Overarching these many remarkable lives of young people who are politically motivated, romantically inclined, adventure-seeking, or just longing for family is that the forces of history will always have the final say in how these desires play out. Like in its predecessor, \\"Winter of the World\\" provides the reader with a number of compelling narratives that take all the main characters into the very heart of a global conflict that will reshape and redefine the very world they live in. War will become the great leveller in this novel as people cast aside their personal plans and focus on staying alive in the fight for survival in a ferociously `cold' world. This book does a wonderful job in blending modern history with fiction to create a comprehensive view of a world undergoing a major social, political and economic transformation.

B0037QM8YA|5.0|My one complaint is that the audio is inaudible in some places. That's surprising considering that Oprah Winfrey & Tyler Perry each have enough funds to get great auditing. Now, for the good which is everything else. The writing is excellent, so true to life. I've been around these people before. It was so realistic I was laughing sometimes. Yes, it's also very tragic. The acting and directing are also excellent. I don't think Mariah Carey gets the credit for her acting ability that she should. I like all of the films I've seen her in. This is not a film about black American ghetto folks living in the hood. Precious could very easily be a fat white girl with the sexually abusive father and the very angry abusive mother who is cheating the welfare system. I've also been around white folks who are like this. It's more about class then about race. The ending is realistic because there is always one chicken who flew the coup so to speak. I was wondering if this is more of Oprah's story. If I could give it more stars I would.
