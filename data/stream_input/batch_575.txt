B00004WLXZ|1.0|Having first seen this film at university twenty years ago I was really looking forward to watching this scary but masterful political propaganda film once again but my copy was a dud. About 70 minutes into the film it started to get the wobblies. The images became broken up and pixelated and then the image froze altogether whilst the sound continued. Then the sound froze. I had to keep fast forwarding to get through the glitches. QA could not have been to rigorous. The digital reproduction on the DVD is poor at this point and this continues throughout the whole of the SS review. <br /> <br />I'll be asking for my money back. <br />
B00006G8HX|5.0|I agree with those who write that Search for Spock isn't quite the movie that Wrath of Khan was.  This movie just ground to a almost screeching halt at times.  Some of the scenes were hard to watch.  There isn't nearly the ambience of movies like Wrath of Khan, The Motion Picture, or First Contact.<br /><br />What I like about the film is as follows:<br /><br />1. Robin Curtis.  I think she's the ultimate Vulcan babe.  I found her Saavik to be much more convincing than Kirstie Alley's.  When I saw this movie in the theater I thought \\"Now there's what a Vulcan woman should look like!\\"  She's never been surpassed in my book.<br /><br />2. The entire original crew working together to save one of their own.  They each get to do something.  It's not just about Kirk, Spock, and McCoy.<br /><br />3. Christopher Lloyd.  No matter how ruthless his character is, I still want to laugh.  Maybe not the most convincing Klingon, but very entertaining, to me anyway.<br /><br />I could go on, but I would likely repeat what others have said about the movie.<br /><br />But this isn't just about the movie; it's about all the other stuff you get with these two disc sets.  You get commentary tracks and interviews and documentaries.<br /><br />Wouldn't you like to hear what Leonard Nimoy had to say about Directing the movie?  Would you like to hear and see Robin Curtis talk about her approach to playing Saavik and how she was coached through various scenes by director Nimoy?<br /><br />There's a lot more going on here than the movie itself.  So maybe it's a three star movie, but it's a five star product.
0802130208|4.0|This is an oddly enjoyable book.  If the film maker John Waters were to write a literary comic-drama, it would be like this.  The dialogue is hilariously self-conscious and over-dramatic; the setting is appropriately tacky.  Yet all this is accomplished as a sensitive critique of 1960's southern culture. Ignatius J. Reilly's ravings against modern society are both interesting and humorous.  It is not an exciting book, but I greatly enjoyed it.
B000002LCX|5.0|We'll never see their like again in this lifetime.  The Beatles of our generation.  Pure pop perfection.  The entire catalogue.  That's the other thing to consider, the amount of material in so little time.  Let's call them genius and be done with it.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|I originally bought the CD because of the soundtrack (tease) for an advertisement on the radio.  The song was so upbeat and fun I couldn't resist.  After receiving and listening to the CD I can't wait to see the play/musical.
B000002UYZ|5.0|What can I say... it's The Beatles!  I trully love this album and jam out in my car every chance I get.  It's such a shame I was born in the wrong era.  I would of love to have seen and hear The Beatles for the first time on T.V. Gotta love Paul, Ringo, John and George.
B00005K3OT|5.0|A chocolate addict I am, and this movie is no exception. Some of the chocolate-filled scenes seriously sent me to my own seventh heaven. In addition, Johnny Depp is pretty attractive and, as a French/American, I can certify that there are no great errors or blaspemy on the french in this movie - that struck me at least. Even the rock'n'roll (\\"you ain't nothing but a hound dog...\\") singing priest is awesome.
B00000G3PA|5.0|The movie Armageddon is about a group of NASA trained astronauts who have to go on a dangerous mission to help save the world. They have to venture out into space so they can land on an asteroid the size of Texas.  Their mission is to drill a very large hole so they can blow it up before it reaches Earth.  But no only does it have alot of action it also is a serious tear jerker.  It made me cry at least 4 different times.  The sad parts don't over throw the humorous parts.  Althought the whole story plot may be a bit of a stretch the graphics and actors help to make it more believable.  Bruce Willis as in all of his other movies was top notch and awesome' while Ben Affleck wasn't at his best.  The soundtrack also kept your foot taping, some songs by Aerosmith.  This is by far my absolute favorite movie; it is timeless and will keep making people awe for years.
B000002U82|5.0|Dark Side of the Moon. A quintessential progressive rock album. This is Floyd's best selling album to date from what I've heard. I've also heard that this is their best album also. I have to disagree on that but I'll get to that in a minute. Anyway, all the songs on here are flawless. They flow into one another smoothly. I really don't have a particular favorite because they are all well done. Roger Water's and David Gimour's vocals are excellent. David's guitar playing is awesom. Nick Mason is spectacular on the synthisizer and provides good backing vocals. Roger Wright does a very good job on the drums. I believe for this album and their following Wish You Were Here the band was at its height in terms of playing together as band. But this isn't my favorite Floyd album. I believe it's overated and I like Meddle and Wish You Were Here better and A Momentary Lapse of Reason. It's unfortunate that people judge all their other albums by this; it's unfair to the band, to the albums, and to those getting into Floyd and being told that this is the end all of Floyd's work. A real shame. Other than that, it is a perfect album even though not particular favorite.
B000055Y0Y|5.0|The suspense was incredible. The way it led up to the final ending was great. I would recommend anyone to purchase this TODAY!
B00005R23X|5.0|A few years ago I approached Coppola's \\"Dracula\\" in a mood of indifference mixed with skepticism.  Remembering Hammer Studios final, rather mediocre Dracula films, unable to forget Paul Morrisey's travesty of a film, and dissatisfied by Frank Langella's interpretation of the vampire Count--I expected Coppola's \\"Dracula\\" to be mildly entertaining at best.  Thus I sighed, slipped the borrowed disc into my machine, sighed once more--and 130 minutes later I started breathing again!  Coppola's \\"Dracula\\" is truly spellbinding, breathtaking.  The very first moments of the film were surprising: the musical score's harsh, Balkan rhythms, the sight of wind-driven mists over the dome of St. Sophia's, the fine narration of the Turks' 15th century conquest of Constantinople, a heavy cross thrown down and shattering on a cobblestone pavement: such is beautiful film-making.  That such visionary intensity could be sustained the entire length of the film--miraculous!       In practically every respect the film seems unprecedented--paradoxically because it adheres to the spirit, if not the letter, of the original 1898 novel.  Only the conclusion deviates significantly from Bram Stoker's book.  Nevertheless the cinematic ending remains quite effective: passionate, violent, Romantic--epithets that can be applied to the entire film as well.  But there's one more word that seems equally fitting: \\"grandeur.\\"  \\"Dracula\\" has a truly epic scope: it begins with medieval armies contending for the possession of Europe; it spans centuries of implied supernatural warfare; it concludes among the incredible fortified mountains and precipices that seem to overlook the edge of this world...       While such visuals are stunning, they never diminish one's interest in the principal characters.  Gary Oldman's portrayal of Dracula is both flawless and original.  Less a monster than a tragic hero, he suffers a centuries-old torment of lost love.  At the same time he is painfully aware of his own monstrosity--apparently inflicted for the understandable sin of cursing God!  Anthony Hopkins is likewise impressive as Van Helsing--eccentric to the point of mania (as are many geniuses), yet formidable in every respect.  Wynona Ryder is appropriately cool and beautiful as Dracula's reincarnated love.  She is upstaged, however, by Sadie Frost's incredibly sexy interpretation of Lucy Westenra, the aristocratic Victorian dream-girl transformed by Dracula into a Victorian nightmare.  Incidentally, I am astonished that Mistress Frost has yet to be recognized as a major horror film Icon.       All in all, Coppola's \\"Dracula\\" is one of those rare films that one can seriously compare to the best work of certain European directors--men like Mario Bava, Dario Argento, Jean Rollin, Jess Franco.  In the horror film universe that constitutes the highest possible praise.
0898159156|5.0|This book contains everything you'll ever want to know about carnivorous plants.  Whether you're a complete novice or an old hand there's something for everyone.  The instructions are comprehensive without being off-putting.  The book is peppered with spectacular colour photos throughout so you can really see what the plants look like. Even though it's not a children's book, children will enjoy looking at the pictures.  It's even got a cool title!
0060899190|4.0|I never got to see the PostSecret art exhibition or any of the postcards on the website's original incarnation so it was nice to be able to get this book.  The combination of people's raw secrets coupled with the evocative imagery on their postcards makes this a heart-and gut-wrenching book.  While I was flipping through it I had the simultaneous desires to put it away forever, keep looking through it and start making my own postcard-art secrets right away.  I would have liked this book to have more pages for what it cost (since I know there are loads more postcards) but I suppose they wanted the pages to have the texture of postcards so they're awfully thick.
B0009NSE1K|5.0|Ok...Lets say your one of these Rock is dead types...from the seventies...or even the ninties from when Nirvana stormed onto the scene with the angst of ages.  Ever hear of this band? <br />Clutch is the End all be all of what can be called \\"modern pure Rock\\"  when I say \\"clutch ROCKS\\" they effin' ROCK!!!  They aren't even a Metal band and are worthy to bare the Horns!  <br />\m/ >.&lt; \m/ <br /> <br />I LOVE this album...sure they had an album called \\"Pure Rock Fury\\"  <br />but they ARE! They SO are... <br /> <br />recomended to those who simply love a kick ass rock band with no Image in mind. Find their web page and actually take a look at these guys... You'll see.
0553573403|5.0|I read a lot of sci-fi fantasy, but I rarely read historical fantasy.  More often than not they're magic-driven and make me feel as though I'm reading some kind of history text/comic book hybrid.  After uncontrollable yawning, I never finish them.  So when I read a review of Martin's latest in this series in TIME last year, I was intrigued.  It's very rare that a fantasy novel gets a review, much less a spectacular review in TIME. I thought I'd take a chance on this one, and I am THRILLED!<br /><br />The organization of this book annoyed me at first.  Each chapter is a sub-plot from a different character's perspective.  I got over it fairly quickly, though.  Martin propels the story forward using this style, and for me, it never got boring in the 800+ pages I read.  Magic is present, but not really discussed too much, and when it's used, it's never good.  I found that surprising and refreshing.  It was kept just under the surface until it was necessary, and it wasn't used as a quick remedy for holes in the plot, becuase there were none!<br /><br />I've read the complaints that this book is violent, \\"sadistic\\" and perverted - hogwash!  There is violence (there's war) there is sex (there are people), and there is perversion in that there is incest, but the incest is a blip on the radar; it occurs among nobility - not fantasy, if you ever took European history.  I was not offended, nor did I find any of those elements to be overdone.  It all contributed to a GREAT read.  Needless to say, I had plans for home-improvement this weekend, but painting can wait.  I hear Book 2 calling...
B000002LIX|5.0|First introduction - Sonora Desert - 70 miles an hour - two great friends...blew my mind.  Music cracked through the exoskeleton and set my mind and soul ablaze.  Still has that same effect 15 years later...power, intensity, the crytal scalpel releasing the inner zen...one MUST eat the other, what bitter irony.  If your worthy, this is some of the most challenging, intellectual-emotionally artistic music out there.  It will create magnificant backdrops in the mind.  Too much power contained within such a small grouping couldn't last.  The sub nuclear assemblage went critical mass.
B00004SU5J|4.0|I like to imagine sitting in a smoky cafe in France in the future with a half robot band playing in the background.
B000A6T1JU|4.0|This version of \\"The Warriors\\" definitely brings another perspective into view.  The theater version of the movie was great, but the directors cut uses dark comicbook-like pauses that gives the view a second to absorb what just happened and get ready for the next scene.  Definitely an enjoyable experience.
B00008GKEG|4.0|This is an important document for beatlemaniacs.  I would prefer more music or concerts over reviews and conversations.
B00005K3OT|5.0|This amazing movie was just as enjoyable to buy. The DVD was in great condition and the price was great!
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I was introduced to this series as a part of my WWII course in university.  I was blown away so much from this series (no pun intended...) that I purchased it on VHS.  Now with this re-release on DVD, 30 years after its original broadcast, you get the digital quality and the ability to view which episode you like - no fast forwarding needed.  This also comes with some extended features as well, not shown in previous releases.  I will be proud to pass this on to my children and my grandchildren.  No faulty viewing problems with any of the discs either!  It is perfect for the gifted scholar to anyone who  just might be curious about the war.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|We are so hooked on this show!  My daughter brought us the Firefly season on DVD that this movie was made from.  We started watching and couldn't stop.  We never saw it when it was on TV, which was a mistake.  It's so surprising that it was cancelled after one season - it's EXCELLENT!  So we couldn't wait to see the movie.  My daughter also brought the movie for us to watch, and we have since bought the first season and the movie.  It's one of those shows you can watch over and over and never get tired of it.  The storyline, the characters, the effects - ALL AWESOME!  I WANT MORE!  I hope they make many more movies or bring the series back.  Carry on, Serenity!
B00005MP58|5.0|I have no plans to give a lengthy review, however I will state how much I love this movie. I love how the director, regardless of time constraints, plays out and unfolds this classic story straight from the book.  It may take a day or two to watch, but the end results just seem rewarding to that of its 2 hour competitions.
B00005JMXX|3.0|The Day After Tomorrow is clearly a comedy being marketed as a disaster movie.  The film has the appearance of being heavily edited down; for an epic, world-ending disaster, you need at least a two-hour movie.<br /><br />The film presents a dark look at how helpless humanity is in the big scheme of things and how our petty lives and culture mean nothing to mindless Mother Nature.  Yet anyone with any iota of meteorological knowledge knows that disastrous weather does not happen this quickly.  And the way water and ice behave in this movie is truly ludicrous.<br /><br />And what if it did happen, and just as The Day After Tomorrow portrays?  What could we do against a world where the laws of nature cease to exist?  The end of the world (or nearly so) is either a tragedy or a comedy.  Judging from this film, it would be hilarious, indeed.

B000002MY3|5.0|Well, If I could set a point that I started to like 'white' music, it would be this CD. Alanis tapped into how I was feeling about a break-up I had went through with \\"You oughta know.\\" She made me want to scream, and feel justified by doing so. In \\"head over feet\\" I was revived by love and got a chance to have a little fun. \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" was a lesson in life and I was completly healed by the time I had memoried this song. It was so cool and confusing because.....well i don't know why!
B000028U0Y|4.0|After playing to death the LP of Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison and then being forced by the end of LP's and dragged kicking and screaming into the DVD and CD player technologies somewhat reluctantly and belatedly it did feel like I was in the front row listening to Johnny on my Bose radio and CD player.  It was great to hear all the songs again.
B00006879E|5.0|Maroon 5 is the SSSS! I first hear them on the radio and thought they were black, but was knocked off my feet when I saw their \\"Breathe\\" video. Since then I have bought this CD and am in love. \\"Tangle\\" is on of my favorite songs, because of it's usually beat. I 'car dance' all the time to it. I really love \\"Sweetest Goodbye\\" and \\"Shiver\\"! They remind me alot of U2. Well Maroon 5 has my African-American vote for bringing the funky!
B000002UDG|5.0|All the best was the very first Paul Mccartney CD I purchased. but of course I have almost all of Pauls solo record in Vinyl. Almost all of Pauls beautiful songs are all here. not included are SO BAD, ARROW THROUGH ME , MY BABYS REQUEST & SPIES LIKE US to name a few. (The original vinyl release was a double record)fyi. Anyway, i never get tire of listening to this cd. Paul to me is the greatest songwriter ever. I became a fan first of paul mccartney & wings before the beatles. I was 6 years old in 1973 when I first heard the song BAND ON THE RUN in the radio. So I particularly grew up listening to paul. He was part of my happy childhood. So listening to All the Best brings back happy memories.... <br /> <br />PS. My three young kids, me wife are now Paul McCartney fans. Thanks to this great album of Sir Paul.
0783240236|4.0|Great movie.  I would really love to toss it an extra little half star and make it five; and perhaps after watching it a few more times and watching some more Hitchcock thats what I ll end up doing.   <br /> <br />It's a great mesh of a film.  More than just some tense horror, you are given a story worth discussion.  Why are those damn birds attacking?  For the love of God!  Its really quite brilliant how it all plays out and in a lot of respects is almost two films in one.  The opening half, a very mysterious love story, and of course the later half a good ole Hitchcock suspense film. <br /> <br />On note of the DVD, its outstanding.  Theres a terrific making of, an original trailer, deleted scene, alternate ending, and, most important for me, other actors or film lovers, Tippi Hedren's original screen test!!  Very cool stuff. <br /> <br />The films great and the DVD is one of the best older films in terms of extras.  You gotta check it out.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|I have always like the Foo Fighters.  I jammed out to a few of their songs with my band, I own every one of their CD's, except One by One, but never \\"loved\\" them.  How an album can change an opinion.  I am amazed by the growth of this band.  Every song on both CD's is fantastic, not one track to skip.  It gets me realy excited to see what else they can do.  The album kind of reminds me of the turn that Blink took.  I just hope I don't get disappointed this time and hear about them breaking up before they have a chance to make another album.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I watched this show when it aired on Fox and I didn't understand the background of the characters since Fox showed the episodes out of sequence.  <br />With the Firefly series, I can watch the episodes as they were meant to be and I love it. It's a really fun,witty and quirky series. It's intelligently written with interesting characters. I'm not a big Sci-Fi fan nor a western fan, but Firefly does a great job integrating the two as well as having a strong story line that is appealing to all.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Though I have a ton of favorite songs from different movies, I have only a few favorite composers.  Howard Shore is one of them.  When Rohan goes into battle, he mixes the strong battle music with the soft, soothing sounds of Rohan's theme to show the beauty, strength and pride of the people and what they are willing to do to defeat evil.  I very much like his style and it meshes well with J.R.R. Tolkien's book.
B0002B15XI|5.0|Fast moving comedy that protests the waste of war from any era. The comic delivery is suburb. You can watch this over and over finding new laughs every time you watch. One of the best.
B00020HEG6|5.0|If God himself were to put music with our emotions, he would ask John Williams to write it.  When Harry rode on Buckbeak, you could feel the excitement, fear and joy that Harry was going through just from the song.  Once again Mr. Williams,  BRAVO!
0792844890|4.0|This is a great take off on the Star Wars Trilogy with some classic comic lines. Who can beat Mel Brooks! This is a good one to add to your Star Wars collection.
B000002J29|5.0|This CD was fantastic.  The sound is much better than the record.
B00006DEF9|5.0|Even if you don't have a huge DVD collection, this one should be a part of it. What's great about the special edition is the behind the scenes stuff. There are a few documentaries on why the sets were built the way they were. How the actors treated each other and why these particular songs were chosen. It is fantastic. You can't watch Singin' in the Rain and not smile. It is a proven fact.

0812550757|5.0|Speaker for the Dead by Orson Scott Card <br />Tor Books, 1991 <br />382 pages <br /> <br /> Three-thousand some odd years have past since the xenocide of the buggers lead by the horrible, hateful, destructive Ender Wiggin, and people have started to colonize not only the planets left from the descimated buggers, but people have also gone in search of new worlds habitable by humans.  People go for many reasons to start life on new planets, Lusitania Colony is formed by a Catholic community to be around like, mined people for their freedoms to live as they want, but later you find that these colonies are not as free as one might think being 22 light years away from the nearest human planet.  Ender, long since thought of as dead is only 35 years old due to the time dilation that occurs during his many trips to all of the hundred worlds, trying to find a new home for his \\"little package\\" left for him at the end of Ender's Game.  Little does everyone know that Ender \\"The Xenocide\\" is also Andrew Wiggin \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" who is loved and cherished by many for his immense talent for empathy and telling the truth, always.  The book starts off in Lusitania colony where a new species has been found, the \\"Piggies\\" a Humanoid species thought of as a redemption for the mistakes made because of the Xenocide done by Ender.  This new species is studied by a new breed of Anthropologist called a Xenologer.  These Xenologers, Pipo and his apprentice/son Libo, are aloud only to observe their culture without interfering at all (at all meaning no discussing our culture to them, no giving them information about our inventions and processes for agriculture) they can literally share NOTHING with the piggies to interfere with their own evolution as a species.  This culture is completely unknown to us, and this immensely slow process of not being able to ask direct questions for possibility of either them learning about our culture or the xenologer's insulting their ways is not helpingat all.  The Starways Congress is already wary of this species, and is willing to destroy it in a second, just like the Xenocide, to protect human life, so when a human is killed while studying the Piggies suspisions grow and restrictions are given to the xenologers to hinder them even more in their research.  Ender is called to the planet to speak the death of the man who has died, so he rushes over from the nearest planet 22 years away relatively to them and a new adventure begins harder than anything he has ever done before he must risk his life to save not only the humans, but also the Piggie's lives. <br /> This book is extremely well written with fluid meanings in the way Card uses his capitalizations and his way of perfectly portraying human behavior.  Speaker for the Dead is an emotional ride as we go from one relationship to another with human to human, human to piggie, and even piggie to piggie.  I strongly recommend reading this book at least twice as it is very complicated, but also very fulfilling, and a learning experience.  This book is not only for lovers of SF, but for everyone. <br />
B000EGDC14|5.0|I was a little apprehensive about this album.  I didn't think that there was any possible way that Goldfrapp could top their work on Felt Mountain and Black Cherry.  Still, I waited in eager anticipation with only the very impressive Number 1 EP to hint at the potential genious to be released in the US on March 7th. I was literally marking days in the calendar for this one.    Did this album ever deliver, and how.  On every single song.  Alison Goldfrapp's voice is a thing of utter genious.  This is one decadent, delicious listen from the bouncing, yet throbbing, opening of Ooh La La all the way through the very Black Cherry-esque sounding close of Beautiful.  Lovely 2 CU is slinky romp, Ride A White Horse is an amazing beat-backed track showcasing Alison's gorgeous snarl.  You Never Know and Let it Take You brings the energy back down, but in that utterly hypnotic, simmering Goldfrapp way.  You Never Know has a districtly hyper-modern orchestral sound.  While I love the beat-heavy tracks a little more, Alison's voice really shines on the slower numbers.  That woman has got quite an instrument going on.      Fly Me Away picks the tempo back up, but in a laid back way.  Very sunny and summer-y sounding song.  It is definitely the most accessible, mainstream sounding song on the entire album.  I would like to know if anyone else thinks that Alison sounds eerily like Gwen Stefani on this track.  No offense meant to Alison, though I actually really like Gwen, as Alison's talent and voice dwarfs poor Gwen.  Still you can really hear where Gwen might have pulled her sound from for L.A.M.B.  They have a very similar lilt to their voices sometimes, and it's an affectation that I think Gwen pick up from Goldfrapp's previous albums.  Hard to tell who might be pulling from whom, maybe neither.  Give it a listen, though, I think that you'll hear what I am talking about.    Slide In, Koko, and Satin Chic keep the flow going strong.  All great, destined-to-be-classic Goldfrapp tracks.  I love Alison's pitch in the chorus of Slide In.  She really shows a lot of vocal range on this album.  Satin Chic has a really cool, with an unusual old-timey piano/juke joint sound to it, but with Goldfrapp's signature heavily electronic treatment.  Time Out From the World brings me back to Felt Mountain, albeit briefly.  Atmospheric and dreamy, and not as straightforward and in your face as the rest of the album.  The finish comes courtesy of Number 1, one of my all time favorite songs, and Beautiful.      It's a fast ride, clocking in at only 48:05 in duration, so hang on tight and listen up.  This album is, in my opinion, a masterpiece from beginning to end.  Easily one of of my top 5 of all time.  If you are Goldfrapp fan, regardless of whether you are in the Felt Mountain camp or the Black Cherry camp, you will not be disappointed.  This is dance music for the beautiful, brooding, noir set.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I really enjoyed listening to the soundtrack for \\"Wicked\\".  I purchased it for my daughter who had just seen it recently and have also enjoyed listening to it myself.
B000E6UK5K|3.0|The music is a mellower Gilmour. I like the music, it is fine. My complaint is how many cds are now coming in a variety of packages. This does not come in a jewel box (which I like) or a digi pak (which I hate) it comes in a little book with the most bizarre ring for the disc to go on. Sure the artsy people will love it but I like consistency. Make the \\"special\\" stuff for special editions and just give me the jewel box. This book will wear, the cd ring will fall apart if handled too much. I am already having trouble with it.<br /><br />I was equally upset over the Kate Bush release of 2005 and the Robert Plant (which fortunately I found in the UK in a jewel).<br /><br />Just had to vent,<br /><br />Enjoy
1594200653|5.0|This is a spectacular book. While the author is a superb academic historian, the book is not written for an academic audience (e.g., essentially no footnotes, no references - this is an advantage but a limit as well). It reads very well, even though the book is long and intense. The key to understand the postwar history of Europe (west AND east), the author seems to argues, is the understanding of the mechanisms that govern the formation of collective memory; in particular with regards to Nazis' crimes.  <br /> <br />The last chapter, The Epilogue, is really illuminating as well as fascinating on this respect.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|I love Pink Floyd and usually take Roger's side in the which one is Pink argument but this album is good.  The only thing it lacks are decent lyrics and a stong coherent theme.  Lost For Words maybe.  I was also hoping David would let lose with a rocker with a killer solo but there's no rocker on this one. Over all I love the mood, feel, and sound of 'On An Island'. The first couple of songs remind me of \\"Obscured By Clouds\\".  If there were half stars I would have gone with four and a half but since there's not from me it gets five.
0920668364|5.0|I first heard of this book when my minister read it at one of his services demonstrating the strong love a mother has for her child.  When he read it to the congregation, I had tears pouring down my eyes just listening to the words.  There is a brief section in the book that has some humor where the child is grown up, and the mother is talking about sneaking into his bedroom of his new house just to \\"rock him back and forth...\\", as she had done when he was little--just a symbol of how she carries him in her heart.  I bought it for my 3 1/2 year old who now asks for it to be read every night...and I still fight the tears now and then....this book is very touching and would be enjoyed by adults as well as children.

0812550706|5.0|I am currently reading Ender's Game and I have got to say it is one of the best pieces of science fiction books that I have read. I am not big on reading books but when I started reading this book it lured me in and is hard to put down. It is about a family that lives in a government that you can only have two children. This family that this book is about had a third child whose name is Ender, Also known as a third. Ender gets into a military school in space called battle school, where children are put into armies and have war games against each other in the battle room which is a room with no gravity. The kids who play the game do not know that they are being closely watched for who will be able to command a fleet when they reach adulthood. That all that I have read so far but I can't wait to finish it.
B000BW7QWW|3.0|-- First of all, I must start by explaining that I absolutely love the Firefly TV series. The series is a truly creative concept with a cast and crew that feel as human as we are. I have watched and re-watched all of the episodes and they have yet to lose their flavor. <br />-- This is my warning to anybody with a desire to watch this movie *because* of the TV series. You might be disappointedly entertained. <br />-- The biggest problem I had with Serenity is that the characters do not feel the same. Simon is more vocal, aggressive, and has a slight variation to his past. The captain is too head-strong and seems to care a lot less about his crew. The quirkiness of some of the other cast seems to be lost in the transition from a series to a movie. The cast just didn't seem to bond as well in Serenity. Without spoiling anything, there are other issues that leave a bad taste in your mouth by the time you are done watching the movie. Things you simply wish that had not been done. <br />-- Serenity does at least answer a few questions, although it's kind of up to you whether you even wanted those questions answered. Some of what made Firefly so fun to watch was that there WERE questions without answers. <br />-- Overall, was it worth watching? Yes, if only to see that one last journey with the crew of Serenity, but do so with a forgiving eye.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Okay. I seriously don't understand why everyone is trying to say Radiohead is basically crap. I mean, if you dislike them just because they're 'depressing', 'whiny', 'boohoohoo'ey, then you obviously are a very closed-minded person. The lyrics are what make up a song, setting the emotion for it. You can't hate a band just because their lyrics are depressing! That's utterly pointless, and proves that you can't appreciate poetry. While I admit, when I first looked at the lyrics to this cd, I was a little perplexed by them, until I dug deeper. You have to more than scratch the surface. Darnit, if you can't appreciate the emotion that someone has put into their piece of art, then I just don't know what to say. I'm sorry if I'm taking this way too far, but I, as a very open-minded person, am practically offended by those comments. If you want happy-go-lucky music, listen to some of The Beatles, or some Britney Spears. But this is rock and roll, where the emotion shapes the song. And if you can't appreciate emotion, then just go invest in some pop crap. <br /> <br />Thank you.
B000002UHG|5.0|HEY EVERYBODY, BUY THIS ALBUM!    Before I start, may I just say that I have been a Floydiod since Atom Heart Mother, OK, I scratched Umma Gumma and said the factory did it, but I've seen every concert since \\"Wish You Were Here.\\" I have just waited for the delivery man to bring me my hot off the presses copy of \\"On an Island\\"; and why not, \\"Broken China\\" c. 1996, Rick Wright... I've been after this album for a while.    Rick, I apologise to you. Not for thinking that you were not a part of the sound; but, rather for not giving you more credit for it. Waters and Gilmour must grant you the courtesy of accepting the style you have lent.    (...) This is the finest expression of your sound I've heard to date, and a lovely journey as well. It is well constructed, and ceretainly takes you on a trip.    I'm out of it slightly, but, any purist who appreciates a start-to-finish rock symphony with masters' musicianship, complex melodic intracacies, well-crafted interwoven rhythms and need-to-know lyrics must have this in their collection and listen to it often. I won't be here, but they'll be listening to Broken China in 200 years like we listen to Mozart today.    And, Rick, your drive for rythym and intricate backgrounds and Gilmour for the other bits, and OK, might as well ask Mason to get off his \\"Country Life\\" duff and make an effort......    (...)

B000E6UK5K|4.0|It's very good to see David Gilmour out in the public eye again. It's hard to rate music from any of the Floyd crew when it's first released, I usually have to live with the sound a while. If I'm disappointed by what I'm hearing it's only because I expected a radical departure. So many trip-hop chill-out releases feature a slick Gilmour sound I was kinda hoping he might collaborate with Kruder or the Orb, and why not (if he's so wordstruck) put out a wordless album? And while I'm listing my dreams, when is the Jimmy Page/Dave Gilmour Blues Explosion gonna roll into town? Isn't it time for the two greatest guitar players in rock history to acknowledge their roots?<br /><br />Nice to see so many intelligent reviews for this album.

B000E6UK5K|2.0|Hey, everybody, go buy Broken China, NOW, by Rick Wright, 1996. See my review there. As to this one, well,  <br /> <br /> <br />Man... What a bust! <br /> <br />First an overture. Cool! We're gonna get a symphony, four movements. We're gonna go on a trip... by the fifth cut I had landed in Candy Cane Land. <br /> <br />Sorry, man. I think everyone who has a collection going will want this, and it's got some incredible hot points, but it's a bit too into the shuffleboard... with a textbook shuffle sound. <br /> <br />Just a bit of virtuoso on the drums would have helped. <br /> <br />Cool. It's your statement. I can abide that. I'm gonna go and see you in London. But it's not one which will be remembered 200 years from now. <br /> <br />All the best, <br /> <br />Steve In Spain
0316286850|5.0|This book is amazing, in short. It has a wide variety of looks, from simple looks for girls, to the exotic. It has amazing examples of make overs, turning girls into boys, boys into girls and making Martha Stewart look like Veronica Lake! It has great step by step illustrations and easy to understand language. I've used this book to create looks on myself and on models.

B00003CXB2|5.0|I've read many of the favorable reviews of Lawrence of Arabia, and I really cannot add anything to them.  This is simply an amazing film of such grand sweep and majesty that superlatives are not sufficient to describe it.  Lawrence of Arabia is simply the best film ever made.  It was re-released to the Big Screen for about a week in 1989.  Having never seen it, I went out of curiosity.  I have never been so enthralled by a motion picture in all my life, and I doubt that I ever will be again.  Before that week was over, I must have seen Lawrence of Arabia on the Big Screen at least nine times.  You must see this film.  Period.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|Relieved of the pressure associated with recording under the Pink Floyd banner, Gilmour here sounds much more at ease and a lot less dark and dreary. This is a record Gilmour could only have written and released under his own name, and I say that as a compliment. It's as good an album that long-time fans could have hoped for, and a nice companion to his original solo effort from 1978. There are no monumental songs here, no anthems like Comfortably Numb, no ambitious themes, just a set of mostly pleasant tunes from a seasoned musician who sounds happy to be where he's at.

B00005JOFO|5.0|Brokeback Mountain is a tale of love. It's NOT about two gay cowboys---well it is, but that's not the main moral to the story. Annie Proulx wrote an amazing short story about two sheep hearderd who fall in love in 1960s Wyoming, and when it is reborn by director Ang Lee (Academy Award Winner---Brokeback Mountain, 2005) who brings it to life in its full fledged glory. Heath Ledger, Enus, is one of the best actors of our time, and now he finally proves it with Brokeback. Jake Gyllenhaal, Jack, also on one of the best young talents in Hollywood deserved to win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, but it was George Clooney's year, and Clooney was excellent in Syriana as well.<br />  Director Ang Lee makes this superb film, capturing the beauty and mystery of the mountains in Wyoming. Enus (Ledger) is an engaged cowboy who is looking for a job when he finds one, hearding sheep in the mountains of Brokeback with another cowboy, Jack (Gyllenhaal). The two begin to lose control of themselves, and then end up falling in love within the first twenty minutes of the film. Enus is engaged to Alma, played by the wonderful Michelle Williams. She soon finds out the truth of her husband. Jack later marries Lureen, played by Havoc's Anne Hathaway who bares all in the best roll, next to her part in Havoc (a 2005 film that was released straight on DVD---check into it), of her career. She plays a cold-hearted woman.<br />  The film is released from Focus Features who had a big year this year with Brokeback Mountain, The Constant Gardener, and Pride and Prejudice. The film did not win the Best Picture Academy Award, getting beat by Crash, which was an amazing film, but it did not deserve to win. Brokeback Mountain is the film of the year that will stand the test of time because it was daring and above all the beauty of what film-making should be.

B00005JKG5|2.0|Believe it or not, I actually wanted to watch this movie.  I've seen almost everything else Adrian Lyne has done and respect his shallow talent enough to be interested in his early efforts. <br /> <br />(I watched _Jacob's Ladder_ because I remembered an intriguing preview on a VHS cassette I watched as a kid and learning that it was a significant influence on _Silent Hill_ sealed the deal; My girlfriend owns a copy of Lyne's version of _Lolita_; _Fatal Attraction_ was a girlfriend induced rental; I watched the TV version of _Indecent Proposal_; I haven't seen _9 1/2 Weeks_ but I read the book.)  <br /> <br />Flashdance is also one of those pieces of pop culture that are so influential that you recognize references even if you've never seen it.  And I always wanted to hear the song \\"Maniac\\" in its original context, so when I found it on an acquaintances shelf I popped it in. <br /> <br />So, how was it? <br /> <br />Not too bad.  Not great by any means, or even really that good (_Lolita_ and _Jacob's Ladder_ are both quite good) but interesting enough to keep me awake after a long day of work.  The plot is a by-the-book \\"believe in your dreams\\" story with really lame dialog, but its development is intercut with extended dancing sequences that are so long and frequent that at times it felt like I was watching an abstract silent film.  I don't know squat about dancing, but the choreography seemed innovative, at least for its time. <br /> <br />I can't even remember the names of the characters, but all in all, I have to admit that it was kind of neat. <br /> <br />Also, if you watch it with the subsequent 20+ years of movies in mind, _Flashdance_ can be seen as sort of an omen of all bad things to come from Hollywood:  It's a movie by a director whose only previous experience was in music videos and commercials, one whose screenplay was an early effort by hack Joe Esterhasz and was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer!  Taken collectively these elements are probably responsible for about 60% of all crap movies made since.
0790733226|5.0|...of all time.  This film is deep and it really makes you think.  I believe it was ahead of it's time and that's why it wasn't well-received by the general public.  Jodie Foster did her usual fantastic job, and Matthew McConaughey was his usual fine self.  You know how books-turned-movies usually end up being a disappointment?  Well, not this one.  Granted, the book and the movie are extremely different, but that doesn't make the movie bad.  I think they just took the gist of the book and turned it into this incredible movie.  How unfortunate Mr Sagan was not around to see the finished product.
B00012FXAE|5.0|You always hear that Ridley Scott knows how to do the whole 'deluxe special collector's edition' DVD thing.<br /><br />Well James Cameron is no slouch either.<br /><br />ALIENS, the sequel to sci-fi/horror milestone ALIEN, is presented here in one of the finest DVD releases of any film.  As great as the film itself is, the features and extras on this DVD really make the set.  Disc one offers fans the original theatrical release of the film or the Extended Version, which includes approximately 17 minutes of extra footage, including the colonial Marines' robot-sentry guns, a look at Newt's family and Hadley's Hope before the xenomorphs arrive, and several other great new scenes.  Some other great movies(in my opinion, Amadeus is a fine example) can become tiresome upon their extension in a Director's Cut format, but ALIENS never slows down or has a dull moment, even amidst all of the extra footage.<br /><br />The extras don't stop with the film itself, however.  The DVD's Disc 2 also features fine documentaries on the film-making process, from pre-production, to production, to post-production, including several interviews with the film-makers and cast.  The documentaries offer a plethera of insight into the film's creation, as we watch about how Fox wanted to write out Ripley's character, Sigourney Weaver's hatred for firearms, Michael Biehn's late arrival, and many other interesting aspects of the film's conception.<br /><br />My first exposure to ALIENS was through this Collector's Edition DVD, and it almost immediately became my favorite film of all time.  The story, the acting, the action, the great quotes(Eat this!), the music, and every other little facet of the film will draw you in for a great sci-fi/action ride that you won't regret embarking on.

B00001OH7X|3.0|It is very hard to sum up Lodger.  Most people try and categorize it as part of a `Berlin Trilogy' with Low and \\"Heroes.\\"  The truth is that Lodger is far removed from the brilliance and passion of those two.  The creativity that defined the previous three studio albums is sorely missing on Lodger.  The main disappointment is that there is so little conviction in the performances.  The album just feels totally disjointed.  Listening to Lodger today, it has simply not aged well at all.<br /><br />The songs on the first side (Fantastic Voyage, African Night Flight, Move On, Yassassin and Red Sail) are all yawners with bizarre syncopations that feel depressingly drunk.  The second side is only slightly better with D.J. and Look Back in Anger being the only real highlights.  On Lodger, Adrian Belew takes over on guitar.  He is simply given very little opportunity that Fripp had on \\"Heroes.\\"  The arrangements on most of the songs do little to showcase his talent.  A much better representation of his dynamic talent can be found on the live Stage CD.<br /><br />In summary, Lodger is Bowie's castration album.  His gender confusion has never been more extreme. I find the cover and liner fairly sick to look at.  Many of the songs sound like falsetto and are simply too high even for his broad range.  Boys Keep Swinging is his anthem to the alternative lifestyle that he must have at least toyed with.  An interesting side note is the opening to D.J. which sounds strangely like David Byrne.  Coming off of the peaks of Low, \\"Heroes\\" and Stage, Lodger is a disappointment.  Fortunately, he corrects most of the defects in Lodger on 1980's release of Scary Monsters.<br /><br />Take Lodger for what it is: Bowie's farewell to the 70's, Brian Eno, Berlin and pretty much his better days as an artist.
B000002A3T|5.0|Pink Floyd, without Roger Waters, was unthinkable for many people, and this work has accomplished what \\"Momentary Lapse\\" did, only more so. At times, \\"The Division Bell\\" is simply awe-inspiring. Such a smooth sound, beautiful production, and Gilmour is one of the few who can make a guitar speak. His technique isn't all speed and dexterity; on his own admission, he can't play fast, and he has a \\"Sour Grapes\\" approach to such playing. But this recording proves his attitude to be correct. He can floor you with just a few notes.<br /><br />There are a lot of older Floyd elements in this recording, without sounding rehashed, and to the long-time fan, it is comfortable, and a little reassuring. I once heard a live bootleg recording of them playing \\"Have A Cigar,\\" from one of the 1970's tours, and \\"What Do You Want From Me\\" sounds a lot like this; in fact, at first, I mistook one for the other. I thought it was an early version, until the singing started. But, there's nothing that says a band can't borrow from itself. You hear elements from \\"Us And Them,\\" with a garnish of \\"Comfortably Numb\\" in \\"Marooned,\\" but this selection is reworked into a new piece that succeeds on its own terms. \\"Lost For Words\\" sounds like something that could have been included on \\"Obscured By Clouds,\\" but the lyric content tells of Gilmour's troubles with Roger Waters and Waters' attutide toward the rest of the band. The sound of a boxing match in the background during the instrumental break, tells this story better than the lyrics do, though. They were polite to one another on the surface, but there was a real battle going on underneath. And it got downright ugly.<br /><br />In all, though, this is the logical direction such a band as Pink Floyd would go, looking at everything they have done. People complain that it isn't the same outfit that made \\"Dark Side,\\" \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" \\"Animals,\\" and so forth, but the Floyd of those days, wasn't the same as the Floyd that did \\"The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn,\\" either. Yes, missing is the input of Waters, one of the best lyricists ever, with a bass sound all his own, but they recovered early on from the loss of Syd Barrett, and they even continued at the end of the 70's for a few years into the 80's without Rick Wright, as well. OK, Wright returned in time to finish \\"A Momentary Lapse Of Reason,\\" but a band that lasts this long, is bound to change.<br /><br />They're not the same, but we aren't, either.r.

006056251X|3.0|:SPOILERS BELOW: <br /> <br />I'm up there with the \\"I usually adore Kleypas, but this one didn't do it for me\\" crowd.  A few things that bugged me: <br /> <br />I hate the stepback.  The painting is of a couple embracing on a bench, surrounded by snow.  In the background you see a pretty house and a frozen lake.  The woman (who is WAY too old to portray Evie) isn't wearing any shoes.  The man is shirtless under his cloak.  Hello!  There's snow on the ground.  Aren't you guys cold?  Not to mention there is no encounter within the book that takes place outside.  No encounters in the snow.  No encounters by a lake.  No mention of a lake.  No pretty houses by the lake.  The stepback really doesn't portray the characters or any event in the book at all. <br /> <br />Evie loses her stammer way too easily.  I presume she has always stammered, but in the presence of one of the most dangerous and scandalous rakes in London, she's suddenly so comfortable and secure she doesn't stutter? <br /> <br />Aside from the romance, there are two other plots to the story.  The first involves Evie's uncles who are trying to force her into a marriage to get her money and when that fails they try to kidnap her.  The second involves her (unknown to her) half-sibling who tries to kill her for lackluster reasons.  Neither storyline captures the attention and I found myself wishing she had stuck to either one problem or the other, but not both. <br /> <br />Most of this book takes place inside a gaming club which smacks of the same setting as one of Kleypas' earlier book.  It was written slightly differently of course, but was still so familiar as to be unenjoyable. <br /> <br />The last thing (that truly got on my ever last nerve) was the secondary character by the name of Cam.  He's described as a 25 year old gorgeous half-Gypsy.  To my dismay and confusion though, Kleypas alternates between referring to him as a man and a boy, sometimes within the same paragraph.  Obviously at the age of 25, he's well past the \\"boy\\" stage.  That little detail kept bringing me out of the book time and again.  (The character in and of itself was one of the best parts of the book, and I dearly hope he gets his own story in the near future.) <br /> <br />All in all I rated this book a three because while it has it's problems, it's still a decent read.
0060574216|3.0|It's good to read it just for basics, but it doesn't give you anything specific. The book is too broad, but some women I have talked to they liked it.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|This is one of the best Robin Hood movies ever done.  The swordfighting is realistic and there is lots of action, some romance, and a little bit of comedy.  I have been shooting a recurve bow for 15 years and fencing for 10 years, so I feel safe saying that the action scenes are true swordfighting tactics, not some rehearsed sword banging to dazzle the audience.  The DVD also has a couple of Disney cartoons and a documentary trip that Errol Flynn made with his father.  There is also a small film done by the Master Archer \\"Errol's double\\" that shows some incredible shots with a bow arrow.<br /><br />  I highly recommend this movie.  Unfortunately they don't make \\"future\\" classics like this nowdays.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|This album is amazing in the truest sense of the word. The first time I heard it, as soon as the thunderous chords of 'Apocalypse Please' took hold, I knew this was going to be special. A band with the balls and intelligence to mix classical with crunching vocals and guitars - it's a welcome antidote to the legions of pop-punk and all-guitar-no-brains out there. The bass work by Wostenholme is fantastic as well, a huge factor in the band's success.
B00006RCNJ|5.0|This DVD, like all Andre Rieu productions, is first class, and full of beautiful music.  Unlike other DVDs of his, the audience is more reserved, but no less appreciative of the talent of his musicians. The selections are wonderful favorites that we all yearn to hear performed by masters.  This DVD will never be put on the back shelf and forgotten!
B00001OH7T|2.0|One thing David Bowie has certainly never been afraid of is change.  And change he certainly did on 1974's \\"Young Americans\\".  During the tour supporting \\"Diamond Dogs\\", Bowie developed a fascination with Philadelphia soul and restructured himself in this regard. <br /> <br />To be quite honest, this isn't my thing, the arrangements tend to be overproduced, overly slick, and soaked in smooth jazz sax (courtesy of David Sanborn) and soul backing vocals (including a young Luther Vandross).  It also doesn't help that at least a couple of the pieces (\\"Somebody Up There Loves Me\\", \\"Fascination\\") are fairly weak compositions, but even the stronger ones sound like they'd be a lot better with just Bowie and an acoustic guitar then their washed out arrangements (\\"win\\", the cover of the Beatles' \\"Across the Universe\\"). <br /> <br />Admittedly, it's not unlistenable-- it's just a bit on the dull side, and while a couple pieces manage to rise above the rest of the album (the title track and \\"Fame\\"), even these are a stretch to be compared to Bowie's better work.  It's not a horrible album, but it's pretty far from Bowie's best.  One thing I will note-- now and again you find someone who just loves this record, but it's not me.

B000000OU6|3.0|When I bought this album, expectations were low to say the least after reading some unflattering comments about 'bargain-bin stuff'. However, this CD is good and very enjoyable. What detracts from it is the vocal work. Eric Dover is a screamer who makes Axl Rose sound delicate. What really mars the CD IMO is the endless repetition of choruses. At least half of the vocals could have been cleared to make room for the real thing - Slash, that's why you bought it, isn't it? Unfortunately, there are only a few solos where I was hoping for more, but there are still some excellent moments, particularly 'Neither can I' and 'Beggars and Hangers-on', which would have been one of the better tracks on Appetite for Destruction.
B00005JO04|3.0|\\"Complicated\\" and \\"Talky\\" are the words you are most likely to hear about `Syriana.' And don't forget this, `Political.' Right, the film is all of them, but probably the most impressive part of it is that though it is very confusing with the fragmentary stories and lots of characters, the film is not boring. The results are surely admirable, especially as political thriller, in spite of some unanswered questions and the loose ends in the story, and the film's dubious (but provocative) answers to the volatile political relations between US and the Middle East that is ironically implied in the word Syriana. <br /> <br />There are several threads of the stories going on simultaneously, and none of them explain much about the situation or backgrounds of the characters. There is a veteran CIA agent whose assignment is to assassinate the Prince of one fictional Emir. In this idealistic Prince, one American energy analyst finds future of the country. In the meanwhile, two oil companies confirm a merger agreement. And there are the unemployed young males and the Muslin extremists. <br /> <br />Watch carefully, and you know the film's method works, if not perfectly. Each story is told bit by bit, one small episode or chatting after another, with very skillful editing and atmospheric photography, leading up to the conclusion, which is not a big secret. Those `bits' of the story which in themselves are not particularly original are still greatly helped by the first-rate cast and their effective performances. Though only George Clooney is mentioned in the Oscar race, his acting is just one of the excellent works of other talented actors.  <br /> <br />Some say `Syriana' is an eye opener. Maybe so. But those who are already interested in the Middle East and the politics there will find the film's content sound like twice-told tales. And the film's use of torture, missile, car bomb, or whatever those characters are doing in the film can also be found in Tom Clancy novels. `Syriana' is an intriguing version of powerfully-told conspiracy theory, but the conspiracy itself is no news at all.
0790730960|4.0|This movie will go down as one of the best all time movies that is based on a comic book.  It followed in the footsteps of the first one that, were the director, Tim Burton, choose actors that were perfect choices to play the character they resembled.  Danny Devito, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Christopher Walken all turned in strong performances and were perfect choices for the role.  As far as Danny Devito, the only other person that was more perfect for his role, in my opinion, was Jack Nicholson as the Joker.  The darkness of the first movie was still there and the sets were just as elaborate as they were in the first one.  Michael Keaton turned in another outstanding performance, but in my opinion this movie was not as strong as the first.
6305922756|5.0|The first film of Rob Reiner is one the best comedies of all time. It's a false musical documental. The actors are amazing, the artistic direction is great, and the songs are very funny & greats too. <br />Is one the best ideas for make a splendit film.

0671646788|5.0|This book is a classic just like Napoleon Hill's Think and Grow Rich.  The idea is basic and simple; you have to think and believe in yourself to be succesful.  It does not matter what degrees you have if you are not going to think about how to overcome your problems be it social, economical or whatever problem, you must take action. As stated in this book action cures fear. So, If you fear something then do something, and the fear is gone...!
B00005LC1H|5.0|This set is so funny you will split your sides laughing. I wish there were more episodes.
0790729652|5.0|This movie is, in my opinion, one the best comic book movie adaptions of all time, right up there with \\"Superman I&II\\"!  Michael Keaton as Batman and Jack Nicholson as The Joker were perfect choices for their roles.  Robert Wuhl brought a since of comedy to the movie that was refreshing, and Kim Bassinger, as usual, was gorgeous in her performance as reporter Vicki Vale.  The scenary, and overall style of the movie was outstanding, and there was a darkness brought to the movie that was lacking in previous Batman projects.  The Batmobile looked sleek and powerful, and the Batcave was resembled perfectly.  This movie also had lines that people will remeber for a long time such as \\"Where does he get those wonderful toys?\\" and \\"You ever danced with the Devil by the pale moonlight?\\" and \\"Wait till they get a load of me!\\"!  Overall, this movie, if anyone is a Batman fan such as myself, will love this movie!
B000BVQ9JO|1.0|Their first 2 CD rock, but what happened here?  I think all their creative energy must be used up, because these are all forgettable, throw-away songs.  The CD insert is more interesting than the music (and how lame is that?!)!
0071373586|5.0|If your product (brand) is not in your customer's mind, you simply will be forgotten with all the other unknown brand in the market. So, you have to make the customer remember your brand whenever he is looking for product within your industry.  Simply put, if you think sports probably the first brand that comes to your mind is Nike, and if you think soda is simply Coca Cola.  These brands have developed a  position in your mind that nobody can remove and you will always have that brand as first choice when thinking about buying a product from their industry.  Positioning is valid now and ever.
B00097DX3U|5.0|This is a solid album from what is turning out to be one of the best bands of the new millenium. I love their sound and it has a tendency of getting me excited. Some highlights for me are \\"Be Yourself\\", \\"Out of Exile\\", \\"Doesn't Remind Me\\", \\"The Curse\\", and \\"Man or Animal.\\" This is true rock music for the 21st century.
B00005JOFO|5.0|\\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is not a movie that offers scenes after scenes of exciting action or those lame, comic situations to give instant gratification. It is made not to entertain, but because it is \\"a story that has to be told\\". It doesn't line up with the usual box office hits, so I'm quite surprised that it has been as well received by the general public apart from the film critics. To do Ang Lee's films justice, one needs to sit back and remain focused on the screen. It requires more work and patience than most movies.       Following the typical Ang Lee approach, \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is an extended film that begins with a languid pace, tracking the relationship between Ennis and Jack that spans twenty years. It refrains from hammering a message into the viewers' head, but allows the story to unfold and speak for itself. Silently, the film reaches out and seeps under your skin, and before you know it, \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" has found the rawest part of your heart and pierce right through it.          \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is a heartbreaking love story made more tragic by the extra dimension of homosexuality. While other star-crossed lovers like Romeo and Juliet have to struggle with external pressures of filial loyalties and social boundaries, Ennis has been taught to hate the very core of his own identity. His self-loath has petrified his ability to love. His self-deceiving denial of his true feelings causes him to lash out in bouts of violence. Gradually, Ennis alienates the people who care for him and pushes himself towards the edge.    More tragically, there is a chance that Ennis and Jack could've spend their lives together in happiness, although it would mean severing their ties with the world. But Ennis is too afraid of society and of himself to seize it. Only when he has lost Jack does Ennis realize how much their relationship means to him, and that he would've risked it all to build a life with Jack. But by that time, it is too late.     Most of us can recall those ineffaceable regrets we now have from choosing the easier path, the \\"what ifs\\" that come back to haunt us during a sleepless night.      But Brokeback Mountain also offers hope and redemption in the finals scenes. The now-famous blood-stained shirts worked together as one is a powerful symbol of their love that cannot be denied. Jack's mother, who invites Ennis to visit Jack's room and discover the shirts, shows that she has known about their relationship and chooses to accept them despite the hateful hostility of her husband.     Finally, we witness the evolution of Ennis, who is empowered to slowly reach out to those who love him. Though he initially tries to bail out of his daughter's wedding, he steers himself in the opposite direction and accepts her invitation even if he has to quit his job. The very last moments of the film, which I'll not reveal here, is simply genius.            I encourage viewers to see the movie at least twice. One can better appreciate the many nuances and acting after you know how the story develops. For those who are willing to open themselves to \\"Brokeback Mountain\\", it will tell you a beautiful love story that lingers with you as you leave the cinema. Perhaps it will inspire you to reconnect with your own heart and soul and become better people.

034544678X|5.0|About 9 months ago we got a very headstrong puppy.  She's turning into a very nice dog, thank you, but it's been a hard road.  I wish I'd read this book before we got her.  There are a few things I'll do differently from now on, knowing what I've learned about dog behavior versus human behavior and how that applies to common wisdom about training dogs. <br /> <br />Dr. McConnell tells us all about why we do the things we do:  use language to communicate, use repeated sounds (think of a chimp's oo-oo-oo when he's excited), use our hands, and how these traits don't always help when communicating with our canine companions.  She cites the science when appropriate, in a very approachable way, and gives utterly practical suggestions for having a closer and happier relationship with your furry best friend.  It's not a training book, but is an excellent companion to training books, showing us the science behind the art.  Our dog has already benefitted from what we've learned! <br /> <br />She does all this with great humor, often self-deprecating, and in a very understandable style for the lay reader.  She tells stories of shrieking at her herding dogs, when, as a PhD Applied Animal Behaviorist, she should know better.  But all those credentials also give her great credibility when she writes.  She also has a comprehensive reference section at the back with books and articles for further reading. <br /> <br />If you have a dog or even just like dogs, this is a must-read!
0385486804|5.0|What a compelling story Krakauer tells.  The subject is young Chris McCandless (aka Alex), who inexplicably wanders off into the Alaska wilderness, eschewing money, company, and most basic creature comforts.  Months later his body is found at his camp, not ten miles or so from safety.  Krakauer is obviously intrigued with this story (as are we all, no doubt), and sets off on a journey to explore the inner workings of this young man's mind, and to possibly explain the bizarre circumstances surrounding his disappearance and early death.  This book is that rare find:  too short.  The reader is left hungry for more, although that is not to say that Krakauer sells the reader short, for nothing could be further from the truth.  Krakauer is an interesting and believable story-teller, and he has the ability to elevate the mundane to a level of significance worthy of being called \\"art.\\"  In my opinion, Jon Krakauer is one of the most underrated writers of our time.
B000001Y5D|5.0|I just heard the song \\"What's Up!!\\" on the radio. I had to have it therefore I went directly to Amazon and found the Album. I loved it. All the songs were great and it's a shame that they are no longer together. I listen to this album everyday at work and never get tired of it.
B0006399FS|4.0|Wow!! I can't believe the U2 bashing in some of the reviews. I guess success and talent breed jealousy and anger in some people. HTDAAB is a strong album. The first three songs- \\"Vertigo, \\"Miracle Drug\\" and \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own\\"- are worth the price of the cd by themselves. Writing great songs with memorable melodies is not easy. U2 have been doing it for over twenty years! While the new album doesn't break new ground like some of their others (The Unforgettable Fire, Achtung Baby etc.) it does deliver what most U2 fans want: Bono's soaring vocals, Edge's angular guitar work and the reliable rhythm section of Clayton and Mullins Jr. If you've ever been fortunate enough to see U2 live and experience the spiritual connection one feels with the band and other fans during the moving hymn \\"40\\" you'll realize how irrelevant those one star reviews are.
B00006LWSF|4.0|Somehow Eminem managed to get not only artists from the Shady/Aftermath label, but also well respected veterans like Gangstarr, Rakim (who was actually on the label at the time), Nas & Jay-Z to make this quality soundtrack to the 8 mile film.  Some excellent tracks include Eminem's Lose Yourself & 8 mile, Rakim's R.A.K.I.M, Battle by Gangstarr and some decent efforts by Xzibit & Obie Trice.  Nas appears to diss Jay-Z (again) on U Wanna Be Me, and Jay's own track is also pretty good.  D12's Rap Game is a surprisingly good effort from a group I don't generally like, to top it all off the album ends with Eminem's Rabbit Run, which I consider to be one of his best tracks ever.  No hook on this one, just spits some ill rhymes for over 3 minutes, and for my money this is the last great work he has done to date.<br /><br />Not a 5 star album because of a few weak tracks, I hate 50 Cent but Wanksta is an O.K effort by his standards, though we all know the term Wanksta could easily apply to him, Places To Go is pretty wack.  Why is Macy Gray on here? Predictably her song is awful as is the other R&B track Wasting My time.  There is however enough good material here to highly recommend it, one of the better soundtracks i've ever heard and much better than Eminem's Encore & Eminem Show, pick it up.
0670034711|3.0|First thing, it is not a travel memoir on the sense of the expression. After finishing the book, I wouldn't qualify it as a memoir about her travel across Italy, India and Indonesia. It is much more of a memoir about her own self-discovery.  <br /> <br />From time to time, I felt like she was describing italy and I could almost see myself in the same streets as she was..However, moments like this were rare..I wish she could have described about her experience living there with the same creativity and grace that she described her dialogues with her friends. <br /> <br />All in all, a good reading.

0739308742|4.0|I think the others have sufficiently reviewed the content of the book and while I agree that this book is a large departure from the main story lines that we have all been following, I do believe that it will all come together in the next installment.  Perhaps it is not as frustrating to me as I listen to these books in my car on my way to/from work.  For me, the rich details are welcome and a nice departure from other books that just speed through the details to get to the action. <br /> <br />The biggest complaint I have about the audio release of this book is that they changed the narrator.  The narrator for the first three books was Roy Dotrice and this book has John Lee doing the narration. <br /> <br />By the end of the book, I was finally acclimated to the new narrator, but after listening to Roy for over 100 hours, this was a big change.  John Lee speaks clearly, but too slowly for me.  He seems to draw out words so they end up grating on you until you want to turn it off.  If I had to listen to him say \\"fiercesomely strong cider\\" one more time .... <br /> <br />Like most stories, when they change narrators, names of characters and places change too.  I wish that publishers would force the voice actors/narrators to listen to previous titles in a series prior to recording the next volume.  It would make for a much more pleasant experience for the listener. <br /> <br />I am anxiously awaiting the next installment and crossing my fingers that they let Roy Dotrice do the narration again.
157270036X|5.0|The elusive, much-sought-after audio version of To Kill a Mockingbird has landed-at HarperCollins. The company will publish a new audio edition of Harper Lee's Pulitzer-Prize winning book in September under its Caedmon Audio imprint.  <br /> <br />To Kill a Mockingbird was previously available in audio format from Books on Tape and Recorded Books in the library and rental markets. In 1997 Audio Partners obtained the rights to sell the Books on Tape production, narrated by Roses Prichard, at retail, and that agreement ran through late 2002 when the license expired. <br /> <br />The forthcoming audio edition of Mockingbird will be recorded in late April by an Academy Award-winning actress (who does not want her name divulged prior to the title's release) and is planned for unabridged CD and cassette formats. <br /> <br />Lee's beloved novel is in familiar territory, as it was originally published by HC in 1960 and remains a strong seller for the company in hardcover, paperback and large print with over 30 million copies sold worldwide. (In addition to its many distinctions, the book was recently named, in a World Book Day poll conducted by Britain's Museum, Libraries and Archives Council, the number one book everyone should read before they die.)
B000ASDFJU|5.0|Even though I am still sour over the fact that this show is actually OVER, HBO finally gave the fans of Sex and the City an excellent package to remember the classic series.

0880796863|4.0|I bought the \\"original\\" deck because I've been using the \\"standard\\" US Games Rider Waite deck for nearly 20 years -- I learned about Tarot symbolism with this deck.  I thought it would be good to see the artist's original conception, but, apart from some color variation, there is no significant difference; in fact, the drawing and the color resolution on the US Games Rider Waite is actually better than on the \\"original.\\"  The stock in the \\"original\\" deck is also flimsier, and the cards are smaller.  I'm glad I bought this deck, though; from a collector's point of view, I think it's important to have it.  For readings, however, I will continue to use my old deck.  I also recently purchased the so-called \\"Thoth\\" deck, Alestair Crowley's contribution.  If you really want to understand Tarot in a new way -- if you want to see how someone who spent decades studying comparative religion and many different culture's occult traditions understood the cards -- this is the deck you should study.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|A one of a kind blend of slacker humor and kind-hearted whimsy, this movie sets some new standards for teenage and college aimed comedy.  It was a very sweet story about a geek  with \\"awesome bow-staff skills\\" who befriends two other marginalized highschoolers and tries to raise his friends positions in life.  He is of course hampered by his blood kin, in this case an even weirder older brother with strange luck at internet dating, and a self centered uncle who is still trying to live his high school years.  Support for our heroes comes from some unexpected sources, and there are some hilarious gags and schtick along the way.  No crudity, nudity, drugs, or profanity, and yet it still had me rolling.  If you liked the \\"Bill and Ted\\" films and/or \\"Aqua Teen Hunger Force\\" give this one a try.  Don't be misled by the, \\"Friggin idots!\\"

B00000IL29|5.0|First of all, be aware that this Herbie solo record features none other than his Miles Davis quintet bandmates on bass and drums - Ron Carter and Tony Williams respectively.  Anyone who loves the second great Miles quintet and their most prized recordings (MILES SMILES, E.S.P., SORCERER, and NEFERTITI,) should also appreciate MAIDEN VOYAGE.  Filling the soloist voids here are the prolific trumpet player, Freddie Hubbard, and George Coleman on tenor sax, the latter being an early favorite of Miles Davis during his years on Prestige.   <br /> <br />Fans of Miles will immediately recognize the track 'Little One' which also appears on Miles's E.S.P. album.  This, like all the tracks on MAIDEN VOYAGE, are Herbie Hancock originals.  Hancock is obviously calling the shots in this group, and his playing is downright scary at times.  Mr. Hancock sounds like he is controlling the tempo, almost like Thelonius Monk, while at other moments, he sounds closer to a nice mix between Bill Evans and McCoy Tyner. <br /> <br />The title track on this album would almost immediately become a major standard of the time, along with the less popular 'Eye of the Hurricane' and 'Survival of the Fittest' which I look at as being the most intense moments of this record.  On 'Eye of the Hurricane' Hancock is perfect at using his left and right hands to keep a hard swinging rhythm in tow, while presenting some of his most crisp and clear soloing as well. This rhythm section will never cease to amaze me, and because of this, one of my planned future endeavors is to explore the entire Tony Williams catalogue.  He was only in his early 20's at the time of this recording and he is possibly the most grossly overlooked drummer of his time.   <br /> <br />'Survival of the Fittest' is the most progressive and experimental track, with the song divided up into what I see as distinct blocks.  The songs begins with an almost free-jazz feel, and Hancock even begins to sound like Cecil Taylor.  Just seconds later, the quintet builds a groove and then Ron Carter follows suit.  Carter helps keep the flow going through most of the song while the other guys appear to be improvising 90% of the time, with some hard swinging solos from George Coleman as well.  Finishing up is the track 'Dolphin Dance' which is similar to 'Little One' - both are much slower paced, but lyrically, I'd say it is Freddie Hubbard's high point.  Hubbard obviously cannot replace Miles Davis, but who can?  I've heard too many jazz purists toss aside MAIDEN VOYAGE because they didn't like Hubbard. <br /> <br />Herbie Hancock released several amazing records on Blue Note during the 1960's, including MAIDEN VOAYGE, TAKIN' OFF, SPEAK LIKE A CHILD, and EMPYREAN ISLES.  Most casual jazz fans are more familiar with his later electric and funk work like HEADHUNTERS and THRUST, but I urge you to give his acoustic work a fair listen.  MAIDEN VOYAGE is a great place to start, and should be welcomed with open arms by fans of mid-60's Miles Davis.
0062502182|2.0|This book was about \\"following your dreams?\\" <br /> <br />I think the moral of the story is that \\"the grass isn't always greener on the other side.\\" <br /> <br />This book is written for someone in junior high school or the high school level... it's not meant for adults to read.  If you're in those teenage years, this is a worthwhile book for you (hence, the 2-star rating and not the 1-star rating). <br /> <br />For the adults out there, you can obtain just as much wisdom about life by watching an episode of The Justice League of America cartoon (heck, the cartoon probably provides more inspiration than this book). <br /> <br />If you're an adult and this book \\"inspires\\" you to reevaluate your view on life, you were probably never an \\"adult\\" to begin with (hence, only something as silly as this book would activate your brain cells).
B000E8QVWY|5.0|\\"Walk the Line\\" is the best musical bio-pic since Val Kilmer portrayed Jim Morrison in \\"The Doors.\\" Phoenix and Witherspoon were superb. The music was top-notch, edgy because they sang them imperfectly but well. Reece got that June Carter Cash twang just about right. Johnny Cash's music is pure Americana. To understand the heartland, one must immerse and learn from the sounds, the stories and the message of Cash's great songs. This film captured Cash's imperfect, sinful nature that always contrasted with his great love of Christ his Savior.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is a wonderfully written and acted series exploring a very human and approachable story.  It is set approximately 500 years in the future, with a very western feel.  The effects are very good, but it is the story and acting that pull you in.  There are no aliens, which is a big plus.  Everything is about human struggles, human relations, of a handful of people trying to make their way.  The technology is there, but it isn't over the top and isn't used to solve character's problems in a neat little package (e.g. Star Trek NG).  The stories and characters are captivating, and I find myself wishing for a great deal more of this series.  It is a fairly harsh universe they live in, so it can be a bit dark.  But, the blend of drama and humor is very well balanced, which is part of what makes this feel so natural.  I highly recommend this series, and the movie \\"Serenity\\" which is based upon this series, whether you are a fan of Scifi or not.
B000002I55|5.0|Do not brush this recording off as noisy and chaotic - I must reiterate what other reviewers have stated, which is that this music does have a fair amount of structure to it, and upon a few serious listens, it is easy to see how this style was built on with later free jazz releases, most notably Coltrane's work in the late 60's.  Jazz legends such as Miles Davis would constantly turn away from Ornette's music, but it is evident in his later recordings that he would borrow elements from Ornette even if he was too hot-headed to admit it himself.   <br /> <br />In 1961, Ornette assembled this double-quartet.  In the left speaker is a quartet featuring Ornette (alto sax), Don Cherry (trumpet), Scott LaFaro (bass), and Billy Higgins (drums).  In the right speaker, we have Eric Dolphy (bass clarinet), Freddie Hubbard (trumpet), Charlie Haden (bass), and Ed Blackwell (drums). Although the music is stretched out and abstract at times, there are brilliant harmonies and an obvious structure to it.  We are given a taste of mid-50's Ornette like SHAPE OF JAZZ TO COME but the majority of the music is a free improvisation that sounds like a party of horns, with duels between Coleman, Cherry, and Hubbard plus the occasional deep moans from Eric Dolphy.  The soloists on this record appear to have no boundaries set for themselves in their improvisation, and it sounds as if other musicians jump in and out in an almost comical manner.  It should also be noted that the only original track, 'Free Jazz' is almost 40 minutes long - which was quite an accomplishment considering the era in which it was recorded.   <br /> <br />The bonus track 'First Take' is the same song as 'Free Jazz,' evident by the familiar harmonies close to the beginning, however, I agree with the liner notes that it does not fully explore the depths that the title track does.    <br /> <br />I would not recommend this recording to someone who is totally new to jazz, but if you're checking out this album, you're probably an experienced listener.  I consider this release to be 'difficult' only in the context of those not familiar with free jazz.  Coleman was, and still is often misunderstood, but if you can open your mind, this record is an exceptional gateway to some other amazing music of the genre.

Very hard for a Porcupine Tree song. The lyrics are beautiful and introspective.  <br /> <br />5/5 <br />Trains: My favorite acoustic type rock song ever. The lyrics, vocal harmonies, and instrumentation are incredible...and that bridge in the middle of the song is the icing on the cake!  <br /> <br />5/5 <br />Lips of Ashes: Serves as a transition song between Trains and The Sound Of Muzak. A very chill song...excellent vocal harmonies once again, the lyrics are romantic and splendid as well. Very slow enjoyable song with a great atomsphere. A good slowdown from  Blackest Eyes/Trains. <br /> <br />5/5 <br />The Sound of Muzak: Really great song. The vocal harmonies on this song are incredible. The guitar riffs, drumming, and midtempo pace are other assets. One of the best songs on the album. <br /> <br />5/5 <br />Gravity Eyelids: Longest track on the album...a bit overlong. But the vocal harmonies are astonishing...the best on the album...very creative. The song goes from slow to fast and has very good lyrics. A grower. <br /> <br />5/5 <br />Wedding Nails: Great instrumental...period. Trumps .3 (later on the disc) completley. Very hard song. <br /> <br />(From here on out the album gets mixed) <br /> <br />5/5 <br />Prodigal: Album slows down from Wedding Nails with this one. A very good song. A bit boring at times but the chorus and ending are very good. Relaxing song. <br /> <br />2/5 <br />.3: OK song...but sounds more like filler. Some of it is ok...but overall its very boring. Skip this one everytime. <br /> <br />3/5 <br />The Creator Has a Mastertape: Weird song. The lyrics are dark and brooding...appropriate for the albums theme. The distorted vocals work for a while...get annoying half-way through the song. Instrumentation is quite good. Good song...not the best.  <br /> <br />5/5 <br />Heartattack in a Layby:  <br /> <br />Great song. A very sad/somber mood permeates throughout. Wilson's vocalwork on this song is extremley moving. The ending especially.  <br /> <br />2/5 <br />Strip the Soul: After the previous song this ones a letdown. Good instrumentation...terrible lyrics. Overrated by PT fans.  <br /> <br />5/5 <br />Collapse the Light into Earth: Great ending to the album. The 2nd best song on the album next to Trains. The pianowork, vocals, and lyrics are excellent. The ending is marvelous. Reminds me highly of any of Coldplay's ballads or Muse's \\"Ruled By Secrecy.\\"  <br /> <br />TOTAL: 52/60 = 87%  <br /> <br />****/***** <br /> <br />Almost a 'classic'

006107327X|5.0|Who best to write a book about this justifiably award-winning animated series than one of the series writer/producers--Paul Dini (who wrote one of my favorite episodes--\\"Heart of Ice\\")? And with graphic designer Chip Kidd involved, you have a book that looks great on the coffee table. The best word I can use to describe this book is \\"thorough.\\" It contains superlative art in full color, storyboards, character designs, in-house memos, licensed products, an episode guide from the animated series, plus great information on why the series was created, why the censors said no to certain aspects, as well as facts about the movies based on the series (SUBZERO, MASK OF THE PHANTASM). My only complaint is that the book isn't longer. But that's not the authors' fault. They put together such a great book, you'll want as much insight into the creation of this series as you can get (like a good DVD provides). And these guys deliver! This is a great \\"backstage\\" look for fans of the series.

B00008NRI8|4.0|I love this movie because both Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock are so quirky.  Together they have this strange but amusing chemistry that draws you in and makes you hope for their ultimate connection.  Most who like romantic comedies will like this movie however, if you're one that is on the fence when it comes to watching \\"hollywood love stories\\" then this movie is not your style.

0783230079|3.0|The love story between Downey and Shue is never beleivable which hurts the core of the movie. Everyone else is great and Downey is excellent in his physical comedy when the others take over his body. But the movie doesn't quite cut it.

1563898586|5.0|I've only recently started to recognize the great value of the graphic novel. Since I'm just beginning to get into the genre, I've particularly enjoyed Alan Moore's The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Even though I'm new to the graphic novel, I'm not at all new to the adventure novel. I'm quite familiar with the characters here. I've known Jekyll & Hyde and Nemo since elementary school, and Quartermain and Griffin I met in junior high. This was something I could get a handle on, and I loved it.    It's really brilliant how Moore develops these characters. His story, simply by using these older characters, is nostalgic, but the pleasure goes well beyond this. There's plenty psychological nuance here as Moore resurrects the classic figures and makes them new. Similarly, Moore's plot brilliantly recalls archetypal themes from adventure literature, even as he is again remaking them. It's a thrilling plot. The supplemental material at the end was wonderful as well.    Really, this was a fascinating read. I can't wait for the next installment of the series.
1563894696|5.0|Absolutely fantastic story, not even necessarily a huge Batman fan but this book is simply too good to be ignored. If you are a fan of Batman, comic books, literature, or simply amazing story writing or artwork I highly recommend this.
1400032717|4.0|I had heard so many good things about this novel that I had to read it sometime. It was a short novel, a quick read, and well worth the time.  <br /> <br />It's pretty clichd to say that literature is important largely because it gives the reader a brief glimpse into the reality of other people. This is one novel where that has to be restated though because THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT-TIME is precisely concerned with bridging the gap between the realities of those with autism and those who've never been exposed to it. The narrator, Christopher, is an autistic teenager who tells this story from his perspective. Really, the many wonderful things about the novel stem from this telling. The novel is mildly humorous, but the real strength is the compassion with which the story is told. Others have described the novel as heart-breaking, and it is. It is because there remains such distance between the characters in the novel that produces such strain. The reader is, of course, pulled into this world and is definitely moved by it.  <br /> <br />I also found myself wondering throughout the novel if there was almost an allegorical element to the story. Something about the vast distance between people in a liberalistic society. I would have put a little more thought into this though. <br /> <br />Really, there was a lot to the book. It is touching read, and it may definitely provoke thought. It's easy to see why it's become so popular.  <br />
1577314808|5.0|This book is so essential to the average person I cannot begin to accurately assess its value. If you read this with an open mind and take it for what it is, there's no way you cannot take something significant and meaning from it regardless where you come from in life.
0930289234|5.0|I have, admittedly, never been much into graphic novels. They sort of intrigued me when I first learned of their existence years ago, but I just didn't grow up in a place that made them available, and I never had enough money to develop a taste. But then, about a month ago, I happened upon Time's list of top hundred great novels from the last century, and I noticed Alan Moore's Watchmen on the list. It intrigued me that a graphic novel was on the list. So, I read it, and now, I think I'm hooked.<br /><br />I was really astounded by the high literary value of the work. Watchmen doesn't require that you come to the story with any particular familiarity of specific superheroes (which is perhaps another reason I'd never jumped into the genre). Only a concept of the superhero was needed, and that's, of course, something that I couldn't escape growing up with. That said, it does require that you read intelligently. Allusions to literary figures and philosophical ideas abound. Images reoccur and are developed throughout the book, both in the prose and in the pictures. The story is gripping; the characters are compelling. And I'm definitely going to have to launch myself into more of Alan Moore's work and further into the graphic novel genre.

B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I repeatedly went to watch P&P when it was released here in Australia, and I loved it! Everything was perfect even if they did change some things...which always happens when you take a story from a book to a movie. <br /> <br />The only complaint I have was that after watching the movie I heard a rumour that you guys in the USA got a alternate ending to us in Australia! And that you actually got to see Lizzie and Darcy kiss! Tell me this isn't true! Because if it is I cannot possibly understand why Joe Wright would cut off the story like that! <br /> <br />I would much rather see Darcy & Lizzie kiss or even hug at the end of the movie rather than see Donald Sutherland sitting in his study saying his stupid line, \\"If anyone comes looking for Mary or Kitty show them in....etc\\"  <br /> <br />I really hope that this isn't true cause otherwise, and I'm sure I speak for all Jane Austen fans in Australia, when I say that we feel completely and utterly robbed of a 'complete' and more 'satisfying' ending to a story that is so beloved! <br /> <br />I would love if someone would tell me whether you guys actually did recieve a different ending and if so...does this dvd version (US version)have the complete ending, kiss included? Because the Australia release doesn't! <br /> <br />
B000063Y8F|5.0|I have been in the kitchen for over forty years and I have tried a variety of garlic presses, but I've always reverted to just peeling and slicing with my chef knife. But the peeling process has grown tiresome lately, and the \\"no peel\\" feature of the Rosle garlic press impressed me. So I purchased this garlic press and I love it! It does what it says it does: it presses garlic cloves that haven't been peeled first. I snap off a clove, trim the ends, make one quick slice lengthwise down the center and then place it in the press. The press is quality made so the squeeze power is enough to press out the garlic; and then I can open the press to expose the interior for thorough cleaning. The press is nice enough looking to keep on my utensil hanger for all to see, and the hook on one handle makes it easy to place on the hanger rack. I have another Rosle utensil (can opener) so I was accustomed to the Rosle quality and I was not disappointed with this Rosle garlic press. I recommend it to all cooks who are tired of peeling garlic cloves.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|The movie drew me in, I was amazed. I was amazed at how ironically unpretentious it was, and I was impressed with the casting and direction. Excellent movie all around for all you romantics out there, and you know who you are.
B00000JFV9|4.0|Going by today's definition of \\"music\\"-anything goes,particularly  if it's loaded with 'mf'type language.Obviously,this was evidenced at the 2006 Oscars,which demonstrated how  badly Curtis Mayfield's 'Superfly' is missed;at least the lyrics are clean.And particularly, if the Oscars are going to be awarded to outright [junk],Mayfield should be awarded a posthumous Oscar for 'Superfly.'
B000AP04NI|1.0|<br /> <br />I've spoke with my uncle about this edition and I was surprised with is reaction!... Very diferent of the article send to you and published last November. <br /> <br />He confessed to me that this subject is really funny, now that he realised that it is much better to see this problem by the tragicomedy angle.  <br /> <br />After the shock of the first viewing of the 2nd disc of this pack, four months ago he wrote something, published in this section, and the question was put \\"in the name of dignity\\". What a fool he was, now that he had realised that Fox have done nothing till now, to offer a solution to the customers.  <br /> <br />And he told me also: - I've returned today to the 2nd disc and, I've discovered another error from the called \\"professionals\\" that had the responsabilty of this edition. The sound of the featurette THE MIRACLE OF TODD-AO is absolutely out of synchronization!!!!. It 's true. Those,like me, that have yet the pack, can verify that in the end of the referred featurette when the Harley motorcycle appears filmed by a car running at is right side, the respective sound is listened around 2 seconds earlier. The same problem that, affects all featurette, is very noticiable in the final crash too.  <br /> <br />Last week he compared this version in DVD with the original 70mm copy that exists in the vaults of the portuguese CINEMATECA and there's no doubt; the original film is absolutely synchronized and this one is not. Funny is'n it?  <br /> <br />Shame on you, once more, 20th Century Fox.  <br /> <br />Eduardo Bastos  <br />OPORTO PORTUGAL <br />
B0002PUHF6|4.0|A movie like Stuart Gordon's \\"Re-Animator\\" is enough to make you rethink everything you ever thought about horror movies. How is it that such a puerile and disgusting film can be so much fun to watch? It's probably because it doesn't even attempt to take itself seriously. What we have is a zombie flick with generous hints of dark humor thrown in for good measure: a classic combination that could easily satisfy even the most devoted fans of Dario Argento or George A. Romero. And why shouldn't it? The satire in this film is beyond plentiful, not the least of which comes in the form of obscenely over the top gore effects. At one point, a length of intestine flies out of a headless body and wraps itself around actor Jeffery Combs. It was so gross that I wanted to turn away and so funny that I just couldn't bring myself to do it.     Loosely adapted from H.P. Lovecraft's short story \\"Herbert West--Reanimator,\\" this film proves that a well intentioned but implausible story idea can be turned into cinematic gold (splattered with blood and guts, of course). We meet Dan Cain (Bruce Abbott), a young medical student studying at the Miskatonic University Medical School in Arkham, Massachusetts. He's eager and determined, almost to the point of wasted effort (as seen when he tries to revive a woman terminally affected by cardiac arrest). He's also well respected by Dean Allan Halsey (Robert Sampson), whose daughter, Meg (Barbara Crampton) is in love with Cain.     His world is turned upside down when he meets Herbert West (Jeffery Combs), a student of an odd and brooding sort, always seeming detached when engaged in conversation. When asked what his field of study was, he replies simply, \\"Death.\\" This doesn't sound too many alarms ... that is, until he meets Dr. Carl Hill (David Gale, introduced to the audience as he's using a laser to lobotomize a cadaver). Right away the two become bitter rivals over theories of postmortem brain function and controlling the will of the brainstem. This brings out the worst in Hill, not only igniting vindictiveness, but obsession, as well; let's just say that his fascination with Meg may be a little deeper than initially suspected.    Things continue to go downhill when West rents out a room in Cain's new home. Cain and Meg are clearly bothered by West's reclusive behavior, and it reaches a crescendo when they discover the body of Cain's beloved cat, Rufus, lying in West's mini refrigerator. They also discover a medicine bottle containing a phosphorescent green liquid, a volatile concoction later revealed to be a biological reagent. Basically, West has created a serum capable of bringing the dead back to life.    Isn't this just the kind of plot that goes perfectly with a blatantly twisted horror/comedy? I certainly think it is, and it reveals itself not a moment too soon. That's because things start to get ugly, and they only get uglier when West and Cain sneak into the morgue and attempt to re-animate a relatively fresh cadaver. What happens is a gruesome sight to behold, and while the scene plays itself as a serious moment, the bold, blood soaked sequence of events is so accentuated that you just know the director is having the time of his life behind the camera. I guess that's the correct mindset; how can excessive gore NOT be fun (and I'm not being sarcastic when I say that)? It seemed as if everyone in this film gets drenched in a sticky mess of stage blood at one point or another; I was surprised the celluloid itself wasn't tinted a bright shade of red. The manufacturers of that stuff must have gotten rich off of this one.     But the incident in the morgue is only the first in a series of ill-fated attempts, and it culminates in a scene with an entire group of re-animated corpses wreaking havoc. It plays out like an overcharged movie projector: the action quick and random, their movements chaotic and sloppy. But I could tell that this was done on purpose, because \\"Re-Animator\\" was meant to be a campy experience. The actors seemed to have had that in mind as they played their roles; only an intentionally created B movie could benefit from A level performances. You have to admit that for such a low-grade production, the acting is actually quite good. (It makes me wonder why such talent was often wasted on typecast roles in post-\\"Re-Animator\\" projects; has Jeffery Combs ever played someone who wasn't insane, evil, or disturbed?) If they had hired actors who were told to not bother with a specific performance style, to just play the scenes out normally, I think this would have been one lousy, uninspired film.       The satire doesn't end with the performances. We also have Richard Band's music, an admittedly not-so-subtle reinterpretation of Bernard Herman's \\"Psycho\\" score. If you can, hear that serious, psychologically based music in your head for just a moment. Now imagine that music being reused in a film that includes a living severed head trying to rape a bound, naked woman (if that isn't satirical enough, then I don't know what is). I've heard that Band originally wanted to include some kind of acknowledgement for Herman during the end credits, but was unable to due to budget constraints. I can certainly believe that money was an issue, considering there are virtually no special effects and very few sets (if I'm not mistaken, a lot of this was filmed in an actual hospital).    \\"Re-Animator\\" is the kind of film that doesn't revel in its goriness; it completely depends on it. It's probably not something that fans of the original Lovecraft story would appreciate, nor should they; the film version is so far removed from the source material that the title is practically the only thing establishing a connection. I think that, for maximum viewing pleasure, you just have to go with the flow--leave behind any notions of good taste or decent principles and immerse yourself in pure horror delight. Movies take on different meanings for different people, and it goes without saying (but I'll say it anyway) that this movie isn't for everyone. There is, after all, a reason it was originally released without a rating (although an expanded R rated version does exist; all of the extra scenes from it are included on this DVD).     I think that one of the film's TV spots said it best: \\"This is not an advertisement for a new movie. This is a warning!\\" The same can be said for this review; if you cringe at the sight of blood and if you can't see the humor in driving a bone saw through the torso of a destructive zombie, then steer clear of \\"Re-Animator.\\" But if you get a real kick out of this kind of filmmaking, see it the first chance you get. It's sick, it's excessive, and most importantly, it guarantees that willing participants will have a good time watching it.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|I am glad this is finally going to be on dvd.  This is one of <br />Audrey's finest roles and she is surrounded by Dames Edith Evans, <br />Peggy Ashcroft and in other roles such great character actresses <br />as Mildred Dunnock, Patrica Collinge and Beatrice Straight.  And <br />in probably her first movie, Colleen Dewhurst is seen as the <br />\\"Angel Gabriel\\".  Peter Finch gave maybe his best performance as <br />Dr. Fortunato.

6305897786|3.0|First off, you don't have to be a fan of Johnny Depp to like this film. However, you should be at least interested in historical mysteries, modern religious explorations or the occult. It will make the movie much more entertaining for you if you like those types of films. That may sound off-putting, but keep in mind that such films as the Indiana Jones series, The Da Vinci Code (best selling novel, movie isn't out yet) and National Treasure all fall into these categories. <br /> <br />Having said that, wow, what a great attempt this movie was. I'll explain why I say attempt in a moment. The acting is very good; the story is engaging and entertaining. I looked around the room while watching this movie with some friends and everyone was literally on the edge of their seats even though this really isn't an action film. Through mystery, suspense and intrigue the director is able to draw audiences into the world he has woven. Some of the clues followed and locations visited by the main character (Depp) are real and so for armchair historians there is an added feel of realism and interest. The ideas for this movie are excellent. <br /> <br />Now we get to where this is a great attempt but it falls short of being a truly great movie. Until about three fourths of the way through the film everything is going great, acting, directing, special effects, everything is good. Then it almost feels as if they ran out of funds. Special effects are the first to go which is excusable except that they had been so good earlier in the movie you expect it to continue. Then the last five minutes or so of the film is a huge let down. The acting goes to hell next (excuse the pun) with Depp being the only one that remains in character for the whole film, most of his support falls apart. The story takes a turn that I can only assume was meant to be a plot twist, but instead it broke the plot in half and it died. <br /> <br />Directing for the last few minutes of the film definitely broke down as well. I won't give away the story but it's very sad to see a film with so much potential die so horribly. The entire group I saw this with agreed that the movie was great until the last few minutes. <br /> <br />Worth a watch, but be ready for a disappointing ending.
0060254920|5.0|I recall an interview where Maurice Sendak was asked if he 'loved being around children'. He simply said, 'he loved being a child', and it certainly shows. I don't believe one has to necessarily adore being around children to write for them. Sendak's adventurous spirit and love of his childhood shows through in this classic tale of a fairly rambunctious boy who dreams he can travel to a wild, untamed world.

B0000931QA|5.0|Amazing, great, perfect. <br /> <br />There you have it in three words. <br /> <br />Wonderfully crafted, each song speaks on so many levels. Great muscianship, great lyrics and vocals, great mixing and sound quality. I really can't say enough about this album. If you like Queensryche at all, you'll adore this album. If you like Metal/Hardrock you should love this album. If you were a fan of any 80's or early 90's hard rock at all, this should at least be something you really like. <br /> <br />Sounds like some of the best Dream Theater or Def Lepard ever made.
B00018D44U|4.0|She is great and sweet. I still like the first CD better than the second. However, this last CD has new rhytms and tones I like. I do recommend it. It is very relaxing and pleasant to listen.
B00009L1UP|5.0|If you are just getting into Queensryche and don't already have this album it's probably a good bet for your next one to purchase. It's a great album, but it does have its weak spots. For one thing it seems a little preachy, for another it's the only album they've done that's this different. Queensryche really departs from their signature sound with several tracks on this album, some a little darker and other much, much lighter.<br /><br />Silent Lucidity is usually the first song by QR that people ever hear, it's one of the few that still get radio play. Don't expect all of their music to be that way though, in fact it's the only song by QR that sounds like that.<br /><br />The extra tracks on this version are worth a listen as well. I really enjoyed them as something a little different from one of my favorite bands.<br /><br />Overall a great album, but if you're a metal fan go with either Rage for Order or Operation: Mindcrime first.
B00000DG1R|5.0|I have to admit these guys are really good. It reminds me the good times of the 80s and still they sound great. It is an excellent compilation of Duran Duran's hits. Those who like the music of the 80s get to buy this CD.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|...David Gilmour is no longer the 27-year-old that recorded \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\".   He's actually aged - as have we all - 34 years since then.   Now 60 (or 61?), Gilmour has released \\"On An Island\\", a calm, introspective, relaxed collection of beautiful songs.   He does not feel - nor should anyone have to feel - that he has to repeat himself from 3+ decades ago in order for his creativity to have \\"value\\".   With \\"On An Island\\", David has created a \\"family album\\" of sorts, and shared it with us.   There are song-pictures of himself, his wife (whom he obviously adores), and his life.   Does it \\"rock\\"?  No.   Should it?   Not if he doesn't want it to.   Can David rock if he so wishes?   C'mon...!!   Is this album a gem?   Yes.   Thank you, David.
B00004UEDQ|3.0|A woman with a penchant for the bottle drives a limousine into the side of a house while intoxicated, and must serve 28 days in a rehabilitation center or go to jail. Her initial indifference to the place and her issue, land her into even more trouble, at which point, she must ultimately decide what she wants out of her own life.<br /><br />  A surprisingly emotional and funny picture, which despite its road-much-traveled feel, gives us enough interesting characters and a solid performance from Bullock, to qualify as a solid feel-good dramedy. I don't recommend you see this film if you're expecting to learn something new about the process of rehabilitation, drug or alcohol addiction or the relationships of an addict. But if you don't mind revisiting some of these tendered themes once more in a film which moves at a quick pace, delivers tit-for-tat moments of humor and drama, and ultimately gives you every single 12-step quote needed for anyone to conquer any addiction of life, then grab a couple of six-packs and check yourself into this moving picture. Of course, I've never been shy to admit my own enjoyment of \\"the beverage\\" every now and again, but thankfully my even bigger fixation on Internet porn, hasn't allowed either habit to take over my life completely. But enough about me. Harumph!<br /><br />Sandra Bullock really surprised me in this film. Sure, her character is still pretty cute, does and says cute things, and knows how to party (well, early on in the movie that is... : ), but this movie allowed Sandra to demonstrate a little more of her dramatic range, a talent which up until this film, had personally gone completely unnoticed by moi. Well by golly, she pulled it off something fierce with several decent scenes featuring a serious Sandra wallowing in her troubles that be. Of course, much like any other \\"institutionalized\\" movie, the rest of the characters in the film also needed to create a certain amount of interest, if only enough to pad the lead performances. The film delivers on that front as well. The stand-out in the area of humour was definitely the \\"german gay guy\\" aka Alan Tyduk, who had the crowd in stitches every time he uttered, or tried to utter, a word in this film. Dramatically, Azura Sky took the honors with a touching portrayal of a girl struggling to overcome her disabling disease, and the best hair, as usual, went to the great Viggo Mortensen. I suspect that most fans of Julia Roberts' ERIN BROCKOVICH (7/10) will enjoy this one as well, seeing as both films feature top-dog actresses at the top of their respective game, an interesting yet predictable story, and as per usual Hollywood style, a generally upbeat ending. Of course, this film also has a lot more humor going for it, but I suppose that's offset by the film's many serious moments as well.<br /><br />All in all, you don't have to be a drinker to appreciate this flick, but I suppose an affection for Sandy Bullock, an understanding of the subject at hand, and the capacity to embrace a familiar but entertaining theme, should make this one enjoyable for most anyone fitting that bill.

B000BHHVPO|5.0|Any genre you would be interested is in here. Some performers sound great live and having an audience of millions really puts an artist out there. I cannot say enough for this dvd package and how it is worth the money. My initial pull was just for the Pink Floyd reunion and a few artists, but there is so much more to hear and see. I have since shared it with my dad and siblings. It's addicting, trust me!<br /><br />Besides all that, watching these concerts is also being a part of history. I like that my son watches them too. It keeps him interested.
B000301YY8|5.0|One of the best new artists I've heard in a long time. His music is mesmerizing! Each time I listen to it, I like it more. Yeah, it's kinda sappy; full of angst over a lost love... But if that's what gets his creativity going, more power to him. And it's NOT the musical equivalent of a chick flick as one of the other reviewers states. Every guy I know who has heard this album likes it too. I look forward to his next album. He's got a hugh fan in me.
B00006J3WH|5.0|If you're buying this CD because you can't get these songs out of your head, and you're wearing a whole in your Season 6 disc 2, you will be very happy.  This CD hasn't left my player since it's arrival over a month ago.  Yay for Joss Wheadon!
B000BYA4JM|2.0|Ok, let me just start by saying that I am one of Madonna's most rabid fans...loved her in Evita, Dangerous Game (any of you seen that one?),Desperately Seeking Susan, and A League Of Their Own.  The problem with this movie is not her acting, which is better than usual, but Madonna herself...she's as irritating as she has ever been with this shrill performance--channeling Judy Holiday on a really bad day--it's no Holiday and nothing to celebrate.  The only reason I gave it two stars is because the writing is smart; Madonna single-handedly ruined what could have been great.
1400032717|4.0|Writing from the point of view of an autistic 15-year-old named Christopher, Mark Haddon introduces the read to the chaotic world of autism.  In the Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time, we see what it is like to live a life with no filters  to eliminate or order the millions of pieces of information that come to us everyday.  As the reader, you will experience Christopher's ups and downs and his trials and successes.  This book broadens the readers perspective while allowing them to gain knowledge. <br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for something different.  It is very humorous yet somewhat heartbreaking.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|Put the CD in, and your heart starts to skip a beat or two because you hear what sounds like a Pink Floyd album starting to play. Haunting sounds swirl around weaving in an out. Is this Echoes? Is this Momentary Lapse? Is this Division Bell?  <br /> <br />Your heart races when the title track begins. \\"Oh man this sounds like Floyd!\\" <br /> <br />But that's where it ends for the Floyd fan-boys...This is a David Gilmour album. Be happy. This album celebrates a guy that's so comfortable in his skin, that you just have to close your eyes and smile as the rest of the CD plays. Go out and get it. Play it a few times, and then ask yourself if it's not a good thing to own.
B0000025D0|4.0|For the beginning Springsteen fan, I'd recommend \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" - it has the hits and strong pop melodies that made him so famous, along with the political anthem that cemented him as a slice of pure Americana.  If you want something a little deeper; if you really want to know what makes Springsteen tick, pick this album up.  It's dark, angry, and moody - a truly beautiful piece of emotional imagery.  \\"Adam Raised a Cain\\" is one of the angriest songs I've heard in awhile - its dark energy could do battle with the most passionate of metal songs.  No, I'm not kidding.  This is Springsteen at his angriest.  But that's not to say there's no hope in this work - there's quite a bit of it, actually, even if he doesn't know where to place it at times.  \\"Racing in the Street\\" is mournful and sad; \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\" is sadly hopeful, but with the opening track \\"Badlands\\" Springsteen shows that not all hope is ever lost.  If you want something beyond pop that you can sink your teeth into, gnashing and biting away, this is for you.

0684824906|5.0|Very well written, and her observations are very well documented.  The only book I've seen with as much documentation is \\"Ultimate Sacrifice,\\" which is also the only book I've ever read with more footnotes (and printed even smaller than in \\"Team of Rivals\\").  But don't let lots of small footnotes stop you from reading this excellent book.
1577311523|4.0|As a spiritual author myself, I constantly remind my readers to stay present, because when we are reflecting on the past or projecting into the future, we miss the divine guidance that comes our way in the here and now moment. Eckhart Tolle's book really delves into the power of present-moment awareness, and demonstrates in a very profound manner how much happier and fulfilled we can be when we choose to live in the now.<br /><br />Steven Lane Taylor, author of Row, Row, Row Your Boat: A Guide for Living Life in the Divine Flow
B000A0GXGA|5.0|When I was a kid, I'd watch TV at night with my Dad.  Maverick was my favorite.  Today my Dad's gone and so are my sons.  I had believed Maverick was also only a memory.  I'm glad to have my old friend Bret Maverick back and I look forward to resurrection day when my Dad and I can watch it together again.

0689865384|5.0|This book was a superfast exciting read with an important message.  The futuristic elements such as hoverboards add to the thrill of the book, while the self-loathing of adolescent appearance will ring familiar for many teens.   <br /> <br />I teach high school English and have given this to a bunch of students for outside reading, and they are eating it up.  It has a clear Orwellian message - ask questions of your government - in a fashion that the teenagers find interesting.  Heck, I'm 36 and read it in a night.  Now I'm reading Pretties.
B000301YY8|5.0|Back to Bedlam is filled with songs of intense emotional imagery. I suspect that most listeners will relate to experiences that Blunt so forecfully and painfully vocalizes. I'm looking forward to another CD from this new artist. As a side note, the unedited version contains only a few words that are cut out of the edited version. They add nothing to the cuts so I would suggest the edited version is the best choice for most.
0307276902|3.0|I read this before the hype about it being fiction and not a memoir as it was originally sold.  It was so obvious that he was blowing air out his *@.  I enjoyed the storyline, but he was insulting to people who need to use programs to help them get through.  He'd brag about how he did it all without the 12 Steps, how hard he'd hit rock bottom, etc., making himself seem cool all the while.   <br /> <br />Frey was unlikeable as a character in the book, and I personally didn't care if he died or not (as he kept saying would've happened if he kept up his behaviors). I don't have any history of drug use, but if I did, I'd probably be really angry at his lies.  <br /> <br />I think the reason it got good reviews is that it was so harsh in its style and people thought this was realism.  Well folks, it turns out to be just another BS story.
B000301YY8|5.0|James Blunt is one of, if not the best new artist this year.  His voice is haunting, and his message is even moreso and thats what makes him unique.  Serving as a British Solder and being stationed in Bosnia, songs like the heartbreaking 'NO BRAVERY' really hold true merit and bring images to your mind that you'll never forget.  Talk about bringing life experiance to the table, Blunt proves that he has something to say that, get this, is worth listening to.  With his first single 'YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL' he burst onto the scene.  I actually saw an interview with him and they showed a clip of the music video for this song and I was imediatly compelled to purchase his CD.  I had just descovered Damian Rice (one of the greatest singers out there) and hearing James Blunt brought a familiar feeling to me, a feeling I enjoy and so I rushed to own this CD.  'GOODBYE MY LOVER' is a tragic song of losing the one you love the most, and it actually made me tear up.  My wife and I were going through a rough patch and there was a moment (more than one actually) when I really thought our marriage was over...and I'm in no way saying that this song saved my marraige, but listening to this song made me realize how much I truly love my wife, especially the part where he says \\"I'd be the father of your child\\" because my wife and have been trying for a child for 2 years now, and hearing that made me realize that there is no other woman I would want to bare my children.  'GOODBYE MY LOVER' is the most amazing song I've ever hear and is the most painfully honest song lyrically I've ever listened to.  'WISEMEN' and 'SO LONG JIMMY', while different lyrically, have the same upbeat tempo, 'WISEMEN' being the better of the two.  I can't find filler here, for every song carries something worth an ear, songs like 'CRY' and 'BILLY' coming to mind, 'CRY' for it's tearful feel of comfort and 'BILLY' for it's throwback to the Beatles era style of rock which has been perfected by new bands like Jet.  Thisis one amazing album and should be a welcome addition to your music collection for its supreme musical style and it's brilliant and meaningful lyrical content.
B000AA305M|5.0|The music on this CD is reminiscent of his \\"Lost Songs\\" CD, which I think is the best of all. I think anyone who likes anything David Gray has done will really like this CD.
B000002H33|5.0|A lot of people don't realize that Master of Puppets is about drugs...... <br /> <br />Great CD. I just wanted to get it out.
B0000042HV|4.0|For many buyers the choice for a complete cycle of the Shostakovich quartets will come down to three: the Borodin, Emerson, and Fitzwilliam quartets. I own the latter two and can offer a comparison.<br /><br />Fitzwilliam: This set, made between 1975-77 in a church in Surrey, has the advantage of price. Although the 15 quartets are spread out over 6 CDs as compared to 5 for the Emersons, Decca offers this cycle at roughly half the cost of the DG cycle (it's much cheaper than that, even, on the used market). The performances eschew Russian soul, grit, and emotional extremes such as one hears from the Borodin Quartet. The Fitzwilliam Quartet sounds soulful but stops short of impassioned. As much as it is possible, they make this music friendly and easy to listen to without sacrificing all of its bite and sarcasm. They are not a virtuoso group (English critics actually praise them for this lack, as if the Emersons' technical mastery was a sign of glibness), so individual solo lines, of which there are many in these quartets, sound medium well played, not dazzling. Decca's sound as transferred to CD can be a bit shrill and congested but is certainly good enough. One large missing ingredient is tonal variation--the Fitzwilliam doesn't search out the peculiar tonalities that are implied in Shostakovich's string writing, which can be eerie, ghostly, brutal, and caustic by turns.<br /><br />Emerson: Recorded in Aspen at intervals between 1994 and 1999, these are live performances from the music festival and are thus not ideal sonically. What's most lacking is solidity and body. Even so, the recorded sound is considerably more detailed than in the Fitzwilliam set, or any other of the four I listened to.  When this cycle was first issued in 1999 it swept the field for good reason. The Emersons are head and shoulders above any other quartet for sheer virtuosity in this music. Not that virtuosity is required very often, but the many solo lines are rendered with exquisite technique, and the Emersons pay very close attention to changes in tonality. As a result, these performances are more varied and interesting to listen to than any competitor that I sampled (including the Fitzwilliam, Brodsky, Borodin, St. Petersburg, and Shostakovich quartets on various labels).<br /><br />The drawbacks are price (it's hard to find even a used set for under $70) and the prevalent accusation, from some quarters, that the Emersons lack Russian soul--they are supposedly too cool, detached, and efficient. Yet this charge can be turned around to say that the Emersons make Shostakovich sound more modern by removing a layer of sentiment. It's really up to the listener to decide, yet I found that cool detachment is not prevalent here--not by any means--and the reviewer below who thinks that the tempos are uniformly too fast is not aware of the field; the Emersons are not extreme in their allegros, at least not very often, and when they play a movement for virtuosic speed, it's almost alwaays to good effect.<br /><br />I bbught this set because I heard the Emersons play Shostakovich in concert on two occasions, and I was deeply struck by how much better these quartets sound when they are given superlative musicianship. I am not one to believe that Shostakovich was a great master of quartet writing compared to Bartok, Schoenberg, and Janacek among moderns. But he found an idiom, often spare and therefore one-dimenisonal, that is easy to absorb. The Emersons go a step further and give that spare idiom all kinds of shading and colors that often make it sound better than it is.<br /><br />In sum, I did what many collectors befoe me have done. I gave away the Fitzwilliam set, which was a good stop gap for many years, and relish the Emerson set as a great achievement, especially for a non-Russian ensemble.<br /><br />P.S. 20011 - The price of the Emerson set has come down considerably, so they are now competitive with other mid-price sets. Thee will always be listenerswho want a Russian ensemble's perspective, and the best of those groups include the Borodin as well as the Shostakovich Qt., if we are talking about modern sound. Although they never completed their cycle, the Hagen Qt. on DG offers probing and original performances of the works they did manage to record.he best of those groups include the Borodin as well as the Shostakovich Qt., if we are talking about modern sound.

B0006GAOBI|4.0|So here's the deal.  A lot of people don't get it, and want to<br /><br />know what there is to get.  Most people can't explain it, and<br /><br />to those people I say this: \\"Your retards.\\"  Better not to get<br /><br />it and say it sucked than to claim it was so excellent, so<br /><br />good, best movie ever, wow, and not be able to back it up one<br /><br />bit.  Others have said that the film is just another piece of<br /><br />psuedointellectualism for gothy kids.  Not so in my opinion.<br /><br />Gothy kids have been stealing art for awhile now, and they just<br /><br />fall right back into my previous comment: \\"Your retards.\\"<br /><br />Now to actually explain the movie.  The film is a depiction of<br /><br />life that resembles Kafka more closely than anything else.  Not<br /><br />Kafka's level of talent, but the same vein of thought.  Donnie<br /><br />is a teenager that causes lots of trouble for his family,<br /><br />willingly or not.  He is saved from obliteration by a man in a<br /><br />bunny suit, note: this is not real, this is the same kind of<br /><br />representation that Gregor went through in the Metamorphosis,<br /><br />and thus starts a chain reaction that will end the world.  But<br /><br />Donnie is given an option to save the world (a metaphor for his<br /><br />family and the girl he met recently, the most important parts<br /><br />of his life, therefore his world) by going back in time.  Dying<br /><br />essentially, much as Gregor had to die once the family moved on without him.<br /><br />In short, the movie is about the strained relations that exist<br /><br />between people, and how those relations can negatively impact<br /><br />others, and how sometimes, it is better to leave, represented<br /><br />in the movie by the ultimate leavetaking, death.

B000000OA6|5.0|The Queen album Innuendo brought to a close the career of in my opinion one of the most underrated british rock bands in rock history. They went out in grand fashion too, despite harsh critisism from alot of the press and declining popularity in the United States. This album in itself although never mentioned was a tribute to Freddie Mercury in so many ways. As late as 1987 he knew he had a death sentence with the A.I.D.S virus and yet he still carried on and it shows on both The Miracle and Innuendo. While The Miracle told the world no one was going to stop his party and he had to breakthru, Innuendo put all the skeptics to rest and picked up the pace as they went back to the basics of hard rocking tracks and power ballads. Queen sounds as good here on Innuendo as they ever had in the 70's and the songwriting is very crisp. Most of all Freddie was connected to his fans , and the tracks presented here were all a way of him showing his gratitude to them. Lyrically the tracks can sway your emotions every which way and you can instantly feel the tension with every verse. This album is definatly a must buy in my book. I discovered Queen when I was 11 when I heard The Show must go on and was instantly rivited. I am 25 now and I still havent been able to put this album down. So go buy this and see what I mean for yourself.
B00001SIES|5.0|Just getting my 5 stars on the record. I can't add anything to what most people here recognize as great music.
B0002XL35G|5.0|Paris, Texas. I've got a friend who lives on a boat near a little hamlet in Holland. It was a quiet summer day 14 years ago. He went away to get something small to eat. In the meantime the gently rocking boat made me sleepy so, why not, I took a little nap. I awoke with music of Ry Cooder. I hazily ask my friend what it was. This music, from the LP Paris, Texas, which filled the boat's space, was hitting the right spot. In that particular way that now, 14 years later, this music crossed my mind again. Somewhere in my head it was nagging that there was a film too. So I surfed on the internet. A few days later I saw the movie. <br /> <br />Now, about the movie: The mystic surroundings at the start of the movie is very promising. What strikes me the most is, aside of the music, the impressive photography. The story goes very slow but therein lays its power; resulting in very convincing acting work combined with comprehensive dialogues. A gentle tough of \\"Linchy\\" surrealism makes it more subtle and catches your attention the entire film. It proves that he has a firm knowledge of how to write a good story. The plot is a bit disappointing though. One longs a different end here in my opinion. But on the other hand; by leaving one at this particular point of view (I won't give any clues away) it transforms the picture to a well composed painting. This in combination with, as mentioned, the music makes this picture on of the most precious moments in your live. <br />

B000E1155O|5.0|The appearance of a completely unexpected treasure, such as this quietly stunning album, serves as a reminder of the hidden wonders in this world. Which is a good description of its tone, in fact. Listening to these songs draws one into a wistfully austere & pure landscape, where the melancholy of the gathering twilight meshes with the secret thoughts & musings of the day, as the soul now approaches sleep in resigned yet grateful stillness. It's amazing to think that such beauty was consigned to a closet for some thirty years! We can only be thankful that it's finally available to the rest of us. A collection of astonishing emotional honesty, both stark & rich, most highly recommended!
B000AGTPUU|5.0|I purchased this movie for my grand-daughter who loves it as much as I do.  It is such a magical movie and can be enjoyed by adults and children alike.
B00005JLIU|4.0|My wife and I had the pleasure of seeing Thoroughly Modern Millie and it was very entertaining to watch this 1920's era fun time.  It is based on the Broadway hit of the early 1960's and feautures that \\"All American Sweetheart\\"- Julie Andrews.  The movie is suitable for the entire family and we would reccommend it.  Travel back in time to a 1960's musical about the 1920's and have a fun time.
B000BEZQ0Y|4.0|When I saw the movie, I was immediately taken by the beauty of the music.  Whether gently sweeping or soaring, the music is a very vital part of the film while remaining in the background never overpowering or falsifying the emotions on the screen.  The amazing thing is how well the music stands on its own.  The piano playing of Jean-Yves Thibaudet is gorgeous.  To me, a good soundtrack is today's version of a Symphony, and this soundtrack is one of the best.
B0000C1733|5.0|What were they thinking on this one.  They arleady have a greatest hits collection from there early years.  Which they should of included songs from that era but instead they go the californication route on this one and have songs from 89 and up.  However, I'm not bashing this collection because it is a great disc and serves them justice for there new fans.  I was excited to see Soul to Squeeze as it doesn't appear on any chili peppers albums, but I was disappointed that Can't Stop wasn't on here and they could've easily taken off Universally Speaking which is not a favorite of mine, and they could've added a couple of live tunes as well, instead we get 2 decent B-Sides which I do like.  Hopefully they will learn from there mistakes and make a \\"The Very Best of the Red Hot Chili Peppers 1984-2006\\" or something along those lines and make this and What Hits collection obsolete!  O well at least Stadium Arcadium will be coming out in May and I will have forgotton about this disc and be listening to that album non-stop, and from the live songs I've already heard from it, it's going to sound great.

B00007AJF9|5.0|Where do I begin? <br /> <br />I visited Hatfield House in the UK and this is where Elizabeth spent her years of house arrest until the death of her sister, Mary. So I felt an affinity with 'The Virgin Queen' when this came out. <br /> <br />Cate Blanchett is outstanding as Elizabeth. The whole movie is superb in its depiction of Elizabethan times and medieval culture. <br />Christopher Eccleston, now better known as the Ninth Doctor Who gives a great performance as the Duke of Norfolk. <br />And how can you not love Geoffrey Rush's Walsingham? He steals the show. <br />Edward Burke has a minor role. Good to see him after Jeremy Brett's sad, sad demise. I still miss the duo in the Sherlock Holmes mysteries. <br /> <br />This is, quite simply a MUST SEE if you like a) history, b) GOOD movies or c) enjoy Cate, Christopher or Geoffrey Rush. I think I have worn out my DVD by now. Hands down, this is an EXCELLENT choice for any serious movie collector, lover of British stuff or good story-telling and good acting!
B0001HAISG|4.0|The new DVD, Peter Pan (directed by P.J. Hogan), is \\"a fun and fantastic tale\\" (Daily Herald) and \\"one of the finest films of the year!\\" (Daily Gazette) This DVD is chocked full of adventures, imagination and timely fun for a family of all ages. Instead of the animated version we are all a costume to, this film has actual actors, actresses and sets. In the very first motion picture, the characters are fun and entertaining, but in the newest release of this film (premiered in 2003), all of the characters have deep internal thoughts that are conveyed through their movement and in the tone of their lines. <br /> <br />A family of two sons: John Darling (Harry Newell) and Michael Darling (Freddie Popplewell), and the oldest, a daughter, Wendy Darling, who is played by Rachel Hurd-Wood. The casting in this film is something that everyone should enjoy. For example, Tink is played by a French actress by the name of Ludivine Sagnier. She has a whole assortment of fabulous expressions and body movements to actually become Peter's fairy. With the help of computer animation after filming, animators were able to give Ludivine actual fairy detailing such as wings and fairy dust.  <br /> <br />The storyline follows the classic setting of an English family living in the 1900's. Wendy is on the brink of becoming a young woman; but she holds onto her childhood by telling stories to her younger brothers. It is then that we are introduced to the main character, Peter Pan himself, played by Jeremy Sumpter. When Peter comes to hear Wendy's stories, his shadow gets loose in her room causing them to meet for the first time. After Peter and Wendy get to know each other, it is then that Peter decides to take Wendy and her two brothers back `home' with him to Neverland. Neverland is a place \\"[two] star[s] to the right and straight on `till morning.\\" To get to this place called Neverland, the children must learn to fly by thinking happy thoughts and by being sprinkled by fairy dust. Wendy soon discovers that Peter has no mother or father. When he was younger, he was determined to run away from his future. He went to Neverland because that is the only place where no one can grow older. <br /> <br />When in Neverland, Wendy realizes that she can no longer remember what her mother and father were like so she decides to take her brothers and go home before \\"they intern [forget]\\" (DVD) as well. Peter does not want Wendy and the boys to leave; he wants them to stay in Neverland so that they will not be pushed to grow up like back in London. Wendy knows in her heart that she must grow up because it is a part of life and it is what she is intended to do. Upon her return, she and her brother's are welcomed by their parents.  <br /> <br />Years later, Wendy is a grown woman with a child of her own. One night, Peter comes to her window and sees her knitting by the fire and does not recognize her. He goes over to the bed side and expects to find her the way she was many years ago. After Peter realizes she has grown up, he decides to take her daughter to Neverland so that she could experience the same adventures Wendy did.  <br /> <br />\\"The magical, the excitement, the wonder of the true Peter Pan comes to life for the first time in this spellbinding fantasy...brimming with spectacular special effects and non-stop action, this all-new adventure is sure to be a family film for years to come!\\" (DVD back cover) <br />  <br />(608 words) <br />
B00005JKOI|4.0|Pretty in Pink is one of those time capsule films that defined the era. Great acting by always solid Harry Dean Stanton provides an anchor, as does Annie Potts' 'Iona', for a surprisingly deep, mature past her years 'Andie', portrayed by Molly Ringwald. The film features a great cast that gives John Hughes funny, somewhat formulaic script life.  <br />Not only defining an era, the movie also defined the actors within it. How much of Jon Cryer's 'Ducky' shows up 20 years later in self-doubting, insecurity-ridden Alan Harper on 'Two and a Half Men'? James Spader's 'Steff' seems like a younger, immature version of 'Boston Legal's' Alan Shore.  <br />Great cameos from Gina Gershon and Andrew Dice Clay as well.  <br />Anyone between 30 and 40 should have this in their collection, no brainer.
B000E6UK5K|2.0|Been there, done that, done it better... <br /> <br />That should be the title for this album. At best, this can be described as background music. Just chill out and make mellow love with your woman to this.  <br /> <br />Typical Gilmour with his unique guitar sound on this. I love the way the man plays and sings. Unfortunately, there's nothing AT ALL memorable about this album.  <br /> <br />The funniest thing about this album is that the guitar on the track \\"Smile\\" sounds like something off of Roger Waters' \\"The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking.\\" <br /> <br />I am wondering what Gilmour was trying to do in putting out this album. Everything here is rehashed from Pink Floyd albums and there's nothing vaguely original about the album at all. Many of the tracks sound like instrumentals off \\"The Division Bell\\" and \\"Momentary Lapse of Reason.\\" <br /> <br />Unless you're the ultimate Pink Floyd \\"collector,\\" you can safely skip this.

Helps make some of the more arcane plot points understandable for people whose Jensons have been gathering dust for several years. Good quality images, a la Joseph Campbell's \\"The Myhtic Image.\\"
B0006399FS|1.0|Have you seen Dumb and Dumber when one of them makes the most annoying sound in the world?  I would rather hear that for an hour than listen to this CD again.  That's how much I hated it.  I had only heard the one song on the radio and thought it was awful, but then when the CD won all those awards I thought maybe the other songs would be different since that happens a lot. I WAS WRONG!  They were all bad.  PLEASE stay away from this CD if you can.

0553573403|4.0|Let me start by saying that I read a LOT of books, 90% of which are of the fantasy/sci fi variety.  I know what I like, and can usually tell within the first 10-20 pages how well I am going to like a particular book.  I read the first page and a half of Game of Thrones literally about 15 times.  I just could not seem to get in to it, no matter how many times I picked it up.  Finally, with a severe lack of anything better to do, I made myself keep going.  Wow.  After I got past the first chapter, I proceeded to read the rest of the series that is out (including A Feast For Crows) twice within about 3 months.<br /><br />The thing that kept me hooked was the way George RR Martin jumps from character to character, giving each a chapter here and there.  Admittedly, there were times when this could be frustrating, but so far, it has always been worth the wait, and I belive that this style of writing helped in creating solid characters that you can really love or utterly despise.  The storyline is compelling and entertaining, with only a very few dull moments.  What makes these books even more interesting is that Martin is not afraid to be dark.  I do really enjoy a happy ending, but Martin is an expert at taking things to a whole new level of bleakness.  Just when you think things can't possibly get any worse for a character, they do.  Much worse.  You keep reading, thinking \\"No, this can't be it, something will happen to avert this disaster.\\"  But I would say 9 times out of 10, crisis not averted.  Somehow, Martin makes it all work, and though horrible things may be happening (with perhaps a not too bad event worked in here or there) he makes it come together, and it really is a wonderful piece of work.  Bravo!
B00003CXAW|5.0|I bought this movie for my son and he loved it, I think is a timeless classic.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|I was born in the wrong era.  Not to be able to witness the might of the Floyd when they were at the pinnacle of music greatness is bad, especially when your favorite band is PF.  Gilmour's past solo records have been pretty disappointing.  It's pretty hard matching up to the Floyd sound.  But, as soon as I heard Gilmour was coming out with a new solo record, I immediately knew it was going to be great.  Maybe it was the fact that a few months before I saw the full lineup on stage at Live 8.  It still brings tears to my eyes.  But, Gilmour is the next best thing.   <br /> <br />\\"On An Island\\" could have been another Pink Floyd creation.  The sounds, the chords, the vocals, the ambience, and the lyrics all reminisce to the age of Gilmour, Waters, Wright, and Mason.  Just like every Floyd opener, \\"Castellorizon\\" is a fused overture of sounds and music.  However, this is one of the best openers I've ever heard.  It's second only to \\"Dark Side\\"'s \\"Speak to Me.\\"  The first noise heard reminds me of watching Spielberg's \\"War of the Worlds.\\"  The title track tricks me into thinking I am listening to \\"Meddle,\\" especially with Crosby and Nash singing back-up vocals.  \\"Take a Breath\\" is a great Wallesque rock song with David rockin' out.  \\"Red Sky At Night\\" could be described as the Reader's Digest condensed version of \\"Shine On.\\"  David's saxophone abilities are quite good, even though I wish Dick Perry could have graced his album with his presence.  \\"This Heaven\\" is very bluesy and is a change from the rest of the album.  The lyrics allude to Christianity and Jesus.  Very nice.  \\"Then I close My Eyes\\" is an instrumental, layered on with various instruments including cornet(played by Robert Wyatt), Weissenborn guitar, cello, a turkish instrument called a cumbus, and bass and glass harmonicas.  \\"A Pocketful of Stones\\" is an odd song with great orchestra and guitar.  Could it be that the lyrics have to do with a man about to stoned?  Hmmm... <br /> <br />All in all, \\"On An Island\\" is an A plus album with original guitar and orchestra.  I especially love the orchestra.  It really adds a nice touch as well as the many instruments.  However, it's Gilmour and his guitar that steal the show.  It's not about flying around the fretboard.  You have to make every note count.  Thanks David.
B00003JRCQ|4.0|I have read the book \\"Persuasion,\\" and also viewed two different English movie versions, made twenty-four years apart.  This version is my favorite, mainly because of the superb acting by the perfectly-chosen cast, as well as the gorgeous scenery. <br />     However, there are some aspects of this movie that left me a bit disappointed.  As much as I love Ciaran Hinds, he wasn't quite as \\"amiable\\" as the character in the book or earlier film.  Amanda Root is nice-looking, but too plain in my eye to attract the attention of Mr. Elliott, who didn't know who she was when he first saw her.  Some bits of storyline were altered or left out - most notably, when Mary chides Ann for not coming to her sooner, Ann says here that she \\"had much to do,\\" while the book and earlier movie point out that Mary had told her not to come yet, which reflects Mary's vascillating and selfish personality better; the Musgroves' dead brother/son, who served with Captain Wentworth, is non-existent in this movie. <br />     That said, this is still a great movie, one worth watching over and over.

For a moment, Pattrick seemed to be<br /><br />the luckiest man alive. Until he was betrayed by Eva. I still find it hard to believe.  For some reason, I think she'll reappear sometime in the future.<br /><br />As I read these reviews, I've come to realized that I'm not the only one who has a problem with the way the book ended.  Although, I wasn't necessarily looking for a happily ever after ending.  I find the end sad and disappointing.  And I'm still trying to figure out who that last female character that was introduced in the last couple of pages, who evantually led the Feds to Benny Aricia.<br /><br />For a moment, when I started reading this book, I thought it was the best book I've read by Grisham,until I got to the end.  And my mouth just droped.  And I was like, What was that?
B0007GAEGC|5.0|The CD is exactly like the Performance on the DVD and they are both excellant. The music is relaxing and then moving to your spirit. Some of the music sang by the four wonderful ladies is  classically Irish . The modern tunes are very nicely arranged and performed.  The special songs with instruments  of the Harp and Violin are wonderful. This CD is a great mix of Celtic music and some modern tunes. I own one for the car and the house.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|Sky Captain is a stylized, artistic, 40's-nostalgic, sci-fi film.  Enjoyable, but I can't imagine seeing it over and over.  The film is not colored, not black and white, but sort of a sepia wash.  I would have preferred it had it been in full color.  The backgrounds and sets are gorgeous, but look created and not realistic.<br /><br />The story is about a reporter who will do anything to get the story about a mad plot by a genius who is kidnapping scientists.  Sky Captain is a freelance crack pilot with his own airbase.  Giovanni Ribisi plays the standard gizmo genius Dex, who is kidnapped by the evil Toten Kamp's mysterious female Asian assassin (Bai Ling).  I LOVE her costume!!!!!!<br /><br />Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Angelina Jolie's performances are the main reason to see this film.
0060920432|5.0|Mihaly's academic treatment of \\"the zone\\" or the state of \\"Flow\\" is thorough, comprehensive, and clear.  This is not a \\"fun\\" read unless you like critical analysis of psychological processes, in which case, buckle up.  His approach is logical and linear as well as out of the box.  The book was an essential read for my work and gave great credence to my own study on being in the creative space, the zone.

B000E6UK5K|5.0|I've been waiting for this album since I heard that he was releasing it and going on tour.  While it doesn't compare favorably to his work with Pink Floyd, it is definately on par (or better) than his solo work.  The songs sound very Floydian, but they are definately his own. <br /> <br />I just wish he was doing more places on his tour.

B0000255CL|5.0|Few albums come along in ones life where the music leaves you so speechless. For me, this is one of them. This is not only Immortal's best work in general but one of the greatest Black Metal albums ever to be released. Nothing can top Abbath's brutal riffs and his throat ripping vocals. The atmosphere of Darkthrone is here and the talent of Emperor. However, between all that makes this cd a masterpiece is some true beauty. Such as the main riff in Solarfall and the intro in At the Heart of Winter for a few examples. This is a true masterpiece of winter beauty and winter carnage.<br /><br />1. Withstand the Fall of Time (8:29) The first track begins with a single riff before the rest joins in, while the riff not really memorable will grow on you. The first minute is spent gearing up before the song gets into full speed.  About 3 and a half minutes into the song it slows down before getting a  second wind about 4:15 into it and doesn't stop until the song quietly dies out. WOnderful opening track. I could not think of a better song to open up this album. 4.5/5<br /><br />2. Solarfall (6:02) Immortal's best song of all time. A short drum roll falls in follwoed by one of my favorite riffs of all time then hell is broken loose upon an unsuspecting listener. The song does not let up for one secodn and has some of their best drumming as well. The vocals are enough to make you wish to conquer all you face. The vocals are almost dreadfully slow in a good way, almost like you wonder how he  isn't tearing all of his vocal chords. The song slows down2:20 into it with some slow drumming but soo returns with that crushing riff. Best song here. 25/5<br /><br />3. Tragedies Blows At Horizon (8:55) This song is 8 minutes and 55 seconds of pure magic. It really starts up about 40 seconds into it and grabs you with hardened claws and refuses to let up. I love the way the guitar riff kicks in at 4:30 with nothing but a take no prisoners attitude. A real highlight on the album. 5/5<br /><br />4. Where Dark and Light Don't Differ (6:45) The first song I heard on this album and it is a winner. The most thrash influenced track on this album has no mellow intro but just decides to come at you full force. The best drumming on the album appears here. The riff that kickss in at 1 minute is majestic and incredible. An epic track. 10/5<br /><br />5. At the Heart of Winter (8:00) This song honestly makes you feel like you're walking into the front line of a war at the heart of a winter storm. This song runs on talent, emotion and an epic battle cry. The two minute intro can't even prepare you for what is to come. Then the rest of the song kicks in barreling down on you liek an  avalanche you know you can't escape. With guitar playing that just screams talent. The rest of the song continues the epic trail the first half of the song left us with. 20/5<br /><br />6. Years of Silent Sorrow (7:53) Well, instead of ending this masterpiece on a quiet note. abbath and crew decide to go out fighting. With one of the fastest songs on the album begins the drums tear through your ears. The guitar is pretty fast in an almost frantic fashion at certain times. \\"Dome in the sky black winds to taste<br /><br />shadowed spirits lead my way...<br /><br />Drifting everly alone years of silent sorrow<br /><br />until I'm home... \\" With those words spoken the final song dies out leaving you only time to pick yourself up and try to comprehend the incredible album you just heard. 5/5<br /><br />In conclusion, if you haven't stopped reading this yet and purchased this album. I recommend you do so right now. Enjoy.5 <br /> <br />4. Where Dark and Light Don't Differ (6:45) The first song I heard on this album and it is a winner.

B00003CX8V|5.0|I loved this movie and all the Jack Lemmon movies I've ordered and was very satisfied the delivery of my items. Thank you
B00005JO04|5.0|If you like movies that make burn your brain this film is for you. <br />Serious, many subjects, a unbelievable script. Just amazing. Great performance of the actors. Yes for Clooney who wins the oscar. It's good to see that good movies are still here. To much of blockbusters with no screenplay at all, it's for once a objective critical of society. Go see this movie, alone, or wait the DVD to watch it with no one to disturb you cause if you miss a minute, you will be losin' it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Words cannot fully express how attached I've become to this series after first watching the movie that it spawned, Serenity, and then being turned to the TV show.  There's really something whimsical in the underlying feeling to the entire series, which is not to say it stresses any one particular emotion.  Every episode is filled with a blend of action, humor, drama, and intelligence, the last probably being the reason the series didn't exist very long on public television.  In spite of these, however, anyone who allows themselves to be brought into the fantasy never stops feeling just a little bit sorry for the crew.  I myself have never been a fan of science fiction; I hated Star Wars, Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, Star Gate, etc.  The fact that I like this show is purely because the director, Joss Whedon, was able to make me sympathize with the characters. <br /> <br />\\"Firefly\\" never deserved to be canceled.  It is the first quality show within recent memory that broke the \\"sitcom barrier\\" with originality and quality storytelling.  I continue to support any and all campaigns to bring this show back in any format possible and I take pleasure in hearing of the success of the actors who I felt myself grow close to in the process of watching the show. <br /> <br />Browncoats forever.
B00004RFFS|5.0|For me this is one of the best movie of Tom Cruise. I enjoyed verry much with my family and friends.
B00005K9LK|5.0|After experimenting with mainstream sounds with their last three albums, the band goes back into a heavy direction and Rob returns to his classic high notes. The Hellion is a beautiful and heavy intro to the album, it is only 40 seconds, but it rocks. Electric Eye is a fast song that has an angry sound, Rob sounds very \\"robotic\\" on the chorus. The guitar solo on this one rules! Riding on the Wind is another fast song that has some nice shrieks by Rob, and an AMAZING drum intro. Bloodstone slows things down, but keeps it heavy. Pain and Pleasure is not well-liked, it is my personal least favorite on here, but I still like it. (Take These) Chains has a nice soft intro, but it soon rocks out, Rob sounds very emotional on here. <br /> <br />You've Got Another Thing Comin I am sure EVERYONE knows, if not, then WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN!?!? But anyway, it is a mid-paced song that is very catchy, no wonder it became a hit! Devil's Child has an amazing chorus, only Rob can shriek like that! Screaming for Vengeance is so fast for its time, really! Rob practically screams his guts out on this one. He was born to sing this song. Fever is another slower tune, it has heavy parts, but overall, it sort of resembles a power ballad (only in some ways). I LOVE that melodic section in the middle. <br /> <br />You also get a great live performance of Devil's Child and Prisoner of Your Eyes, which IS a power ballad. It is over seven minutes, but it does not get dull at all, it is a beautiful song that I wish was released earlier. WONDERFUL keyboard playing! Metal fans everywhere must get this album, but then again, you all should own it by now!
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|I first read this book in college and loved it, so I have seen all the versions from the silly Lawrence Olivier version to now. My favorite still remains the 1995 Colin Firth version, but this one is also a keeper. Kiera Knightley is wonderful as she has been so far in everything she has played. The scenery alone is well worth the price of the DVD. The settings give you a real flavor of the time - early 1800's - and the muddy way that people lived. No wonder the upper class were revolted by country manners - with a pig that size in the house? Brenda Blethyn does a wonderful job as Mrs. Bennett, as do the four sisters. But, for those of us who know the book by heart, this version is a disappointment. I miss many of the lines I love - they are either missing or thrown away in a mumble. The hair stylist should have done more research as should the writer - I agree that the 'faux pas' - Elizabeth running around in her nightgown - Darcy waltzing into the Collins' whenever he feels like it - are GLARING. It disrupts the reality for those of us who know the manners of that time better. But the real problem with it is Darcy - Darcy has to be cold and haughty, warm and shy, and sexy. MacFayden does angry and appalled, and little else. The director said that he did not want to cast someone too handsome and he certainly has followed through on that. MacFayden could have been cast as one of the farm hands much more easily. Love stories have to be believable - you have to believe that someone as great as Kiera Knightley is going to fall for the guy. With Orlando Bloom this works. But not here - such a shame. Lastly, although I like Donald Sutherland, he plays Mr. Bennett as though he on the edge of senility - Mr. Bennett has a lot of great lines in this story but I'm not surprised that other viewers didn't value them because Sutherland threw them away if he got to say them at all. Read the book, it's funnier.
B00005K9LN|5.0|British Steel is an appropriate title for this one. This album is filled to the brim with true heavy metal. The band was beginning to get mainstream recognition with this one. Most people remember this as the album that has Breaking the Law and Living after Midnight, and while they are good, catchy pop metal tracks, they only represent a small piece to this great album. Rapid Fire is an awesome opener, very fast-paced and headbangable! Metal Gods is slower, but very lethal. Grinder is slow but CRUSHING, tell me that song isn't heavy!! United is a nice anthem-like song that you HAVE to sing along to.  <br /> <br />You Don't Have to be Old to be Wise is more mainstream sounding, but it is still awesome and catchy. I like the lyrics, they have a very good message. The Rage opens with a good bass solo, a lot of people say it is epic-sounding, and I kind of agree with them, you have to hear it to understand. Very creepy song, in my opinion. Steeler is another fast tune, I love when they rock out at the end. <br /> <br />The bonus tracks include a good live performance of Grinder, and a very emotional anthem-like song, Red White and Blue. Nice keyboard playing, great tune, too bad it wasn't released until now. Awesome metal album that YOU MUST BUY!!!!!
B000E6UK5K|3.0|This disc is about what I expected not having heard any of it before purchase. 'On an Island', is nothing like his past 2 solo releases, not even close. This one is a semi-plugged very laid back affair with strings as well as other odd instruments. Voice and guitarwork are excellent as usual, problem is there isn't any real standout tracks. This makes the disc hard to catagorize: it isn't rock or pop/new age/electronic. At times it sounds like The Alan Parsons Project as well as Floyd's 'Wish you were here', but not much. It is atmospheric, it's just dull. Packaging includes a bonus disc with 1 track: Island Jam. It could have fit on the original disc so it's inclusion is a puzzle. <br />The package is like a book with full lyrics/credits. The disc itself is held in place by a spongey black dot, therefor is not protected from scuffing(like my disc is)an odd choice on the part of the manufacturer. Points deducted accordingly. 10 tracks/51.00/Bonus disc/1 track/6.32. If you want Gilmour at his best, wait for the remaster of his first solo release due in April 2006.
B0000C6K09|4.0|This is a \\"must have\\" for John Williams fans. Although conducted by a couple of other conduters with the Prague Symphony Orchestra, it is all John Williams' musical score spanding many years of his spectacular work that makes this compilation special. There will be slight variances nautrally, some which are entertaining to discover, and some which may dissapoint, but one must realize that John Williams is that rare musical genius that is hard to duplicate. The orchestral work of the Prague Symphony Orchestra is encompassing, but not the same as the London Symphony Orchestra. Then again, not all of Williams' orignal work was performed by the London Symphony Orchestra. So, its a little give and take, however, the compilation is by far the most complete work to date.
B00004ZD69|3.0|I had this album recommended to me by a friend and I must say that I see why he would recommend it.  The high points of the album are beautiful, striking and powerful soundscapes that nary a band will ever be able to match.  However, to anyone interested in this album, I must warn that the high points are a minority of the actual album.  In Static, for example, a 22 minute song, this \\"high point\\" comes in about 11 minutes into it, and only lasts till about the 17th minute.  Its an amazing piece of music, to be sure, but the greater portion of the song is just plain boring.  For someone who enjoys this sort of sound, I would really recommend Sigur Ros before Godspeed, as they are able to say just as much in their songs but are also able to say it without 10 minutes of boredom.  Some might argue that this multitude of ambient sound (face it, it's not really music) is an artistic buildup to the great climaxes, but when casually listening to music, I prefer a song that entertains me the whole way through, artistic or not.

B000002513|5.0|For those who have only heard the hits this is a fine addition for your collection.  Bruce and the boys were young and completely up to the task of handing out the long jams you find here.  The title sums up the overall feeling of the songs.  There's a certain joy and a ton of fun to be had.  Put this on one nice warm spring day and see if it doesn't lift your mood.  Caution: must be listened to while drinking a cold domestic beer!
B0002IQEHI|5.0|I've noticed something about Alfred Hitchcock thrillers.  They really aren't that thrilling.  But they do have genuine class. <br /> <br />I won't summarize the plot of this one.  I will say though that the pacing is leisurely, the story interesting, the performances all strong.  I particularly liked Martin Landau.  And James Mason has a voice that makes everything he say sound like Shakespeare. <br /> <br />But who I really love is Cary Grant.  Man, that guy was one cool cat.  Even when he's being hunted by spies, he's still relaxed and continental and witty.  I would've given the movie 4 stars but Landau, Mason, and Grant push it easily into five. <br /> <br />If you don't need a car chase or gun fight every five minutes then this is a very good movie.  It doesn't always make sense.  I mean, who would use a cropduster-mounted machine gun to kill a guy when you could just drive by and shoot him?  But who cares.  It's got style, class, and some very witty dialogue. <br /> <br />But more importantly, it's got Cary Grant.  He's so cool.
B000002KDI|5.0|Buy this cd and put it in your collection.  If you're reading this then you have some sort of interest in Mr Young.  If you have none of his work then this is a good a place as any to start.  There is a lot of ground covered on this single cd (originally double album).  There's a ton of acoustic work and it's great because you can tell the audience has grown up on his music and they're into every note Neil plays.<br /><br />Then there's the electric part.  Many of these songs are on his other live releases.  And while they are all good this set is the standard by which they should all be measured.  Neil lays down the best versions of Cortez the Killer and Powderfinger ever recorded.  Crazy Horse (his backing band) finds a groove they would never find again.<br /><br />Simply put: this is the essential live Neil collection.

0307276902|5.0|Books where I can see everything that is happening are my favorite. A Million Little Pieces is such an emotional book that I can almost physically feel what James Frey is going through. I can feel the pain, the sickness, the regret, and \\"the Fury\\". When I came to the last page I was just as afraid as he was to leave rehab because I had experienced the entire six weeks with him.  <br />The characters are everyday people, likeable and unlikeable. they each have their hidden traits that make them tick and determine good person, bad person, messed up person. Frey does an amazing job of giving each character its own voice. <br />Frey's writing style is what I would call explosive. There are just some things he can't explain with real words so he uses his own. Some of the pain he goes through can only be expressed through serious profanity and although he uses curse words it is all done well. He uses it to put an emphasis on things. The book is filled with sentences that stick in your mind after your done reading, and he repeats them over and over.  <br />I know that some of what he wrote was a lie or exaggerated but it was still an amazing book. I really enjoyed it and it was well worth reading.
B000024D4R|5.0|Since there isn't anything on Animals that comes close to being radio friendly you are highly unlikely to hear anything from it even on classic rock radio stations.  What you will hear on these stations is the best selling stuff from DSOTM, WYWH, and the WALL.  So this should be a treat for the casual fan who is burned out hearing the same few songs.  Make this purchase and you get a whole world of new Pink Floyd music!!  And it's great!<br /><br />The songs are all very accessible.  The reason for the non-radio play is that the songs are long.  You only get 3 real songs and the bookends of Pigs on the Wing.<br /><br />The political comentary on the 3 main songs are more biting than anything else Floyd ever put out.  But the most important thing is the music.  Gilmour has lots of opportunities to show off his unique guitar playing.<br /><br />My favorite song here is 'Sheep'.  Along with Gilmour's great guitar riffs this song also features a lot of keyboards from Wright.  Some of the organ sounds like it could have been from the Meddle period.<br /><br />If you've already heard their classic rock stuff then give this a try.  If you like this then give Meddle a try.  You might want to stay away from Piper at the Gates of Dawn as it is completely different than anything else out there (Syd Barrett was running the band then).
B000E6UK5K|4.0|hmmm...been listening to \\"floyd\\" since i was 17<br /><br />im like 36 now....<br /><br />i havent bought the cd (yet).....but i will<br /><br />this is not the point.<br /><br />i just wanna know if syd barrett will ever rejoin?????
B000AXSN5G|5.0|I got this within a couple of days of its release. There are some very nice songs on it and an overall mood that suggests Neil was appreciating the vibe of these songs and knew his audience was going to love them. The last year or so has been rough on Mr. Young and it's a wonder he was able to get this project completed. This is all acoustic with backing band. Of course, it's been compared to Harvest since the day it came out. So let's just use Harvest as a comparison. If you like Harvest you will not be dissapointed with Prairie Wind.  At least that's my opinion.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|I always enjoy a few Christmas movies before Christmas, but this is my absolute favorite.  I enjoy the way everything blows up in Clarks face when he thinks he has the best laid plans and his heart is in the right place wanting to make everyone happy.  I especially like when he needs an aspirin after a very long rant, as anyone that has done anything similar will be able to relate to the headaches the ranting causes.  Absolutely hilarious.
B000006TRV|3.0|Hey, I kind of thought the concept was cool.  Our hero, Pink, loses his mind and goes on a mental breakdown, journey, concert tour.<br /><br />The problem here is Roger Waters.  Genius that he is the point he's trying to make is plainly missed by him.  This should have been a single album.  But, no, Waters, the megalamanic, gives us a double dose of what he wants to force down our ears.  And it really is a disaster.  The music is all over the place but always heading in one direction, despair.  This is one downer of a musical experience.  Does Waters want his audience to commit suicide?<br /><br />We really needed just one album worth of music.  After the perfection of Meddle, Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, and Animals this was and continues to be a complete let down.<br /><br />Waters supposedly wrote the Wall to reflect his feelings of shame and audience isolation after a nasty incident where he spat on a fan who tried to get on stage during the tour for Wish You Were Here.  He wondered, after that, what had he become.  He then wrote the wall and proceeded to terrorize the rest of the band.  That is until they eventually got him to leave them alone completely.<br /><br />If you're a fan you're going to ignore this review and buy this cd anyway, unless you already have it.  There are some great musical moments and Comfortably Numb (a non related Gilmour contribution) stands as their greatest single song.  Other standouts include Mother and Hey You.  The Trial is a silly, silly waste of disc space.  Young Lust is a good song but it isn't a Floyd song.  It sounds like any other rock song.  I know, they are 'in character' here but the Beatles were in character on Sgt Peppers and still produced songs worthy of their genius.  Another Brick in the Wall is one of their most pedestrian songs.  Gilmour almost saves the song with a very nice guitar solo but the lyrics ultimately become the rally call for a million stoned out illiterates who just never understood what the Floyd was originally about anyway.  Seems Roger Waters forgot too.erstood what the Floyd was originally about anyway.  Seems Roger Waters forgot too.
B000BJS4TO|5.0|MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA is a brilliantly tranquil soundtrack from composer John Williams. Williams continues to astonish us with his endless and seemingly undiminished ability to compose ever-moving scores with innovativeness and insight. This is an incredibly interesting and brilliant soundtrack that surreptitiously explores so many cavernous regions of the mind's eye. It is very moving and captivating.
B000002U8G|5.0|The epic 'Echoes' is worth the price alone.  Many who have only heard the big Floyd releases (Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, The Wall) will be surprised to hear the acoustic numbers that make up a lot of the first part of this cd.<br /><br />The acoustic songs will make you happy David Gilmour joined the band.  Echoes will make you estatic he's in the band.  His guitar interplay with Wright's keyboards is fantastic.<br /><br />This album is getting them prepared for history making (Dark Side of the Moon).  It often gets overlooked but should not be ignored.<br /><br />It's great.
B00005JO9J|5.0|This has to be the greatest current TV show.  I didn't see the first few episodes because I'm not a big TV-watcher.  BUT, after I caught one show I haven't missed an episode since.  I've watched the DVD several times over the last month.  The actors are great with diverse nationalities and personalities.  The dialogue is fresh and original.  The situations are unique, interesting, and ones we can easily relate to. The medical scenes are also interesting.  I especially like the twists and turns throughout each episode - you seriously never know what's coming.  The original musical scores are really catchy and expertly placed.  Then, there's Derek, ...  oh, can't go into details here except that he's a hunk.
B0000025DD|2.0|The song No Way is extremely well done. Other than that it's off to the used CD store with this one.
B000AA4M9U|5.0|Listen to it constantly.  Went to his birthday concert.  At 80 he is still rockin!
B0000025ZK|2.0|Most of Floyd to me is timeless. Gilmour's solo stuff sounds dated in my opinion. That's certainly not a bad thing in and of itself but this record just seems a bit too 80's poppish to me. The song Love On The Air is just ridiculous. Of course I've never cared for Townsends style of writing and think he's written several songs that just can't be taken serious. I find no songs on this record worth even putting on a compilatation. Off to the used cd store with this one.
0385513755|5.0|I'm not a big book person, but I love this book it is a must read.
B00007GZR5|4.0|I have this film on VHS and now I am buying it on DVD - just for the lovely sets and color, the humor and the drama. The story itself is a fantasy - a kind of fairy tale - and it has a disappointing ending, when you consider what an eternity together could mean for lovers, compared to another risky, painful and pontless go at \\"life\\" on what must seem a poor imitation of heavenly possiblities.
B00005MP58|1.0|I just saw the 2005 version of Pride and Prejudice last night and it made me appreciate the 1996 version even more. If you have read the book, perhaps more than once as I have, then you will love this version because this film captures the characters, the rules of society, the style of living, as they were described in the book. There are a few minor liberties but they add to the story. The acting was superb. The characters in the book lived in a very polite, very reserved society and these actors were able to convey so much with a glance, a gesture, a stiffening of the shoulders. I will admit that I was already a fan but never more so than after viewing the new, and dreadful version. If you are going to buy a DVD of Pride and Prejudice this is the one.
B00008IAMD|5.0|I can't recommend this album highly enough!  i'm not a big Country & Western fan (i'm a big heavy metal fan), but grew up listening to Johnny Cash as a child due to my dad's love for 'the man in black'.   <br />However, while watching the 'Scuzz' channel on British Sky TV I saw the video for Johnny Cash's cover of Nine Inch Nails 'Hurt'.   <br />The video is a classic, despite the apparent affects of the stroke he suffered affecting his facial features.  Luckily, this version of the CD includes the video for 'hurt'.  I cannot put in words how strong & powerful both the song and video are.  This is one of the rare occasions that a cover song sounds so much better than the original. <br />But thats not all, this is a quality album from start to finish.  Whether its his own songs (such as 'the man comes around' and 'danny boy') to covers (such as 'bridge over troubled water' & 'Personal Jesus'). <br />Even if you have some of the songs already in your collection, this is a definate 'must have' album.  But don't take my word for it - try it yourself!
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|It's very difficult for me to believe that anyone associated with the making of the 2005 version of Pride and Prejudice actually read the book. I can believe that they read the Cliff notes as they got the names right anyway. Lizzy was spirited and strong willed perhaps for her time, but the constant giggles, the rudeness in Church, the lack of propriety; wandering around outside at night in her nightclothes, not wearing a hat outside, unkempt hair, gave me the impression that Keira Knightly was playing Keira Knightly, and not Elizabeth. Jane seemed more true to form but the blonde streaks in her light brown hair? Did she get those in a salon in London or just pick up hair dye in the local super market? There was so very little character development. George Wickham was supposed to be a villain but if you blinked while he was on screen or yawned while Mr. Darcy minimally described the role Mr. Wickham had in his life you certainly would not have known that. Lizzie's speech to Mr. Darcy about the downfall of her younger sister in the presence of Mr. and Mrs. Gardner was just plain bizarre. I had no idea that Mrs. Bennett drank too much in public, nor that she, and the girls did so much housework, in fact the book tells us that they did not. If the pig being escorted through the house was supposed to mean something I did not get it. Lizzy standing on the cliff was the Titanic wasn't it?  Didn't Lizzy realize that she really had been prejudiced against Mr. Darcy by listening to the very positive things about him and the very negative things about Mr. Wickham as related by the long term housekeeper? Don't look for that in this film because she is not even in it. The portrait of Mr. Darcy is now a statue placed in what looks like a museam. Would the Lady Catherine De Bourghe really descend on the Bennett household in the middle of the night and then go and visit her nephew at the home of Mr. Bingley? Was this supposed to be a joke? Is this an example of British humor and the real film is coming out next year?
B000BB1MIC|5.0|I am addicted to the show Gilmore Girls, so when I started looking for the fifth season on dvd, I did a little comparitive shopping. By far, Amazon.com had the lowest price. Y'all even beat out Wal-Mart! I am very pleased with the service you offer, and I will definitely continue to order from Amazon! Thank you! <br />Bethany King <br />Georgia
0316172324|2.0|Malcolm Gladwell writes the book like the reporter that he is. All the relevant information is presented in the first few chapters : the rest of the book is pretty much a \\"repeat and rehash\\" of the original concept. Which by the way is not a novel one at all. Anyone who lives above the most superficial level knows that as humans we react to circumstances at many levels: intuitive, energetic, genetic, instinctive or even karmic. An okay book for cocktail conversation; very lightweight for anyone halfway intellectual...minal
B0001CCXZW|5.0|This was for a gift. I received it on time and perfect condition (new).
B000AADYRQ|4.0|Death Cab For Cutie remind me of some of the best aspects of REM, Elliot Smith and Mercury Rev, and with this, their first major-label release Plans, they've become major players in the music industry themselves. Having garnered a devoted following over several years peaking with 2003's indie cult-classic Transatlanticism, DCFC now find themselves in the middle of a debate amongst fans as to whether the band has made any subsequent artistic progress. Is Plans an improvement? Has their sound benefitted from more major-label production? I don't consider myself one of their biggest fans, but I'd like to weigh in with an opinion of my own. Yes on both counts.<br /><br />Upon listening it becomes quickly apparent that the songs here are crisper, more melodic, more dynamic and pack more of an emotional punch than DCFC's previous work. Take the beautifully executed 'Soul Meets Body' for instance, or  the wonderfully evocative 'Summer Skin', or the heartbreaking 'What Sarah Said'. I could go on....<br />Only the soundtrack-fodder of 'I Will Follow You Into The Dark' fails to convince, being a little too fey for my tastes.<br /><br />Transatlanticism had much to commend it, particularly the album's memorable title track, but Plans provides pretty strong evidence that DCFC had more to offer and better in them yet to come. Put simply, it's just a very good alternative pop record.<br /><br />Did I say I wasn't one of their biggest fans?<br /><br />On second thought.......

076790382X|5.0|This book was really fun to read, it's clever and funny. Since each chapter is was a newspaper column originally, it reads like a collection of short stories.  <br />
0385507755|5.0|i was really excited to get this book and read it after i initially saw this author on the Oprah show.  i was about half way through the book and found out that he was brought back on the show for lying about the \\"story\\" told here.  i thought it was great until i found out it was fiction rather than non.  Still a graphic and detailed book though
6305076995|4.0|People shouldn't complain about the sound & picture quality, because it's the best you're going to get for it's time.  <br /> <br />There are spectacular performances of \\"And you & I\\" and the full version of \\"Close to the edge\\". These are some of the first shows with Alan White on drums and he does an admirable job considering the complicated compositions.  <br /> <br />Seeing Rick Wakeman in his gold cape ,long blond hair and the circle of keyboards surrounding him is quite something.  <br /> <br />I've seen Yes about 10 times and the first was the Topographic tour and the last on was the Rhythm of Life tour. I was (un)fortunate to catch the famous Buggles Drama tour. pee-youuuooo
1400043662|5.0|Kafka on the Shore is a great book that is different from many Haruki Murakami's previous works. Many of his characters are relaxed people in their thirties. They go with the flow and do not worry about tomorrow. The personage of the book is a fifteen - year - old boy who's is name is Kafka. He is very mature and determined person. He knows how to push himself. His story is intertwined with the journey of an elderly man named Nakata and a truck driver Hosino. Their story is surreal and magical. It explains Kafka's journey from metaphysical point of view. With reading on, it becomes absolutely clear that these two stories complement each other. <br />I have read many books of Haruki Murakami. I find them very deep in spite of the easy language the writer usually uses. He has this talent to impart the atmosphere and feelings of his characters. Just as his other books, Kafka on the Shore gives rise to different, sometimes contrary, emotions. The book brings diverse thoughts. <br />Kafka on the Shore is especially strong to me because I have reached the age when a person realizes that going with the flow is impossible and starts looking for one's own way and purpose. The book truly opens this side of Kafka's emotional experiences. <br />The only weakness of this book is its ending. The plot becomes overextended and predictable. The main part of Haruki Murakami's works has this problem. It does not irritate me because many writers do this. I also believe that the goal of the book is to get a writer's thought to a reader. In many cases the ending becomes a sort of framing for the main idea and then it does not matter. Kafka on the shore is among those cases. Haruki Murakami wants his readers to participate in the process and arrive at their own conclusions. <br />Kafka on the Shore is the book for younger people who do not mind metaphysical tendencies in literature. It is for people with imagination who like to think on and \\"digest\\" a book for some time after reading it.I would also recommend this book to the people that like different and odd books. <br />Kafka on the Shore is a book that hypnotizes and leaves a reader attached. <br />
0767830555|4.0|In Taxi Driver we see a classic De Niro performance in a bizarre evironment. If you like the sort of movies that don't seem to have much point after watching for the first time, but it really means you have to watch it a few times to get the \\"juice\\" out of them, this is one for you. We're taken into the life of a taxi driver that gets fedup with the filth in society and that ends up as a hero by mistake. <br />Quite good!
006056251X|4.0|Of the \\"seasons\\" series, this is one of Kleypas' better writings.  As a previous reviewer indicated, you do end up caring for the characters and it was hard to put the book down.  I did put it down just to make it last a bit longer!!
0790734850|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie....What are you waiting for?! Definitely a must-see detective story. Great performance from Russell, Spacey and Pearce, but the whole cast is excellent. <br />It's great, get it now, you won't regret it.
B00007LTIB|5.0|This is a masterpiece.  I encourage the young to venture into the amazing musical poetry of \\"The Gates of Delirium.\\"  There is a history of rock music and this is a must.  Keep enjoying the new stuff that's out there, but dig into the past.  It may become your future....
6304712936|1.0|I didn't get a region-2 version of the dvd that I'd ordered, so the item was useless to me. Moreover the copy didn't contain Dutch subtitles, so I really wonder what I'd ever again buy at Amazon. I was flabberghasted to see that it was possible to make even two fatal mistakes in just one very simple order like this. Ridiculous. <br />Bye bye, Amazon.
B000E1YW0E|5.0|Truly the best musical and now film.  The message delivered is incredible - it gets me through everyday.  It is motivational, moving, and incredibly powerful.  The special features are tremendous, as there is a full length documentary on Jonathan Larsen.  A must have - you will watch it again and again and again!
B000A6T1KE|5.0|Nemesis, is one of the best Star Trek movies yet. The reason it didn't do well at the box office is because  it stayed true to<br /><br />science fiction,which much of the main stream do not understand.<br /><br />The fact that Capt Jean Luc Picard has been cloned is the basis<br /><br />for this movie and his fight with his other self to save the<br /><br />universe. Good character development in this one and I don't<br /><br />want to reveal too much. But if you're a true Star Trek Scifi<br /><br />fan this should be extremely enjoyable to you and thought provoking.
B00000HZFH|5.0|Doug Martsch had already been fooling around in Treepeople and the slightly legendary Halo Benders before 1994's instant classic 'There's nothing wrong with love' came out. This album had some great songs, riddled with melancholy and full of melody. <br /> <br />Succesor 'Perfect From Now On' had it's moment but was not near as good. And then this album came out and Doug was back. <br /> <br />'The Plan' blasts from the speakers and is the perfect opening song with a great simmering ending with at least one great sliding gutiar note. 'Centre of the Universe' is a fresher song followd by the rolling 'Carry the Zero', again with a great ending in which the song completely changes with breaks, new melodies and new sounds.  <br /> <br />Martsch shows that besides writing a basic good song there is more you can add before the guitar solos get too boring and longwinded, something the previous album suffered from somehow. <br /> <br />Other favorites are 'Else' based on a simple but effective bass line and the brilliant 'You Were Right' (spot the songs). <br /> <br />Together with Lou Barlow, J Mascis, Frank Black and Evan Dando Doug Martsch is one of the heroes of late 90's, early 00's guitar orientated indie-style rock. Even though it's on Warner he still maintained that status. A legend in the making, like his hero Neil Young. A perfect album that after 8 years I can still listen to every day.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|I did really enjoy the series and these DVDs.  The one thing that puzzled me was all the chinese writing on buildings and they also at times spoke Cantonese or something like that.  Also, most of the places that they visited was like the old west and rarely ever an alien?  Not what I envision life in space to be like.  Guess I am too much into Star Wars and Star Trek.  Those and Stargate SG1 and Atlantis are more my favorites.
B00006JSS8|5.0|If you are a Stevie Wonder fan you will love this collection.  It includes all of his greatest hits and then some. It is sure to please.
B000A35VTW|5.0|Wow.  At first glance this book, a story of a young Brazilian prostitute and her adventures and trials in Switzerland, seems to simply be about sex, kink and the degrading underbelly of civilazation.  Then, just as the characters themselves in the book do, so much more is revealed.   <br /> <br />This book contains so much insight in to true human nature, in to love and the meaning of life that sometimes parts of the book and in particular the parts that are exerpts of Maria's diary smack you in the face and wake you up from a dream.  They almost made me cry.  The characters in this book become so wise and one sees how easily it is to get stuck in patterns and to think (or more accurately not think) of the things in life that are possible if one can just break out of certain patterns. <br /> <br />Beautiful, sensual, sexy, raw, amazing.  A passionate story that shows that life isn't just always looking and feeling good and being like the pages of a high fashion magazine, but that overwhelming heart-wrenching joy is possible after all. <br /> <br />I feel as if I want to, no I MUST read absolutely everything by this author.
B000E6UK5K|1.0|I'm a big fan of his previous solo work - in addition to Pink Floyd. But this CD is really a letdown! There are a few very brief moments of greatness, but mostly just crap.
B000A7S4B0|4.0|Black Rebel Motorcycle Club does not so much howl here with \\"Howl.\\" <br /> <br />However, it has a good feel and nice sound, something their past albums tried not to do. While this album is less of a rock heavy cast of songs it is good and worth the price. <br /> <br />I just hope their next album is a collection of songs like their single. <br />They seemed to have mastered the early organic rock or the 70's rendition there of. <br />
B00003CXRM|4.0|Product came in condition described but I thought it took a little longer than I had expected to receive it. No major complaints.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|Because they don't get the fact that David Gilmour is doing what he wants to do, which is reflecting back on his life; and won't we all someday? <br />This is an extremely enjoyable CD, and it is supposed to sound like Pink Floyd, because he really is the sound, for the most part; of Pink Floyd. <br />He reports that there is maybe upto 150 songs in the 'vault',some of which might be considered for release, so he is not breathing his \\"last breath\\", as some might think. <br />Carry on, David.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show was amazing!  Everyone agrees that Fox didn't know what they were doing when they made this show crash into the ground.  Everyone who's ever watched even one episode gets hooked. <br /> <br />It's a Western, it's a SciFi, it's an Action... But even if you don't like any of those genres, it's for you! <br /> <br />Still not convinced?  Then don't buy it; rent it.  You won't be spending too much money on it.  But you'll be buying your own copy before you get through the rented one.
0385486804|1.0|I nominate Krakauer for the Overrated Author prize. He took an article and padded it ad nauseum to make a thin book filled with junk. Into Thin Air also was not one of the greatest adventure stories ever written, either. Boring Boring Boring.

Not only that, my wife, who is not into scifi, loved it!   <br /> <br />The only disappointment, a big one, is that the series was cancelled so soon, and the movie, Serenity, just released was very obviously a finale.... So, once you've bought this, and the movie, that's it........ that's it.  :-(

020161622X|5.0|This book is really clear, easy and fun to read.  It has the potential to be a \\"Software Engineer for Dummies\\" book minus the annoyance and uselessness of a \\"... for Dummies\\" book.  After reading just the first chapter, I was enthusiastic and eager to put to use the ideas that this book put forth.  It makes developing projects (even Open Source projects) fun and seem a whole lot more structured.  Great read for any newbie in the programming field or veterans that are looking to freshen their views in true Software Engineering (as opposed to mere hacking).
B000BJGTXC|5.0|This book was the forerunner and the master of all Mafia related fiction. Never has anyone before or since came close to emulating the \\"believeability\\" of Puzo's classic.<br /><br />Puzo introduces us to generation upon generation of all too believable characters. He warms us to them, at times we even sympathise with them and dare I say it, admire them. Then within the flick of a page he turns the character around, so we are thinking that they are the most ruthless cold blooded scum on earth.<br /><br />Nothing will stand in their way, the police, judges, the courts, and ultimately the corridors of power, they've infiltrated everywhere.<br /><br />A fascinating and at times frightening read.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series is an amazing blend of outer space, old west, family and friends.  It is exciting, funny, adventuresome and will definately leave you yearning for more.

B0007PAMR4|4.0|Dune (Extended Edition) has been a long time coming. When the original movie was released in the theatres running at over two hours, the film was a financial flop. However, over the years David Lynch's adaptation of the novel has achieved a kind of cult status with its incredible set design and largely faithful translation of the book. <br /> <br />The Extended Edition was originally released only on TV several years later without Lynch's approval -- so much so that he asked that his name be pulled from the credits and replaced by the infamous \\"Alan Smithee\\" (an approved name for directors who want to distance themselves from a finished project). Until now, this extended edition has never been available on DVD so this then is the first chance for most people to have a look at an alternate version of this classic. <br /> <br />So how does this Extended Edition stand up? Well, in short, good in parts and really bad in others. <br /> <br />First the bad -- the film opens with the original Princess Irulan  narration replaced by an overly-long and unnecessary narrative by someone who sounds like a Southern gentleman (think Colonel Sanders). This narration is accompanied by, believe it or not, production photos. Even worse, Colonel Sanders' obtrusive narration goes on throughout the movie. Not a good start at all. The other bad thing is that most of the music has been rescored and re-arranged even in the non-extended scenes. For example, the first scene where the Guild Navigator visits the Emperor has some added music from another scene -- the original scene did not have any music at all. <br /> <br />Now on to the good -- once the film gets under way, most of the additional scenes actually do add more to the movie. In fact, almost every major scene in Dune has a slightly extended bit, with a little more action and a surprising amount of character development. For example, going back to the first meeting between the Emperor and the Guild Navigator, the conversation that precedes this, between the Bene Gesserit advisor and the Emperor, has been slightly extended, making the Bene Gesserit a more human and doubting character. Then, later in the movie, there's a short scene which shows how the Fremen extract the Water of Life from a juvenile sandworm.  <br /> <br />Overall, the extended edition, while still a long way from being a good film, does add a lot of interesting bits for the curious Dune fan. Hopefully there'll be a Special Extended Edition which does it right and puts back the Irulan narration while leaving in the extended scenes.  <br /> <br />Oh yes, this Extended Edition DVD comes with the original version as well so you can enjoy Lynch's far superior version when you're tired of the extended version. Also worth mentioning is that this DVD comes in a very nice metal presentation case -- much better than any metal case I've owned so far.
068987474X|3.0|If you've read my other reviews, or visited my blog, you know that I'm the last person you'd expect to recommend a book like this, especially given its rather hokey title and the way it's been positioned in the self-help marketplace. Most of the billions spent on self-help--on \\"relationship writing\\" in particular--is money down the drain. It often hurts more than it helps. But after merely perusing the book when it first came out, I actually spent the past weekend with it (someone gave it to my daughter anonymously), and though I tried to find the same fatal flaws in it that I've repeatedly diagnosed in offerings from the likes of Dr. Phil McGraw or John Gray...well, for the most part, I just couldn't.     The thing about this book--the key thing--is that it doesn't wimp out. Most self-styled experts in self-help's relationships wing end up pandering to their audiences; terrified of alienating their (largely female) readership, they refuse to speak the hardest truths. Ultimately they replace what women probably *ought* to hear with what they know women *want* to hear. Thus, whatever genuine help they might've provided gets lost in the frenzied pursuit of market share. Though this book does spend a fair amount of time keeping the reader focused on the light at the end of the tunnel--after all, you have to keep people \\"motivated\\"--it never pulls punches. It calls a spade a spade--and a doormat a doormat. And for that alone it deserves a star or two.    The authors do overreach at times, assuming \\"universal truths\\" that they don't prove (and that, in fact, probably can't be proven). And again here, the authors would seem to lack the technical credentials to be asserting much of what they assert. (I wish I could've awarded 3.5 stars, but there had to be a deduction for areas in which the book fell short.) But those are small shortcomings when measured against this book's courageous approach to \\"telling it like it is.\\" It almost pains me to say that...but it's the truthas I see it.

0385512058|4.0|This is certainly a good read and I enjoyed the way the author provides advice on the attitude and skill set so you can build on your networking skills.  Having an MBA from an ivy league University, I realate to some of Mr. Ferrazzi's stories in the book.   <br /> <br />The one thing I love about the book is the guidance, ideas and insigths it provides... I think this is good stuff and can give you edge to connect with people...
0811729117|5.0|This book was an amazing look into the actual real life experience of being a Tank Platoon leader in WWII and really puts your mind right into the events unfolding.  The Author has great knowledge and understanding of the roll and duty of a soldier.   A must for any WWII reader.
B00026W82U|5.0|This album is a work of art; unbelievably balanced, brilliantly mixed, and a simplicity that is beyond perfect. The kings of Convenience have created musical euphoria.
B00005JOII|4.0|My beef isnt with movie. Its a very solid drama. My frustration is with the commericals and previews that preceeded the release.  <br />Everythig was revealed in the commericals. I knew he was going to turn violent. It shows him putting on the glove and walking around with a shotgun. I just wish I didnt know that was going to happen. It would've been more enjoyable. <br /> <br />They are showing too much about movies in commericals\previews these days.  <br /> <br />If a movie is not based around a 'sixth sense' twist ending, you can be sure you'll know about it in the previews. That is sad. Commericials are pushing too hard and its taking away from the actual experience.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Voila une bonne adaptation du roman de Jane Austen qui est l'quivalent de la srie TV de la BBC/AE ; les acteurs jouent justes, les images magnifiques, et qui plus est nous avons le droit  une bonne son en franais <br />Indispensable !
B00000K2W1|4.0|This is an excellant sampler of Janis.  I remember getting this on vinyl when it first came ot. Has a bit of Big Brother, and a bit of her later.  Nice sampler.
B000E6UK5K|3.0|For better or for worse, Dave is going the way of aging musicians a la Sting, Neil Young, Eric Clapton, etc. <br /> <br />Listening to his gorgeous wailing guitar is still akin to watching fire dance when you are a child, but I guess I was hoping for something a little more diverse, a little more of the Pink Floyd ryhthm section. <br /> <br />The fourth track, \\"Take A Breath\\" has some punch reminiscient of Momentary Lapse of Reason, and track 6,\\"Red Sky At Night\\" (which sounds more akin to the Call than the Fixx) has a nice Clapton-esque bluesy sound. The rest of the album is gentle and folksy, but failed to blow me away.  <br /> <br />Overall, the album is a good purchase if you are either a dedicated Pink Floyd fan, or if you're over 40. It's good background music for the office and also good drinking music when you're alone and feeling old by the fireplace. But don't expect a phenomenal masterpiece to being back old Dark Side flashbacks or reawaken any of the Division Bell marching powder left in your bloodstream. Pink up his 1978 release if you want some raw soulful rock music with David's amazing guitar strings.
B000E1ZBH2|1.0|First off, I am a huge Jane Austen fan. I love this story but I didn't love this movie. If you haven't seen this movie, let me just warn you that this film strays from the book a lot. For instance...Darcy's aunt comes storming into the Lizzy's home in the middle of the night. Or the fact that Elizabeth runs outside in her nightgown...and who does she happen to come across but Mr. Darcy! And the ending? That was creative license if ever I saw it. <br /> <br />      This actually leads me to the reason why I really didn't like this film. Everything was so rushed and obvious. When you watch the film, you'll notice there's a scene when Darcy helps her into a carriage and then they get a close up on his hand clenching. Then there are scenes when they look at eachother longingly. There was no mention of him beginning to like her \\"fine eyes\\" The way the film depicts the romance between the two wasn't special. I always loved the book because of the differences the two must overcome to finally see eachother as their ultimate love. To me it seemed like the screenwriter knew the audience would want the two characters to end up together so they didn't put in all the details that make the story special. <br />  <br />     If you liked the A&E version, you may not appreciate this adaption because they really do change things up. Scenes happen in different locations, a little dialogue has been added, the characters are depicted as really poor and shabby which in my opinion kind of took away from the magic of the story. Needless to say I wasn't happy with this version. The only thing I DID like about this film was when he finally asks her to marry him, her response was I imagined it to be because it was romantic (unlike the A&E version where they just keep on taking their walk together). <br /> <br />    P.S. If you do decide to buy this dvd make sure you get the widescreen. I viewed the fullscreen and there were several scenes where the characters were so far away from eachother that you would hear them talking but could only see the blue sky between them on the tv.
B00005JOFO|1.0|I was really glad that BROKEBACK didn't win Best Picture.  The more I think about this movie, the more I think it's actually a very BAD movie, both politically and artistically.  First of all, it reinforces all sorts of negative stereotypes about gay men (they prey on and lure straight men into their way of life and ruin marriages and are promiscuous and are ultimately lonely and pathetic and/or die of AIDS or are bashed to death).  Secondly, it's not about love, it's about animal lust done by two incredibly selfish men who, if the story were straight, would have had feminist groups up in arms in anger.  Finally, it is yet another gay movie about beautiful men who don't exist in real life for anyone outside of those with lots of money who can afford the gym bunnies of west Hollywood.      I didn't see CRASH, but I assume it was at least not self oppressive and ugly.
B00003000M|5.0|Stephen Marley did a wonderful job at integrating his father's master pieces with a twist of hip hop & R&B.  It is a CD that stays in my player at all times.
0307276902|5.0|This book got me hooked from start to finish. I read through it in no time and enjoyed it as well. A week after I finished reading it, unfortunately, all the controversy about \\"the content not being authentic\\" and \\"the author not sticking to the facts\\" came up... <br /> <br />If you are interested in a book that is pleasant to read and entertaining, I highly recommend \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" by James Frey. Read it on a rainy afternoon, on your 8 hour flight to Europe or whenever you have more than a few minutes to entertain your brain - it is well worth it. <br />
B000ASATWQ|5.0|Damien & Stephen are creative, unique, and extremely talented.  The CD has something for everyone.  The music is perfectly mixed with carribean, hip hop, and R&B.  Listen to the words and understand the messages.  The lyrics of every song were spritual, political, fun, and thought provoking.  As you listen, you learn something which is something the youths need in todays society.
B00003CXCT|5.0|This edition is terrific I think.  I guess if I knew every second of each movie maybe I would be more critical.  As far as I can remember I have always enjoyed these movies.  My kids just recently watched them and are totally enthralled.  I guess it was a little weird to see some of the newer characters thrown in this trilogy but not something that ruins the whole movie.
B0000AMRJD|5.0|I can't belive the high quality of the DVD, I saw the original version on TV and the colors in this DVD are so much brigther It seems like the movie it was recently film. <br />This DVD was a gift to my husband, that is a fan of Al Pacino, and he almost cry when he saw it. <br />The price it's really good and was arrive just on time. <br />I'm very happy with this buy
0399241523|5.0|If you like the first five in the Stormbreaker series you will love Ark Angel.  It is one of the best  in the series.  I read it in England last spring (2005) and can tell you that my one copy has made the rounds in my Jr. High Library.
B000BW7QX6|4.0|\\"Serenity\\" is a movie that rather should've been a long TV Special.  To fill-out the movie-length time, there were several draggy scenes that should've been tightened up and shortened. My biggest gripe is about the fights -- particularly the climactic one -- in which characters are so direly injured that they should be at least entirely incapacitated, and maybe even dead, but they keep on fighting as if \\"it only hurts when they laugh.\\" My second-biggest gripe is about the personal weaponry involved, almost all of which is anachronistic and silly. But I'd watch it again -- and again -- anyway.
B0007M22TI|5.0|The title for this says it all! I wasn't looking to do a professional analysis of this dvd, but just kick back and see/hear how it was. How was it? Beautiful and all three women could sing very well. The violinist was also appreciated as well as the rest of the musicians. I don't particularly care if I sound stupid and trite, but it was sweet \\"music to my ears\\".
B000EOTAM6|5.0|While this movie departed from the animated series in many ways and was not as challenging to watch, I still enjoyed it.  The movie managed to provide a perspective for 'big' questions that are so easy to lose sight of in day to day life. I think the flow of special effects fed the story well. My only reservation is that the story was wound so tight that by the end everything fit too neatly into a tidy package. In spite of this small limitation, I expect that, as with many significant works of science fiction, we will someday face related challenges that arise as consequences of current technological developments.

6305327041|5.0|Ted is a lonely bellhop. He's got the whole hotel all to himself on New Year's eve. So, what else can he do but be the lap dog for every requesting customer. But, he only has to worry about four particular, and sometimes peculiar, rooms. Each room is a story involving ted, directed by four different directors. Call it a collaboration of different comedic talents. So, let's go through them, one by one.<br /><br />Story one: The Secret ingriediant<br /><br />Not really much to go on here. A coven of witches are trying to ressurect some virgin wicth who was wrongly accused of a crime. Not really that funny. It's a bumpy start but it gets better. ted stays the same goofy self all through the movie.<br /><br />Story Two: the wrong man.<br /><br />A mistaken identity sex game in which ted accidently found himself in. Constantly he tries to escape the room. Funnier than the last one. Still bumpy, though.<br /><br />Story Three: The Misbehavers (Directed by Robert Rodriguez)<br /><br />Funny story of a couple leaving their kids in the room to go celabrating the new years eve at a party. These kids are bad news. They get their hands into any and everything. Poor ted runs rampant to make sure they won't misbehave or else the father will kill him. ted at his best here. hilarity incarnate. Explosively funny.<br /><br />Story four: The Bet (Directed by Quentin Tarantino.)<br /><br />An after hours new years eve party with a witty group of filmakers who have had too much to drink. Quentin stars. Bruce willis too. Ted stays the same, quirky and naive as well. Funny and different, but quick on the jokes. There is one take where there is just one uncut shot, lasting well over ten minutes. They must've rehearsed that one for hours.<br /><br />the overall feel of the movie is unique and full of laughs.<br /><br />Enjoy!
0783229364|3.0|There is no question that Michael J Fox is a pleasure to watch in this romantic comedy set in the corporate world of the 1980's. He is supported by several worthy co-stars and a solid but not too demanding of a script. The movie is aimed for those who enjoy screwball comedies and are comforted by happy endings.  <br /> The Secret of My Success is deftly directed by Herbert Ross (now deceased) who proves once again that he was a man interested in entertaining and not challenging his audiences. Personally, I periodically like to watch a comedy that offers 90 minutes of harmless laughs, but at almost two hours this movie runs out of steam. <br /> Fox stars as Brantley Foster, an improbable name for someone from a farming town in Kansas, who gets a job in New York City after finishing college. Unfortunately, he's fired on the same day he's supposed to start work, since the company was recently taken over. After several days of looking for another job, he remembers that he has an uncle in New York, who runs a major corporation. His uncle starts him in the mail room and soon Fox's character will meet the woman of his dreams, be seduced by his aunt, and begin to pretend he's a newly hired executive.  <br /> Fox works the gags with practiced ease, but as with all screwball comedies, the audience can only be expected to suspend their disbelief for just so long. All in all a solid effort by Fox and Ross, and I recommend this movie to anyone looking for an afternoon of formula comedy.     <br />
B0007Y08IS|4.0|Sorry if you are on the right--this isn't really directed at you, just the one member who seems to think a couple of online reviews speak for an entire group of people.  I thought this movie was absolutely hilarious.  The songs in particular were very funny--The Pearl Harbor one being my all time favorite.  It's definitely not humor for everyone.  If you're sensitive to Sean Penn's plight (i.e. having to get involved in EVERYTHING) then this movie is not for you--the same is true if you're a big fan of Alec Baldwin, Michael Moore, conservatism, leftism, country music, \\"blow-em-up-real-good\\" politics, RENT, etc.  You name it, and it's probably made fun of here.  The only reason I personally can't give it four stars is that, like past reviewers have said, some of the humor is just silly toilet humor that isn't particularly funny.  Just some of it though--the vast majority of it is truly inpsired.<br /><br />Okay, apparently you don't know what a \\"sweeping generalization\\" is, but statements like \\"the left has no sense of humor\\" qualify.  Even if you clarify the statement later, that statement (your title no less) is still a sweeping generalization.  My title was a satirical stab at yours, which I apologize for in my first sentence.  As you say though-\\"pointing out the truth may sometimes be painful to hear.\\"  And just to clear things up, I was calling sweeping generalizations stupid, not you (that would be silly-I don't even know you).
B000B7HZXM|2.0|Not enthralled at all with this music, and the disc hangs up between the tracks.....It is NOT my cd player.....it does it on three players I have.....so I assume it is a fault in the disc creation!  Anyway, it was not worth the $ to me.   Sorry Rod
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Ok.  If you've never heard of this show, you're missing out big time.  Buy it, or rent it (like if you have a NETFLIX account), and watch it.  Then watch the movie Serenity. <br /> <br />This movie is different than all the others.  Why?  It's not one of those ultra-clean sci-fi environments.  Imagine a fusion between a western and a sci-fi.  There are no aliens, but there are Reavers!  Every episode is extremely entertaining. <br /> <br />Besides that, the acting is awesome.
B000000NN1|5.0|Before Vangelis became known in the Western music world-- helped along by the motion picture soundtracks for Chariots of Fire and Bladerunner--he helped create the genre of electronic music.  He was a pioneer in the true sense of the word. <br /> <br />First Released in 1975, Heaven and Hell is a masterpiece.  It is at times operatic--with the appearance of the English Chamber Choir--and at times lyrically soothing--encompassing the angelic voices of Jon Anderson and Vana Veroutis.  Instrumentally, Heaven and Hell delves into the the psyche of the human spirit and hearkens to our very beginings.  Appropriately, sections of this release were used for Carl Sagan's 1970s television series \\"Cosmos.\\" <br /> <br />I first discovered this album in 1982 and recently replaced the vinyl with the CD and am now rediscovering it.  Any true fan of Vangelis--or electronic music--must include this in his collection.  It is perhaps Vangelis' true begining in popular electronic music, and is a journey unto itself.
B00005OCMR|5.0|It is a great show, considering when it was made the graphics/special effects are pretty well done.  I would reccomend buying it
B000000OSE|5.0|The Use Your Illusion (UYI) albums are not another \\"Appetite for Destruction,\\" and perhaps that is why they are not not well-received by some Guns N' Roses fans.  The band's style is a bit less lively, and the songs are more serious and more sophisticated than those on the \\"Appetite\\" album, but that does not mean that the UYI albums are bad.  On the contrary, they are classics.    UYI I, in my opinion, is the better of the two UYI albums.  For me, the songs complement each other and flow much better than those on UYI II, it is more \\"down-to-Earth\\" than UYI II, and it comes across as if the band had more focus on this one than on UYI II.  Also, it has a far better variety of style and tempo than UYI II.    Contrary to popular belief, I find very little (if any) \\"filler\\" material on this album, and nearly all the tracks are good.  The highlights include the famous \\"November Rain,\\" \\"Don't Cry,\\" and \\"Live and Let Die,\\" plus good, lesser-known material such as \\"Dust N' Bones,\\" \\"The Garden,\\" \\"Don't Damn Me,\\" and the 10-minute art-rock piece \\"Coma.\\"    UYI I is a must-have for Guns N' Roses fans, but I'm confident that anyone who has a taste for rock music will enjoy this album for a long time.
B00005221M|5.0|awesome movie through and through although there were a few minor cut outs it still is an awesome movie!
B000683VI4|5.0|Fantastic story, very touching, made me cry tears of happiness, sweetness, and sadness.
B00006RCNW|5.0|This was a series I enjoyed and it has been nice to collect all the seasons on DVD.  Watching the episodes sequentially without commercials is like watching a long movie where you can take breaks easily.
B0001XAOLQ|4.0|The uncut version is too long. The story is great.If I were to watch it again, I would probably skip the last 2 hours of the first disc.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|This is an old fashioned western.  The characters are very real.  At times, I even felt a little embarassed, like I was eavesdropping on someone else's conversation!  Robert Duvall is at his best.  The character of Gus is a perfect fit.  This series is perfectly cast and there's not a sour note in the bunch.  You'll miss these characters when the series ends.
B00000JS1M|5.0|Hey guys, the cassette version of this release had the song \\"Suzi Hold On\\" and the CD has \\"Midas Touch\\".  \\"Suzi Hold On\\" appears on an earlier Saxon release (WHEELS OF STEEL), but the version on the POWER & THE GLORY is far superior.  Can ANYONE tell me where to find the POWER & THE GLORY version of \\"Suzi Hold On\\" on CD? <br /> <br />OK, now for the review . . . <br /> <br />I LOVE the title track \\"Power And The Glory\\" - fast riffs and some great drumming.  It sould similar to DIO's \\"Stand Up And Shout\\", if you've ever heard it.  \\"This Town Rocks\\" is another fast-paced, hard rocker. <br /> <br />Saxon has had some interesting lyrical content throughout their career.  They seemed to take a cue from Iron Maiden for topics like vikings (\\"Warrior\\") and fighting and war (\\"Power And The Glory\\").  We've also got the standard metal topics of motorcycles (\\"Redline\\") and crowd pleasers (\\"This Town Rocks\\") - themes we've seen on earlier Saxon releases that will perpetuate in later releases. <br /> <br />Nigel Glockler makes his drummer debut here - and he is GOOD.  The talent base for the band is good - maybe not quite up to Judas Priest or Iron Maiden level, but these guys wrote great songs and they play their metal hearts out for their fans.  It's a shame they were not appreciated in the USA the way they were in their native England because they have a lot to offer the metal world.  I have most of their CD's and all are in the 4 and 5 star range.  Don't miss out on these guys.  If you are new to SAXON, begin with POWER & THE GLORY, DENIM AND LEATHER, and INNOCENCE IS NO EXCUSE.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Usually when I see the fanboy reaction to a TV show or movie, I get repulsed and tend to avoid whatever it is these salivating fan-cults are hyping up.  Well, I guess even old dogs can learn new tricks because I'm salivating like a schoolboy with a brand-new XBox, someone hand me a hanky.      I recently watched the movie \\"Serenity\\", which was spawned by this great series.  I was so impressed with the movie that I borrowed a friend's DVD set.  This friend had been begging me to watch both for months, but I just never got around to seeing either.    Ho-lee-cow was I missing out[Yes, Ry, YOU TOLD ME SO]!  What an incredible show!  I got hooked immediately by the 2-hour pilot, also titled \\"Serenity\\", which, by the way, WHY wasn't this the pilot aired on FOX in 2002?  The rest of the episodes on Disc 1 were good, but it wasn't until Disc 2 that I realized the treasure I had stubbornly acquired.    The show really hit it's stride with \\"Our Mrs. Reynolds\\", \\"Jaynestown\\", and the incredible, and almost poetic, \\"Out of Gas\\".  From there, every episode was a priceless piece of television excellence.  The never-aired episodes were absolutely fantastic.  From the hilarious episode \\"Trash\\", the mournful and [again] poetic \\"The Message\\", to the odd, but brilliant \\"Objects in Space\\", just pure gold.    Needless to say, I finished the whole set in just a couple of very late-night marathons.  And now, my broken-record moment: \\"How in the HAY-UL did this brilliant show get cancelled?!?\\"  And how could anyone with a molecule of taste not LOVE this show?  Great cast, interesting 3-D characters, best dialog I've EVER heard, fantastic mix of humor, drama, and action; and I could go on and on, but you'd have to hand me a towel instead of a hanky.    But hey, don't listen to me, don't listen to the day-one fanboys, and don't listen to the Firefly & Serenity bashers, see for yourself.  Firefly is one of the best shows ever made and a truly tragic loss to the entertainment landscape.  Buy it, savor it, and treasure it, there will never be another show like it.    Now hand me that hanky, I just drooled on my new brown coat.
B0001CNRBG|4.0|The Same time, Next year starts Alan Alda and Ellen Burstyn. <br />Good movie about 2 people who meet and fall in love.  Obviously <br />there is more to this movie but I don't want to spoil it.  Well acted.  Movie timeline runs from the 50's to the 70's.  Great to see the different fashions.  Picture this Alan Alda in Bell bottom jeans a beads!  Great movie.
6305922756|5.0|The DVD is great, This is the second time I had to purchage it because someone that was careless broke the first one removing it from the case.  The only 'flaw' I find is that the DVD should have the option to re-enter the deleted scenes.  Watching the deleted scenes is like watching a whole new movie in itself.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|If you appreciate David for his skillful and inspiring guitar playing then you will love this soulful masterpiece.  If you like old Pink Floyd then you will revel in its beauty.   <br /> <br />The orchestra blended with the soft and rich tones of the guitar are outstanding.  This is a must.
1563898586|5.0|I thought this was awsome. I saw the movie before I read this and was dissapointed at what I saw as a lot of squandered potential.  This Comic, on the other hand, totally lives up to its potential. A great read.
B00009MGGI|5.0|This was a very good TV series and we are very happy to have found it on DVD. The plot is basically about a British politician who is very BAD but goes right to the top and becomes PM by very devious methods.  It's a thriller of sorts but so well done by the Brits!
B0007GAERG|1.0|Okay, let me start of by saying that 'We Belong Together' is a good song, not great like 'Hero' or 'Vision of love', but good none the less.  However the rest of this CD is a complete waste of time and the remaining 13 tracks would have been put to better use as very poor b-sides on the single. <br />  <br />American music \\"fans\\" like to follow trends, and seeing as the ever increasing, one dimensional, repetitive radio stations spin her music they all flock like SHEEP.  This album has done nothing outside the States and yet it is shoved down our throats as a 'come back', just because she hasn't had a decent song since the mid 1990's. <br />  <br />This is not a good album, it's just media hype of a once credible musician who now wears a scarf as an outfit and has a pants optional policy.  That being said would be fine if she didn't have a body that perfectly depicts America's obesity problem.   <br />  <br />As evident from her Grammy performance our Mariah has lost her once powerful voice, figure and dignity.   <br />  <br />America it's time to take a look at ourselves and catch up to the rest of the world. The music we are FEED by the media and radio is only a tiny sample of what's available and instead of settling for Mediocre \\"Mimi\\", educate yourselves on something with substance.
0743486196|4.0|Jodi Picoult has been my favorite author since I read The Pact three years ago. I love how she draws you into the hearts and minds of all the characters. She always chooses complex and ethical topics for her stories, but she writes them beautifully. I could not put down My Sister's Keeper; It is a heartwrenching story of a girl with leukemia and her family's endless struggle to ease her affliction. If I am not mistaken, I believe Picoult based this plot along the lines of a true life story. I was genuinely touched by this novel, along with all the others. I was a little dismayed by the ending, as she throws a totally unexpected trauma to you, but still enjoyed it very much and recommended it to all of my friends.

B0001MDQ6W|5.0|Dylan concerts are famously uneven: Some are magical, some are dead, but this is one of the magical ones.  Not only are the performances terrific with Dylan upbeat and engaging the audience, but he shows how a performer should age.  Rather than try to recreate the youthful rock and rolling that existed when \\"Tombstone Blues\\" and \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\" were recorded, Dylan brings the tempo down and provides arrangements that are different but just as good as the originals.  The best part is the music fits the man singing it, so instead of looking like a middle aged rocker clinging to youth, Dylan has recreated his music to age with him.   <br /> <br />Dylan's music has always been timeless, and it's wonderful to see he has the creativity and self-awareness to make himself timeless in the vein of BB King, John Lee Hooker, Johnny Cash, Ray Charles, and not a ridiculous looking Mick Jagger pretending he's still twenty-five.

B00003TL18|5.0|I was never a huge fan, but bought this after hearing how Elvis called him \\"The Voice of God.\\"  Anyways, just about every track on this is amazing, even if you're not previously familiar with it.  One thing to note is that you can't really tell that he's playing with all the other famous musicians.  If I hadn't known already and just heard the songs, I would have thought it was just his regular band.  Could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how you look at it, but either way this still deserves 5 stars.
0684824906|5.0|This is a fantastic book.  It is very detailed and essentially ties mid life biographies of 5-6 people toghether in a most informative and accurate way.  Author has gone to great effort to provide detail.   <br /> <br />It is not a quick or easy read thatmany may desire, but for a true Lincoln enthusiast, it is valuable and a wonderful addition to your library.
B000002KDM|5.0|Mud Slide Slim is the best album of james Taylor. 2nd is Sweet baby james. My favorite tracts in this album are PLACES IN MY PAST,RIDING ON A RAILROAD, YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND,& LONG AGO & FAR AWAY among others. All the songs in this album are beautiful. I never tire of listening to it. Its always in my car stereo &  a perfect companion wherever I go. To me, JT's peak as singer/songwriter is evident in this 1971 album. That's only my opinion. Of course I have all of JT's album in my collection. But MUD stands out. I respectfully recommend this album to you,the reviewer, wherever you are in the world. Thank you.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This cd is excellent. Michael sounds asthough he could have been one of Frank Sinatra's friends. So smooth and jazzy. I recommend this cd to anyone looking for awesome vocals and duets. Listening to Michael sing takes me back to a time when the music touched your heart and soul.
B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey Road is the Greatest, Enigmatic, Super, Fantastic, Awesome,Beautiful, album the Beatles ever made. People will talk about this album 300 years from now. Its a masterpiece. A work of art. Pure genious. I had second thoughts of writing a review on this album, Abbey Road. Its like asking a plumber to critique the Nile River. Or asking a carpenter how the Great Wall was built. So wherever you are in the world, I hope you share my sentiments and thoughts about this album. Because 5 stars ain't enough to rate this. 10 stars!!!
B0007OCG4W|3.0|Mike Nichols' \\"Closer\\" is a stage play that never looses the feeling of short stories strung together and edited in a somewhat displaced chronology of bits between stripper Alice (Natalie Portman), writer Dan (Jude Law), photographer Anna (Julia Roberts), and dermatologist, Larry (Clive Owen). That no one is less that stunning and beautiful in this film is a credit to the casting of four actors who have chops behind their chiseled jaws and perfect profiles.  <br /> <br />Natalie Portman gives an eyeful of her adult nether regions for the screen in the easily most watchable section of the film. She has long outgrown the little girl of The Professional and her maturity as an actor is exceptional for those expecting a Star Wars ingenue. Equally outstanding is Clive Owen who played both the roles of Dan on stage and Larry for the film. His dark handsomeness and intensity over the disintegrating relationship with his wife (Julia Roberts) is both territorial and frantic. One can easily relate to his anguish and anger at his wife's straying. <br /> <br />Although given top billing, Julia Roberts plays the least likable character as a passive- aggressive photographer whose brief fling with Jude Law reflects the press attention to the actor's recent notorious behaviour. Law seem totally comfortable with the portrayal of cad, a role that has all too many associations with his real life drama that eeks its way into the performance. <br /> <br />Dialogues on fidelity, infidelity, love, and sex are the majority of conversations between characters that begins to sound preachy. Often cruel in its harshness, the relationships of these \\"adults\\" is vicious sparing between men too crude for Sex In The City, and too harsh for reality TV. As a slow moving storyline jumps between temporal frames, it barely moves the action forward in uneven pacing. Although the majority testosterone waving happens between revengeful Larry and Dan, a callous pretty boy who writes obituaries, the only scene between the two women early in the film is easily the choice confrontation of a wronged woman meeting the guilt- ridden slut. <br /> <br />Sometimes the truth is too much information in relationships and neither Larry or Dan have learned that fact to the detriment of their women swapping relationships. Dissatisfaction, unhappiness, and inability to trust seems to unravel these shallow relationships as well as bore the audience to tears. While some may label this film art, it is not exactly \\"art\\" as \\"mature,\\" and its adult storyline falls short of interest as none of the characters are worthy of audience attention for the entire duration of the film. If long and boring but attractive is substance, Nichols' \\"Closer\\" fills the bill.
0553801503|5.0|I love the series!!! Have been there since game of thrones first hit the shelves.  I think the fact that he keeps life real by keep shocking us with rivals and deaths. He doesn't always make you happy by the way life unfolds for the characters you love and hate. (i.e the Starks) I know everyone has there own opinions and you must realize \\"can't make everyone happy\\" <br />I will be impatiently waiting as always for the next... lets hope he doesn't take as long as some of the previous ones :) If you love a GREAT read and have the time to devote (can't put it down) Read this whole series from book 1.  I couldn't imagine starting in the middle and knowing whats going on.  <br /> <br />My advice read it and make your own decision.  <br />
1400032717|5.0|What a wonderful book! The author tackles a series of very emotional and dramatic scenes through an emotionless methodical voice and comes across as true and compassionate at the same time. A wonderful study and a wonderful read. Can be enjoyed on so many levels yet still remains a simple and straightforward book. One of the best books I have read in a long long time.
B000002KET|5.0|I'd have to say,being a Black Sabbath fan from their very beginnings,there a no three albums by ANY band that can hold a candle to Vol.4(1972),Sabbath,Bloody Sabbath(1973)and Sabotage(1975). <br />Listen to any metal band today and their sound and roots can only be traced back to BLACK SABBATH. <br />I have seen the original line up 3 times,the first being Feb.'74 on the Sabbath,Bloody Sabbath tour.Next was 1976 on the Technical Extacy tour and lastly,the Never Say Die tour '78. <br />Every single Sabbath album is of course a classic,but my three favorites are Vol.4,Sabbath,Bloody Sabbath,and Sabotage. The most nut-crunching musical sounds on the planet.

B000002KAT|5.0|If you think this album isn't very good because it doesn't have songs that sound like Domino on it, chances are good that I don't like you very much. <br /> <br />I'm by no means a huge fan of Van Morrison. I've liked some of his work that I've casually heard on the radio, but if you asked me to name some songs of his, all I could come up with are Domino and Brown-Eyed Girl. Frankly I'm so sick of those songs, I really didn't have much interest in Astral Weeks. But my wife checked it out from the library, and I really was blown away by how great of an album it is. <br /> <br />So don't believe the reviews that say that Astral Weeks is \\"for Van Morrison fanatics only\\" or other such nonsense. I only like music that doesn't suck, and I say this is great music. <br /> <br />--sclaughl
B000002868|4.0|Wayne Shorter and Joe Zawinul left the Miles Davis fold to start their own group, soon to be known as Weather Report.  This is their debut album with bassist Miroslav Vitous, drummer Alphonse Mouzon, and percussionist Airto Moreira.  With so many of the musicians coming out of Miles's early electric period, one would expect more of the same funk and fire coming out of the trumpeter's recordings and performances at the time, especially since Shorter and Zawinul were probably the two most prominent in terms of shaping Miles's music compositionally.  But instead of the spontaneous energy and rawness of Davis's electric music (which is definitely an acquired taste), this album delivers more of a studio production, although not to the level that their subsequent recordings would.  The different tunes are more like sketches than long funky jams, though they do continue the tradition of electronic sounds.  They explore new sonic territories in a relatively laid-back fashion, and thus the result is like \\"In A Silent Way\\" or even more like \\"Filles de Kilimanjaro\\" than \\"Bitches Brew\\" or anything Miles was doing at this point.  But this album takes it a step farther, like on \\"Milky Way,\\" the product of recording echos from an acoustic piano that form a remarkably coherent yet far-out piece of music. <br /> <br />When this album was first released, it was critically acclaimed to be brilliant (Shorter and Zawinul are two of jazz's greatest geniuses) but somewhat cold in comparison to Miles's recordings on which the present leaders had played.  That criticism stands up today; I listen to this album once in a while when I'm in a strange mood and find myself very interested in the experiments but not particularly emotionally affected.  The exception I can think of is \\"Tears,\\" with its beautiful melodic fragment and passionate development. <br /> <br />Weather Report would continue in this vein for one more album, \\"I Sing The Body Electric,\\" with what I feel are more successful results (see my review for that album) before changing tracks and becoming one of the most commercially successful fusion bands of the 70s.  That music is wonderful too but this is quite different than \\"Heavy Weather\\" or \\"Black Market.\\"  Still, there is nothing particularly overt or offensively dissonant to the casual listener, so it is a listenable introduction to the band, if not the best.  This album will truly appeal only to adventurous jazz listeners or anyone who wants to hear some \\"tripped out stuff\\" and anyone else might feel disengaged from this music.  But if you can pay attention to it long enough to appreciate its depth, you will hear how nobody else ever did anything like this, which in and of itself is exciting and worthwhile.
B000AP04FG|5.0|This was a great movie, first of all they make a great team, couple wise and movie wise.  They was so much action in this movie, you could wait to see what happened next.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|While not my favorite Disney \\"classic\\" film, Lady and the Tramp is nevertheless full of the quality and wonder that you expect from almost all of the animated films made during \\"Uncle Walt's\\" lifetime.  The characters are charming, the story sweet without being sticky, the music charming, and the visuals are at their hand-painted best.  We have been gradually replacing all of our old VHS Disney classics with the DVDs, and it is well worth it--not only for the extras, but for the work Disney has put into restoration.  They don't make movies like this anymore.
B00028HBKC|5.0|This is the best portral of the crusifixon ever.  It is probably the closest we will ever get.  If u have read the bible deeply u would have found that it is all true there is no evidence to disprove he existed, or that he was the Son of God.  First of all if he were just a good man why would he die for us.  No man would. It would be pointless i he were just a man.  But u say hes insane.  If he were insane then he would have done inasne things and he never did any thingout of the ordinary human behavior besides claim to be God and do mircals.  Then u say the Bible is false.  First there are the daed sea scrolls.  Then there is much historical and artifacts to back all this up. <br />There is aslo a ton aof evidence for creation.  The smart and logical man can not honestly deni God exists.
0743487478|4.0|I was a little hesitant about purchasing this book.  I've worked with children for a good portion of my life and now have one of my own.  I've always used rewards and punishments.  Honestly, I really didn't know about any other way to teach children right from wrong..... until I read this book.<br /><br />The first half of the book describes why punishments and rewards are so detrimental to children.  I must say that while this was interesting, it certainly was long.  I found myself feeling like I was reading the same thing over and over and kept wondering \\"Ok already, so what's the alternative?\\"  The second half of the book dives into just that--what can you do instead of telling your child \\"good job\\" or putting them in time-out.<br /><br />While I'm not sure about how well some of his suggestions would pan out with real children, it certainly was an interesting read.  It definitely prompts you to re-examine everything you thought you knew about parenting.  And the basic premise that everything we do as parents should teach our children that we love them unconditionally is exceptional.  Even if you're not sure you agree with Kohn, I do suggest giving this book a try and broadening your perspective on how we raise our kids.
B0001GL3K4|5.0|Wonderful love story; definitely a \\"chick flick!; well-known actors really add spice and professionalism to the movie; the music fits the movie perfectly. I even bought the soundtrack! This is a movie that can be watched time and time again.
B0002234LS|4.0|This is the type of film U can only see once because there's such an unexpected twist. Johnny's acting is outstanding and definately one of his best roles. There need not be many more additional actors in the film as the story focus' completly on Johnny's character, Mort Rainey. A mild triller with great acting and directing, A Must See!! (Even if your not a Johnny Depp fan.)
6304779607|4.0|COBRA blows. Don't ever forget that. However, the movie sucks so badly that it rules! Whether Stalone is battling his enemies or his partner's bad-eating-habits, the action is always present and usually overflowing with corny intensity.<br /><br />The film starts off with a horrid scene in a grocery market where a crazy-lunatic enters a food store and immediately blows away various fruits and vegetables with his enormous shotgun with precise aim (maybe his parents forced him to eat those as a child). Stalone enters and says more corny things that may make you puke, and that is basically the basis of the entire film. Nothing more happens then that. However, there is one scene in the movie where the \\"Hunters of the New World\\" clang their axes together in an intimidating way that comes off (to me and my siblings, at least) as incredibly hilarious. We often raise our own arms and pretend to clang our own imaginary axes together during this scene, and it once freaked my old friend out. He never came over to my house again.<br /><br />The suspense in this film is mediocre like everything else in the movie, but a few scenes are awesome. In particular, I thoroughly enjoy the scene where the main-hacker attempts to murder the supermodel inside the intensive-care ward. That scene puts me in a surprisingly calm and good mood. The end scene in which the main-hacker gets thrown onto a gigantic meat-hook (which, incidentally, becomes penetrated through his stomach entirely) and gets hauled off into the metal-grinder is a truly uplifting moment in the film. If you are queasy about blood, guts, death, occult-like murders, and psychopathic, crazy axe-murderers, then stay away from this film. I rate it 4-stars because of how terrible AND how funny it is, even if it is unintentional.
B0000024TT|5.0|Great album when you're in a low-impact mood and looking for something mellow, but not boring. I am in awe of Cohen's duel talents of melody and songwriting. He'll have you humming a tune and marvelling at his choice of words at the same time. Key tracks are 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|This is a mellow album.  If you do not like well written mellow music then do not buy this or write reviews saying it sucks just because you do not like it. <br /> <br />This is not a Pink Floyd release.  It will not sound like Roger Waters.  It is no longer the Floydian hayday of the 70's (unfortunately). <br /> <br />What you have hear is a wonderful album with well written songs.  It is mellow, ambient, and full of melody.  Gilmour's guitar work is at it's best (well almost)..  <br /> <br />This is a great album, which does have some dull moments here and there, but don't get on here and trash it because it doesn't sound like The Wall or Darkside.
1932100385|5.0|THE CHINA STUDY is beyond superb - it is finally the SCIENTIFIC proof that was needed to prove that the Human Species/Animal NEEDS to be eating a PLANT DIET.  This book  is based on a 20-YEAR STUDY.  Our species is suffering beyond belief, and mainly because of the eating of other animals flesh and fluids.   The Human body has been designed (or has evolved) to exist on plant foods for optimum health.   The flesh (muscles, etc.) and fluids (dairy, eggs, etc.) of other animals contributes more vastly than anything else to our diseases plagueing the \\"rich societies\\" of this world;  for example:  diabetes; heart diseases; artery disease; many cancers such as breast and prostate cancers, colorectal cancer, etc; many autoimmune diseases such as arthritis, lupus, multiple sclerosis; osteoporosis, amongst others.     I CANNOT EMPHASIZE ENOUGH how important it is for this information to get to the general public, AND TO THE MEDICAL ESTABLISHMENT--your general doctor, dietician, etc. etc.  PLEASE GET AND READ AND LOAN TO OTHERS - or encourage them to get this book, along with \\"The World Peace Diet\\" by Will Tuttle, which encompasses all the issues of health/diet, brutality to animals, environment, wasteful production of grains/food that could feed the starving, and how it affects humans psychologically and spiritually.     The extreme, almost unbelievable, horrendous suffering that humans inflict upon billions upon billions of other animal species (~10 billion land animals for food per year in U.S. alone (~55 Billion in world), along with billions of sea life, and millions more for experimentation, skins & furs, entertainment, and all other commodities) comes back to us in the forms of suffering through diseases and violence towards humans.   And it is because our bodies are not designed/evolved to EAT OTHER BEINGS; just as giraffes, cows/steers, apes, horses/stallions, hippopotamuses(?), and other VIRILE, LARGE, STRONG ANIMALS do not!  I can only hope that others help get this information to the general public so that they will start expressing their outrage at being so misinformed.
B000002UB6|5.0|Go ahead and get this album... it's really good.... yes, the recordings <br />were done prior to Abbey Road (that is if you don't count the Spectorphilharmonic) <br />and so the sound to me just doesn't feel like their last album... it's not as experimental as Abbey Road and you don't feel like this is the direction the band was going in.... if you want to hear what the Beatles would have probably sounded like in the 70s... get Abbey Road before getting Let It Be... but this is still vintage Beatles... my favorite part of Let It Be is on I Got A Feeling when Paul and John carol together in a round..
B000E6UK5K|5.0|I dont understand all of the negative reviews, no its not Pink Floyd, but musically its so very good, the guitar work is great.  I love how mellow it is, I mean he is 60 years old, I prefer someone acting their age unlike the Stones...Gilmour's cd is just great.  No its not FLoyd people but there is no way to match that stuff but I do like this better than Division Bell and it still sounds really cool like floyd, noone can come close, Yes Roger Waters is a better lyrics writer but i listen to this for his guitar work and the craft.  What an artist Gilmour is.  I am so very thankful that he put this out, now if he would only play larger venue's so that more people could see him.  Thanks for a great CD I will take it over the junk out there today, buy this CD and let it take you away.....

B00006AW2G|5.0|Another reviewer, \\"exileonmainst\\" has questioned the value in the remastering on the Stones' ABKCO releases. Take it from me, since I actually own this CD. I replaced my old cds with the new remasters, and I can assure you that the remastered versions are FAR SUPERIOR to the old releases, and I do not own an SACD compatable cd player.  ABKCO's previous releases have been remixed, making the track less muddy sounding at high volume.  The level of clarity is amazing, and the mixes have been opened up to allow for a fuller sound. Definately worth the price of the new CD.
0440211727|4.0|John Grisham has quite a reputation as being a very prolific author.  Being the best selling author the 90's means you've got quite a reputation.  So I wanted to see what all the fuss was about and I picked up \\"A Time to Kill.\\"  Needless to say it was a good book, but there are a few moments where it glares.  As it is Grisham's first book (and believe me, in some areas it shows), I'd expect a lack of substance.  Surprisingly, there's substance.  But there are times when the book really rambles on for a very long time.<br /><br />When a ten year old black girl gets raped by two drunken high racists white men, the father is outraged and decides to take justice into his own hands.  So he gets a hold of an assault rifle and guns the two rapists down.  Now Carl Lee Haily is on trial for vigilant justice, and the whole world is watching.  The lawyer to defend Carl Lee is a young man named Jake Brigance.<br /><br />A reoccuring theme in the book seems to be the question, \\"What if it were your daughter?\\"  It posses a pretty thought provoking question, and whatever you decide on isn't wrong.  It's your interpretation.  The book touches on a lot of touchy areas.  Not just rape, vigilante justice, and the court systems, but it also touches on racism as well.  If you're easily offended by racism, this book is not for you.  It IS uncensored, but a lot of people tend to forget it's fiction, and doesn't express the authors true beliefs (any time an author touches race they're immediately labeled racist, you can usually find these accusations in one star reviews).  There are moments where it is offensive.  Even more so, the KKK plays a huge portion in the book.  There are a lot of common stereotypes, but it's nothing to get worked up about.  Again, it's fiction.<br /><br />Second, the book really does ramble from time to time.  Grisham himself even admitted it in his notes.  The book is fantastic, the story even better.  The problem is... there's too much mumbo jumbo and not enough story.  Also, as it nears the end, a lot of stuff happens that either doesn't make much sense, or is totally unbelievable.<br /><br />Grisham has a good story, but his characters are also a little flawed.  Very stereotypical in their roles.  Jake Brigance is the dashing hero, Carl Lee Haily the man in distress.  There's even one character he sort of forgets about.  In fact, he forgot about the character so much he never made it into any one page of the last two-hundred.  And there was no end to his story.<br /><br />So yes, it's a good book.  However, it does ramble.  It's a great story, perhaps one of the best works of fiction I've read in a long time.  Some characters are cliched, and if race-relations aren't your thing... this book isn't for you.  I'm not offended by the book (I am an African-American), but I seem to notice others are.<br /><br />Great story.  Rambles a bit from time to time, but overall, a good story.

006056251X|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Of the wallflower series, it is my favorite. I also liked the previous one, but I think I enjoyed this one just a tiny bit more. I agree with other reviewers that say that the series is getting better. Kleypas will have a hard time topping this one. Although I have every faith in her. I look forward to Daisy's story. <br /> <br />There isn't much more to say about the book, since other reviewers have covered pretty much everything. I agree that this book brings back memories of \\"Dreaming of You\\", I actually hoped that Derek Craven would be featured in this book, perhaps advising Sebastian on how to properly run the club, it was not so, and that dissapointed me a litle, but still... <br /> <br />I also agree with the reviewer that said that it is annoying the way Cam was refferred to in the book as a \\"boy\\". Come on, the man is 25. He is not a boy and hasn't been for a while. Kleypas actually has another book (Suddenly You) in which the main character (I think his name is Simon) is 25, and he was never referred to as a boy. I can't fathom the reason why she keeps calling Cam \\"a boy\\". <br /> <br />But all in all, the book is a great read. I can't wait to read the next in the series. I wonder with whom will Daisy end up. There was something there between her and Cam, but although I liked Cam as a supporting character, I'm not sure he is hero material. The possible suitor that is mentioned in the preview at the end of this book doesn't look promising either. So if Kleypas wants to finish the series with a bang, she had better come up with a great hero, because at least for me, that is a very important part of the book. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B000E6UK5K|4.0|There's a thousand reasons why Gilmour would not want to re-enter hell with Roger Waters, first among them being the primal need for a better bass player and less o/c lyric writer. What's on offer with this brilliant solo exercise is a seasoned and subtle appreciation for the tranquility of family. It's a rare man that gets what solace can be found in the company of one's own, and in the songs on evidence here, Gilmour has found just such solace and a terribly nuanced and sophisticated appreciation for the peace therein. <br />His soaring guitar runs scorch as ever across the musical landscapes. There is perhaps no more singular sustain than Gilmour's, save Santana and Fripp, and it is put to extraordinarily compelling dramatic effect in the delivery of these songs. The CD opens with an orchestral track arranged by no less a composer and conductor than Zbiegniew Preisner, whose homage to his friend Krysztof Kieslowski, and whose film Bleu he scored, remain among the finest orchestral works of the late 20th Century. Though brief, it is a riveting introduction. David Crosby and Graham Nash lend their soaring harmonies to the title track, perhaps advising Stills and Young that they still have a few of their own surprises left to pull. Throughout, in both his singing style, the thematic content and the orchestration of the songs, Gilmour also evidences the benefits of working with and having as a friend Paul McCartney. <br />In short, this is a great leap beyond his previous solo work and the neurotic obsessions of Roger Waters that needed, and judging by CA IRA still need, placating. Whether Gilmour tours this stuff or not, hopefully he will pick up the pen and continue to write. All of us of a certain age who have gotten past the greasy kid stuff welcome a writer who can speak in a sophisticated musical and lyrical language to the concerns of our years, without the conceit of someone like Elvis Costello. This is just such a record.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|You may hate the Bush Doctrine or love it.  Either way, this movie has the pithiest (and most unrepeatable/unprintable) summary of it ever.  I am the mother of twenty-somethings and conservative, but I found the film hysterically funny.  I did prefer the censored version that I saw in the theatres to the one here.  The uncensored one was a bit too much for a middle-aged mom.  And the songs are great.  I may now almost have a soft spot in my heart for Kim Jung Il.  And what cinematic justice for Hans \\"Brix\\"!  All in all a \\"must-see\\" if you are not easily offended by college humor.
0895260131|5.0|Today what we see and what we hear about Islam are two very different things. We are constantly told that Islam is a peaceful religion, and that the radical Muslims are small in number. Yet we see attacks in this country and in others, and even more threats of violence if we don't conform to terrorist agenda. We see violent protests to cartoons. We see Hamas elected into power in Palestine, the extremist Ahmadinejad elected in Iran. <br /> <br />In order to fight terrorism we need to truly understand Islam and why so many Muslims are radicals. Unfortunately today it is difficult to get honest information. Today's Universities are filled with extreme left-wing Muslim apologists, and even with Muslim radicals themselves. Why is that? Funding. Harvard's Middle Eastern Studies program, for example, is funded with Saudi money (yes the same country that funds and promotes Wahhabism, and produced most of the 9-11 terrorists). And the Danish paper which published the Muhammad cartoons proved its point that media is indeed censoring itself when it comes to Islamic issues. How many papers in the U.S. published the images, even on their website, for those people who wanted to be fully informed about the issue? Not many. <br /> <br />That is why this book is so important. It unapologetically states the truth about Islam, and why there is such a large violent and extreme element within it. Spencer discusses the history of Muhammad, the reasons for Islamic expansion (here's a hint: it wasn't peaceful), its theology, and its impact on the world today, all in a clear concise manner. <br /> <br />I would also recommend reading The Sword of the Prophet by Serge Trifkovic (ISBN: 1928653111), which is similar to this book, but goes into slightly more detail; The Legacy of Jihad by Andrew Bostom (ISBN: 1591023076), which goes into detail about Muslim expansion and growth; While Europe Slept by Bruce Bawer (ISBN: 0385514727) about Islamic extremists in Europe and the threat they pose; and Future Jihad by Walid Phares (ISBN: 140397074) about terrorist motives and strategies (this one is frightening). Also I would encourage people to visit jihadwatch.org for truthful and uncensored daily updates on Islamic extremism throughout the world.

B00005JOT1|3.0|A Good Woman was screened at festival here in Toronto alongside with films like Being Julia, but it's been kept on the shelves until last month when it finally gets it's North America release. Now I know it's delayed for the reason of marketability. I find this film to be dull in it's direction and it results in a nice looking period film lack luster, comedy, or drama. It's not as good as An Ideal Husband(also a Wilde adaptation), and it's not worthed the participations the two leading ladies.<br /><br />Helen Hunt(Mrs. Erlynne) is an experienced seductress with a bad reputation, and she's been with most of the married men in New York. When she's shunned by society, she flees the city to Italy in search of another sponsor. She managed to connect to a wealty young married man named Robert Windemere(Mark Umbers) who secretly carried an affair with her and provides for her finiancially. Meanwhile, Mrs. Windemere(Scarlette Johansson) is clueless about her husband's secret affair with the notorious Mrs. Erlynne when the whole town's gossiping about her arrival. Mrs. Erlynne also attracts the attention of another wealthy suitor named Tuppy(Tom Wilkinson) who eventually becomes infatuated by her and wants to give her his all. The real mystery of Mrs. Erlynne's past starts to unravel, and her must not reveal her secrets and lies in order to help save Windemere's marriage and redemn herself....<br /><br />Helent Hunt at times seems to be channeling Glenn Close's expressions from Dangerous Liasons, and she's quite convincing as woman wearing a mask. Unfortunately, the role is limited to a one-note and not multi-layered performance. Got to give her credit for being so glamorous and against type. Scarlette Johansson is also kind of low-key in this film. However, she did get to have a few tearful moments. I must say that Tom Wilkinson is superb in a supporting role.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I rented this movie, and when I finished watching it I went to Amazon and bought it.  I loved the story, the history, the characters, and the message.  This movie did such a great job of showing that there are always two sides to a story - two sides between individuals, families, industries, walks of life, and cultures.  The cast was awesome!
B000CS45QU|5.0|I have all of Beth's previous releases, and I think she's given us her best work yet! It was worth the long wait!

B00005JOHI|3.0|I thought it wouldn't measure up to the BBC and I was right.  To be fair, a 2 to 2 and a half hour limit brings its restrictions and really, the film shouldn't have been attempted.  Colin Firth runs rings around MacFadyen who can't act to save his life.  Dressing Donald Sutherland up to look the part was not enough to take his acting beyond that of school play proportions.  That said, Rosamund Pike was delightful as Jane and would potentially have fitted just as well into the BBC production.  The cinematography is excellent and the music is breath-taking.  I trust the producers lost money on this project which, coming so relatively soon after the definative BBC production, was nothing more than an effort to cash in.  I am grateful that none of the BBC actors and actresses took part.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you blinked and missed this jewel of a series then here is your chance to not be left behind in the 21st century.  Without a doubt one of the most innovative, fun, creative, enjoyable and \\"shiny\\" shows as well as cast of characters I have seen in years.  Joss nailed it with this show, it is a pity that the ride was this short.  If you saddle up with the crew of the Serenity you're traveling with a group that \\"gets it\\" from day one.  The cast interaction is absolute magic from the get go.   Buy this set, and you'll have a hard time not watching them over and over as well as singing the theme song and then you to will answer YES if asked, Dong Mah?! by the Captain.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Son Et Lumiere    7/10 <br />A great into track that leads into intertiatic ESP very smoothly. It feels like they should be played as one song no need to make different tracks. <br />Intertiatic E.S.P.    9/10 <br />Sensational but not quite the kick in the teeth that you would expect this album to open with. <br />Roulette Dares (The Haunt Of)  8/10  <br />The weakest of the full length tracks, but still very good. Some of the more mellow melodies toward the end are defiantly the high light here. <br />Tira Me A Las Aranas    6/10  <br />A little instrumental that isn't needed. <br />Drunkship Of Lanterns   10/10  <br />Hyper and ultra funky, gets the blood flowing. <br />Eria Tarka     9/10  <br />Yet another title I'm going to have to look up the meaning. Great use of juxtapose melodic styles. <br />Cicatriz E.S.P.     10/10 <br />This is my favorite song and it is the longest song on the album. Cicatriz is hard hitting and energetic until it dissolves into a spacey ambient session. Then it comes back around with a funky jam that makes you forget all else that has come before it on the song and even lose track of yourself for a while. <br />This Apparatus Must Be Unearthed  10/10 <br /> The friendliest song for hard rockers, short and to the point.  <br />Televators     10/10 <br />The most accessible track on the album, but it highly depressing and not something you want to listen to while driving.  <br />Take The Veil Cerpin Taxt   10/10 <br /> This one grows on you. Takes you to a place filled with anxiety and morbidity.  <br />
B000AYEI5Y|5.0|Sometimes there are just songs that hit home and sing to the current events in life and the world. James Blunt offers a collections of often-meloncholy, but extremely sensual music. Very thoughtful and intuitive.
0689853637|5.0|I bought this book for my 3 year old son.  He returns to it again and again.  He particularly loves the little house on the last page.  It's got christmas lights that he can turn on and off.  It's a simple story and the pop-ups are visually stunning.  I think that's what is so appealing to him.  He loves to study how the page pops up.  I will buy more of Subuda's books in the future.
B00005JMJG|5.0|this movie is amazing.  it is an honest, beatuiful, and funny look at relationships.  it is definitely not a normal romantic comedy, but charlie kaufman always keeps people guessing.  the score by john brion is also great, just as good as the one in punch-drunk love, which he did as well.  that is also a good movie, but anyway, this movie is one of my all time favorites, trust me it is that good.
B000001DTM|5.0|\\"Achtung Baby\\" is the best U2 album of all time and it still sounds fresh just like it did 15 years ago. When this album came out, Grunge exploded on the rock scene and took control. But unlike the great bands of Nirvana, Alice in Chains, and Soundgarden, U2 is still around to still play great songs from \\"Achtung Baby\\". Sure U2 might not be as good or even suck now with their corporate rock style simplicity of the 2000's, but they are still great in concert. To hear them play \\"One\\", \\"The Fly\\", \\"Until The End of The World\\", and \\"Wild Horses\\" live or on this CD is just a breath of fresh air. This is the album that should have won a grammy for album of the year, not HTDAAB. This album is strong from start to finish. Every song is upbeat, fast pace, and there isn't a bad song on the album. Remember we only have one life so don't miss out listining to one of the best rock albums of all time.
B00005MP58|5.0|I love this movie in every form, yet on DVD, Pride and Prejudice is at its best.

0800141660|5.0|I daresay that one cannot find a more stunning and diverting entertainment than this classic story of love.  Well-Done!  One must view it more than once to truly appreciate its beauty and wit.
0930289234|5.0|One of the top three comic books recommended to me by bigtime fans.<br /><br />Tale follows a group of mostly retired super heroes who begin to worry when one of them is murdered. Investigations lead to several flashbacks of the formation of the super hero league, personal problems, love stories and the overall theme of what do you do with super heroes who have lost it or become obsolete.<br /><br />Enjoy.
078681859X|1.0|The premise for this book was interesting, but the style was so cumbersome.  I could not get past the first few chapters out of pure annoyance with all of the sidebars and the writing style.
0553801503|1.0|It is amazing how rich and full the first three books were and how amazing that this book was full of nothing. I was very happy to finish this last book it was like a burden was lifted off of me. I'm sorry to say that I found this book was a waste of my time. Knowing me I will give the next book a try.  I'm hoping that this was a dud in a great series.
1400032717|4.0|This is an amazing story from a completely unique perspective.  Can't wait to see the movie
B00005JOWF|4.0|In reading the previous reviews and hearing other movie-goers comments, I'm surprised at people's expectations for this movie.  The movie isn't deep, but it is very effective at what it's trying to accomplish - making a graphic novel come to life. <br />It's stunning visually.  The use of colors and other symbology make it very visually interesting. The special effects are very fun.  It's what I expect from this genre. <br />This is film candy - enjoy it for what it is!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This is a thoroughly enjoyable movie that is paced wonderfully and acted brilliantly.  It can be seen over and over again like you would with \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" or \\"Harry met Sally\\"
B00003CXCT|5.0|Worth the money that i spent since i ordered it from international location.
B000BB1MHS|2.0|I never read the book but seeing this movie made me run out the next day to get it. I am a Burton fan and was disappointed in his interpretation.  <br /> <br />I admit I am a fan of the original but more for nostalgia than the quality of the movie. If you revisit the old you may find it not exactly what you remember as a kid. The tunnel scene is a bit acid trippy. Other elements well it is just plain dated.  <br /> <br />There are some parts in both movies that are exactly like the book. Hard to say why each interpreter chose what they chose, but they are positive in both. It is the creative license that is always questioned.The newer version took too much for my taste. <br /> <br />The new. Well.... it was fairly well cast. It was pretty good in the visual department with modern technology being able to give us a better fantasy world, but the Depp/Burton portrayal of Wonka is just wierd and creepy. The father-son candy dentist thing I found just disconcerting. Creative license? This is why I ran out and read the book. As I expected, nothing about the Depp/Burton Wonka resembled anything  that I interpretted from reading the book. From that demented scene of the burning dolls fireworks dislay to the freakish flashback and that stupid baby voice.  Burton turned it into a story about father and sons.(and not with any continuity) I interpret Dahls story as being about about the consequences of obnoxious children and over indulgent parents. The ultimate moral: being good will bring rewards. The first movie atleast attempts this with the Slugworth honesty plot.  <br /> <br />Wonka should be a witty, prankster sort of fun character.  I see more of a Martin Short type playing him. Gene wilder was not quite the book either but he captured that \\"twinkle in his eye\\" of being in on the joke, that I found to be Dahl's truer intent. Also Oompa loompas should be leprechuan-ish and funny. That character looks like he was from Gilligans Island. <br /> <br />My advice RENT this movie before you by it!
0380789035|5.0|Much of the action in this books takes place in Wisconsin.  If you've been there, you will always be a little suspicious of the places used as setting in the book.  Story was well written and imaginative
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my husband. All I can really say is that he loves the CD. He's a Johnny Cash fan, even though he doesn't listen to a lot of country music. He said it was awesome.
B000002H2H|5.0|This is by far Metallicas greatest album. It has the best guitar tone you will ever hear. It has this super heavy deathly crunch that will leave you in awe.   <br />Fight Fire with Fire- 10/10 Guitar tone is killer and Hetlields vokills are deadly <br />Ride the Lighting- 10/10 see above <br />For Whom the Bell Tolls- 10/10 awsome song that you can really get into <br />Fade to Black- 9/10 beautiful guitar playing. It is so stupid that people gave Metallica a hard time about this song back in the 80s because its a ballad. They should be incredibly greatful that they got to witness Metallcia in their prime. <br />Trapped Under Ice- 10/10 My favorite. This is a totally killer thrasher that is fun to sing along to. <br />Escape- 10/10 Another cool one to sing along to. Awsome lyrics and killer solo just like all the other songs. <br />Creeping Death-10/10 See above <br />Call of the Ktulu-9/10 Awsome instrumental that starts off real slow and nice sounding but then turns into a total thasher. Dave Musatine claims to have written some this but I don't see how, he was far to crazy at the time to write something as involved as this.  <br />Megadeth is a better band though. <br />BUY THIS ALBUM RIGHT NOW!!!
B00005LB50|4.0|Ok, i'll admit it, i have been a Buffalo Springfield fan since their 1st album came out.  I have all their issues on vinal (eh?).  What makes the box set cool is the demos and out takes.  But if your not an almost rabid fan, buy the three albums.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|The sticker on the cover heralds Gilmour as &#34;The Voice and Guitar of Pink Floyd&#34;, and that is what you will be hearing. This is obviously not an album for Roger Waters purists. Many of these songs are love songs, mellow, peaceful, happy. This may be a shock to fans of Floyd's exquisitely sad songs, but I personally find it a welcome change. Gilmour has found his island and seems quite happy there. If you like Gilmour's signature sound, and are prepared to hear things both similar and different to Pink Floyd, you will like this album. I highly recommend this album to any Gilmour fan. It's a million times better than his early solo efforts, and sounds more like a really good post-Waters Pink Floyd album, if a bit more subdued.
B00006RCNW|5.0|I am a TV sitcom watcher from the 80's. I grew up on shows like 21 Jump Street, Dukes of Hazard, The Hulk and Knight Rider. Come to modern day and how can you not be a fan of Lost, The Office, My Name is Earl and the 200 reality shows. With all on TV, I never was able to watch The Shield. About 2 months ago I purchased season 1 and a few short weeks later I am almost done with season 4. This Show grabs you from the first episode and before you know it you have watched three or four of them in one sitting. You can't turn your attention to something else until you know what happens with Vic and his team. I wish I could write more but I am off to watch the rest of season 4.
B000067J1Y|5.0|Even though this movie came out several years ago as a spoof of \\"Top Gun\\" the humor is still current.  Charlie Sheen is a great comedic actor even though he has played some emotionally charged dramatic roles quite well, as in \\"Platoon.\\"  To enjoy this movie fully you have to forget about reality and enjoy both the subtle humor as well as the slapstick.  Interestingly, part of the movie involves an attack on Saddam Hussein.  Who would've known!
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I Must say that \\"Pride & Prejudice\\"  Has taken my under a spell.  This movie is fantastic.  It has got to be one of the best love story's of all time.  The music that goes to the movie is perfect.  Absolutely Beautiful!  Ive watched this movie so many times its crazy.  I am the kind of person who buys a movie and watchs it once.  But i cant get enough of this movie.  After searching for the soundtrack i finally found it on here.  Any other music in this movie... and it wouldnt quit be the same.  I recomend not only the movie but the beautiful soundtrack!
B00005T30L|4.0|In Ghost World, two young people face the real world after graduating from high school in a small town. It's a well made movie. I've read the comic,and it's a lot more subtle than this movie about Enid's struggles.
B00005JMCW|4.0|Lindsay Lohan is a very funny actress; this movie does not disappoint. <br /> <br />Jamie Lee Curtis is also a sucess. <br /> <br />Anna is the typical 15/16 yearold girl in California, but an amazing guitar player who also has a huge crush on Chad Michael Murray (not in real life; his character, Jake). <br /> <br />Tess Coleman (J. L. Curtis) is a physiciatrist who's just written a book about mother-daughter relationships and has found true love again, after her husband died 3 years ago. <br /> <br />The story begins on an ordinary Thursday, but today Anna's band has been offered an AMAZING audition at \\"The House of Blues,\\" or something like that. <br /> <br />This audition means an INCREDIBLE chance for their band- but there's a catch: it's tomorrow night, the night of Dr. Coleman's rehearsal dinner and Anna can't miss that! <br /> <br />That night at a Chinese restaurant, Anna and Dr. Coleman argue loudly until they are interrupted by \\"Pei Pei's Crazy Mother,\\" who gives them each a fortune cookie. Immediately after they read it, a strange earthquake occurs, one that no one but themselves felt. <br /> <br />The next day, Anna and her mother have switched bodies. <br /> <br />The movie is hilarious, but I think that, trying to reach more teen audiences, Dr. Coleman gains respect for her daughter, but the daughter fairly little for her mother's lifestyle; in other words, the makers of the movie sided too closely with the teenager.
B000007MVD|5.0|Many of the songs on these discs could have been hits for The Beatles if they hadn't already saturated the charts. <br /> <br />Their tones are much more American than the pop hits that made them <br />popular. It sounds like they have different instruments and amplifiers. <br /> <br />New Beatles songs after all these years.
B0007Y08IS|1.0|In the beginning of the film, Team America become overly vigilant against clichd Arab terrorists and blow up the Eiffel Tower. The puppets kick box their enemies -without getting tangled up in their strings (miraculously). However after these few initial funny gags, the film sinks into silly sex jokes, bathroom barf humor and redneck politics.  <br /> <br />The creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker have created the ultimate propaganda film for adolescents. Friends of my 13 year old son love it. Most people over 25 I know hated it.  <br /> <br />These South Park creators in a recent Time Magazine called George Bush a lovable \\"Homer Simpson\\" a flawed character, but with a \\"good heart\\" - the man who many consider at best a front man for the corporate far right, and others a war criminal for instigating an \\"illegal\\" oil war resulting in hundreds of thousands of needless deaths (according to the highly reputable Lancet). <br />  <br />As a true propaganda film, it pretends to be even handed, but with astounding politically naivety that generally elevates the right wing media generated Bush myth. Overall this film has become becomes a bully boy pulpit for the far right. And like much far right rhetoric, it lacks logic, evidence of their crimes and simply utilizes the weapons of juvenile insults as gross-out locker room bully humor. <br /> <br />
B000002UA5|5.0|This album may catch many off guard with an uncanny name \\"Ummagumma\\" (which is British schoolboy slang for sex). But this album shows the creative efforts of the band after Barret's departure of the band, as it shows the band in transition and experimenting with different styles and techniques (not to mention the many sound effects!). The album shows a method that would continue on for years to come: Waters and Gilmour write songs with lyrics and Wright and Mason create the songs that are 100% instrumental. The live album is very brief (4 songs) but they are very long, and includes a performance of \\"Careful With that Axe, Eugene\\" (an interesting instrumental). This is a very creative psychadelic album and I'd recommend it for any Pink Floyd fan.
B000AYEIZY|5.0|I was a fan of Cream in their original iteration. They haven't missed a beat. If anything this talented trio is more cohesive then before. Eric Claptons inspired playing is both powerful and considered.

B000BNX3B4|5.0|Great movie.  I loved Diane Lane and John Cusack both.  The movie is funny and right on the mark as far as the internet dating experiences I've had myself...it is a movie I will watch again and again.
B0000041LA|3.0|I totally agree with these 2 reviews<br /><br />I believe the fault here lies more with Previn, and thus holds back Ashkenazy \\"somewhat\\", as Ashkenazy is not stellar as one would expect.<br />, There are some high points, but overall I strongly agree with A Music Fans recommend of Krainev, the finest set on record.Yes I've heard all avaliable recordings in comparison.<br />If you like this set then OBVIOUSLY you will vote on my review as follows:<br />, no this review was not helpful<br />But at least I'm truthful, w/o the hype.<br />Besides I've heard all the avaliable, while others that promote this set has not.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|Even though as widely reported the actual movie score by Gustavo Santaolalla is only 13 minuets long, it still sets the mood of the movie and when repeated on the soundtrack brings back the emotions.  We enjoyed the story and then the movie.  Now the soundtrack compliments and adds to the total experience.
0486266885|5.0|It's a classic AND it's actually good. I loved it. I expected it to be much harder to read and boring. It wasn't, and it's now one of my favorite books. BEST ONE TO BUY. Only 64 pages.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Having missed the original airings on Fox, and probably the extreme frustration of having it foolishly cancelled, I have become a believer in Joss Whedon's look into the future.  I don't know how many times I and friends have watched these gems, thankfully without advertisement, and still look forward to watching them with pleasure.  No other series has grabbed me like this one has and I personally would have liked several more seasons of this crew.  Beautifully done.
B000AARKOO|5.0|This movie was fantastic on so many levels.  The emotion, the action, and all the graphic and realistic make-up.  This is one I will watch over and over...comparable to Braveheart or Gladiator!

B00005JOFQ|5.0|I am so tired of reading/hearing criticisms about this film having centralized \\"gay\\" characters.  And stop calling it a \\"gay movie.\\"  A movie cannot be gay.  Unless it conducts in sexual activities with other gay movies.     <br /> <br />If homosexuality is a problem for you, then why even waste your time critiquing this film?  But if you can get past it, this film is not about being gay; if anything, other themes of love, loss of innocence, and survival are much more pronounced.     <br /> <br />Clearly, this was an Oscar favorite for good reason.  Its directing and cinematography are flawless, and the acting could not be better.  It is true that (as many have mentioned) parts of it can be slow at times; however, it only adds to the laconic feel of the film's setting (which is crucial to the film's central themes and symbols).  And if you read the original writing of Annie Proux, you will see that this film stays true to  the original story (which any good movie should, when it is based on a writing piece).  But, perhaps more importantly, it can feel slow because it is a reflection of real life.  Life is not a collection of well-scripted coversations with things happening constantly.  Life can be, at times, slow and boring- and Ang Lee did an excellent job of portraying real people, in real life, falling in love.   <br /> <br />For me, this was the best movie of 2005 even if it lost to Crash for the Oscars.  The sadness of this film stayed with me for days after I watched this film, which I certainly did not anticipate with any movie.  Love it or hate it, this film stirred up a lot of attention.  It made a powerful statement about humanity and intolerance that still echoes in our society today.  This movie is sure to be a classic, and a must-have for any movie collector.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This is a beautiful film in every sense--the look, the feel, the sound, the plot, the message...one of Miyazaki's best.  While _Spirited Away_ got a lot of press (what with the Oscar's and all), this earlier film deserves even more praise. <br /> <br />With all the other reviews, I don't need to get into too much detail, but one note--it may be animated, but it isn't for all children.  Some of the action scenes and fantasy animals will scare kids. <br /> <br />All in all, one of my favorite films and one I recommend to everyone.
6305841861|4.0|If you have never seen a evil dead movie you are in for a treat. What you take from the movie is all up to you. Some may find it scary and some funny.I see it as a fine creative/artistic work of film. It is worth checking out or buying,if your sick like me:) <br />
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|Beautiful movie but more reminiscent of the Romantic era versus Regency England.  More Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester or Catherine and Heathcliff than Lizzy and Mr. Darcy.  And I would have preferred that they left off the \\"kissing\\" ending that Americans saw in theatres and on the DVD.  In Britain they left it out because people started laughing in the theatres and I must admit that I had to stiffle a giggle myself.
B000063DFQ|5.0|This is the first Iron Maiden album I ever got. When I heard \\"Revelations\\" on one of the music channels I was hooked. Truely an awesome album.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|A young American in a Far East prison meets a mysterious stranger who offers him the training and focus he needs to become what he desires most: an unstoppable force to combat evil. Upon his release, the young American joins the stranger, a man called Ducard, in the mountain domicile of ninja cult leader Ra's Al Ghul, where he begins refining his skills of combat and stealth in addition to learning the arts of deception, intimidation, and theatricality. During his time with this mysterious \\"League of Shadows,\\" the young man reveals the secrets of his tragic life and his obsessive quest for the means to fight injustice. We learn that his name is Bruce Wayne, and he is the only surviving heir to the great Wayne Family fortune of Gotham City. His parents brutally murdered before his eyes in an alley when he was only 8, Bruce has spent every moment since then acquiring knowledge and skills to help him in his as yet unclear goal of becoming an enemy of crime. Once his training with the League of Shadows is complete, Bruce is ready to return to Gotham and begin his fight against the criminal element, but maniacal Ra's Al Ghul has other plans for him! After a daring escape that appears to spell the end for Ra's, Bruce finds himself on a jet plane bound for Gotham, his loyal family butler, Alfred, at his side. On the trip home, Bruce tells Alfred the nature of his travels these past 7 years and of his plans to take on the villains of Gotham with a dramatic dual-identity meant to strike fear into the hearts of evil-doers. With the help of Alfred and a Wayne Enterprises employee named Lucius Fox, a scientific and technological genius, Bruce takes on the identity of his greatest childhood fear, the bat, setting up shop in the caves beneath his family mansion and developing an unequalled arsenal of gadgets and gear to aid him in his fight against crime. Wearing the mask of a billionaire playboy by day and stalking the rooftops of Gotham at night in the guise of the Batman, Bruce becomes both a myth and a living legend to the downtrodden people of the corrupt and dangerous city.  The Batman first sets his sights on exposing notorious mob boss Carmine Falcone, enlisting the aid of childhood friend Rachel Dawes, Gotham's beautiful assistant D.A., and the one trustworthy cop in the city, the kindly Police Sergeant Jim Gordon. However, the Bat's investigation into Falcone soon uncovers much more than he expected, revealing a plot to victimize the citizens of Gotham and involving the sinister and powerful Dr. Jonathan Crane of Arkham Asylum and a higher power so evil that even the arrogant Carmine Falcone is intimidated! <br /> <br />After director Joel Schumacher destroyed the promising Bat-franchise created by Tim Burton's 1989 film, \\"Batman,\\" taking it in the direction of the enjoyable yet extremely campy kids' TV show of the 1960's rather than treating the Bat with the respect his fans demand and deserve, it seemed the Dark Knight would never be allowed to grace the silver-screen again. Then came \\"Batman Begins,\\" a fantastic new take on the bat more true to the character comic and animation fans know and love! This is a dark, brooding, even terrifying Batman, angry at the criminal element that destroyed his parents and his childhood, and dead-set on bringing justice to the city his family once nurtured and loved. The always wonderful Christian Bale seems born to play the Bat, bringing the right amount of intensity and emotion to both hero and secret identity. Katie Holmes is both beautiful and noble as the high-idealed Rachel Dawes. Gary Oldman continues to impress and surprise with the most perfect incarnation of Jim Gordon I could ever hope for! And, though I never would have thought to cast him myself, Michael Caine shines as Alfred Pennyworth, bringing his own charming and original take to the role. The great Morgan Freeman is wise and endearing as Lucius Fox, the Bat's gadget man. Of course, we can't forget the amazing villains so crucial to any Batman tale! By far the favorite is Cillian Murphy, who is fantastically creepy as Dr. Jonathan Crane, AKA the Scarecrow, taking the role right to the top at times, but never going over! A perfect Batman villain performance! Liam Neeson is always flawless, this time playing the role of Henri Ducard, a man with a past as dark and mysterious as The Batman's. And the magnificent Tom Wilkinson is terrific as the sleazy crime-boss Carmine Falcone. The story is inspired! The choice of subject and characters is perfect for a tale of the very origins of the Dark Knight, everything about it reflecting the core subjects of fear, deception, theatricality, intimidation, symbolism, madness, and the nature of justice! These are the things the Batman is all about! I certainly hope there will be many more films in this new Batman line, as long as they all share the strength and realism of this one! A tale involving the Mad Hatter would be fantastic! Might I suggest Paul Giamatti? How about Crispin Glover as the Joker? And Christopher Lloyd is long overdue to play Mr. Freeze! <br /> <br />What director/writer Christopher Nolan and co-writer David S. Goyer created with \\"Batman Begins\\" is nothing less than a masterpiece for the superhero film genre. There is nothing \\"cartoony\\" about this Batman, something that truly differentiates it from all the live-action, big-screen attempts that came before it. There are scenes of such perfection that they demand mentioning. For example, Cillian Murphy's brilliant performance in the bowels of Arkham Asylum, as he boils-over with anticipation at a 2nd encounter with Batman. There's also the wonderful scene where Batman converses briefly with Jim Gordon outside his own modest home. I love all the Jim/Batman scenes, and Batman's use of live bats as \\"backup\\" at Arkham was fantastic! My favorite scene by far, though, must be the final scene between Batman and Gordon, where we are given a drool-enducing bit of foreshadowing in the form of asimple playing card!  <br /> <br />The 2-disc DVD of \\"Batman Begins\\" is just glorious! In addition to getting this outstanding film in widescreen, you also get the theatrical trailer, a hilarious MTV 2005 Movie Awards skit called \\"Tankman Begins\\" (starring Jimmy Fallon and Andy Dick, with a special appearance by Napoleon Dynamite!), and a large pile of other extras! There are 8 featurettes on topics like special effects, the development of the film, Christian Bale's physical transformation into Bruce Wayne, the unusual new Batmobile, and much more! Yes, the new Batmobile is very tank-like, and I would love to see a little style added to it in future installments (its crude simplicity is understandable in the beginning). Maybe smooth out the body just a bit and add a couple of bat-wing fins. Of course, I'd rather see less style than TOO MUCH. You also get image galleries and gadget and character overviews. Plus, if you pick up the DELUXE 2-disc Edition (as I did), you also will get a very nice, exclusive comic book and a case to hold the book and DVD together. The high-quality comic features three stories, The Man Who Falls (1989), Bat-Man in The Case of the Chemical Syndicate (1939), and a 48-page excerpt from The Long Halloween (1996). All three stories present situations and characters reflected in the film. Any Batman fan should love the 2-disc Deluxe Edition, just as any Batman fan should love \\"Batman Begins!\\" This is the Bat-film we've been waiting and hoping for! Now, give us many more!  <br />
B000063COX|5.0|This is one of their best albums. All of the songs on it are amazing. If you haven't heard this album your missing out.
006056251X|4.0|I usually skip plot summaries because there are so many here.  Thus far Lisa Kleypas has never failed to write a book i did not enjoy.  I haven't read all her books yet, but am slowly catching up.  This new addition to the Wallflower series is so good that I read it in less than 24 hours (and yes, I did go to work!).  Evie was the wallflower that I felt we knew the least about as readers.  We knew she was shy, stammered and had mean relatives.  I was happy to read her story at last.  She was developed well.  I just love that in this series we get to meet the characters and get to know them in the previous book before they get together in their own novel.  Romance novels aren't written for any surprises, so I think this is a way to not need to waste time getting to know the characters themselves in their book before they are a couple - we already know them as individuals and where they fit into the circle of friends.  Besides giving Evie some backbone, this book really does make us like her rake husband.  Sometimes I am not convinced, but Kleypas can pull it off<br /><br />This book also does a good job of catching us up on some lod characters from the series.  Not as much as in other books, but I am sure we will catch up with Daisy's (and Cam's?!?) story.<br /><br />The one weakness in this book was the dual side stories of Evie's extended family (two sides of it) coming after her.  It seems like Kleypas probably had much more to say in regards to each story and had to edit each story somewhat and it left both a little short.  Also, key events in this book are played out in great detail - I didn't mind so much but I could see how others did.  I didn't mind another Kleypas novel set in a house for gambling.  In my mind not much can ever top her book (of somewhat similar plot) \\"Dreaming of You\\" but this book holds its own both as a Kleypas work and a part of the Wallflower series.  I loved it!
B000063DHL|5.0|This album is really good with some awesome songs on it. In my opinion it has some of Steve's best playing. For example listen to \\"Sea Of Madness\\" and \\"Stranger In A Strange Land\\".
B00000J6AG|2.0|One good song on the entire album - South side with Gwen Stefani.  Rest of the songs have some sort of rap guy and not much if any Moby.  Waste of money
B000063DFN|5.0|This is the ultimate Iron Maiden album! I love every song on it. Especially \\"The Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\\". Trust me this is the best Iron Maiden album.
0380715430|4.0|An Informative and amusing look at the English language in its many forms.
B000063DI9|4.0|\\"Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son\\" is a great album except for the key boards. When I heard this album I was very surprised that they were using key boards. Anyhow it is a good album and \\"Infinite Dreams\\" is one of my favorite songs.
B000DZIGDU|4.0|Lean and surreal. Yeah it's been done before but here's one for gulf 90's. Good actors and stunning visuals hold your interest and imagination. Well done.
B00005JNX0|5.0|After seeing this at a friend's house, we had to run out and buy it... Mind you, I have no little kids in the house--we adults loved it!  My almost-adult daughters love it, too.  The humor ranges from slapstick (kid stuff) to deeper adult humor (that's only \\"gotten\\" by the adults).  Very creative, very funny!  Some deeper meaning, too-- after all, don't we all wonder if we're black with white stripes or white with black stripes?<br /><br />I really recommend this one!
B000002UTI|5.0|If anyone ever bothered to ask me who my favorite Beatle was (I'd probably have to reincarnate in a time-warp as a 14 year old girl back in 1963 for it to happen), I'd say unquestionably, John.  John Lennon was the most important poet in English in the second half of the twentieth century (including Bob Dylan, Mick Jaggar, Dylan Thomas, Bukowski, Seamus Heany, whoever), hands down.  His \\"greatest hits\\" collections read like synopses of every issue central to the age.  No poet is more topical, deeper feeling, more essential on the things that count most.  His musical genius still resonates within us -  indisputably - but many of the lyrics are immortal.  I've felt at times that should humanity still be around a couple of centuries hence, much of rock & roll, as a phenomenon, will be regarded as a footnote to the work of Lennon.  I make this claim based of the fact that for humanity to survive, the world is, necessarily, going to have to look like what John envisages in his crowning masterpiece \\"Imagine\\".  The soundtrack to the film made about him bearing the title of that wonderful song is my favorite collection in short format and belongs in every home, if not for you, then for your descendents, as a reminder of what the best of this age was, and what we could have been, had everyone been able to listen.
B00005JOFO|5.0|I see three of the \\"critics\\" here totally MISSED the point of this excellent film; two are obviously VERY homophobic; sorry \\"critics\\", but I felt BROKEBACK and the brilliant film CAPOTE were FAR superior to CRASH; this film obivously got the Best Film Oscar because  Hollywood all too sadly still suffers from anti-Gay prejudice; the same was VERY evident when the excellent film GODS AND MONSTERS came out a few years back.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|I am so pleased to have this album in my collection. David Gilmour has been a guitar legend for nearly forty years now, and I don't need to waste my energy or your time chronicalling his epic contributions to modern music. Suffice it to say, with this release, he draws on his vast stylistic background to fuse and meld a delightful range and scope of absolutely stunning music.<br /><br />Does it sound like Pink Floyd - well yes and no. From the very first guitar note, any fan will readily recognize David's distinctive style of playing and know this is related to much of what came before. That being said, this album is a smoother, more flowing collections of songs that are at once challenging and relaxing. If comparisons had to be made, I would say this album most closely resembles the mellower bits of MEDDLE, particularly on the songs THEN I CLOSE MY EYES and WHERE WE START.<br /><br />You won't find any driving hard rock songs like ALL LOVERS ARE DERANGED or RUN LIKE HELL on this album, but there are plenty of tasty guitar licks, towering walls of sound and soaring lead passages to satisfy any fan of Gilmour's work.<br /><br />Lyrically, the songs are tinged with introspection, reflection on the past, deep love and persistent hope for the future. The songs SMILE and WHERE WE START are as beautiful and touching as anything David has ever written.<br /><br />This is a wonderful album that has been a long time coming. It's an absolute pleasure to listen to from start to finish.
B00006JDVV|5.0|THIS WAS RELLY A GREAT MOVIE.  GERARD BUTLER SEEMS TO MAKE EVERY MOVIE HE IS IN.  HE REALLY DID A GOOD JOB IN THIS ONE. <br />WILL WATCH THIS ONE OVER AND OVER................
B00007LTIL|5.0|'American Beauty' and 'Working Man's Dead' together and almost singlehandedly establish The Grateful Dead as a major American musical presence. Before these albums, they always struck me as background music to the San Francisco forground bands such as 'Jefferson Airplane' and Janis Joplin's incarnations.<br /><br />If you are backfilling your collection of '60's rock albums, these two, plus 'Live/Dead' are the ones you want to get to represent this important American act.
B0002IQMKM|4.0|Slap it in your car stereo, pump it up, and you're ready to roll!
B00005JLPK|5.0|Movie was delivered on time! This is a great movie that portraits the life of one of the greatest Mexican artists. Salma did a great job! But what I like the most about the movie is the way it was done, it is very artistic and I like how they portrait Frida Kahlo's work from reality into a painting. I highly recommend this movie.
B0001MDP3G|3.0|I am a huge fan of Anthony Mingella's movies, I loved The Talented Mr. Riply and I liked The English Patient, though it was hella long, but this film was harder to like.  The story is a good one and the book by Frazier is very good, but in its movie form it seems really depressing.  I thought Kidman was very good and Zellweger was great, but I really did not like Law as Inman, he just did not register, it was hard to understand why Kidman longed for him so.  The movie is extremely violent, in a Deliverance sort of way, the violence is real and disturbing, one scene in particular is just retching to watch, if you see this film you will know exactly what I am refering to, overall the quality of the film is very good and the cinematography is outstanding, it amazing how much Romania looks like North Carolina, I do recommend this film, but be forewarned it is depressing and hard to watch at times....enjoy.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|Excellent movie. Followed the book almost to the letter. <br />Keeps you riveted to the end. <br />Outstanding cinemaphotography.
B0001ZX0OW|4.0|This is a very good movie, thanks to a great performance by Sean Penn.  From the beginning I was pulled into this movie, I really wanted to know how it would end and how it ends is a shock.  Eastwood really captures working class Boston, it was filmed on location, you can almost smell the clam chowder.  At times Eastwoods movies are a bit long, but this one is paced well and it really never lulls.  Laura Lindley is also very good as are Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins.  If you enjoy movies then I really can't imagine you not liking this movie, it is loaded with great preformances and the ending makes the journey worth it.  Penn flat out earned his Oscar.
B000BBOUU4|3.0|not ment for the young... can be a bit misleading.    But, as a whole.. I thought it was a great movie
B000E6UK5K|4.0|Well my copy came in the mail from Amazon, and I must say I'm HEARTILY impressed.  I was loooking for a few good songs, and some filler, and but really...it's all pretty good..save one or two.   <br /> <br />1) Castellorizon (3:43)  - It's misleading.  It starts off like Floyd's \\"Sorrow\\" then throws you back to \\"Shine On\\"..very reminiscent of \\"Shine On\\"....guitar solo just kinda \\"Rips\\" into you...and it's awesome...instrumental track. No vocals <br /> <br />2) On An Island (6:49) This one sounds like a classic floyd track.  Amazing at that....picture \\"Shine On\\" mixed with the acoustic stylings of \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and the vocal harmonies of \\"The Division Bell\\".  But...it's not the members of floyd doing the harmonies...its David Gilmour, Graham Nash, and David Crosby.  Bad Ass.  <br /> <br />3) The Blue (5:26) Another Instrumental - Slow tempoed, almost bluesy Riff, but again, very much obvious who made the floyd sound on albums like \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here\\"...but at teh same time, elements of \\"Division Bell\\" and \\"momentary Lapse\\"...hard to classify this one.  <br /> <br />4) Take A Breath (5:45) This one goes WAY back.  Almost psychadelic Syd Barrett type floydian sound.  Guitar is deep down crunch, with an underlying, very ominous, very gilmour vocal.....I can't figure out how this guy does it, but he matches the floyd harmony, by himself...and that..in and of itself, is very impressive. <br /> <br />5) Red Sky At Night (2:51)  - For many many years - Dick Parry was the breath behind the saxophone on nearly every pink floyd song that had a saxophone...and this one, when you hear it...makes you go \\"yeah...dick parry's back\\"...but then you read the liner notes, and it blows your mind. The sax...isn't Dick Parry..it's GILMOUR HIMSELF....making his debut on the saxophone.... <br /> <br />6) This Heaven - (4:21) - Not sure I like this one, save for the guitar solo. Very bluesy guitar solo. Rest of the song is so - so - Probable Low Point of the album... <br /> <br />7) Then I close my eyes - (5:27) A Banjo?  A Friggin BANJO?  Okay, whatever floats Gilmour's boat.....but then it's really cool with some psychadelic backwards effects...and actually turns into a decent instrumental.   <br /> <br />8) Smile (4:03) - This one's not new - at least not to owner's of the \\"In concert\\" or \\"meltdown festival\\" concerts.  It was played five years ago on those shows...but here we finally get the full studio version....nicely arranged, and the slide guitar is pretty good....reminiscent of \\"high hopes\\" but not as blistering.   <br /> <br />9) Pocket Full of Stones (6:18) - Back once again to \\"shine on\\" - a basic piano track (which at first hearing, one would credit to Rick Wright, and I think I'm right there) and a great solo from gilmour.   <br /> <br />10) Where We start (6:46) - A Great slowed down closer - a mix of really all the floydian eras...and a good mix at that.  Kinda laid back acoustic, some great organ, and some well placed bluesy clapton-esque guitar.  Not bad <br /> <br />Highlights - Castellorizon, On An Island, Take A Breath, Red Sky, Smile <br />Lowlights - Then I Close My Eyes - This Heaven -  <br /> <br />Comments - Not enough Vocal..too many instrumentals...but...that's what made Pink Floyd...well...Pink Floyd.   Lots of people considered Pink Floyd's \\"The Final Cut\\" A Roger Waters Studio Album.   I could very easily credit this as being worthy of being called a \\"Pink Floyd\\" album, if I didnt know there was little or no floyd members involved in it.   <br /> <br />Compared to other albums: <br /> <br />Better Than: <br /> <br />Gilmour's Solo Debut <br />Gilmour's \\"About Face\\" <br /> <br />As Good As <br /> <br />Floyd's \\"Wish You Were Here\\" <br />Floyd's \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" <br />Floyd's \\"Animals\\" <br /> <br />Not As Good As <br /> <br />Floyd's \\"Momentary Lapse\\" <br />Floyd's \\"Division Bell\\" <br /> <br />Not to be compared to <br /> <br />\\"Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" <br />Anything Roger Waters has done.
0330485385|5.0|Okay, you can but don't do it without tissues :) <br />This book is stuck in my head FOREVER! I loved this so much and I cannot stop looking for a similar story line out there.  <br />I hope Alice comes out with a newer book (besides 'Lucky') soon. <br /> <br />Please read! it's an great read people. XOXOXOXOXOXO
B000AMJDHY|5.0|I've never been hooked on a group so quickly. After seeing Panic! tour with FOB I met the lead singer after their performance. Really a nice guy. Not your typical \\"I'm too cool to hang out with you\\" kind of guy. So I decided to give the album a chance. Wow I'm glad I did. The songs are so catchy. It's also one of those cd's you can put in and listen all the way through without getting bored. Seriously, great band great music and for the price of the CD you can't beat it...just give them a shot I guarantee you'll like 'em!
B00008PC2O|1.0|if you dont live in the usa and dont have a very fast pc do not buy this dvd microsoft have put a lisence on this disc so you can not watch it out  side of the usa not that fair when u have payed four it and find you can not play it
0451167716|4.0|This is a great book. Alot different than the movies (yes, I did it backwords and read the book second).  <br />Realize that the book is a lot more 'vicious cycle' focused where the movie is about 'family.' <br />It just gives you a different view of the Corleone family and how the movie was shaped.
0380733358|5.0|A real page turner. And as usual, much better than the movie, which was also great!
0571202284|5.0|There is no question about it. Richard Williams is da man.<br /><br />This book is for everyone who wants to learn animation. I mean REALLY learn animation.<br /><br />Tons of illustration, fun and intuitive reading, it's a must have for everyone who loves animation. I just love this book.
B0000CFW87|5.0|This is a great CD and I can't stop listening to it.  It is absolutely beautiful and Josh's voice is mesmerizing.
B0001QNFXW|5.0|Amazing concert DVD, tons of replay value.  I only wish they did Space Cowboy but this is still well worth the money.
B000BYA5G4|4.0|The acting in this film is well done. They all sell their respective parts. In this movie we follow Yuri Orlov (Nicholas Cage) from his early days in the early 1980s as an immigrant in New York to the present. One day when checking out menu of their family's competition across the street, he is witness to a Russian Mob assassination attempt. Of course the amount of ammo being used grabs Yuri's attention. For he thinks everyone needs bullets. And this is all he needs to try his hand at gun running. <br /> <br />He starts off his business by being a reseller of Uzi's in New York and works his way up to arming countries. As Yuri deals his product, the repercussions of his sales are not glossed over. We see the havoc and death they bring. The sad part of the movie is what Yuri says is true; most of what he does is legal. Yuri is a brilliant businessman and criminal, and can think on his feet. The movie has the feel of reality to it. <br /> <br />When you see the volumes of arms he sells and the death it brings. It makes a strong statement. But I think the bigger statement is the fact that the five largest arms dealers in the world are the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council itself (U.S., China, France, Great Britain and France). And they continue to sell to whom ever will buy. <br /> <br />Watch this movie. There are no spots in where you will be bored. But I will suggest that you do not let your young children watch it, for there are some very bloody and realistic death scenes. <br />
B0000TB01Y|5.0|We purchased the Wicked Broadway recording for our 12-year-old daughter based on friends' enthusiastic reviews of the play.  What a great purchase!  She LOVES it & we do to.  The inserts have good information.<br /><br />Funniest song:  Popular (gets stuck in your head)<br /><br />Favorite song:  Defying Gravity
B00005KARK|4.0|An outstanding animated film by the late Walt Disney and his people.  It most definitely focuses on our total humanity.  In other words it has laughter, happiness, and joy, mixed with crying, sadness and emptiness.   It is also optimistic which may be the most important aspect of the film and certainly a trademark of the times it was made.
B000026C3T|5.0|This is definately the LZ compilation to have. It's got all of the hits, no filler and the sound is great. All of the good songs are on 2 convenient discs, there are no filler songs, to speak of. If you get just one LZ compilation, make it this one, it beats all of the other LZ compilations.
B000002U82|5.0|Excellent, classic album. The technology and synthesizer effects are used economically and effectively. Gilmoure's guitar riffs are beautiful with long, well sustained notes that flow smoothly. The guest players also contribute very well to the album, especially the saxophonist in Money and the R&B singer in Us and Them. The lyrics are also very well written and clever. Very few, arguably no, groups have pulled off what Pink Floyd did in this album, and that is why it is a classic that transcends its time.
B0000UJDLM|5.0|Great Fun!  Have seen it on tv, over and over.  Glad to have it in my library.
0618164413|5.0|This compilation is wonderful and my daughter (5 yrs) pulls it out every 2 or 3 days.  So many of the illustrations bring flashes of memories back from when I was a child and I love reading it to her.  The book is very well constructed and we'll definately have it around for the next generation!
B000E6UK5K|5.0|The largest complaints I've been seeing are \\"boring\\" and \\"it's not Floyd\\".  Many people should have read the words on the album before they reviewed it and noticed that it said \\"David Gilmour\\" and not \\"Pink Floyd\\".  I have been a Floyd fan for many years, and although it's not completely like the Pink Floyd of old, I still really enjoyed this album.  If you listen carefully you can hear some of the old Floyd blended in nicely.  I keep hearing the name Roger Waters, but the fact of the matter is, David Gilmour is now carrying the Pink Floyd torch.  Gilmours' musical genious and solos are still flawless at 60+, which seems mighty impressive to me.  We also see a few contributions on this album from Richard Wright, another Pink Floyd member. It's sad that we may never see David Gilmour, Roger Waters, Richard Wright, and Nick Mason perform together again, but I think that Gilmour does just fine without Waters on this album, which seems to be the contrary to the popular oppinion. It's nice to see what Gilmour can do without Roger running the show like a tyrant.  I have read some negative reviews for this album but it is my oppinion that this album tells tales of a great time in Gilmours' life and showcases his true essence.
0786281316|5.0|This is unquestionably the best life guidance book ever written if you are in pursuit of enlightenment; that is, an understanding of the true nature of life, the universe, and everything (to steal a famous line).  It is a Bible of the New Age and should be read and re-read over time to use as a guide to a better, happier life.

B00005JM4Z|5.0|I normally prefer romantic / comedies but this movie is definitely one of my favourite movies ever.  This movie has a bit of everything in it.  My entire family loves it.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|This is not Pink Floyd AND this is not one of David Gilmour's previous releases.  It's an entirely new CD.  First of all the sound is fantastic.  A great deal was put into the production of this release.  The songs are just as good.  After the first listen, I must admit, I was a tad bit dissapointed.  Having listened to On an Island all the way through around 4 or 5 times now, I have changed my opinion.  Most of the songs are understated and not as grand as I thought they would be.  This is a good thing.  Dave's music has matured over the last decade.  While his guitar playing may not \\"jam\\" the way it has on past releases, (no comfortably numb type solos here) it seems to be more heart-felt and thought out.  I agree with one of the other reviewers.....the songs from On An Island tend to have the feeling of some of the pre-Dark Side releases.  From blusey to jazzy, Gilmour has all bases covered here. This is a great release from one of the best guitarists for the past 3 decades.  Give On An Island a listen, then give it another, then another.....If you are a Gilmour fan, you will appreciate it.  Oh yeah.......Gilmour has said many times over that song writing dose not come easy for him.  Too many reviewers seem to have a problem with the fact that his wife wrote many of the lyrics on this release.  Who cares who wrote the songs......listen to them and enjoy them regardless of who authored them.  One must wonder these people would have had a problem if some total stranger had written them.
B0000DIJO2|5.0|I had to think about it for awhile before I bought this, and I am so glad that I did. I watch it all the time. I always listen to their music,but, to see them perform and watching their smile's and emotion they put into their music is great. The only bad thing is I know I will never be able to see them perform since Mo's passing. If you ever liked the Bee Gee's I would highly recommend buying this. I will always think they are the best group around
B000066NW0|3.0|1. Losing Grip - A good buildup, but the chorus itself isn't as impressive as the verses. An ok song that could have been better. 8/10 <br /> <br />2. Complicated - First single off the album. A good one at that. It was number one here on the New Zealand charts for a good solid 8 Weeks! A good song. 10/10 <br /> <br />3. Sk8er Boi - The second single. An upbeat punk song. Again I enjoy the verses a lot more than the chorus. 9/10 <br /> <br />4. Im With You - The third single. A ballad that again could have been better. It's a little boring, you have to be in the right mood to actually enjoy the song fully. At least her vocals here are great. 7/10 <br /> <br />5. Mobile - This one had the potential to be a single. Its heard on the movie `Medallion' starring Jackie Chan and Claire Forlani. It's a great pop song, with great vocals. 10/10 <br /> <br />6. Unwanted - A good heavy song. Another punk/pop song. Nothing special here, but still its worth a few listens. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />7. Tomorrow - A beautiful ballad! Very moving. Most likely the best song on the album! (ironic how this is suppose to be a punk album, and the ballad turns out to be the best song) 10/10 <br /> <br />8. Anything But Ordinary - Nice chorus, a good pop song. Lavigne sings about wanting to be anything but an ordinary person. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />9. Things I'll Never Say - Could have done without the \\"da da da da da da da da\\" at the start. This songs pretty average at best. 8/10 <br /> <br />10. My World - Sounds really like track 9 \\"things I'll never say\\". 8/10 <br /> <br />11. Nobody's Fool - Lavigne tries rapping in this, and fails miserably. She's not fast enough, stick to punk! 5/10 <br /> <br />12. Too Much To Ask - The beginning of the instruments sound a bit out of tune, but anyway, the song is pretty good though. It's a slow paced pop song. The chorus is pretty catchy. 7/10 <br /> <br />13. Naked - Like most albums, this one decides to close with a slow song. If it was intended to end with a bang, Lavigne should have ended the song with `Tomorrow'. Nevertheless this songs alright. 8/10 <br /> <br />I know im a little late for reviewing this album, but I only just got to listening to it a couple of days ago, when my recommendations said I should try this one out. <br />The album was made at a poor effort, and could have been a lot better! But its still got a couple of songs in there that are worth mentioning, so why not give this one a go <br />
B0007MAO0M|4.0|A word about DVD production. Bad DVD's just happen. My particular disc came with flaws. I couldn't get rid of the French subtitles and the last fifteen minutes of sound was bad. I reported this to Amazon and they replaced my disc with a smile. No problem. They even informed me when they received the returned disc and assured me that I wouldn't be charged for the replacement. It's always a pleasure doing business with Amazon.  <br /> The movie Silverado is FUN. Doesn't have a nodding acquaintance with fact or reality. A real popcorn and soda pop and chocolate Saturday afternoon Western. The music is great. I think I'll buy the sound track. The scenery is terrific. Maybe I'll visit New Mexico or Big Bend this year. The actors, including Kevin Costner, don't get in the way too much. Saddle up your Orville Ridenbacher or Paul Newman \\"Real Movie Popcorn\\", shut down your brain for a little while and relax. It's fun.  <br />
B000E0OBK6|2.0|I give this dvd 2 stars only because of the second disc.  Does anyone know where the boot camp footage on the supplemental disc came from?
0800141849|5.0|The quality of the the DVD is superb.  Now the movie: I originally saw it on the big screen (1996) and have been waiting for the DVD to come out. Seeing the changes of the persons had quite an impact on me. After seeing this movie, I made substantial changes in my own life....and this raised my own confidence and self-esteem.  I recommend it to everyone.  I have also purchased the Soundtrack on DVD.  I keep it in my car and it's constantly played.  A favorite song of mine is Bryan Adams' song about our shadow standing in the way of our progress. The words seemed to be directed at me the first time I had heard it.  This intertwined with the movie, woke me up.
B000BTGY7I|5.0|GREAT MOVIE !  THE BRITISH HAVE SUCH A DRY SENSE OF HUMOR, BUT I LOVE IT.  BRAD PITT AND JASON STATHAM ARE GREAT !
B00008DDXL|4.0|My children and I loved this second Harry Potter movie almost as much as the first. The magic continues!
B000006MV8|5.0|I picked this album up at the base exchange at Torrejon AB, in Spain after hearing that Magic Christian song on the radio (don't remember the title). I must say, I loved this album though that cut from the Magic Christian was not on it. Sure, it is pop, but their guitar playing and harmonies just can't be ignored. And the quality of the songs still holds up some thirty years later.<br /><br />I still get a rush when I hear Day After Day and Baby Blue. I had the privilege of seeing Joey Molland a while back with the Rock and Roll All Stars and he still has it, just like the old days.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000062TU1|5.0|My children and I love all the Harry Potter movies. This is the first magical one and so it is our favorite.
B0006MT314|4.0|I enjoy the songs on the cd.  The selection is good as are the artists.  I would recommend this CD to my friends.  My daughter & her friends have listened to it also, and really like it.
B0002TT0NW|4.0|My children and I had fun watching another adventure of Harry Potter unfold. The movie was suspenseful and the movie was as terrific as the book!
B000BOH8XW|5.0|All the songs on this album are fantastic.5 years has made a difference.There isnt one song That I like more than any other. <br />From the first song to the last the cd plays like a well made tapestry of emotions.I enjoy the hebrew and reciting of the Lords Prayer in how do you do and have loved dont bother,track 2, since I first heard it on mtv.The only question I have is what is Oral Fixation?I ordered this product from amazon.com because it is not available in Britan yet and it arrived with me in Nortern Ireland one week after I ordered it so thankyou amazon.com as usual your service is 100%.
B000E1YVZU|4.0|I have never seen the play (the only way I get to see any brodway play is if it goes to movie) and when I saw this at the movies at first I was put off by the  theme of the lifestyle,etc.  Not my cup of tea..a full movie about  free sex (do not care if they are same sex or not tho) and drugs.  BUT....what stuck with me was the friendship and how they connected to each other and the songs.  So I bought the dvd, saw watched the movie again, and like it better the 2nd time around.  This time knowing the story, I just did not 'see' the drugs and sex (well you never see the sex to that is not a problem)  but got really into the friendships and how they all connected, stronger , this time.  So it is now one of my fav dvd's.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|It is a hell of a challenge to find something positive about this movie. This is like James Bond taking on all the classical horror characters at the same time, Hollywood style! They even have an own Q preparing machine gun crossbows and other \\"typical\\" medieval weaponry. Children should not be allowed to watch this stupid movie as it definetely makes people lose braincells.(SARR)   <br />
0743518144|5.0|I've read a lot of self help books and this audio CD is the best.  Discovering what your true talents are helps you to enjoy life to the fullest by catering your lifestyle towards your talents.  Anyone who wants to be in the 99th percentile needs to read or listen to this book.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|Excellent sound track and selection of songs from the movie, which is excellent as well.  It was robbed at the Oscars, the public is nor ready for a gay oriented movie to win an Oscar.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I watched this in Japanese while overseas and it was one of (if not the best) CGI movies out there.  Final Fantasy Spirit Within can not hold a candle to the action sequences and character development put forth in Advent Children. If you loved the game (even if you haven't finished it :) ) you will want to see this movie.  It is worth the buy.  I have the Japanese version with subtitles and am buying the American version as well.
6304167660|5.0|This is a wonderful movie. Mr. Bernabo, in his review was wrong about a few details. Firstly, this movie takes place in upstate New York, not Mass. Secondly, the reunion is in January, not February. However, this move IS about real people and I like that it doesn't have that \\"happy Hollywood ending\\" thing. It is one of my all time favs. Enjoy.
B000646MNE|4.0|This is one of the best series ever on television.  It's great for women who can identify with the characters and situations.  It's also great for men to gain a little insight into what women are really thinking.  The first few seasons are the best.  Somewhere in 4 or 5 Carrie gets annoying and starts talking like she's trying to be funny all the time.  But, the series redeems itself.  Desperate Housewives Season 1 is another good one.  Addictive for me and my boyfriend loves it too!
B00006RIO7|5.0|I enjoy most musicals, but don't usually purchase soundtracks, but the music in Chicago is snappy and fun, I found I really wanted to be able to listen to it more often...great in my MP3 player when I am at work or out tilling the pasture on my tractor.
B00005JM02|5.0|Fantastic movie! I saw it originally at the movie theater and immediately bought the DVD when it came out. My little cousins loved it so much I gave away my DVD copy to them. I'm now re-completing my Pixar collection with Finding Nemo. Can't wait for Cars!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|How does a show like SG1 get renewed season after season, yet Firefly doesn't even get to make it though a full season. Don't get me wrong, SG1 is okay (Atlantis keeps sliding downhill though), but nothing near the caliber of show that Firefly was...is. Whedon's writing (and the entire team of writers) is rivaled only by his casting ability. He casts perfectly. You can tell everyone in the show isn't just cashing a paycheck. They put their heart and soul into it, as does the production staff. Is it Art, yes and no. It's not as important as Art can be, but it is poignant at times. Heck, even if you only view it as pure entertainment it's still more engaging than 98.5 percent of film and television currently out there. <br />  <br />     If you're a Sci Fi fan, a Buffy fan, or just a fan of well developed series (Sopranos, 6 Feet, Deadwood, Rome), Give this a chance. Don't just watch the film Serenity (although I it stands on its own well enough). Give it a few episodes to sink in and you'll be hooked.  <br /> <br />     If this show continues to succeed, more good work like it will follow. Not just from Whedon and his gang, but from others as well. Stop accepting the Garbage that we're constantly fed. Studios, producers, and networks will have no choice but to keep giving us good stuff...like Firefly.
B000301YY8|5.0|I love this cd. It's great to listen to at work. I was worried with the warning label but it's not bad at all. There are several drug references and that is it.
0385338082|5.0|This was an awesome book - i was hooked from beginning to end!
B00005JA2B|5.0|I'm a total fan of progressive rock but there are times when I've had enough of the British accents and cryptic lyrics and want to put on \\"Freebird\\" or \\"Born to Run.\\"  Kansas is the perfect halfway house, they rock hard despite the synthesizers and strings.  On Leftoverture -- their best album -- they deliver accessible songs that you can howl along with.  While they don't sound alike, you can think of them as an American version of Jethro Tull, in that their music grew out of solid, classic R&B, they know how to rock the house when they want, but they include classical instruments and art rock lyrics.  Kansas manages to be both prog rock and yet very, very American in their sound.  It is a combination that I don't think any other band has managed and makes their sound unique. <br /> <br />Leftoverture is not just \\"Carry On Wayward Son\\" and a bunch of other forgettable songs -- although that one song is so great it would make this album worthy of any collections.  \\"The Wall\\" and \\"Magnum Opus\\" are heartfelt songs and every song on this record features great playing from a talented band.  Admittedly, sometimes Kerry Livgren's lyrics as sung by Steve Walsh can get a little too overwrought, and I'm eventually going to put on \\"Freebird\\" anyway, but this is an album that after thirty years still gets played all the time for me. <br /> <br />The sound quality on this CD is excellent.  I previously owned this only on vinyl, so I can't compare it to prior CD issues.  The two extra tracks on this one don't add much, but Kansas' instrumental work is so dense and layered that any improvement in the sound quality is worth acquiring. <br /> <br />
B000000W5N|5.0|This is perhaps the greatest album the Rolling Stones have ever made, during the period when they were at the pinnacle of their careers.  If you're only going to own one Stones album this is it.  Of course, once you list to it, you'll want more.
0060557818|5.0|I am fairly new to the worlds of Neil Gaiman.  In the past few months I have picked up and read a few of his Sandman collections, Mr. Punch, the script for \\"MirrorMask\\", \\"American Gods\\", \\"Good Omens\\" (co-written by Terry Pratchett), \\"Coraline\\", \\"Stardust\\", and most recently \\"Neverwhere\\".<br /><br />In brief, \\"Neverwhere\\" tells the story of a good samaritan, Richard Mayhew, that rescues a girl, named Door,  who looks to be a junky on the street.  In actuality she is a very important person (a princess, in fact) in the \\"between\\", a world that exists below and sort of \\"parallel\\" to the streets of London.  By helping this girl, Richard Mayhew enters this \\"between\\" world.  Unfortunately, when someone falls into the \\"Neverwhere\\", the world above doesn't know they ever existed, which makes Richard's life rather difficult, to say the least.<br /><br />The entire story takes place in and around London as Richard and Door, joined by a motley cast of characters, race to discover why Door's family was killed all the while dodging two extremely well written and scary evil henchmen, Croup and Vandemar.  These two enjoy maiming and murder most foul and have honed their skills like martial arts masters.<br /><br />Throughout this wonderful adventure, Richard and crew will cross paths with almost every fantastical creature imaginable, including an Angel.<br /><br />The story moves at a brisk pace and all of the characters are exceptionally realized.  Each character has been made very three-dimensional thanks to Neil Gaiman's deft writing skills.<br /><br />The streets (and underside) of London are given a life of their own.  Medieval and Modern England collide in unusual and interesting ways.  Imagine waiting for your train in the Tube and when it opens, instead of stepping into the boxy, hard plastic, metal and rubber capsule you are used to, you are greeted to a room with velvety drapes, thrones, emperors, magistrates, jugglers, magicians, party-goers, tables of food.  Of course,you may not be able to see such a thing, if you live in London above.  That train car would look broken and unused ...the doors wouldn't open, the lights wouldn't work......But this is the world of \\"Neverwhere\\".  Things aren't always what they seem.  For instance, that beggar on the street corner you see every day on your way to work, could very well be a king.<br /><br />Written with a lot of wit and a lot of heart, Neil Gaiman has crafted a modern-day fairy tale that's melded the best pieces of popular fantasy and turned it upside-down, inside-out, and back again.  I highly recommend this book to everyone especially if you've enjoyed works like \\"Alice In Wonderland\\", \\"The Wizard of Oz\\", or any fantasy novel, for that matter.
0440241588|1.0|OK, Grisham... stop it! If I wanted to know how to learn Italian in 13+ mind-numbing chapters, I would not have picked up a Grisham novel. I read your books for suspense, humor, and good story-telling. I want to be entertained, gosh darnit!!!<br /><br />Are you gone for good???
B0006GAI6Y|4.0|This film is more enjoyable than the Japanese version because <br />it is set in a culture with which we are more familiar. <br />Dance can be an important influence in one's life by making that life more meaningful, but most film that includes partner-dance is set in an environment in which dance is presented in a competitive or entertainment form.  Here, dance with a partner became a part of the protagonist's normal life, and enhanced that life.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never watched this show when it was on the air (except for part of  one episode).  Because of favorable reviews I watched the movie \\"Serenity\\" and wanted to see more.  Watching the original show, without commerical interuption, really made me sorry that this show did not stay on the air.  I am a SciFi fan, but this show was something special.  Intersting characters who were multi-dimentional.  I watched this series while running on a treadmill and found that I would extend each workout to watch more of the programs.
006056251X|2.0|Was it just me or am I the only one who found it boring?  I am more than half way through and am trying to force myself to finish.  It's not as fun, and light-hearted as the first two in her series.  I loved the first two, and I loved the strong and fun heroines.  I found Evie to be so morose, unemotional, unexciting, and a drag.  I don't see what St. Vincent sees in her at all.  If I were him, I'd go after someone else.  The book seems so serious.  I don't want to read about her abuse in a romance novel.  It's depressing.  The only funny part was when they were getting married at Gretna Green.  That was cute.  But other than that...  I did skip a bit to the end and I think it picks up a little there.  I hope so.  So far, I don't like it very much, and I usually love Lisa Kleypas' work, especially her two Wallflower books.  They were fun reads.
B0007O38F8|1.0|Why do we need a fake thug steroid image in the industry to sell records. This man has no talent whatsoever. His first cd was alright but The Massacre was one of the worst albums of all time next to Eddie Murphy's album. Hear we have a man that look like he just injected himself with Arnold Swarzneggar steroids talking about \\"Candy Shop\\" and \\"Disco Inferno\\" what's next for this Uncle Tom? Are we going to see him dancing for the President in a pink bikini suit? For the right price he'll be there.

0399230033|5.0|Every bit as fun as Good Night Moon with a little more whimsy!
B000E6UK5K|3.0|Music = vision + lyrical content + melodic content + mood. Roger Waters brought tremendous lyrical content and vision to PF. David Gilmour brought melodic content and mood to their music. Roger Waters is right for criticizing post-Waters PF albums as 'hollow'. David Gilmour is right for calling 'The Wall' and 'The Final Cut' as verbose.  <br /> <br />Compare 'On an Island' and 'The Final Cut' for a good lesson in how each of these talented musicians contributed. This album has 4 great songs: 'On an Island','This Heaven','The Blue' and 'Smile' that are complete. The rest as many say, are lazy/meandering/relaxed, maybe hollow ideas that could've used Roger Waters. Just as a lot of songs on 'The Wall' and 'The Final Cut' could've used more Gilmour. Enjoy this for what it is: a 60 year old who is finally performing stuff _he_ likes. <br /> <br />
B00003CX9E|4.0|a lot of people hype this movie...a lot of people hype every movie...that's the job of a lot of people...still, i must say that this is a good movie...for the Gen-Y-ers out there: black-and-white films are OK...there is some weak acting in this film: i think the part of CFC's buddy, Mr. Leland (J. Cotten), drags a bit at times; it is still a great film and even the low point mentioned above only last momentarily--maybe cotten hadn't found the character at the time i'm thinking of in the film...it's worth looking at...the cinematography especially is cool...again for the gen Y-ers: this stuff had never been done before...it's visually akin to something like star wars.
B00008OWZC|5.0|Came highly recommended by a friend and I wished I had purchased it sooner. I was never able to see Led Zeppelin live but if I had this would be the ultimate \\"live\\" capturing of in concert album that I have ever heard.
B000777J2S|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this CD. The songs featured cross several genres while consistently displaying beauty and emotion throughout the entire album.
B000002U9Y|3.0|Although undoubtedly a good album, there is no point giving this album a score as that would suggest it ranks alongside such masterpieces as Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here; in saying that, this album is easily superior to the turgid and incoherent 'More' and the dour and embittered 'The Final Cut': in short, if you're a Floyd fan you will love most of this album; as a casual listener you will largely be disappointed, but still find it an interesting listen. <br /> The opener 'Let There be More Light' demonstrates the loose vitality of the band in their formative years in the best way: a propulsive Waters bass riff gives way to what could be described as a carnivalesque intro, with Mason hammering his kit with abandon and Wright creating a tapestry of intertwining melody. The intention here is clearly to dazzle. The mantra of the verse builds to a revelatory chorus that has an anthemic appeal that was never evident on Piper at the Gates of Dawn, with Rick Wright unfurling some marvellous keyboard sounds, and the close re-entering the vibrant chamber of the intro, only this time with overlapping layers of echoing guitar, blues guitar and crashing cymbals. It is a thoroughly satisfying opener and perhaps underrated. <br /> Next up is Wright's 'Remember a Day', a far more understated song that is pastoral in feel. The trademark echoing Barrett guitar marauds around the piano melody threateningly, and the song has a strangely portentous chorus, evoking a seriousness otherwise missing on the earlier work. Wright's vocals lack strength but he manages to at least get the sense across, and this doesn't affect what is a blissful, melodic and assured composition that demonstrates a minor talent that was perhaps not allowed to fully flourish within the maelstrom of creative forces in the Floyd. <br /> The melodic focus of 'Remember a Day' breaks down into mantra again, as we see a more focused return to the mesmeric appeal of the verses of 'LTBML' with an eastern-influenced riff that makes up the entire song. Here the song plays to the band's early strengths: Mason, a drummer who was far more skilled in percussive experimentation than `keeping it tight' is here given a free reign, as is Richard Wright: overall, the opus is a musical journey around Waters's imagistic and exotic lyrics, that add to the visual allure of the song. The song perfectly embodies a western fascination with eastern culture, and is done so in a way that is entirely devoted to simple feeling: it is deservedly considered one of the Floyd's best tracks. <br /> This sensorial relaxation is firmly brushed aside by the brash and obnoxious swagger of 'Corporal Clegg' that features some abrasive guitar playing, vocals and cynical lyrics. Although featuring a satisfying chorus, the rest of the song is far too abrasive and it's contrast to what has gone before seems more wilful than inspired. The thematic thrust of the song - Water's first sardonic take on the war - also seems oddly juxtaposed with the theme of the album, and the grating kazoo solo on the outro is texturally at odds with the sonorous instrumentation that we have been used to. This is an extremely irritating track. <br /> Having fizzled out, some order is restored by the diaphanous, swooping bass riff that opens the title track, offering itself as a harbinger of some forthcoming apocalypse. What follows is an extended journey into the abstract, with ghostly keyboard swirls hovering formlessly above curious squalls of feedback, the bass riff dropped away like a trapdoor; this segues into a drum section and atonal piano car-crash, where a manic slide guitar soars above it all, then collapses away: the effort is clearly impressionistic, and the vitality of the experimentation is enthralling if at times slapdash. The music is hardly the most enjoyable to listen to, but is interesting nevertheless, and a journey into dissonance the Floyd can be proud of. The remarkable Rick Wright coda that ends the track does so with a sense of epiphany and completion having brought us through the confused sounds cape; however, this is strangely subdued on the disc, sounding far better live. For this reason this track counts as a disappointment, it is what otherwise makes the track. <br />The next song continues Rick Wright's involvement with another song of his own, titled 'See-Saw', a largely forgettable, if at times charming song. <br />The repose engendered by the mellifluous synths of 'See-Saw' collapse into the strum along that is Syd Barrett's 'Jugband Blues'. The song is not without merit, and has some good melodies, but just seems horribly out of place on the album, as though it was attached simply to allow Syd a swansong. Throughout the album, with the exception of 'Corporal Clegg' which we could otherwise see as an aberration, we have been lulled into lush, atmospheric soundscapes quite different to those on Piper at the Gates of Dawn, yet the closer draws us back to the last album, attempting to ruin the identity of 'SOS'. The impression we are left with is that the focus of the album, toward improvisation and the creation of a soft timbre and mellifluous, opulent soundscapes, is undercut by the intrusion of Roger's ire on 'Clegg' and the closing Syd cut: it unsettles and obstructs what could have been a flagship album; hinting not so much at Psychedelia, but also pointing toward post-rock and shoegazer music as others have mentioned. <br /> Overall, if you are a Floyd fanatic, this will contain some vital secrets for you to uncover, just beware of the duds; to interested listeners, there is some good stuff here, and if you are put off by the pomp of Pink Floyd this will surprise you with it's intimacy, it's off-kilter experimentation and other-worldliness. <br /> In an age where music seems exhausted of it's secrets, there are plenty to be found in here.
0140120416|5.0|Hands down, this is the best course out there.  Could easily be used as a do-it-yourself, or in a classroom.  I bought this book to help me re-learn after a few years with no practice, and throughout the book there are explanations that really get to the conceptual heart of issues I had struggled with back in the 90s.  I can't emphasize this enough:  The best thing about this book is how it gives you a ground-up understanding of grammar and usage patterns.  The most complex of rules are presented as you need them, right alongside other \\"easier to tackle\\" issues so that it all seems to unfold  naturally.  Prof. Brown is a genius for how he works all of this in with a practical guide to pronunciation.  The exercises are all worth doing, though I'd suggest also picking up Schaum's Outline to Grammar for even more well designed practice.  The two complement each other very well.   For the amount of money they want for this book, or even at two or three times that cost, this has to be the best Learn-Russian text available.  Don't miss it!
B0000DDAU9|5.0|why do so many metal heads think that they are post-modern deconstructionalists when it comes to discussing music? anywho, saw these guys open for clutch...werent expecting much to happen...this is the only 'opening' band that i've followed up on...they rock...old school sensibility packaged in a tight, snappy package....these guys know their craft, esp. percussion...the drummer might make you wet your pants if you listen long enough...'mother punhcer' is the wife's favorite song from the album.
B000035P7X|5.0|This DVD I bought was a gift for a friend who is a Bob Dylan fan. I personally did not see it. My friend loved it. He told me that it was one of the best gifts he has received. He also said that there were parts in this DVD that he had seen before, but many parts he did not. According to him, he says that if you are a Bob Dylan fan, it is the greatest thing since sliced bread. He really enjoyed this gift!
B000002AS1|5.0|I dont know why it didnt won the oscar for best score. This is one of the best music Ive ever heard. This shows the genius of this composer. Silvestri knows his art.
1557507473|4.0|This is not the book to read if you want an overview of the campaigns. Even though there are maps it is hard to follow the action against them (most of the place name sin the narrative are not on the map), but that's ok. This is strictly a graphic account of what it was like to be there, and after reading this book you will probably know more about the campaigns than the author did at the time. Excellent.
B00005NVDF|5.0|Based on the hyper known last farewell of Bogart and Bergman in Casablanca, will emerge a fabulous, extraordinary and funny script that will allow Allen to lean  on Bogart `s spirit to guide him about his personal hesitations and tribulations around the bride of his best friend.<br /><br />Surrealist and inventive; tantalizing and evocative that counts with an excellent cast. Do not miss it for any reason.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|Okay, I admit to being a Pride and Prejudice snob.  I've read the book 14 times in the last three and a half decades.  When I've found the right superlatives, I'll write a review!  And yes, I am probably prejudiced against anything that is not the 6 hour A&E mini-series (with Firth--I have to say it too!).  But I tried to like this movie.  I even enjoy the books that have been similar to Austen's (like Pride, Prejudice and Jasmine Field).      But there were just too many things that I didn't like.  For example, there was very little character development.  Keira Knightley does a well enough job as Elizabeth Bennet but Matthew Macfadyen (whom I loved in MI-5) did nothing but sneer in this film.  I don't know how anyone could form an attachment to someone who did not have any redeeming qualities.  I know that they cast the Americans for the American audience but I also didn't like the casting of Sutherland.  His 5-day stubble annoyed me, as did his American accent during part of the film.  The worst character portrayal though was Bingley.  He was definitely not a buffoon in the book....  In the movie, he acted like a simpleton!    I do give kudos to the makers of this movie; trying to recreate the greatest novel ever written (my opinion) is certainly an ambitious undertaking.  The scenery was lovely and the people unfamiliar with the story will probably love this movie.
B000005RSW|5.0|I was around 16 or 17 when this record was released, and it was another Masterpiece by the Kings of Metal! This release, like the three before it, is part of the foundation of Manowar's Kingdom. <br />This is one of my favorite Cd's of all time. It has some of the Heaviest moments in Manowar history, it's raw, stripped down, and heavy. This is what True Heavy Metal is all about. If I were going to give somebody a few CD's  to give them an idea of what Manowar is really about, it would be the first 4 CD's, because they truly are a great period for the band. During that time period, information about Manowar was hard to come by  here in the United States; the media ignored them, and the critics panned them, and neither had a just cause for doing so - Manowar's musical abilities far outweighed any of the bands that were getting coverage. Joey DeMaio is still the most original  bassist around, Eric Adams' voice is simply unbelievable (I've studied voice for the last 6 years - trust me, the guy is incredible). Scott Columbus is simply my favorite drummer. I began playing drums well over 20 years ago, and John Bonham was quickly replaced by Scott Columbus; and we finally come to Ross the Boss - there is not another guitarist around who has the style that Ross has. <br /> <br /> The first 4 releases were recorded in Analog - that's why the releases that came out after this had a much different sound, the band began utilizing Digital Recording equipment for the following releases. For me, this CD was the end of an era, because Manowar's sound changed and became a bit more polished and less raw, and it wasn't until they released Triumph of Steel that they regained a lot of the rawness that the digital recording medium of the late 80's seemed to kill.  <br /> <br />That said, I would highly recommend this CD to anyone wanting to get a taste of what Manowar was really about. <br />
B0007PAMR4|5.0|We love Dune so this was well worth it.  Not too many changes for the average person but pretty much this is our thing.  Enjoy!
B000006TRV|1.0|I listened to this album fairly frequently (and quite liked it) when I was about 17, then lost it within a year. I bought it again many years later, listened to it once, and have never played it since. It's awful. <br /> <br />It's frankly difficult to imagine a worse example of navel-gazing erected into such a pompous, self-impressed musical monument. Nearly every song on this album expresses bland (and unexplained) angst as though it were an Apocalypse. One can see how it appeals to either adolescents or not very bright people who are self-persuaded that they have 'problems' of some profundity. (There's even a track entitled 'Goodbye Cruel World' and a song beginning with the line 'I wanna go home'.) Leaving aside the triteness of the concept of an emotional 'wall' built around the supposedly tortured individual, consider how the idea itself is explored: <br /> <br /> When we grew up and went to school <br /> There were certain teachers who would <br /> Hurt the children in any way they could. <br />[from 'The Happiest Days of our Lives'] <br /> <br />Is there anyone who *hasn't* had that experience? It's one thing to explore a shallow theme, another entirely to do so in bad lyrics. Then the teenager goes home from school and enters an Oedipal world where <br /> <br /> Mother's gonna make all your nightmares come true. <br /> Mother's gonna put all her fears into you. <br /> Mother's gonna keep you right here under her wing. <br /> She wont let you fly, but she might let you sing. <br />[from 'Mother'] <br /> <br />Lyrics that basically punch you in the face with their ideas are not really intended for thinking people. A self-pitying thirteen-year old asked to write some doggrell about their own feelings of adolescent angst might, for example, have scribbled the following lines on the bus to school: <br /> <br />I've got wild staring eyes. <br />And I've got a strong urge to fly. <br />But I got nowhere to fly to.  <br />[from 'Nobody home'] <br /> <br />Feeling sorry for yourself, as George C. Scott once remarked, is the most popular indoor sport: it rarely makes for artistic greatness, however. And here the listener is being asked to choke on two whole jars of it. <br /> <br />Some of the songs are of such absurd brevity as to leave the listener with a cheated feeling; others are inexplicably bookended by random fragments of dialogue or puzzling sound effects. It's a mess, in short. But so myopic and self-impressed were the Floyds that the album underwent the fate of being reworked into a bloviated motion picture and an even more pompous  concert in Berlin. All of this could have been avoided had the artists had any of the introspection that this album so plainly pretends to wear on its sleeve.
0553062182|4.0|This is a very good book for those of us in a neurological-wiring minority. Author Elaine Aron suggests that 30% of the population can be described as highly sensitive people (HSPs). HSPs have sensitive nervous systems, which allow them to be more aware of details and subtleties in their environment. They are often reflective, cautious, empathetic, and highly moved by the arts and/or natural world.      The flip side of their heightened awareness in some areas is a lower threshold for sensory input. HSPs tend to be easily over-aroused by bright lights, loud noises, and general busyness. If you have ever been enjoying a few quiet moments of much needed solitary recuperation on a busy day, only to have a concerned colleague/ teacher/ friend, etc. ask you \\"What is wrong?\\" this may be a good book for you.       I will not attempt at a summary of the book, as many other reviewers have done that wonderfully. I just want to add one perspective. I have found one major limitation in this book.     The author brings up the point that there are different types of sensitivities, and that not all people will necessarily fit every item on the checklist (which is provided at the start of the book). Aron points out that some HSPs may have extremely high sensitivity, but only in one or two areas. She also points out that high sensitivity does not necessarily equate with any one personality style, mentioning that there are HSPs amongst introverts and extroverts; thinking and feeling; and intuitive and sensing people (in terms of the Jungian psychological types). But the descriptions in the book seem to be geared mostly towards those with a particular personality traits (particularly, towards introverts and those with preferences for feeling over thinking, and intuition over sensing).     I think the book could have gained from an extra chapter or two on different personalities within high sensitivity/ different types of sensitivities as this book will not *speak* directly to all HSPs. I would love to read a book which covers the differences that can be found within high sensitivity.       However, this aside, I have to say that \\"The Highly Sensitive Person\\" is an excellent book for its embracing of the positive aspects of high sensitivity. This is especially needed as many HSPs have grown up in a culture which doesn't appreciate sensitivity, and have been used to negative labels (e.g shy, worry-wart, slow-coach, sissy, over-emotional, aloof, etc.). Aron does a lot to de-pathologise the characteristics natural to HSPs.
1932100385|5.0|I decided to become vegetarian again (did it for a while in college) after reading John Robbins's \\"Diet for a New America\\", and this book further convinced me that a whole food, plant-based diet is the right thing to do. The writing style is very down-to-earth, conservative, and never sensational - almost a bit dull at times. You get the sense he is just conveying the evidence he has discovered for maintaining a healthy, disease-free life, from one human being to another. This book is chock full of scientific evidence showing that animal protein (meat, fish, milk, and eggs) are a fundamental cause/promoter of cancer, heart disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, obesity, and a host of other diseases. I myself did not need this much convincing to go vegetarian, but this is a good book to lend to those who do.     As of today I have been a vegetarian (not vegan because I still eat ice cream once in a while) for a little over 2 weeks, and I lost 2.5 lbs (now weighing 140 lbs) without doing much else - I work in front of a computer all day and don't exercise. I don't miss meat, but I don't obsess over the diet either - if I cook, I don't buy meat products; if someone else cooks, I don't mind eating the veggies cooked in with the meat. Like Dr. Campbell says, give it a try for 30 days. If you can't stand it, you can always go back.    For those of you interested in learning about the effects of meat eating on animal and environmental health (not just human), I highly recommend John Robbins's \\"The Food Revolution\\", which is the update to \\"Diet for a New America.\\"
B000E8QVWY|5.0|Joaquin Phoenix was cheated out of the Oscar for this performance.  He was fantastic and beyond believable in this role.   <br /> <br />Movie overall was captivating from start to finish.  I'd never paid much attention to Johnny Cash songs before, but am now interested in buying his albums and learning more about his life. <br /> <br />Once again though, I cannot believe Phoenix barely got one win out of this performance.  He has my vote.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I first rented this from Netflix and my wife who shows little enthusiasm for such things danced about the house as we played it. We have since purchased the DVD for ourselves. Later, a friend who visited, enjoyed it so much that he bought it and now it's his favorite. This is a guy who is VERY passionate about his music. We also have 'Hell Freezes Over' and though it, too, is very good, this one's got it beat handily. If you like the Eagles, the Farewell Tour is a must-have for your collection.
B00000DQSV|4.0|Ok, so it doesn't have the hooks that their earlier stuff has and it isn't as strong as the stuff they are doing now - but its a solid album.  The melodies are great and I challenge anyone to sit still while listening to the title track.  Its a funkier Duran, and totally dance-worthy, but also manages to leave you feeling soothed.  \\"Winter Marches On\\" is a bit out of place on thise album as it sounds more like something from Rhodes' and LeBon's project, \\"Arcadia\\", but it remains one of my favorites with its haunting beauty.  Simon LeBon shows a lot of versatility on this album, and John Taylor proves again that he is possibly one of the most underrated musicians out there.  Nick Rhodes - well, he pulls it all together in his Wizard-of-Oz-man-behind-the-curtain way that he always does.  All in all, not my absolute favorite Duran Duran, but still makes regular rotations through my CD player.
B000E1YVZU|4.0|I saw this movie for the first time last night. Incredible! Probably the best musical movie I have ever seen on DVD. The cast was great. Anthony Rapp, Adam Pascal..... WOW! Tracie Thoms....even a bigger WOW! Her voice is moving. Heck, even Jesse Martin can knock out a tune or two. Definitely worth the 135 minute run time. 180 minutes for this movie would have been fine with me. To top it off...... it sounds great in 5.1 surround. The dialogue is very crisp. You can hear every noise right down to Joanne and Mark's coats hitting the floor right before they break into Tango: Maureen. Get it.... you won't regret it.
0446310786|4.0|In 1962, To Kill a Mockingbird won a Pulitzer Prize. After reading it, I agree that it is a great book that deserves its fame.  <br /> <br />Harper Lee creates lovable, compassionate characters. Atticus Finch is the PERFECT man, therefore unrealistic, but hey it's a fictional story. Of course, there is no secret Lee modeled the characters in Mockingbird after real people in her life in Alabama. Lee is obviously Scout, her brother is Jem, and their childhood buddy Dill is Truman Capote. <br /> <br />Even though much is made about the rape trial, this is really the backdrop story to Scout's, Jem's and Dill's plan to make the town recluse, Boo Radley, come out of his house. This sounds trivial, but Lee makes it work. It's actually interesting despite the fact nothing eventful happens until the end. One thing that bothers me is that Dill was not there when the \\"big thing\\" happened. Seems like Lee could have had it occur in another part of the season when Dill would be in Maycomb considering his invested interest for the previous two years. Other than this small nit-pick, Mockingbird is a warm, great, uncomplicatedly written, yet very complicated book. It's not complicated because of any great complexity. It's complicated because of the senselessness of racism and the seemingly helplessness of those who try to be fair. <br /> <br />
B000000OUJ|5.0|This album orignally was not my favorite of the solo WU albums of the mid nineties but the more I listen to this CD the more I think it is the best. Raekwon, Method Man, Ghostface and ODB had solid solo albums but this one had some of the darkest beats with rhymes that cut like the title of the album \\"Liquid Swords.\\" For those that want to hear some great hip hop before 96 I suggest you all pick this one up.
B00005M91K|5.0|Baraka is not a storytelling movie, at least not in the usual sense. Rather, it's a nice visual theater introducing nature and cultures in different parts of the world. Great music complements the picture.
B00005JOFO|5.0|Brokeback is more than a love story, and it's more than a gay love story.  This movie is something more powerful than words can really describe.  It seems so simple and when I talk to my friends about it they don't really understand because they haven't seen it.  The beauty of it is its subtlety.  It doesn't have to TELL you how to feel, you just feel it.  This movie really changed me in some way and I appreciate the risks that the actors and everyone involved took to tell this story and they did a beautiful job.
B00003CXBH|5.0|I've been looking for this movie for a long time, but have refused to pay <br />the exhorbatent prices others are asking for it. <br />Amazon had everything... Price, Quality and Fast Shipping !
B000B86S1Q|2.0|I read this book for my book club, and I didn't end up liking it much.  I felt that all of the \\"coincidences\\" in the book were too fake and predictable.  The only thing that I didn't find completely predictable was the very end, which I just thought was sad. <br />Overall, this book made me cry a whole lot more than it made me giggle, and left me wishing at the end.
0312995423|4.0|Very much in the author's style, this one takes the reader into cryptology, computers, government bureaucracy, espionage, etc.  It pretty much dances around all the hot themes and sets your mind to wondering about the mostly out of sight, high tech stuff that goes on night and day in our name and for our future.  The heroes have an edge on most of us in abilities, knowledge and that good stuff, but the emotions and the conflicts ever ring true.  As characters wander through power, emotion, reality, crisis they each become humanized enough that we can share their experiences and walk a bit in their shoes.  Simultaneously the plot weaves and clues are dropped and dribbled along the way.  It becomes a cannot put it down book without overly much trouble.  Everyone can remember some \\"favorite\\" situation where they suddenly had to do something totally unknown.  The author is a master at tweaking that nerve and hooking the reader.  He may have a formula.  It sure works for me.
B000092T6M|3.0|i originally had this movie on vhs but wanted it on dvd. i also was looking forward to all the extras a dvd provides. its funny to say this but it was too much because the clarity of the movie was ruined. in the vhs movie, at the very end, the scribe is questioned by robin \\"where's the maid marian\\" and the scribe says \\"up the stairs, that way\\" . but the dvd added the cut out edited scenes and in the middle of the movie , nottingham has the scribe's tongue cut out so he could not possibily be able to speak when spoken to at the end of the movie. this was the most disappointing aspect of the dvd. also , the video of bryan adams singing , everything i do, i do for you ....is not on the dvd but a live version at the castle as a part of adams' concert. would have prefered the original video cause you can't count on cable to play that video.  <br />i did however enjoy the making of the movie and interviews.  <br />my husband found fault with some of the info about time period of the list of swords and weapons of the movie (also a dvd extra). <br />what to do : if looking for the original movie....hold on to vhs tape or get the no-frills dvd. otherwise its all just lack luster.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|I never like to compare different versions of films, but I just couldn't help but do so after watching this adaptation. I have seen other P&P films in the past, and the one that blew me away was the 1996 A&E version. This new film doesn't measure up. <br /> <br />1) Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle defined the story's characters beyond belief; in fact, the whole cast was superior (you felt as if Jane Austen's characters jumped off the pages). There was chemistry, subtlety, passion, etc. Here, the characters seemed undeveloped/undimensional and lacked all the qualities of the book's characters.  <br /> <br />2) The length of the 1996 movie gave a lot of detail and was well-developed; the story made much more sense in terms of why and how everything was happening. Here, they just took out all the main parts from the plot and pasted them together, leaving you to wonder if more was supposed to happen. Also, in the 1996 movie, Elizabeth and Darcy saw each other quite often, and each interaction contributed to the overall progression of their relationship; you can see why Elizabeth disliked Darcy and how she slowly started changing her mind. Here, one minute she hates him, and then, after hearing a couple of nice sentences from people, she, all of a sudden, \\"magically\\" loves him. The two characters barely saw each other and have not even held a real conversation, except for the scene where Darcy makes his first proposal, and is turned down, yet they somehow fell madly in love with each other...? <br /> <br />3) 1996: Manners, etiquette, and traditions of the elite British class were captured quite well. You really saw how courtship was intended to be, and how marriage was looked upon. Here:too much Americanization going on (\\"Hollywood BS\\" I call it!). Certain parts were ridiculous (Lady Catherine's night visit, Mr.Bennett's dialogue, Charles Bingley's moron personality, Elizabeth's nightgown run, and the list goes on.......)Basically, a bunch of Americans (with exceptions, of course) pretending to know about British culture. <br /> <br />I could go on forever with a list of complaints, but I don't want to bore the readers! If you're going to make a romantic film, make it about anything else, but don't take a classic novel and pretend that you can pull it off with good cinematography. <br /> <br />Overall, if you have no idea what the book is about and have never read it (like this version's filmmakers), you might enjoy see this P&P movie because it's a \\"romance\\". Just watch it as it is and don't give a second thought to what Jane Austen's story really stood for. Enjoy the costumes, music, etc, but don't pay attention to the plot. Just be glad that everyone lives happily ever after.
B000BMSTMS|4.0|My order of preference for KoRn albums are as follows <br />KoRn (clearly the most exciting debut, extremely heavy, and every track a gem) <br />issue ( really heavy and catchy, and pretty dark) <br />see you on the other side ( brilliant, heavy stuff, and more catchy then there second experimental album untouchables) <br />follow the leader (there first experimental, technical in guitar aspect and most commercial) <br />take a look in the mirror (very heavy, and enjoyable, lacks new invention like there previous albums) <br />untouchables ( kinda of ok, some brill songs but a few are too slow for me) <br />life is peacy ( half the songs are fantastic, but the other half, make this album slightly dull, shame) <br /> <br /> <br />See you and the other side is KoRn showuing they can still rock and be a little different at the same time. the usual koRn riffs are still there sounding absolutely awsome and munky brings some exciting guitaring. Lyrics are slightly more simple but davis's vocal ability is still as refreshing and exciting as always.KoRn have finally released an album that is enjoyable, new and fresh with inventions that are far accessable for rock fans. here's my song by song review. <br /> <br />Twisted transistor (4/5) - very different to any release by koRn so far, has a cool hip hop vibe, with really heavy riffs here and there. Davis's vocal range throughout is awsome. a brill opener. <br /> <br />Politics (4/5)- the opening riff will probably deafen you, if not then rest of this amazing catchy track will keep ya headbanging. classic koRn. <br /> <br />Hypocrite (5/5) - the first standout track on this album, the riff is soo catchy and bouncy you'll be hooked. and the vocals are stunning. <br /> <br />Souvenir (4/5) - highlights munky's incredible guitar work, brilliant song and quite dark too. <br /> <br />10 or a two way (5/5) - the second highlight is probably the very best song, its moody, but also extremely heavy. this is where koRn derlivers someof theire better balladry to date. <br /> <br />Throw me away (3/5) - Not the greatest track, but i like fast songs so this one tends to get skipped. but its cool though and has a moody astomephere. <br /> <br />Love song (5/5) - fantastic, a great catchy chorus, heavy verse, and a rather unexpected harmonic voice from davis in the bridge/chorus, very bouncy too. <br /> <br />Open up (3/5) - Bring back the heavy, yes. not the best song but builds up great tension for whats to come. <br /> <br />Coming undone (4/5) - really heavy intro, and well done, could possibly be a release. The album will start to impress here and heavy song after heavy song explodes your ears. <br /> <br />Getting off (4/5) - a pretty cool song despite being slightly repetitive, but the riffs just keep on coming...Are you reeaaddyyy!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />Liar (5/5) -awsome awsome awsome, nothing bad to say, its catchy, bouncy and heavy. all you need. plus once again great vocals <br /> <br />for no one (4/5)- wasn't into this one at first, but it grows on you. great chorus and proably the last of the really heavy stuff on this album. <br /> <br />seen it all (3/5) kinda of ok but the album could have done without it. if this song and probably throw me away were taken out. this album could be their masterpeice. not too sure if it'll be better than Korn though. <br /> <br />and finally Tearjerker (4/5) probably the best ending to one of their albums since daddy. its heartfelt in a dark sort of way and actually sound very nice. Korn finish pretty epically. <br /> <br />The standout tracks : hypocrite, 10 or a 2 way, love song and liar <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002OOUP0|4.0|I have Mixed Emotions about this CD compilation. Most of the Stones best songs are here during that era, although I would have liked to have seen \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking?\\", \\"Monkey Man\\", \\"Shattered\\", \\"She's So Cold\\", or \\"Dance Little Sister\\" on it.  But the biggest letdown in this CD was the editted version of the Monster Hit: \\"Miss You\\" by one minute and sixteen seconds. (the singles version)  Also, \\"Beast of Burden\\",\\"Hot Stuff\\", and \\"Fool to Cry\\" were each cut by almost a full minute! \\"Rock and A Hard Place\\" was also editted too.  (You can hear the eight minute dance version of 'Miss You' on the \\"Rarities '71 to '03\\" CD, but that was more amusing than fantastic listening.) Overall the 'Jump Back' CD is good, but You Can't Always Get What You Want. If you did, you got me Rocking!
B000B2YQX4|5.0|This cd is a bit darker than their others, but it's amazing. The songs are great. Certainly a must have for Depeche Mode fans.
0802130208|2.0|After seeing so many glowing reviews of this book, I was galvanized to read it.  I was very eager to enjoy it, but quickly became disappointed.  To me, the book lacks the humor that so many here are ascribing to it.  The main character (Ignatius) is something akin to the fat comic book guy on the Simpsons, but without any of the wit or funny sarcasm.  He is socially awkward and tacky.  Moreover, the whole book is written in that style.  Most of the characters are inept, and the situations that arise are silly, but really not funny.  An important aspect of good storytelling is developing characters that the reader can relate to on some level, or at least care about.  I certainly didn't find that in this book.  The only positive aspect is that it's an easy read (in spite of the phonetic spelling which gets slightly annoying), so you won't end up wasting a great deal of time reading it.  As far as attributing the title of 'Literary Classic' to this, as I've seen in a few reviews, - you may agree if comic books are your favorite literary genre, and you think of the Three Stooges as the greatest cinematographic masterpiece.
0786886811|4.0|This book is wonderful. There are so many classic recipes, as well as a lot of unique or different things I've never heard of before. I love that there are some color photos, and helpful descriptions at the beginning of each recipe. This book is chock full of wonderful and yummy ideas. I can't wait to check out Ms. Lawson's other cookbooks.
B00003CXAA|5.0|This was actually bought as a gift for my father, as I've seen them all before I can rate them accordingly. <br />
B00003CXI1|4.0|Of course I wasn't much of a Harry Potter fan when it came out.  I actually saw the Prisoner of Azkaban first.  But, as far as this one goes.  I think it's an excellent adaption and a wonderful story with stunning visual effects and some great music. <br /> <br />10-year-old Harry Potter is leading a difficult life.  His parents died when he was a baby and his only remaining family members (Unlce Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley) treat him liek some cockroach that's wandered into their house.  1 day, on Harry's 11th birthday, he recieve a letter from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  Well, of course he goes to find out that he's famous for the defeat of a dark wizard, Voldemort.  Voldemort came to their houser, killed Harry's parents and tried to kill Harry too.  But, Harry destroyed his powers and Voldemort (unintentionally, of course) transferred some of his powers to Harry.  On his way to Hogwarts, he meets Romn Weasly and Hermione Granger.  They all have the displeasure to be associated with Dracoy Malfoy and his two henchmen, Crabbe and Goyle.  Then, on top of that, he shows extrordinary talent on a broomstick and becomes the youngest seeker for any Quidditch team in centuries.  He also learns that not everybody at Hogwarts worshops him day and night.  Severus Snape, Argus Filch, and his cat Mrs. Norris all take a disliking to him.  It's not really just Harry with Filch and Mrs. Norris, they just like to wage war with the students and the poltergeist, Peeves.  Harry begins to ponder over Snape and Quirrel's (the Defense against the Dark Arts teacher) strange behavior.  A strong desikre to see his parents again is finally manifested in Harry and he gets his wish when he discovers the Mirror of Erised, which shows the deepest and darkest desires of our heart.  Later on, he discovers that Hogwarts is hiding the Sorcerer's Stone which contains the Elixer of Life.  So, when he Ron, and Hermione, go down there... well I won't tell you that. <br /> <br />The books are much more detailed and describe much more.  These movies are great and all, but they sometimes feels rushed and this one is no exception.  The scene where they arrive at Hogwarts is so d**n rushed it feels like a time warp.  In addition to that, Dumbledore slows things down to the point of feeling like you've gone back to the day you were born.  I liked the way Dumbledore was potrayed though.  Quirrel and Voldemort were also wonderfully acted out.  Alan Rickman was a great choice for Snape.  Danial Radcillfe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Wattson are the perfect people for the job.  Richard Harris plays a fabulous Dumbledore except for how slow he is.
B00005JLZN|5.0|If you're looking to see a different sort of Death Row movie, this one is for you.  Most DR films deal with the psychology of waiting around to die.  This one does cover this issue, but goes well beyond that.  It's a DR movie that almost plays out like a murder mystery.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey turns in a wonderful performance of a professor @ the university of Texas who ends up landing in Death Row for murder 1.  It is fitting that the film takes place in TX as it is the \\"center of gravity\\" insofar as the Death Penalty is concerned.  People on both sides of the issue are very outspoken in TX, perhaps more than any other state in the union.<br /><br />People who have a morbid fascination with DR flicks (like me!) will love this movie.  Those who enjoy murder mysteries will also like to give this one a viewing.  Be forewarned, however:  it is gripping.
0385504209|3.0|When a noted scholar is murdered in the Louve Museum, he uses his final moments of life to leave a series of clues to a secret he has guarded for many decades: the location of the Holy Grail.  Symbolist scholar Robert Langdon is called to the scene to interpret these clues, where he is soon joined by the victim's granddaughter Sophie Neveu--but all is not as it seems, and the two are suddenly plunged into a race against police, an ultra-conservative faction of the Roman Catholic Church, and an unknown entity called \\"The Teacher\\" in an effort to both locate and protect the Holy Grail.<br /><br />Brown is not a great stylist, but his prose is workman-like and he writes at a breathless pace.  That said, his great gift here is his ability to plant hooks on almost every page of the book: questions concerning character, plot, and issues that are intriguing enough to keep you turning the pages one after another.  About a third of the way into the book I began to find the hooks a bit too calculated; moreover, as the action progresses the plot turns begin to rely more and more upon coincidence.  (After a certain point the novel begins to feel rather like \\"James Bond and the Holy Grail.\\")  Even so, the pace of the novel and the interest of Brown's ideas is more than ample to pull you all the way to the final page.<br /><br />As for the saga of the Holy Grail, what it is, and where it might be-- There can be no doubt that Dan Brown has done considerable research in art, history, and theology for this novel; at the same time, however, he has the distinct tendency to present speculation as fact when it supports his ideas and to downplay or completely dismiss facts that undermine them.  A great many people decry this, and they have some point, but this is after all a liberty we allow writers in works of fiction.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading THE DA VINCI CODE.  It is clever, entertaining, and the whole thing is well imagined, yes.  All the same, I cannot actually say that it offers a great deal more than this, and I cannot imagine that I will return to it again.  No matter how  provocative it may be, when the last page is turned THE DA VINCI CODE is a lightweight pop fiction thriller, the ideas that it posits as fact are handled in a very superficial way, and it would be a tremendous mistake to take its assertations too seriously.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Revieweroffers a great deal more than this, and I cannot imagine that I will return to it again.

B00000G3AZ|5.0|I had only read \\"Emma\\" once several years ago so I don't remember all the details that one finds lacking in film adaptations.  But I must say that I am very pleased with this adaptation of the book.  I bought this movie on a whim last week---really knowing nothing about it.  I really enjoyed the enitre movie from start to finish and have watched it several times since.   <br /> <br />I think it is a \\"cute\\" story and Paltrow/Northam play a very likeable Emma/Knightley. Seeing this movie has motivated me to reread the book and although I'm not yet halfway through the book, I do find that quite a bit of the dialogue from the book is found in the movie and in general it follows the book pretty well.   <br /> <br />This is an easy to watch, feel good, romantic movie.  I liked all the characters, esp Sophie Thompson as Miss Bates.  Certainly a great movie to watch on dreary days to lift your spirits.  I would highly recommend this to any romantics at heart.
B00003CWPL|1.0|Well, a few years ago I saw a listing on the internet of the Top 10 Scariest Movies by Dave McCoy of MSN Entertainment.  Eraserhead was number 10 and I thought it would be fun to have a collection of these \\"scariest movies.\\"  Like many of these older movies, there isn't much blood and gore compared to Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th -- these older movies are more creepy than frightening.      Since it was a David Lynch movie, I knew that it was going to be bizarre, but I had no idea just how bizarre it could get.  Maybe I missed the point, but there just didn't seem to be much to figure out.  The girls that I watched this movie with (Elizabeth and Roma) have since revoked my movie choosing privileges.    Anyway, to me this movie was just way too abstract, had very, very sparse and bizarre dialogue, and did not seem to make much sense.  A friend of mine had heard of the movie and we watched it on fast forward with me stopping it at several places -- that saved us from wasting so much time and that is the only way I would recomend watching this movie.    Maybe this movie will grow on me, but I will seriously worry about myself if it does.
0143057375|5.0|I find that each of Eckhart Tolle's books are profound in the wisdom that he speaks. I particularly liked hearing him speak on the CDs of his book rather than just reading his words.  Again, what he has to say expands on what he has said in his previous work even suggesting how we can be in the present moment when someone gets us angry, etc.
0385504209|5.0|I have uploaded Leonardo's paintings in \\"Customer Images\\" so you can compare them to the \\"Code\\" Dan Brown claims they contain, in The Da Vinci Code. His book is so full of other historical and factual errors that are more laborious to explain, I think it is quickest and easiest to compare his claims about the codes in the paintings to the actual art which his introductory pages claim is FACT.<br /><br />Remember, the whole point of the book is to make the case that Da Vinci put secret pagan messages or codes in his paintings.

Is it really,<br /><br />\\"Finally, the most obvious and frightening image....Uriel was making a cutting gesture with his hand--as if slicing the neck of the invisible head gripped by Mary's claw-like hand.\\" (Da Vinci Code p 138-139)????<br /><br />Why this supposedly threatening gesture?<br /><br />THE LAST SUPPER<br /><br />-Do you see the letter 'M' in the painting?

For the marriage of Jesus and Mary Magdalene?<br /><br />I can't see it because it isn't in the real painting.

B000002NHN|5.0|I only came across Loreena McKennitt recently and have been deeply moved by this one album. <br />I don't quite have the ability to explain in words <br />how wonderful it is. <br />The best track, I think is Skellig, altho I'm not religious, <br />few songs can bring a tear to one's eye as this one did. <br /> As a whole, just an amazing work.
B00001OH7U|5.0|\\"Station to Station\\" is, in many ways, the forgotten gem in David Bowie's catalog.  Coming off the somewhat limp \\"Young Americans\\" and its bright Philly soul, Bowie, by his own admission fueled by copious amounts of cocaine, constructed something entirely different, something bleak and dark and paranoid, yet still with a danceable, soulful edge to it.  Funky backbeats, slap bass, hazy keyboards and overdriven, fierce guitars (courtesy of lead player Earl Slick and rhythm guitarist Carlos Alomar) mix to provide a background that is claustrophobic, bleak, and yet somehow oddly uplifting at times.  The end result is an extraordinary album that points the way to the future. <br /> <br />Nowhere is this change more apparent then the opening title cut-- clocking in at just over ten minutes, it builds around a chugging guitar line with a funky backbeat and a downright morbid vocal delivery before slipping into a churning, excitable rhythm for its chorus.  This is pretty much the way it goes throughout with this sense of claustrophobia, be it the optimistic and upbeat \\"Word on a Wing\\", which still manages to embrace a darkness, the chanted vocals of \\"TVC15\\" or the fractured, off-rhythms of \\"Stay\\".  The only exception to this is the brightest gem on the record, vocal-fueled \\"Golden Years\\", which lifts the veil of paranoia enough to allow the performance to shine brightly (Bowie's vocal is staggering) over a fantastic groove. <br /> <br />On his next album (\\"Low\\"), Bowie would find a suitable partner in Brian Eno to help bring forth this paranoia and darkness in his music, and invariably it's hard to see \\"Station to Station\\" independent of that album because \\"Low\\" is so good, but this is not one that should be passed up.  Highly recommended.

B000C65Z1G|2.0|Rachel Weisz won an oscar for 'Best Actress' for her portrayal of a  dedicated humanitarian in this movie. That is the only reason I've rated it - 2 Stars. <br />It is typically 'English' in its context, both in its characters and its oddly morbid plot, which never quiet unfolds until its final, disturbing climatic finish. <br />It's one of those movies that leave me with a 'why in the h*** did I waste my time watching this piece of garbage' feeling. <br />If you're one of those viewers who cling to every lauding critique by those esteemed film critics, you will probably enjoy this film, not because its a good story, but because 'they' gave it a 'critically acclaimed' review. <br />I'd rather watch 'Rocky' again.
B00001OH7X|4.0|\\"Lodger\\" is the third and final collaboration between David Bowie and Brian Eno in the 1970s.  Recorded two years after the landmark \\"Low\\" and \\"Heroes\\" albums, \\"Lodger\\" does not quite live up to the legacy the previous two albums allowed for it, as though taking time out of the studio to tour somehow derailed the Bowie/Eno partnership a bit.  Having stated that, had this is a great album. <br /> <br />I think perhaps my reason for feeling this way is that while \\"Low\\" and \\"Heroes\\" were mapping out new territory, \\"Lodger\\" tends to mine on those successes and embraces the burgeoning New Wave sounds that Eno and Bowie previously anticipated.  Mind you, when it's good, it's fantastic-- the proto-industrial \\"African Night Flight\\" is built around essentially the sound of crickets and electronic noises with Bowie frantically speaking out the lyrics as though there's too many words to get out, \\"Yaassassin\\", featuring a superb violin performance by Simon House mixes a Middle Eastern organ line with reggae (or perhaps Police-like?) guitars for an unusually natural sounding blend, \\"Look Back in Anger\\" finds Bowie at his most passionate and explosive over a new wave backdrop and a decidingly Enoesque arrangement of frantic rhythms and instruments waxing and waning in prominence and the pounding rhythms of \\"Boys Keep Swinging\\" nicely offset the total goofiness of the lyrics (and guitarist Adrian Belew is unbelievable in his solo channeling all sorts of noise).  Along the way, Bowie provides a couple features for Belew on guitar, who eats up \\"Red Sails\\" and \\"D.J.\\" with his fierce and highly original guitar lines. <br /> <br />Still, the record has its weak moments-- \\"African Night Flights\\" is a bizarrely bright and somewhat dull piece, \\"Move On\\" has a fine galloping beat but misses altogether and even Belew's pyrotechnics don't save \\"Red Sails\\". <br /> <br />I suppose it's all small complaints though, the good in the album far outweighs the less than good, and I realize my initialassessment was pretty harsh.  This is a good album, and for many other artists, it would be the best thing in their catalog.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I saw this series originally when a friend showed it to me.  It's definetly one of the best series that's come out in the last few years, and I'd recommend anyone thinking about getting it to go ahead. <br /> <br />I had some problems with getting it, though.  Three copies had to be returned (first two for having a duplicate Disc 2 and no Disc 1, and the third for having a duplicate Disc 1 and no Disc 2).  It was quite a pain, though on the whole amazon was fairly fast about shipping replacements.
0345308239|5.0|In spite of being written several decades ago, this book is still relevent to the world today.  Mrs. Tuchman was an intelligent interpreter of world events and world history, and this book is an incisive analysis of the \\"follies\\" of the past.  Certainly several new chapters could be added, since history does, indeed, repeat itself.  Tuchman is an author who seems to have fallen out of favor among contemporary historians, but she deserves to be required reading for every history 101 class beginning college.  It would be even better to require her in high school, but the sad state of American education makes that unlikely.  She's always a pleasure to read.
B000BYA5GO|3.0|Nicolas Cage brings another of his fascinating portrayals of enigmatic characters to life in this dark story of an international arms dealer who has traded his morals for money. <br />The story line weaves its way through a series of dangerous encounters, where life has little or absolutely no value to his customers, to a climatic staging of events that makes Cage aware of his own mortality. <br />If abstract violence and gory bloodshed is offensive, this is definitely not your cup of tea.
B00001OH7V|5.0|In 1977, David Bowie and Brian Eno were riding a creative wave-- their first collaboration, \\"Low\\", was an artistic triumph and stands among the best work in the catalog of either musician.  The followup, \\"Heroes\\", nearly equalled their first collaboration. <br /> <br />Following the formula of \\"Low\\", the first side of the LP was all rock songs, but this time Fripp and Eno brought in guitar virtuoso Robert Fripp to provide a third voice.  The result is staggering-- the entire side is full of brilliant songs that find all three artists at the peak of their form-- explosive post-punk \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", sustained-guitar driven \\"Heroes\\" (with some of the most passionate singing Bowie has ever done), retro-modern \\"Sons of the Silent Age\\"... quite frankly, the whole side is a highlight, whether fierce and powerful (\\"Joe the Lion\\"-- check out Fripp underneath Bowie on the bridge) or the aching passion of the title track, this really is about as good as it gets in this vein. <br /> <br />The second side again is largely ambient pieces (excepting the closing track which is a dance piece).  This material isn't quite as good as the instrumental material on \\"Low\\"-- it's not that it's uninteresting, in fact it's superb.  Bowie's koto (a Japanese stringed instrument) performance over delicate synths on \\"Moss Garden\\" and the wailing saxopone on \\"Neukoln\\" make for fantastic pieces, it just doesn't quite stop you in your tracks like the second side of \\"Low\\". <br /> <br />Nonetheless, \\"Heroes\\" is unnervingly brilliant material, and as essential an album as anything in Bowie's catalog.  Highly recommended.
6305807930|4.0|A Very Good Edition for one of the most peculiar films of Argento, with a marked Lovecraft flavor. The story of three mysterious buildings designed by a strange alchemist for the \\"Three Mothers\\" of horror is detailed with an awesome collection of visual moments (such the crime with the rats in Central Park durin a lunar eclipse), but with only the necessary dialogues, creates an unreal atmosphere during all the film. Very good image quality, but better Dolby Digital mix.

B000AP04KQ|2.0|I bought this movie after hearing about it numerous times over the past few years. I kept hearing how hilariously funny it was and how I just had to see it!  <br /> <br />I like \\"quirky\\" films like Little Shop of Horrors (musical version), Serial Mom, Chasing Amy, etc, but this movie fell short in so many ways. I have worked in \\"the office\\" for over 10 years. I spend my 8, or 9, or 10, or more hours a day in a cubicle with no view to speak of. I know all about crappy office equipment, the difficulty getting office supplies, the stereotypical annoying people, the feeling that any day someone will come by and tell me that I'm no longer needed, etc. But, this movie just didn't capitalize enough on the humor that is found in everyday work. I think I could take a video camera to my job for a week and come away with two hours worth of funnier material.  <br /> <br />I was truly disappointed in the path that the storyline took - what was that whole program to steal less than a penny from hundreds of \\"accounts\\" so the characters could come away with a few hundred thousand dollars at the end of 3 or 4 years? That part of the movie was so ridiculous, it wasn't even slightly funny. In all honesty, the best characters in the movie were the next door neighbor to the main character, and the waitress (Jennifer Aniston). If not for them, I don't think I would have even smiled once throughout the whole movie. <br /> <br />I don't know who I would recommend this movie to. I guess the people who gave it a good review here. For the most part, it's only worth a watch so you can talk about it with others or have knowledge of some of the scenes when others bring the movie up. But, for me, I wish I had only rented it, and I wish I hadn't wasted two hours of my already small number of free hours...
B000EGDC0A|3.0|I was blown away when I first heard Felt Mountain, and tracked down all the Goldfrapp disks I could find. Felt Mountain's amazing, surprising, and adventurous: each of the songs is totally different, and much more psychedelic than more traditional electropop.  The sound, and the skill used in putting together the instrumental tracks on that album, are superb. The string arrangements on Felt Mountain are great, too. Black Cherry was a little more industrial-sounding, but still had great, funny vocals and lyrics, and the songs weren't all homogenous as they are on this one. Supernature is bland and safe. I've listened to this a bunch of times through expecting to suddenly be blown away, and it just hasn't happened. I had such high hopes after hearing Felt Mountain, and it's a shame that she seems to have gone the way of safe mainstream corporate industrial electropop.
B00065MDRW|4.0|This CD really brings back some old memories.  Although the songs are great, the song quality seems a little lower than expected.  (Of course, so is my hearing these days.) In any event this is a must have CD from the 1970's.
377571622X|5.0|Having spoken several times with the artist Gregory Crewdson, I'm comfortable in saying that a retrospective of his art is an insight only into his (r)evolutionary techniques and dream narratives. The man himself is a slightly bemused, curious artist with an assured but uncaring knowledge of his impact. A recent panel at Princeton, pitted Gregory against motion pictures' reigning dream narrative king, Spike Jonze. There's a reason Spike's infamous Addidas spot was particularly brilliant...the scenes, the props and even the film coloring were all lifted quite clearly from Crewdson's eponymous single frame masterpieces. This book has the beautiful and haunting recent work, but also features a assortment of compositions from his earliest period; a period that seemed to focus on the grey mood and the everydayness  from a Walker Percy life. A period in the early nineties shows the transition to curious composition; with hints of what was to come. Overall brilliant, and I\\"m sure music video directors will steal openly from the pages of this great book as well.

B0009VRHLK|2.0|David Lean once said, describing the scene in Laurence of Arabia where Peter O'Toole rides from the distance towards the viewer that the producers lost their nerve and cut the unblinking shot down by a minute, that the longer version was \\"better\\". In a similar vein, the much maligned scenes looking through a van windscreen in The Brown Bunny, are weakened only by being cut short. This is because the impact of the fleeting human contact between driving is heightened by the endless hypnotic quality of driving. This is the real feeling of driving around: time ceases to be a factor when you are not trying to be somewhere but just keep moving towards a continuously receding point on the horizon. There is a cultural factor here as well: we are familiar with a roadside America via any number of road movies, pop videos (U2 spring to mind) and novels (Lolita is far more absorbing in its descriptions of mid 20th Century motel life than the workings of a paediphile's mind). But spectacular scenery, slick cuts, special effects, draining or saturating colour all romanticize the sheer dullness of travel. By contrast Brown Bunny plays on the familiarity to convey an ordinariness which is entirely lost in films which try to grind out the metaphor of personal emptiness by picking unusually bleak settings. <br /> <br />The people too are ordinary which makes the ultimately revealed back story all the more shocking even though, it is also ordinary in its way. This leaves the message \\"there but for the grace of god\\" all the more indelibly imprinted on the memory. I find it difficult to connect emotionally with characters who show no emotions but Bud shows exactly the kind of pain, indecision and yearning which go straight to the heart of loss. <br /> <br />The other obvious charge levelled at this film is that the fellatio scene is gratuitous. This is a moot point. This is a normal sexual act filmed without any kind of exaggeration; it is dealt with in exactly the same cinematic manneras talking, kissing or driving. If doesn't stand out or jar against the flow of the film. Showing a couple about to copulate and then playing music and cutting to extreme closeups of sweat droplets - that is gratuitous. Moreover it carries the story forward. What most people seem to miss is that this is not pornography in the sense of watching sex to masturbate - this is watching the sexual fantasy of someone masturbating. Sexual fantasies are not coy. This is made all the more evident by the lack of any other nudity or sexual activity up to that point - many European films lose the impact of sex by over-abbundance of nudity (maybe a sign of my Anglosaxon uptight attitudes).  <br /> <br />This is the ultimate guilt trip: on the surface Bud is looking for redemption but at the same time he has the same physical desires as any man, the same desires that caused all the trouble in the first place.

B00008PX8P|5.0|The magic that is Led, originates first in the lyrics. <br />Each Masterpiece tells a story, a pain, a hurt, a joy. They had some magic formula for conveying as much emotion as possible in as few words as is possible. Powerful stuff. Poetry. <br />There was no precursor to this band. No one to imitate, these guys were all original, and pure genius. They do what I imagine Mozart would do, faced with the rock'n roll era. <br />Then there are the arrangements, the nuances of which would escape the techno-pop quick buck \\"artists\\" of today. What makes their Music timeless is the intelligence behind each song. You just can't fake that... <br />Plant, Page, JPJ, Bonham if not classically trained, wrote, and performed as though they spent years at Julliard. Their execution is virtually flawless. <br />What is most apparent is the heart they put into their music. They gave and gave, beyond the call of duty. Not for cash, but because they felt it. It came from somewhere deep within, and it still speaks across all ages, all generations. My 11 year old girl who is all \\"pop\\" will sit and listen quietly in awe of the power of Kashmir. There will never be another band to equal Britains best. <br />We were just lucky to have been there to share in their brilliance. Please enjoy their legacy, please pass them on... <br />

1400032717|4.0|This book is truly insightful. Mark Haddon is able to capture the world through the viewpoint of an autistic child named Christopher. Through Christopher's experiences we laugh, cry, and learn a little about how our actions are perceived.  <br /> As we read the book, we quickly discover that Christopher takes everything in a very literal sense. He also thinks all situations through in what he believes is a logical way. A perfect example is his reasoning for wanting to become an astronaut. Because he likes to be alone and he enjoys the company of machines and animals rather than humans, he believes he is qualified to go into space. <br /> Christopher's idea of logic is wrong when it comes to communicating when other people. He believes that no one will tell him a lie. When people talk to him he truly thinks that they mean everything they say and has trouble catching on to sarcasm. When people tell jokes, he thinks to hard and doesn't seem to understand why the punch line is funny.  <br /> I highly recommend this book. I believe it to be humorous and slightly heart breaking. It gives an excellent look inside a special needs child's life. <br />
B00005JO1R|5.0|Joaquin Phoenix was DEFINATELY overlooked for the the Oscar he so richly deserved in this film... <br />He not only learned to play the quitar, he learned to sing and did a GREAT job of it! <br />What the heck WAS the academy thinking when the Oscar went to Witherspoon (she DESERVED it!) and not to Joaquin? <br />Without Joaquin Witherspoon would NOT have won her Oscar! <br />It was the acting of both stars that made this movie! <br />I also loved Waylon Payne's redition of Jerry Lee Lewis. <br />Any old time country music fan simply must add this DVD to their collection. <br />It not only tells the story of Johnny, it tells the early days of Sun Records and the Nashville Music scene. <br />Both Johnny and June are gone from this earth, but I think they would have both said yes to this story.. <br />Joaquin to you---I am deeply sorry that you did not get the Oscar you so richly DESERVED!
B0000CABBW|5.0|This is a beautiful movie about community, love, family relationships, despair, hope, loyalty and destiny.  There are many messages here that are especially important for young (and older) people to understand.  A community experiencing difficult times in need of new leadership.  A young girl who is gifted with leadership ability who does not allow discouragement or humiliation to break her spirit.  In the end this child unites a community and gives it hope in the future - she achieves her goal and that of her community.  The movie sends a strong message about sexism and how it holds not one female back but an entire community.
B000066C4V|1.0|My girlfriend and I picked up this movie.  We made the decision based on the awards this movie has won.  To be honest, I don't see why it won so many awards.  It either didn't have much competition or someone paid someone else off.  There is no character development and seemingly no plot.  Just a bunch of pompus rich people and their servants. <br /> <br />I wasn't renting this for car chases or gun fights, I was looking for an intellectually deep movie, and was utterly disappointed.
B000BZISTE|2.0|As stated before, this is a great DVD but it's already been done with the Five Star Collection MASH DVD. I don't see anything new here. DVD nuts like me really get tired of the studios constantly trying to get us to double dip for the same movie thinking we are going to get some new content. It's ridiculous. If you have Five Star Collection MASH DVD don't bother with this and even if you don't I wouldn't get this version. This package doesn't look as good as the previous release.
B00005JOFQ|1.0|I am amazed with the amount of five star reviews that this awful movie has recieved.This is not a true western movie as a real western movie features gun fights,action sequences pillaging and tough masculine actors like JOHN WAYNE,BURT LANCASTER,STEVE MCQUEEN and CLINT EASTWOOD.Dont waste your time and money on this weepy boring gay cowboy movie which features an insipid and weepy love story.AVOID.
B00004TVGF|5.0|I've listened to more than 10 deferent interpretations of Stabat Mater. This one is very unique. It is like a wild flower from the meadow. Not posh and proud, just pure beauty.  Every intonation is thoughtful, thoughtful to the point that it sounds unintentional and sincere.  Perhaps, this is how Pergolesi imagined it?    <br />
B000002C1W|2.0|Guilmour cant write, I admit Learning to Fly is good, and ON the Turning Away is a treat, but the rest of this is crap. Dogs of War is Guilmour's horrible attempt at topping Waters songs on the Final Cut (floyds best album). It sounds like Genisus, posibly the worst classic rock band ever. I don't care what anyone says, this was not Pink Floyd. Although the title does fit it well if you think about it.
0790734850|5.0|LA Confidential is a new Hollywood Film Classic.  Original, unexpected, and Superb with a capital \\"S\\" in every way.   This is a must see.  It creates its own category of excellence.  You can happily add this to your DVD or VHS collection.

0393061310|5.0|Lucid, well-written, ably-argued, and vehemently anti-racist.    This book sets out to answer the question of why different societies progressed at different rates and why some societies were able to dominate others so well.  Diamond presents his theory that environmental factors are at the core of the answer.    Starting with the development of agriculture and animal domestication, history is traced through the spread of the original crops of the Fertile Crescent.  Societies that were early in developing agriculture were able to settle into sedentary societies which allowed for increased population capacities and in turn the development of technology.    The title of the book refers to the ways in which advanced cultures were able to overrun less-advanced cultures.  The scenario repeats itself throughout history, from the first push of Homo Sapien Sapien into the European territory of the Neandertals, to the decimation of the American Indian at the hands (and germs) of European colonists in the Americas.  Diamond points out the difference in technology and disease immunity and traces backwards through history to find the causes of these differences.    He is able to make the arguments of cultural superiority without resorting to arguments of racial intellectual superiority.  Through his clear exposition, the reader is able to follow how some societies were able to succeed and some to fail as dictated by the environment in which they lived.  The reader takes away from all this that racial advantages were due to chance rather than bigger brains or higher natural intelligence.    Diamond added a chapter about the Japanese in this latest version.  However, it does not seem to fit in well anywhere.  The rest of the book is about the societal adaptations to the environment, but the Japanese chapter is about the genetic and cultural evolution of the Japanese people.  It's interesting, but out of place.    In all, this is a magnificent book.  It lays a foundation for the understanding of all further history, and stands up well to competing theories of human societal evolution.  5 enthusiastic stars for this book.
0486237664|5.0|I purchased this book after I saw a copy that my Art Teacher showed me.  I knew I had to have one of my own.  I was not disapointed!  This book is fountain of inspiration.  It is so well done and facinating that it will keep children (or adults) quiet for hours.  The printing is exemplary and the variety endless.  I highly recommend it.
B000BP86OG|5.0|I was a big fan of The Darkness' first album but this knocks the socks off of \\"Permission To Land\\". This is head and shoulders above PTL. It's like the difference between Def Leppard's first two albums. This is one of the most catchy and addictive albums I've ever heard. Think part Queen, part AC/DC, and add a little Def Leppard (namely the song \\"Bald\\") and you get an idea of what this album sounds like. The production is phenominal, thanks to producer Roy Thomas Baker(Queen). Justin Hawkins has one of (if not) the best falsetto voice I have ever heard and this album really shows it off. The drums are mean and heavy (in a good way) and there are so many instruments on this album, it would take a novel to write them all down. The guitar riffs are stellar and the bass is thumpin'. This album is a blast to listen to.
B0006B29WA|5.0|Franz Ferdinand's music is incredibly powerful and unique.  There's just something about it that makes you want to just stand up and dance.  This \\"Special Edition\\" of the bands self-titled debut comes with a bonus disc containing five tracks that were left off of  the original pressing.  The five tracks are \\"This Fffire\\", which is a remix of the single found on the original album.  Next up is the funky b-side \\"Van Tango\\" which, as the title suggests, is a great song to dance to.  Track three on the second disc is another b-side which was left off of the album, \\"Shopping For Blood\\".  This a great song, with a great beat, and great lyrics.  Next up is yet another b-side, \\"All For You, Sophia\\".  The final track found on this bonus disc is an alternate take of the single \\"Darts Of Pleasure\\" retitled from the song lyric \\"Words So Leisured\\".  I personally find this second disc to be a waste, considering the fact that these tracks could just be part of one CD. <br />     The Original Album:  From the minute you hear the opening guitar strum of \\"Jacqueline\\" you know that you will be in for a treat.  Suddenly, out of the acoustic guitar melodies of the intro, the bass kicks, then so does heavily distorted guitar. Magnificently composed.  Track number two, \\"Tell Her Tonight\\" is a highly infectious, funky track with a great guitar riff.  The Singles:  The very first single we heard from Franz was the smash hit \\"Take Me Out\\".  No wonder this song became a hit!  From it's opening lyric \\"So if you're lonely. . .\\" you are hook.  Right before the chorus begins, the instrumentation breaks down to a crawl, and then the fun begins.  \\"The Dark Of The Matine\\" was released as a single as well.  Probably the most controversial single released from this album has to be \\"Michael\\".  The song seemed to be a homosexual, erotic theme for the gay community, and law officials were certain to point that out.  In all reality, the song was written about one of the bands friends who got drunk at a bar and began hitting on a man.  \\"Darts Of Pleasure\\" comes next.  \\"This Fire\\" was the very last single to be released from the album, and proved to be a hit. <br />     This is a great album and I highly recommend that you try it out.
B00003CXDD|5.0|When my son Nicholas was a little boy and we came across this movie it was watched so often in our home that I thought I'd be sick of it. Now that he's a young man and on his own I'm having fits of nostalgia. I love this movie! If you still have a little one, cuddle up on the couch and watch how an endearing character named Willow helps save a very special baby from a wicked queen. Don't complain if they want to watch it over and over, those years go by much too fast...enjoy!<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay<br /><br />author of 'Souls of the North Wind'
B000E6UK5K|2.0|Not David Gilmour's best work but it's OK. The first cut is an instumental and acts as an intro to cut #2 \\"On An Island\\" which is a decent song both lyrically and musically. He get's help on this from Crosby and Nash (no Stills). 3, 4 & 5 are sleepers as in they will put you to sleep. 6 \\"This Heaven\\" is a really nice \\"Bluesy\\" cut and I think it is my favorite. 7 is an instrumental but it is very forgettable. 8 is cheesy, just not at all what I would expect from David Gilmour and you will never ever hear this on any radio station. I listened to 9 ONCE and now I skip it. If I make a copy of this for the car I will leave it out. The last song \\"Where We Start\\" is ok but again it is very laid back but it does have a nice guitar solo. There is some excellent guitar work sprinkled about the whole album. This is an album that many PF and DG fans looked forward to for some time now and I suspect that many of them will be disappointed. (Where is Roger?)

B000063UR1|3.0|It&#8217;s essentially an ecological protest movie that pounds you in the face with that message without really hitting home. Sure it looks pretty good for its time and sure the ships and robots are neat, but that is not enough to validate a poorly written message.  <br /> <br />At its core Silent Running reminds me of the hippie movement of the 60&#8217;s and I don&#8217;t doubt that&#8217;s where the movie came from. It seems the whole point of the movie is to make a stand about apathy towards the environment (more specifically the national parks and forests). The problem I feel is the execution. We have hardly any perception of how Earth is in the future and just how bad the ecology really is. We only hear a few sentences on the matter, and vague sentences at that. Pretty much the first half hour is dedicated to the protest and extreme measures Lowell goes to in order to preserve nature. Apparently the writer didn&#8217;t want to stretch the issue any longer than that, heaven forbid.   <br /> <br />So then we are to assume that society has destroyed all of the forests in the planet and what few remain in space are to be destroyed. First off I consider it unlikely that Earth has no trees or plants since that&#8217;s how we get most of our oxygen. Once more how come the forests have to be carried in massive ships? Why not just have them orbit close by or something? Even the movie itself reveals that technically the ships aren&#8217;t even needed. How&#8217;s that for a gaping plot hole?  <br /> <br />The characters also come off as very one-dimensional including Freeman Lowell, our overly preachy Greenpeace representative of the future. They don&#8217;t give enough to really flesh them out. The supporting characters are no more than buffoons to be discarded and the main character falls well into melodrama all the way to the pointless movie ending. Lowell also shows his lack of intellect as a botanist. Apparently he has taken care of these forest domes for eight years yet when the plants start dying he fails to figure out in a decent amount of time that plants need light to survive. This isn&#8217;t exactly rocket science here. It&#8217;s common knowledge.  <br /> <br />Still there are virtues to Silent Running. The space scenes are really nice to look at. Lots of the tech in the ship is well thought out too (though not all of it). The ships are cool and the robots are neat too. As a matter of fact they used real robots in parts of this movie. Not bad for 1971. Of course the not so real robots, Huey and Dewey, are pretty much the only colorful characters in the movie. The best part of the movie is after that  hour of melodrama where you get to see Lowell and the drones interact with each other on a daily level. Not great mind you, but interesting nonetheless. Music is not a virtue in this movie unless you like hearing 60&#8217;s protest music on a space station.  <br /> <br />Silent Running is weak at best. If you are into blatant protest messages and have an interest in the consequences of the human condition (done melodramatically) then you will like Silent Running. This movie also wouldn&#8217;t be bad for those who can get into just experiencing the sci-fi setting, but don&#8217;t expect too much. For those of you who want a little more refinement to your plots or are action oriented this movie will likely bore you. Silent Running is interesting, but not enough to write home about.   <br />
B0009HLDFU|2.0|So many of the reviews here ridicule this CD solely on the basis that it's copy protected.  That's TRULY unfair.  I hate copy protection as much as the next person, but the whole point of these reviews is to talk about the material on the CD itself to help potential listeners in their decision to buy the product,  and that's what I'm going to do.<br /><br />This CD stinks.<br /><br />Aside from the nonsense I had to go thru to get around the copy protection to put it on my iPod, this could have been one relatively great CD and instead it's a totally subpar 2-CD set.  Since the RIAA counts a 2CD set as two CD's sold toward a platinum award I'm pretty sure I understand *why* Grohl and company did this.  But they should have put better material on the CDs, especially the second disc.<br /><br />The first disc, for the most part is pretty good.  However, the second disc is bad - really bad.  In fact it's so bad that I actually started falling asleep driving home listening to it.  Now, if that's what Dave Grohl was striving for - to increase the number of road fatalities due to people nodding off at the wheel - he might very well have succeeded.<br /><br />Honestly, I think it's time to bid adieu to the Foo Fighters.  The magic that made \\"The Colour and The Shape\\" what it was is obviously long gone.  Go do  another Probot disc, Dave...  Mothball the Foo - obviously you don't care any more.

0142401668|4.0|Hmmm.... my friend forced me to read this (literally... eyes taped open and all :) jking sam) and I found the author's style a bit infuriating- i just found it extremely predictable. Yet i couldnt put it down.. until my geometry teacher took it away for reading in class. It was as if you were there, standing with Alex, being forced into helping the people you want nothing to do with. Even if you know nothing about it (like i did) id say read it anyway- youll be swept off your feet.
B00005A1PR|4.0|Her music is unique, mellow and smooth.  Her songs sound like something heard in upscale coffeehouses catering to educated business folk.  Her first single, the highly acclaimed \\"Video,\\" is the epitome of radio candy without being the fluff that happened to be popular in early 2001 when it was released (Britney Spears and the boy bands instantly may come to mind).  India Arie is her name and she's about as soulful and introspective as anyone can be.  Her music reflects everyday situations and real life.  Sure, not all of this CD soars as much as the aforementioned \\"Video,\\" \\"Brown Skin\\" and \\"Promises\\" do, and that's sad because it's doubtful anything else other than that instant first single received airplay; but this talented singer-songwriter's debut Acoustic Soul is still brilliant, soothing as a first sip of coffee and as delightful as taking that first swallow and feeling the warmth down your esophagus.

B000AYEI5Y|4.0|James Blunt has a unique voice.  It is easy to see why he is so popular in the UK and now has moved on to popularity in the U.S. as well.  There is not much good new music out there these days, but James Blunt is one of the best. <br />
B00007LTIA|5.0|I will start by stating there are 4 types of classic Yes fans:<br /><br />Ones who would say \\"The Yes Album\\" is their favorite album.<br /><br />Ones who would say \\"Fragile\\" is their favorite album.<br /><br />Ones who would say \\"Close To The Edge\\" is their favorite album (which represent the greatest number of Yes fans.)<br /><br />and Ones who would say \\"Relayer\\" is their favorite album.<br /><br />Clearly their most underrated album is the brilliant, monumental and magnificent Tales From Topographic Oceans.<br /><br />Which, judging by most reviews on this site, really seems to be lacking in fans. Or more, \\"obsessors\\" like myself.<br /><br />Well, I come here to tell all you with the headlines \\"Obnoxious and Over-Indulgent Piece of Prog\\" are not necesarrily stupid, or musically inclined. Only confused, and overall lacking in musical patience.<br /><br />And this piece of music is hardly \\"indulgent\\" at all.<br /><br />\\"Indulgent\\" would be to describe too much improvisation and soloing and dragging out of songs and riffs over and over.<br /><br />The longest of TFTO's suites may last a mere 6-7 minutes.<br /><br />These are not improvisations, or solos, these are carefully constructed and utterly brilliant rock compositions so PROLIFIC that they stretched out a never-before-seen 80 minutes on an album.<br /><br />And being a bit of a Dead-Head myself, I will state, I know (and enjoy) indulgent rock.<br /><br />But I ALSO love Prog, and prog really is not indulgent at all.<br /><br />Compared to the, (I hate to say it,) overrated \\"Close To The Edge\\" (which is a brilliant listen, I must give it it's credit, I just don't understand its mass acclaim,) TFTO stretches out more than twice the length. No, that does NOT mean twice as \\"indulgent,\\" folks, that means more than twice the amount of songwriting. Could you call The Beatles, who at their prime were realeasing 3 albums a year (each without a dull moment on them) INDULGENT?!? No, the word would be \\"prolific.\\"<br /><br />At this time, the songwriting of Yes was prolific.<br /><br />It only took them a year to construct this masterpiece, even in the middle of the mass touring from the recent Close To The Edge release.<br /><br />They were all quite proud of it, by the time it was done and before it was released to the public. But then the critics listened to it. And didnt understand it.<br /><br />Well, OF COURSE!<br /><br />THEY ONLY GAVE IT ONE LISTEN!<br /><br />Being the prog listeners that we are, we all know it takes about 3-4 listens to start to catch on to a prog album. And once we catch on... boy, is it a great ride! Sometimes classically composed music like this is SO much better when you know whats coming next. But this of course, takes above all: PATIENCE.<br /><br />And patience is what the critics did not have.<br /><br />But we can't really blame them,can we? They listen to about 10 new albums a day, they don't have the time to give this lengthy 80 minute art piece \\"3-4 LISTENS\\" in one sitting!!<br /><br />The general public, and already-Yes fans moreover, didn't quite realize this either. Most of them read the critics reviews before giving the album its recquired 3-4 listens, and gave up, agreeing that this stuff was stupid and over-indulgent prog garbage.<br /><br />But there were few that held patience.<br /><br />They were few and far between, but they were greatly rewarded with one of the greatest rock compositions in its histroy. And this hardly even rock and roll. It truly is more along the lines of classical, only featuring the traditional \\"rock band\\" instrunments; making the sound a little heavier.<br /><br />Personally, I was hooked by the opening synth riff of THE REVEALING. I mean... sheer beauty. I really could go into each of the four main \\"songs\\" (if that's what you want to call them,) but its really unimportant, their descriptions would probably only be to vague, and the point really is for you to experience them for yourself. And besides, the extensive length of the album would only make this review even longer.<br /><br />But to describe it all in one word: \\"moody.\\"<br /><br />The different moods of the album are endless, and shift around in various directions, but it in the ended is constructed to all flow like a river, and by the time its over you will look back feeling it was all quite relaxing. Yes: hardly \\"rock and roll.\\"<br /><br />30 years later, the number of TFTO fans has little increased, and its almost quite sad. Before, it was fun for us; it was almost like our little \\"best-kept secret.\\" But after a while, we got lonely, because we have no one to share its glory with.<br /><br />So, reader, my only suggestion for you is to purchase this record, as soon as you feel like it, and pay your dues. Give it some time, let it grow on you by itself. It will take work, but the light at the end of this tunnel is so bright and delightful, you most likely fall in love.<br /><br />And hey, only adding one more member to the Tales From Topographic Oceans fans can, and will make quite a difference.ngth of the album would only make this review even longer. <br /> <br />But to describe it all in one word: \\"moody.\\" <br />The different moods of the album are endless, and shift around in various directions, but it in the ended is constructed to all flow like a river, and by the time its over you will look back feeling it was all quite relaxing.

B0006284JQ|5.0|Despite her detractors (as apparent on this site--people that only diss her and don't review the actual music fairly), Britney Spears has remained at the top of the pop charts.  Sure, it's largely due to her looks but her songs are flawless concoctions of Top 40 pop.  From her 1998 uber smash and first single \\"...Baby One More Time\\" to the classic \\"Oops!...I Did It Again,\\" from sexy \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\" to 2004's Best Single (according to critics and fans) \\"Toxic,\\" the reigning queen of teen has entertained the world.  Her Greatest Hits may be a little early due its release in 2004, only six years after her debut, but Britney Spears has a great track record, being most of her songs are so well-known that even given just the intro on tracks like \\"...Baby One More Time, \\"Oops!...I Did It Again,\\" \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\" and \\"Toxic\\" most listeners know the song.  Being she's always been more of a singles artist than records, it's refreshing to hear most of her hits together as one, giving it an actual full-listen.
B0002XDODU|4.0|This cd has the same sound as mutter only that they have perfected it everything is perfict in this cd when the overall music is being judged. the songs were a bit different in some ways by using some different languages (Russian, english) and the band hit a new high with the song Ohne Dich. If your looking for metal with a highly musical aspect to it this is the cd for you.
B00004SCX6|4.0|Call her what you may, but nobody can say that Britney Spears didn't once bring it.  Her 2000 sophomore record Oops!...I Did It Again outsold diva Mariah Carey with 1.3 million copies sold in its first week, and its title track is a pop classic.  The rest of the album follows suit, with its Euro-influenced cheese pop (\\"Stronger\\" and \\"Don't Go Knockin' on My Door\\" are examples of this) to soft ballads like \\"Don't Let Me Be the Last To Know.\\"  Sure, the ballads other than the aforementioned \\"Don't Let Me Be the Last To Know\\" and \\"Lucky\\" are horrendous, but the upbeat tracks make that just an afterthought.  Oops!...I Did It Again is the best teen pop can get, regardless of what you think of Britney Spears.
B000EGDC0A|4.0|Alison Goldfrapp is one of those artists worth waiting a few years for, especially if it's for the follow-up to the sexy electropop \\"Black Cherry.\\" And she doesn't disappoint in her third album, the much-anticipated \\"Supernature\\" -- sultry, dancey electropop, with a hint of future experimentation.<br /><br />It opens on a strong note with a trio of sinuous beat-heavy songs -- the fluffier, dancier pop of \\"Ooh La La\\" and the sinuous beats of \\"Lovely 2 C U,\\" although that letter-number thing is a bit too cutesy for my taste. By the time she approaches the heavy, twisting beats and swooning vocals of \\"Ride A White Horse,\\" it's obvious that Goldfrapp has hit her stride.<br /><br />From there on, she experiments a bit with different styles, not content to just sit on the dancier electropop, as many artists would do. She tries out orchestral electropop, ethereal balladry that makes her sound like she's floating away, sizzly synthpop, and delicate dancepop.<br /><br />By the finale, Goldfrapp is poking around in some different sounds as well -- sinuous, complex dancepop that is busy slithering all over the sound board, a classier brand of electropop, and the piece de resistance: \\"Time Out of the World,\\" a string-accented, expansive song that seems content to sweep gently over the listener's ears.<br /><br />If that exquisite song is where Goldfrapp is going with her music, then I'm sure her fans will follow eagerly. Most of the album is in the same mold as \\"Black Cherry,\\" but more refined and mature artistically. And of course, she starts putting out feelers toward new styles.<br /><br />And even if you're not looking for artistic brilliance, Goldfrapp will be fun to listen to -- her ballads are achingly pretty, and her dancepop is the sort of stuff that you can tap your foot to, but not so repetitive that it becomes monotonous. Sultry melodies, rapid beats, and all arranged as actual music. Sometimes Goldfrapp even accentuates the dancepop with smooth soundscapes and strings.<br /><br />The centerpieces is, of course, Goldfrapp's singing. Her sweet voice weaves in and out of the beats -- sometimes she's front and center, sometimes she's darting behind the sound. Want a downside to all this? Okay, the lyrics are not exactly brilliant (\\"When the light turns into darkness/Will he turn up to explain us?/I wanna ride on a white horse...\\").<br /><br />\\"Supernature\\" is not supernatural, but it is a delightful electropop album, and gives a few glimpses of where Goldfrapp may be heading in the future.

B0000DD7LB|4.0|If you don't like the Grammy-winning \\"Toxic\\" then something must be wrong with you because everybody else did, even the hard-to-please critics.  Britney Spears' fourth studio record In the Zone is a mishmash of futurepop, hip-hop and sophisticated trance, and though it isn't always successful it provides and much-needed change from the cheese pop of her earlier days.  First single  \\"Me Against the Music,\\" featuring pop icon Madonna, is decent but falls short of expectations since it lacks any real melody; of course, the aforementioned super smash \\"Toxic\\" is the standout track here.  The only ballads on record are \\"Everytime\\" and \\"Shadow,\\" and both are equally likable (with \\"Shadow\\" being the more listenable of the two in my opinion), and Spears gives quite impressive performances on both (but more so on \\"Shadow\\" once again).  Britney provides hot-and-heavy, sweaty and club-ready pop here, from the sexual \\"Breathe On Me\\" to the ode to masturbation track that is \\"Touch of My Hand,\\" one of the most musically adventurous and impressive songs on the CD.  Still, as on any Britney record there are some failures, such as the Madonna-influenced \\"Brave New Girl\\" and the boring and repetative \\"Early Mornin',\\" but the disc's choice cuts make this CD worth purchasing if you're a pop music fan.  If not, then don't listen.
0800141660|4.0|This is a truly great movie. It is one that I can watch over and over, yet can never seem to get enough of!  I found \\"Sense and Sensibilty\\" to be one of the most charming movies I have seen since \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". It has a very warm feeling and is very welcoming. The story is absolutely beautiful. In the 1990's, all of Jane Austen's huge novels were made into movies and some even in television series. Most of them were very good, but Sense and Sensibility really stood out. Most thanks to Emma Thompson and her brilliant screenplay, which was also her first.  I found out that this screenplay took her about 4 years to have the final draft done. She also couldn't translate some of the novel into the book so she took some of Austen's letters and put them into the movie.<br /><br />The acting is absolutely on key and all of the actors fit quite well into their roles. I enjoy period pieces thourelly, if you don't, you might want to skip it. But I would recommend this picture any day. It's very beautiful and a wonderful movie to watch. It has some of the finest British actors: Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, and Hugh Grant. So give it a chance, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised
6305907145|4.0|Ok, so it's not like the book. I love the book ... and I love this film. They're different. Honestly, I don't know if I could watch an adaptation of Mansfield Park that was completely true to the novel, because Fanny Price is a very quiet, thoughtful, virtuous person who essentially never does anything wrong. She sits, she observes, she pines for Edward, and she thinks. Occasionally she speaks. As a reader, you know her thoughts and emotions through Jane Austen's genius narration. I just don't think that a quiet Fanny would come across in film - so I am fine with the many liberties taken here. My favorite bits of dialogue from this movie are actually lifted from Northanger Abbey, which I found quite amusing. If you are a die-hard Austen purist, you might not like this film. But I love Jane and manage to love this movie as well. <br /> <br />Oh, and be prepared to fall for Henry Crawford. It's really hard to dislike him when he is that beautiful!
B0002OERI0|3.0|I used to listen to the older Green Day CD's but moved on to more hardcore music. As someone who listens to bands like Leftover Crack, Black Flag, and Minor Threat I found this CD to be somewhat enjoyable. There's a lot of pop but there is some punk to be found as well. Kinda catchy and acsessible I think the problem is they got way too much media attention.  All in all if it wasn't played on the radio 24/7 I don't think so many people would hate Green Day. Oh and to all those idiots whinning about how great classic rock bands (Led Zep, Iron Maiden ect)are: You and your music suck.<br /><br />Bottom Line: If your just getting into punk start with Green Day, otherwise though you can probably find something better.

0812550706|4.0|Much goes on in this book, but if I had to sum it up in a quick way I'd say \\"Ender's Game\\" is kind of like the Harry Potter stories, only instead of young Ender and his friends learning how to be wizards, they're learning the military strategies and techniques that they'll ultimately have to use to battle the \\"buggers\\", an insect-like alien race mankind has battled to a draw in the past.<br /><br />The story- in this first outing of the series, at least- is also a bit more philosophical and metaphysical than the Potter series.  Initially, a kind of \\"does the end justify the means?\\" theme permeates the plot as Ender and his friends are subjected to all manner of manipulations by their adult trainers; then the conversation evolves more to the idea that \\"yes, the end often does justify the means, but that doesn't mean that it still isn't all a little sad.\\"  Finally, because this is science fiction novel, we- and the characters- ultimately get to experience a many-years-after-the-proceedings perspective that seems to say, \\"is ANY major conflict really worth the effort and sacrifice, in light of the fact that the high emotions and the conflict in question all become old news and stale history before you know it?  Could there have been a better way to solve the problem?\\"  And, again because this is a science fiction novel, our hero Ender just may find a way to make at least some after-the-fact adjustments to set the universe in proper balance.<br /><br />But to say more would be to take away from the experience of the book.  Give \\"Ender's Game\\" a shot, and see if you're as surprised as I am that some thoughtful film maker hasn't yet turned this into a really great movie.

B000E6UK5K|5.0|Well I have read a bunch of the reviews here and I decided to post mine. I will keep my opinion very short and direct. I think this is by far the best work David Gilmore has released in the last 20 years or so. The writing is superb and has a very introspective quality about it. There seem's to be a very graceful mature dedication that can only come with time. Musically it is inspiring ! Just sit back and relax, this one will settle in quite nicely.  <br /> For you hardcore Floyd fans, it's well worth the wait. Island harkens back to the machine and more. This is Gilmore, and he has matured with time. There are some music groups that just rock on, and there are some musicians that tend to move on. I think Gilmore just shines it all on. Take a real good listen, you won't be dissapointed.

B000DWMYQ8|5.0|I recently watched this animated feature film with my five-year old grandson, Cameron Morris, and we both enjoyed it thoroughly but for different reasons. That's an important issue for parents, grandparents, and other adult relatives of small children. Literally, this film offers \\"something for everyone.\\" Cameron was intrigued by the strained relations which soon develop between Chicken Little (with Zach Braff's voice) and his father, Buck Cluck (Garry Marshall). He thoroughly enjoyed the mayhem as well as the friendship which CL shares with Abby Mallard (Joan Cusack), Runt of the Litter (Steve Zahn), and Fish Out of Water (Dan Molina). The pace accelerates when an alient infant (Kirby whose voice is provided by Evan Dunn) is accidentally left behind after a brief visit by his parents and other aliens who travel in hexagon-shaped space ships of various sizes which have blinking multi-color lights, resembling the devices which restaurants provide to those waiting to be seated. Lots of action ensues. John Debney's musical score complements the narrative without drawing attention to itself. At the conclusion of the film, Cameron said that he really loved it and wanted to see it again...and again...and again...It seems safe to say that he will.<br /><br />As for my own favorable reactions, I appreciated the multiple-levels of humor which include clever word play as well as integration of popular song lyrics with plot developments (e.g. Carole King's \\"It's Too Late,\\" Elton John and Kiki Dee's \\"Don't Go Breaking My heart,\\" and Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell's \\"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\\"). I was also struck by how subtly the co-writers of the screenplay juxtaposed CL's relationship with his father with the alien infant's relationship with his mother (Catherine O'Hara) and especially with his father (Fred Willard). Cameron picked up on one point, that love should not have to be \\"earned.\\" In so many of Disney's previous animated classics (notably Pinocchio, Dumbo, Bambi, Peter Pan and The Lion King), there are thoughtful and sensitive portrayals of parent-child relationsips which involve miscommunication and misunderstanding, alientation, separation, reconciliation, and sometimes death.<br /><br />As is also true of so many other fables, Chicken Little offers interesting characters involved in familiar situations (with which people of all ages can identify) and is thereby entertaining.

0440237688|5.0|This is a utopian story that is written in a style and language understandable by all ages, even those as young as sixth grade.  The main idea revolves around the concept of a perfect society and what must be sacrificed in order to achieve that, most significantly personal freedom and expression.  A uniform, restricted, colorless, apathetic, malevolent society ironically results from the attempt to create an ideal community.  Younger readers may be particularly shocked by the lack of regard for human life.

B000295SH4|3.0|I own several Donna Summer compilations, not so much because I relish having several copies of the same song, but because each one has something that the others do not.  For example; the oldest Summer compilation I have ( a European import released in the very late '80s ) is the ONLY one to this day that has the full length version of \\"State Of Independece\\" free of the annoying, damaged tape section that muffles parts in the middle of the song ( If you own any of the other compilations, and are not sure what I'm talking about, listen to the song with headphones on. About the time Donna starts singing \\" Sounds like a Signal from you...\\" you'll hear noticeable muffling in one channel for much of that section. An appalling defect on so many releases from a major label ).<br /><br />This release is unique as, to my knowledge, it is the only official major label Donna Summer release to include the legendary Patrick Cowley megamix of \\"I Feel Love\\" - a staggering 15 minute mix. This version is incredible when you consider that it was produced and hand-edited ( no digital tools back then ) by the late Cowley, who played all of the synthesizer overdubs, in his home studio in 1979. Previously only available as either an acetate bootleg, or on the defunct, DJ only subscription service \\"Disconet\\", this CD version has been remastered to the best possible sound from the available source. Considering the original \\"I Feel Love\\" parts were, no doubt, recorded from vinyl to tape when Cowley produced this mix, it sounds very good. This mix alone is the best reason to get this collection.<br /><br />As to the main disc, you've heard it all before, and in longer versions. Most of the tracks on this disc are the shortened radio edits, and only of interest to the casual listener.<br /><br />For the best overall collection, my recommendation would be the 2004 release \\"Gold\\", which not only contains the full length album versions of most tracks, but includes several glaring omissions left off of the older, very similar \\"Anthology\\".<br /><br />However I still say that this release is worth buying, if only for the contents of the bonus disc, which contains some decent newer material, as well as the 12\\" version of \\"Love To Love You Baby\\" and the aforementioned, very rare mix of \\"I Feel Love\\"left off of the older, very similar \\"Anthology\\". <br /> <br />However I still say that this release is worth buying, if only for the contents of the bonus disc, which contains some decent newer material, as well as the 12\\" version of \\"Love To Love You Baby\\" and the aforementioned, very rare mix of \\"I Feel Love\\"
0451191153|3.0|Several years ago, Miss Ayn Rand wrote The Fountainhead. Despite a generally poor press, it is said to have sold some four hundred thousand copies. Thus, it became a wonder of the book trade of a kind that publishers dream about after taxes. So Atlas Shrugged (Random House, $6.95) had a first printing of one hundred thousand copies. It appears to be slowly climbing the best seller lists.  <br />The news about this book seems to me to be that any ordinarily sensible head could possibly take it seriously, and that apparently, a good many do. Somebody has called it: \\"Excruciatingly awful.\\" I find it a remarkably silly book. It is certainly a bumptious one. Its story is preposterous. It reports the final stages of a final conflict (locale: chiefly the United States, some indefinite years hence) between the harried ranks of free enterprise and the \\"looters.\\" These are proponents of proscriptive taxes. Government ownership, Labor, etc. etc. The mischief here is that the author, dodging into fiction, nevertheless counts on your reading it as political reality. \\"This,\\" she is saying in effect, \\"is how things really are. These are the real issues, the real sides. Only your blindness keeps you from seeing it, which, happily, I have come to rescue you from.\\"  <br /> <br />Since a great many of us dislike much that Miss Rand dislikes, quite as heartily as she does, many incline to take her at her word. It is the more persuasive, in some quarters, because the author deals wholly in the blackest blacks and the whitest whites. In this fiction everything, everybody, is either all good or all bad, without any of those intermediate shades which, in life, complicate reality and perplex the eye that seeks to probe it truly. This kind of simplifying pattern, of course, gives charm to most primitive story-telling. And, in fact, the somewhat ferro-concrete fairy tale the author pours here is, basically, the old one known as: The War between the Children of Light and the Children of Darkness. In modern dress, it is a class war. Both sides of it are caricatures.  <br /> <br />The Children of Light are largely operatic caricatures. In so far as any of them suggests anything known to the business community, they resemble the occasional curmudgeon millionaire, tales about whose outrageously crude and shrewd eccentricities sometimes provide the lighter moments in Board rooms. Otherwise, the Children of Light are geniuses. One of them is named (the only smile you see will be your own): Francisco Domingo Carlos Andres Sebastian d'Antonio. This electrifying youth is the world's biggest copper tycoon. Another, no less electrifying, is named: Ragnar Danesjold. He becomes a twentieth-century pirate. All Miss Rand's chief heroes are also breathtakingly beautiful. So is her heroine (she is rather fetchingly vice-president in charge of management of a transcontinental railroad). So much radiant energy might seem to serve an eugenic purpose. For, in this story as in Mark Twain's, \\"all the knights marry the princess\\"- though without benefit of clergy. Yet from the impromptu and surprisingly gymnastic matings of heroine and three of the heroes, no children- it suddenly strikes you- ever result. The possibility is never entertained. And indeed, the strenuously sterile world of Atlas Shrugged is scarcely a place for children. You speculate that, in life, children probably irk the author and may make her uneasy. How could it be otherwise when she admiringly names a banker character (by what seems to me a humorless master-stroke): Midas Mulligan? You may fool some adults, you can't fool little boys and girls with such stuff- not for long. They may not know just what is out of line, but they stir uneasily.  <br />  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />The Children of Darkness are caricatures, too; and they are really oozy. But at least they are caricatures of something identifiable. Their archetypes are Left Liberals, New Dealers, Welfare Statists, One Worlders, or, at any rate, such ogreish semblances of these as may stalk the nightmares of those who think little about people as people, but tend to think a great deal in labels and effigies. (And neither Right nor Left, be it noted in passing, has a monopoly of such dreamers, though the horrors in their nightmares wear radically different masks and labels.)  <br /> <br />In Atlas Shrugged, all this debased inhuman riffraff is lumped as \\"looters.\\" This is a fairly inspired epithet. It enables the author to skewer on one invective word everything and everybody that she fears and hates. This spares here the plaguy business of performing one service that her fiction might have performed. Namely: that of examining in human depth how so feeble a lot came to exist at all, let alone be powerful enough to be worth hating and fearing. Instead, she bundles them into one undifferentiated damnation.  <br /> <br />\\"Looters\\" loot because they believe in Robin Hood, and have a lot of other people believing in him, too. Robin Hood is the author's image of absolute evil- robbing the strong (and hence good) to give to the weak (and hence no good). All \\"looters\\" are base, envious, twisted, malignant minds, motivated wholly by greed for power, combined with the lust of the weak to tear down the strong, out of a deep-seated hatred of life and secret longing for destruction and death. There happens to be a tiny (repeat: tiny) seed of truth in this. The full clinical diagnosis can be read into the pages of Friedich Nietzsche. (Here I must break in with an aside. Miss Rand acknowledges a grudging debt to one, and only one, earlier philosopher: Aristotle. I submit that she is indebted, and much more heavily, to Nietzche. Just as her operatic businessmen are, in fact, Nietzschean supermen, so her ulcerous Leftists are Nietzsche's \\"last men,\\" both deformed in a way to sicken the fastidious recluse of Sils Maria. And much else comes, consciously on not, from the same source.) Happily, in Atlas Shrugged (though not in life), all the children of Darkness are utterly incompetent.  <br /> <br />So the Children of Light win handily by declaring a general strike of brains, of which they have a monopoly, letting the world go, literally, to smash. In the end, they troop out of their Rocky Mountain hideaway to repossess the ruins. It is then, in the book's last line, that a character traces in the air, \\"over the desolate earth,\\" the Sign of the Dollar, in lieu of the Sign of the Cross, and in token that a suitably prostrate mankind is at last ready, for its sins, to be redeemed from the related evils of religion and social reform (the \\"mysticism of mind\\" and the \\"mysticism of muscle\\").  <br /> <br />That Dollar Sign is not merely provocative, though we sense a sophomoric intent to raise the pious hair on susceptible heads. More importantly, it is meant to seal the fact that mankind is ready to submit abjectly to an elite of technocrats, and their accessories, in a New Order, enlightened and instructed by Miss Rand's ideas that the good life is one which \\"has resolved personal worth into exchange value,\\" \\"has left no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous 'cash payment.'\\" The author is explicit, in fact deafening, about these prerequisites. Lest you should be in any doubt after 1168 pages, she assures you with a final stamp of the foot in a postscript: \\"and I mean it.\\" But the words quoted above are those of Karl Marx. He, too, admired \\"naked self-interest\\" (in its time and place), and for much of the same reasons as Miss Rand: because, he believed, it cleared away the cobwebs of religion and led to prodigies of industrial and cognate accomplishment.  <br /> <br /> <br />The overlap is not as incongruous as it looks. Atlas Shrugged can be called a novel only by devaluing the term. It is a massive tract for the times. Its story merely serves Miss Rand to get the customers inside the tent. And as a soapbox for delivering her Message. The Message is the thing. Itis a sum, a forthright philosophic materialism. Upperclassmen might incline to sniff and say that the author has, with vast effort, contrived a simple materialist system, one, intellectually, at about the state of the oxcart, though without mastering the principle of the wheel. Like any consistent materialism, this one begins by rejecting God, religion, original sin, etc. etc. (This book's aggressive atheism and rather unbuttoned \\"higher morality,\\" which chiefly outrage some readers, are, in fact, secondary ripples, and result inevitably from its underpinning premises.) Thus, Randian Man, like Marxian Man, is made the center of a godless world.  <br /> <br />At that point, in any materialism, the main possibilities open up to Man. 1) His tragic fate becomes, without God, more tragic and much lonelier. In general, the tragedy deepens according to the degree of pessimism or stoicism with which he conducts his \\"hopeless encounter between human questioning and the silent universe.\\" Or, 2) Man's fate ceases to be tragic at all. Tragedy is bypassed by the pursuit of happiness. Tragedy is henceforth pointless. Henceforth man's fate, without God, is up to him. And to him alone. His happiness, is strict materialist terms, lies with his own workaday hands and ingenious brain. His happiness becomes, in Miss Rand's words, \\"the moral purpose of his life.\\" Here occurs a little rub whose effects are just as observable in a free enterprise system, which is in practice materialist (whatever else it claims or supposes itself to be), as they would be under an atheist Socialism, if one were ever to deliver that material abundance that all promise. The rub is that the pursuit of happiness, as an end in itself, tends automatically, and widely, to be replaced by the pursuit of pleasure with a consequent general softening of the fibers of will, intelligence on \\"man as a heroic being\\" \\"with productive achievement as his noblest activity.\\" For, if man's \\"heroism\\" (some will prefer to say: \\"human dignity\\") no longer derives from God, or is not a function of that godless integrity which was a root of Nietzsche's anguish, then Man becomes merely the most consuming of animals, with glut as the condition of his happiness. And this, of course, suits the author's economics and the politics that must arise from them.  <br /> <br />For politics, of course, arise, though the author of Atlas Shrugged stares stonily past them, as if this book were not what, in fact it is, essentially- a political book. And here begins mischief. Systems of philosophic materialism, so long as they merely circle outside this world's atmosphere, matter little to most of us. The trouble is that they keep coming down to earth. It is when a system of materialist ideas presumes to give positive answers to real problems of our real life that mischief starts. In a age like ours, in which a highly complex technological society is everywhere in a high state of instability, such answers however philosophic, translate quickly into political realities. And in the degree to which problems of complexity and instability are most bewildering to masses of men, a temptation sets in to let some species of Big Brother solve and supervise them.  <br /> <br />One Big Brother is of course, a socializing elite (as we know, several cut-rate brands are on the shelves). Miss Rand, as the enemy of any socializing force, calls in a Big Brother of her own contriving to do battle with the other. In the name of free enterprise, therefore, she plumps for a technocratic elite (I find no more inclusive word than technocratic to bracket the industrial-financial-engineering caste she seems to have in mind). When she calls \\"productive achievement\\" man's \\"noblest activity,\\" she means, almost exclusively, technological achievement, supervised by such a managerial political bureau. She might object that she means much, much more; and we can freely entertain her objections. But in sum, that is just what she means. For thatis what, in reality, it works out to. And in reality, too, by contrast, with fiction, this can only head into a dictatorship, however benign, living and acting beyond good and evil, a law unto itself (as Miss Rand believes it should be), and feeling any restraint on itself as, in practice, criminal, and, in morals, vicious- as Miss Rand clearly feels it to be. Of course, Miss Rand nowhere calls for a dictatorship. I take her to be calling for an aristocracy of talents. We cannot labor here why, in the modern world, the pre-conditions for aristocracy, an organic growth, no longer exist, so that impulse toward aristocracy always emerges now in the form of dictatorship.  <br /> <br />Nor has the author, apparently, brooded on the degree to which, in a wicked world, a materialism of the Right and a materialism of the Left, first surprisingly resemble, then in action tend to blend each with each, because, while differing at the top in avowed purposed, and possibly in conflict there, at bottom they are much the same thing. The embarrassing similarities between Hitler's National Socialism and Stalin's brand of Communism are familiar. For the world, as seen in materialist view from the Left. The question becomes chiefly: who is to run that world in whose interests, or perhaps, at best, who can run it more efficiently?  <br /> <br />Something of this implication is fixed in the book's dictatorial tone, which is much its most striking feature. Out of a lifetime of reading, I can recall no other book in which a tone of overriding arrogance was so implacably sustained. Its shrillness is without reprieve. Its dogmatism is without appeal. In addition, the mind, which finds this one natural to it, shares other characteristics of its type. 1) It consistently mistakes raw force for strength, and the rawer the force, the more reverent the posture of the mind before it. 2) It supposes itself to be the bringer of a final revelation. Therefore, resistance to the Message cannot be tolerated because disagreement can never be merely honest, prudent or just humanly fallible. Dissent from revelation so final (because, the author would say, so reasonable) can only be willfully wicked. There are ways of dealing with such wickedness, and, in fact, right reason itself enjoins them. From almost any page of Atlas Shrugged, a voice can be heard, from painful necessity, commanding: \\" To the gas chambers- go!\\" The same inflexibly self-righteous stance results, too (in the total absence of any saving humor), in odd extravagances of inflection and gesture- that Dollar Sign, for example. At first, we try to tell ourselves that these are just lapses, that this mind has, somehow, mislaid the discriminating knack that most of us pray will warn us in time of the differences between what is effective and firm, and what is wildly grotesque and excessive. Soon we suspect something worse. We suspect that this mind finds, precisely in extravagance, some exalting merit; feels a surging release of power and passion precisely in smashing up the house. A tornado might feel this way, or Carrie Nation.  <br /> <br />We struggle to be just. For we cannot help feel at least a sympathetic pain before the sheer labor, discipline and patient craftsmanship that went to making this mountain of words. But the words keep shouting us down. In the end that tone dominates. But it should be its own antidote, warning us that anything it shouts is best taken with the usual reservations with which we might sip a patent medicine. Some may like the flavor. In any case, the brew is probably without lasting ill effects. But it is not a cure for anything. Nor would we, ordinarily, place much confidence in the diagnosis of a doctor who supposes that the Hippocratic Oath is a kind of curse.  <br /> <br />Whittaker Chambers
B000301YY8|5.0|How rare is it to love an entire CD?  All tracks are in the same mellow mood and tone; another bonus.  Love it.
B0002DB0FO|4.0|It's great! If you missed Season 1, you can go back and find out how it all started ... and ... it's completely commercial free! I would have rated it with a 5; however, I'm still waiting for Season 2 to be released.
0446310786|4.0|I loved it.  I definitely see why it is a classic and required reading for students.  I read it for a private book club and I know I will have loads of stimulating conversation discussing it.
B0000CFW87|3.0|Josh has a great, great voice, but most of the songs a too similar on this CD.  Variety is lacking.  I would also like to have more songs in English.
0553212737|4.0|I saw the BBC film adaptation of this (not the one with Gwyneth Paltrow) AND Clueless before reading this, so I was expecting to have some difficulty, as tends to happen when I've seen the film first. <br /> <br />However, I really enjoyed reading and although it takes some getting used to, I enjoyed the rich and interesting dialogue and language.   <br /> <br />This is the third Jane Austen book I have read - after Persuasion and Northanger Abbey.  This is by far my favourite as I thought the character of Emma was very well developed and very enjoyable - I couldn't help but love her despite her pride and prejudices.  Haha. <br /> <br />I did attempt to read Pride & Prejudice a few years back and gave up because of Austen's writing style.  Emma has encouraged me to persevere, and I just love the P&P BBC series - it's amazing! <br /> <br />Emma (the book and the character) is not to everyone's taste but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed reading this.
B000CPH9I4|5.0|I really like this album. My husbnd wasn't sure I would when he gave it to me for Valentine's Day. He stated that since there were two songs in Gaelic that it would be different from the other Corrs CD's I have. I opened it put it in the player and it has yet to come out of the player. In fact the two Gaelic songs are the ones I like the most. I like each son but those stand out to me.
B0009UC7H0|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, even though it was a VERY loose adaptation of Clive Cussler's book (by the way, Sahara is one of my favorites of Cussler's books, although most of his books are great!)  However, that said, the movie was fun with lots of action, and humor. It's not as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark, but then, what is?  Definitely worth watching, and if you're into this type of movie, worth owning!
B000244EMO|3.0|bad picture, bad sound for collectors editionn. addons not realy good.
B000050FEN|4.0|And deadly sins these were.  This is a weird murder mystery with a surprise ending.  I would not call this Brad Pitt's best picture but he was good.  Very suspenseful. <br /> <br />
B000002AH9|5.0|This classic album lives completely up to expectations to the extent that it contains all the original material.  But, the only people I know that appreciate the tacked on alternative versions are the techno-fanatics.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|HOw amazing is it to watch the historical rock group Cream reunite after all these years to perform their hits at the Royal Albert Hall? The sound is surprisingly fresh.  Although Eric Clapton has maintained his creativity and productivity over the years, both Ginger Baker and Jack Bruce deliver on this CD with musicianship likely akin to the level they were at the height of the popularity of Cream in the 1960s.  Thoroughly enjoyable for rock buffs such as myself and for all others who dig Cream.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I watch it everyday nonstop since I got it back in Jan. A must buy for sure <br /> <br /> <br />
B000E8N690|3.0|I truyl enjoyed the acting performance of Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash,though overall he was missing that edge that Reese Witherspoon brought as June Cash.I think Her Performance is what got her awarded the Oscar.the film was well put together.just was missing something which kept it from being very good to great. still the Chemstry between Phoenix&Witherspoon is on point. good to see the film acknowledging many of the Highs&Lows of Johnny Cash's Musica career.
B000AARKOO|5.0|Very well done depiction of the events surrounding the crusades that tells the story and perspective from both sides of the conflict and doesn't completely demonize one. One can draw a lot of insight and parallels to the conflict going on in the middle east in the modern times
B000E6UK32|5.0|Blondie was something else back in the day.Hybrids of various styles.everything that Madonna&now Gwenn Stefani do Deborah Harry was all about back in the day.catchy pop songs that reached so many folks.\\"Rapture\\" was a cold Cut. Heart of Glass,The Tide is High,etc...are all sounding good here.the DVD is cool as well.a tight throw in as well.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|David Gilmour' ears, mind, and hands are the institutional memory of Pink Floyd.  It looks like he can do no wrong.   <br /> <br />For me, listening to this whole album in the car tonight was like hearing a new PF album, but better in certain ways.  You can hear the maturity.  Very mellow music, like elevator music - IF your elevator happens to go up to the asteroid belt.  The music is a little more harmonically advanced than my favorites from the golden age of PF.  There are flashbacks to PF music from Ummagumma up through the Wall (which is the last one I listened to very much).  Meddle is the one this most reminds me of, I guess because Island is so guitar-centric.  However, Dave's not plundering his past repetoire, just making some neat allusions.  <br /> <br />I figure five stars - this is great if you like Pink Floyd, a must-hear CD.  <br /> <br />The arrangements are impeccable, like a pillow of wind supporting that signature pinched strat sound, plus every other guitar sound known to Gilmour fans.  I couldn't make out all of the words in the car, but that really doesn't matter much.  Track 7 is really cool, bringing the biggest grin to my face.  Just a trippy instrumental with a neat set of interlocking riffs. <br /> <br />If you like this one, check out Dave's live DVD.  Also check out the latest couple of albums by Phil Manzanera.
B00005JO1J|2.0|I was sooo dissapointed by the movie version of RENT and I am not a \\"renthead\\". I saw the Broadway show for the first time on the 10 year anniversary because I had to see it onstage before the movie came out. I am so glad I did. I didn't know the plotline before I saw it and I literally cried for twenty minutes in the middle of Times Square after leaving the theatre. I couldn't even listen to disc two of the cast recording, for weeks, without crying. The scenes that they left out of the movie should have been left in. It would have added a whole ten minutes to the running time but they were so important to telling the whole story. I don't think I can sit through another viewing of this movie. If you want to know what the Broadway musical was like, buy the original broadway cast recording. It is exactly how the show runs, with little talk and so much more singing. It also gives you the whole story with all the emotion that should be in the movie. If you haven't seen RENT in the theater, the whole show is done with only one set. It's great!!
B000BYA5G4|5.0|Warning: this is not a war movie.       Nicolas Cage, plays a fictional, global arms dealer named, Yuri Orlov. What he does is somewhat akin to the black market, in the sense that he is not an official weapons manufacturer or seller, instead he deals secretly under the goverments noses. Orlov's huge stock pile of weapons mainly comes from military surplus and abandoned weapons in warzones. He bribes military personell including border patrols to run across to other countries. He sells all types of guns, tanks and even attack helicopters to any country or militia willing to pay the price. He lives in glitz and glamour, in a giant penthouse, has a model trophy wife and owns his own line of air transports, travels the world and makes tons of cash, and sometimes gets paid in conflict diamonds as a form of currency.      Underneath the glitz, glamour and allure of the lifestyle, Orlov lives a very dangerous and depressing life. He lies to his wife, by claiming that he works in \\"imports/exports\\", his brother gets hooked on drugs and has to constantly send him to drug rehabilitation, he and his partners are being chased by Interpol (international police), the mafia syndicates threatened to kill him if his weapon's prices were too high or didn't want to accept cocaine as payment, warlords and malitia got angry if they didn't get their weapons to execute innocent civilians or rivals. Orlov tries to mask his dark world, by trying to make his family happy and living in luxery, when in fact his life is a business of death. He is death's best friend and he realizes this. Orlov, trades his soul and morality for money. To him it's a dirty business but someone has to do it and besides...he is very good at it. Nicolas Cage played the part to perfection, the story was compelling and his narritive style just pulls you in. Great cast of actors in a very unique film. I think not many people liked it because of the slow pace. A lot of the film's time was lost in Jared Leto's character as, Vitaly, the drug addicted brother. There is the constant narration (by Cage) done in monotone voice which some people may not like. Also, some people may have been mislead by the movie's title \\"Lord of War\\" then expecting to see a war movie. This is not a war movie. It is a character-driven movie about an arms dealer and his dark journey as he loses his soul.
B000002ADT|5.0|Kind of Blue is a must have CD for any jazz fan or even for the casual listener. It is not only easy on the ears, but it is also a mini who's who of the greatest musicians of the 20th century. <br /> <br />Eric Sutz
B000E6UK5K|2.0|Wake me up when this is over, How Boring!, Sorry, Dave, but you miss Roger!.
006056251X|5.0|Evangeline Jenner was always my favorite of the Wallflowers. Probably because she seemed the most hopeless; obviously I really wanted her story to be extraordinary. She could so easily have met with a kind sort of gentleman who would make her feel safe and therefore she would lose her stutter. Lisa Kleypas, however, could never write any book by halves or in any way ordinary. I just want to say that the character of Evie's man, in past Wallflower books, caused me discard him as having any role of importance in future books. Rather than having the effect of soothing a stutter this guy would have made me pretty close to a blithering idtiot. There are some slight predictable turns in the plot but they don't deter at all from the deep enjoyment of reading it. Ms. Kleypas obviously has had a good snuggle or two in her experience; has been very, very cold which can bring on a desire to burrow into a man's embrace. The story has it's sensual moments that are - ah - warming, but I loved the tenderness within best. Evie has a lot of grit, wit, and humor that we did get glimpses of earlier. But as in any new relationship, she and her man both shine and play off one another. Oh, one other thing, Ms. Kleypas never hesitates to throw in the realistic ugliness and occasional violence in her books. With her great dialogue she makes her characters so very believeably alive.
B00006AVRK|5.0|Bertie, in appearance and mannerisms, is an uncanny clone of our nephew.  Looking for the perfect thank you gift for his parents who recently royally entertained us, we immediately thought of this wonderful series.  We were not dissapointed.  Their shrieks of laughter could be heard 1,500 miles away.  Aside from that peculiar similarity, the second in the series, with its various renditions of \\"Sonny Boy\\" stands out as one of the funniest, if not the funniest, things I have ever seen.  The way it builds is priceless.  Of course, Jeeves, is there to counsel and protect his master; indeed, he is Machiavellian in his instigations and Wooster is so gullible.  A pure delight !
B000021Y77|5.0|This fast-paced film with an unusual narrative structure is an edgy, witty exploration of cause-and-effect, coincidence, and the proliferation of meaning.  To say too much would be to spoil all the fun surprises.  Just see it and enjoy!
0316172324|1.0|A great read for those of you surrounded by button-down type A's that have to dissect every problem and beat it to death before they can take action.  Buy one for each of them, and give them ten dollars if they will read it!   <br /> <br />If you find yourself in meetings, or calling meetings to decide on the problem solving method to tackle the problem of Coke or Pepsi in your vending machine at work, you need this book.
B00005MP58|5.0|I am a Colin Firth fan so seeing him in one of my favorite stories is fabulous. The whole cast is exceptional.
0316168815|5.0|From the first page, this book hooked me! I thought it sounded really morbid, but actually turned out to be a murder mystery. You follow the main carachter as she watches, from heaven, her family try to solve her murder case. I love it!
006056251X|5.0|Lisa Kleypas once again writes a funny but very romantic novel; That women are sure to love.  The love sceans in the book are VERY HOT!!!!  I truly love this author and this book.
B00008AWOG|3.0|I felt this album didn't match up to Opeth's latest, \\"Ghost Reveries.\\" That said, this album is closer to it than any other of Opeth's. It's very hard and fast-paced, but it still has it's slow, light (and still incredibly emotional) moments. <br /> <br />My main problem with this album is I often notice a lot of the melodies sound similar, and they're simply not that rememberable. Nevertheless it's still a nice addition to an Opeth fan's collection--I put it in every once in a while. <br /> <br />If you're a big fan of mainstream music, this might be the best album to start off on. However, if you want to be WOWed, get their most ingenius, melodical, aggressive, emotional album yet--Ghost Reveries.
0393317552|1.0|As a history lover for decades, I gave this book a try, and two other reading friends did too.  We love great writing, but only 1 of 3 could complete even half this book.  Similar to Listening to Prozac, this book is written by an academic to impress other academics, but it has no heart.  Yes, many of his points are no doubt true (you can say that about almost all history books) but the author's cleverly contrived way of organizing the material seems agonizingly pedantic, and this is clearly not inspired writing.  Too much intellectual blather here & no heart.   <br /> <br />
0767802519|4.0|If you have never heard of Jean Reno, you have got to watch this very low key thriller.  Natalie Portman performs beautifully and her acting is superlative.  Jean Reno, the assasin, is calm, mechanical, and cold blooded.  Natalie enters his life (literally via the door scene!) and it changed his outlook.   <br /> <br />Gary Oldman is perfect for the role of the movie villain and his acting is, as usual, believable and vicious.  Danny Aiello is your proverbial Italian 'godfather' and he is casted just right and acted just perfect. <br /> <br />The movie, while deserving of 5 stars, certainly could have explored Jean Reno's previous life a lot longer, but regardless, the movie itself should have been named, 'The Professionals' because all the actors were great and kudos to the potted plant.  It was manhandled all over the place and it still lived unscathe. <br />Great movie.
B000BYRCRY|5.0|Underworld: A place hidden underneath normal eyes.<br /><br />Selene is a vampire. For centuries she, and her group, the deathdealers, have been riding the world from lycons, werewolves. The war has been raging since God knows when. Now, nobody can even remember when the war began or what caused it. But everyone has the same intentions: kill the other group. For years, lycons have been growing scarce, which means that the vampires are winning. But now, the lycons are resurfacing to track an unknown human. Michael Corvin, a hospital worker, is apparently their target--but not for food. From this storyline we can get a sense that both groups want to find out more about him. Along the way there are many cool stunts, excelent history, and even a connection to science. Each person bitten, the curse of either the vampire or the werewold would get passed on like a virus. But what if a human was bitten by a werewolf . . .and a vampire? What would happen then? Find out here.<br /><br />Filled with excitement, unraveling storyline, comic-bookish characters and scenes and unbelievable make-up work.<br /><br />Enjoy, fellow night-owls!

B0000025DD|4.0|Released in 1978, David Gilmour's debut solo album is a generally low-key effort.  It's pretty easy to see why some listeners would tag it as \\"Pink Floyd lite\\", but I think that gets to the core of the album's appeal--this is a really good album to put on for just plain chilling out.    Gilmour's blues influence really bubbles to the surface on many of the tracks here.  Check out the simple-but-irresistible bluesy riffs on \\"Cry From The Street\\" and \\"No Way\\", or his extended soloing on \\"Raise My Rent\\" for proof.  Even the radio hit \\"There's No Way Out Of Here\\" has a swampy opening hook that sounds like its being played in unison by an electric guitar and a blues harmonica.    The moody, slide guitar-fortified \\"No Way\\" grooves along irresistibly, as does \\"Cry From The Street\\" with its crunchy rhythm guitar (the latter does have a ho-hum speeded-up fade, but it's quite brief).  The instrumental \\"Raise My Rent\\" features a lush-sounding, arpegiatted electric guitar riff--again, simple but irresistible--and it serves as a canvas for Gilmour's superb soloing, plus the subtle electric piano and organ flesh out the sound to excellent effect.  The harmony-fest \\"Short And Sweet\\" is another splendid track, with its catchy, droning guitar riffery.    The rest is generally enjoyable too even if it's underwhelming.  The tender \\"So Far Away\\" is a pretty piano-based ballad, but somewhat lacking in focus.  The album-opening instrumental \\"Mihalis\\" is nice enough, although it leans too far toward listless, generic Muzak for its own good.  \\"There's No Way Out Of Here\\" is a good song, with Floyd-style female backing vocals, although it feels kind of routine and passionless.  \\"Deafinitely\\", another instrumental, with a skittering \\"Sheep\\"-style rhythm, unfortunately overdoes its repetitive and gimmicky sound effects and ends up falling quite flat.  The album-closer \\"I Can't Breathe Anymore\\" starts off nice, but it's ultimately underdeveloped and feels rushed through.    So, the album is disappointing on some level.  Gilmour does seem to be coasting a bit here, and if he would have brought some more passion and focus to the proceedings (like he would do on his subsequent \\"About Face\\"), this maybe could have been a great album.  Still though, it's a really good listen even as it is, and it's interesting to see how it contrasts to the Floyd albums that it's sandwiched in between (\\"Animals\\" and \\"The Wall\\").
B00005JOWF|1.0|This movie is horrible.  Terrible.  It's like watching a bad european movie.  No plot, acting was terrible.  I liked Milla Jovavich in the Resident Evil Movies.  In fact, I first thought this was part 3 and was anxious to check it out.  But, it had no ties to the Resident Evil movies.  Boy was I glad about that.  It would've tainted that franchise.  This movie was so stupid.  I didn't care for the characters at all.  She should've not done this movie.  But, I guess all actors/actresses need to do a movie like this to cause them to realize that they need to be careful about their careers!!!
B00000IL29|5.0|\\"Maiden Voyage\\" in my opinion, is one of the best jazz albums I've ever heard. I rank this album right there alongside of Miles Davis' \\"Kind of Blue\\" or McCoy Tyner's \\"The Real McCoy.\\" But what really brings my ears into focus on this album is how subtle yet complex these songs are. All of these songs demonstrate strong melody, harmony, rhythm, and structure, while also having a very loose and spacious feeling. The interplay on this album is astonishing and all the soloists are accomplished and don't overplay each other. George Coleman on saxophone and Freddie Hubbard on trumpet were great choices, while Tony Williams on drums and Ron Carter on bass were obvious choices. Herbie Hancock couldn't ask for a better rhythm section than Williams and Carter.<br /><br />The music on this album is timeless and speaks for itself. All I can say is that any serious jazz musician or listener should pick this album up right now.<br /><br />I would like to make a comment to a reviewer who said that Dexter Gordon on saxophone would have been better than George Coleman for this session, Dexter Gordon couldn't play this kind of jazz, in fact, if the reviewer would do his research and listen to Dexter Gordon's album \\"Go!,\\" he'll soon realize that Gordon's style of playing wouldn't work with these songs. I think of Dexter Gordon as kind of a jazz standard saxophone player. His style just wouldn't work with this group at all. He stays in one place too long, and he wouldn't be able to keep up with the forward-thinking musicians like Hancock, Hubbard, Carter, and Williams who all would easily leave Gordon in the dust.<br /><br />Having said all of that, this album is beautiful and should be apart of everyone's jazz collection.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I actually didn't care for Seventh Trumpet that much, although I did really enjoy Waking the Fallen.  Avenged Sevenfold started out as a hardcore-type band with lots of double-bass, wailing guitar soloing, and screaming.  That is not at all City of Evil. <br /> <br />City of Evil is somewhat lighter, more melodic, and the vocals are much easier on the ears, in my opinion.  Although I was a bit skeptical at first of shaking hands with the new CD and welcoming it into my library, I am happy I went alonog with it.  Let me just give you one helpful tip: if anyone trys to tell you that Avenged Sevenfold is emo, don't believe it.  Whoever says that has no idea what they're talking about.  Avenged Sevenfold sounds NOTHING like standard emo.  There are some parts that even sound closer to progressive metal. <br /> <br />Some of my favorite cuts from City of Evil include Beast and the Harlot, Bat Country, The Wicked End and Strength of the World. <br /> <br />Beast and the Harlot, a strong opening number, gives a decent overview of the album.  Very strong, good guitar part, and drum part.  I don't really pay attention to lyrics most of the time, which is why I have no comments on them. <br /> <br />Bat Country is probably the closest you'll get to a \\"hit\\" from Avenged Sevenfold.  If they ever sell out and make a \\"Best of A7X\\" CD, you can guerantee that Bat Country will be on it.  And I will admit that the song is quite radio friendly, and quite frankly, friendly for any listener.  It isn't too heavy, and it isn't elevator music either.  I'm glad that I don't keep up with mainstream radio, because if I did I'd probably be sick of this song.  But I can still enjoy it, just as I can still enjoy Stairway to Heaven(I wasn't around in the '70s...) <br /> <br />The Wicked End is a \\"rockin'\\"(eww term, but w/e) song.  If somebody heard only The Wicked End, they might infer that Avenged Sevenfold was a sort of Metal band, or maybe Cradle of Filth with a decent singer.  With awesome guitar solos and riffs that could easily be coming from John Petrucci, and some double-bass action on the drums, this song starts out sounding like something off Dream Theater's Train of Thought.  However, as it progresses on, there comes a spine-chilling orchestral and choral section right in the middle of the song.  This bridge is indeed one of my favorite parts of the song, and I have been told before, \\"omg tehy sound lyke bad m00zik!11!\\" because of that part.  But anyone with a real brain will find this one of the best things they've ever heard. <br /> <br />Strength of the World is quite light compared against the rest of the album, but it still rocks, and it too has some orchestration towards the end.  There isn't really much to say about it except, \\"awesome song\\".  <br /> <br />All in all, City of Evil is very good, and one of only a few decent albums that came out in 2005.  Hovever, I would reccomend listening to the 30-second samples or maybe borrowing the CD from a friend before buying it, just in case it isn't really \\"your thing\\".
B000050FEN|5.0|This is one of the most disturbing, bleakest films ever made.  It is a masterpiece of writing, cinematography, directing, and acting.  One wonders how a film as creepy and disturbing got not only green lighted, but that they left the dark, horrifying ending on it (especially during the 1990's, when creative filmmaking was at its nadir).  Usually a film like this would have been audience tested to death, and L.A. audiences always want their films to be sunny and happy (I read a story that someone in a test audience for the Joan of Arc film The Messenger didn't like the ending and asked if Joan had to die at the end), and the ending would have been changed.  But lo and behold, this brilliant piece of cinema from David Fincher (only his 2nd film and still his best) came out of the decade of the dumbed down Farrelly Brothers type movies, overrated cute, indie movies, and crappy romantic comedies.  Perhaps they pitched the story as \\"a cross between Pulp Fiction and Silence of the Lambs\\", which in some ways it resembles the latter.  The film isn't perfect (there's some mundane dialogue, a few convienences in the plot), but overall the atmosphere of the film and the incredible tension make up for it.  The plot has been summarized by other reviewers here, so I won't do that, other than recommended a surprisingly thought provoking, gruesome, but never explotative film that Hollywood should make more of....

B00005JOWF|1.0|After the movie was over, the 4 of us watching just wished for the hour and a half of our lives back.  This was one of the worst movies I have seen in a very long time.  No plot, no dialogue, no motivation really for anything, very confused, no interest in the characters, not great effects, too much notice of the fact that it was mostly animated backgrounds and people.  It was TERRIBLE.  DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE.  We should have been warned when even the teenagers in the theater were walking out in the middle.  They had better sense than we did!
B00005JLWN|4.0|This movie has all the elements to make it a classic..I went into this film thinking that with a name like it has it's bound to be a 'shoot kill little green men' type of film with  men in space suites carrying a serious grudge for aliens..blah blah. <br /> <br /> <br />But this film has heart soul and much much more...it has suspence,dram,action, trust and all emotions of man...and woman.. <br /> <br /> <br />Our hero is torn between fulfilling his duty to the state and his duty as an entity seperate from the state...Bale made this role his with his naural intensity.... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />THis is definately a recommend.
B000002B35|5.0|I saw the band on this tour and I can tell you that this is exactly how they sounded.  Crystal clear.  This is a fantastic live cd.  The only complaint I have - and it's with the band - I wish they would have put something from Animals into their set list.  Why couldn't they have dropped Another Brick in the Wall pt. 2 and added Sheep?  But that's really not enough to complain about.<br /><br />This has the entire DSOTM that they recorded in England.  It's great to have that in a live setting.  For those who want to complain that they don't change up the songs very much you have to understand Floyd.  They just aren't a jam band.  I'd love to hear what they could do in a jam band context - that would be great I'm sure.
0345457684|2.0|Altered Carbon is not cyber fiction, in my humble opinion; rather it is recasting a fairly traditional hard boiled detective story into the near future. And unfortunately at a time when people are looking for the next new thing to read in cyber fiction and they will gravitate to this in hopes of finding new cyber stuff.<br /><br />They will be sorely disappointed as the plot could come from the 1950's and Morgan uses technology as substitutes for common plot elements. For example: A man commits suicide, but that does not make sense so instead of his wife hiring the detective, his back-up copy is the on hiring detectives. The crime involves a tour through the seedy world of all the stuff you already know. Surprising how seediness is largely unchanged even by high tech. The drugs are more designer and service is automated.<br /><br />Brian Jacques of Redwall fame told an audience that his books basically replayed the themes and approaches of the Cowboy Westerns he saw at the movies as a child, but placed them in a fantasy land.<br /><br />Morgan does the same, only it is much more mechanical and misses out on some of the unique possibilities and twists you could introduce with technology.<br /><br />If you are looking for Cyber detective fiction, this is not it. Its ok detective fiction, it has no understanding of technology beyond what is in the papers now, and so it does not hit the mark.<br /><br />Takeshi Kovacs is not the Mike Hammer of the future and this will be my last Takeshi Kovacs novel.
B00023GGFI|5.0|Thanks to the reviews that came before mine.  I had been looking for a Johnny Winter cd (having nothing by him) and the reviews on this page convinced me to start here.<br /><br />Glad I did.  As a guitarist I am blown away by Winter's approach to the blues.  No compromises to the current music scene going on in '69.  This guy just brought the serious, serious blues to this album.  He burns through a set of standard blues songs leaving the listener dumbfounded.<br /><br />His brother, Edgar, joins him on a couple of tunes with keyboards and horns.  Most of the songs are performed with just bass and drums backing up Johnny's guitar.<br /><br />The sound of this remastered cd is incredible.  I still have a hard time believing this was recorded in 1969.  The only let down - it's kind of short.  But that's not a real drawback.  It's so good you'll just put it on replay or shuffle.<br /><br />Along with the original album artwork you get a short but informative write-up on what led up to the recording sessions for this debut.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Hendrix, Page, Clapton, and Beck and haven't heard Winter then this just might be like Christmas day for you.
B000BTGY1O|5.0|I have not seen it yet, but my wife loves it.  She owns the VHS version, but wanted to upgrade to DVD.
B000002A3T|5.0|To me, this is so much better than the wall.  It's a nice sounding album with great PF songs.  David Gilmour picked the band up and got the job done here.  This is coming after an only average effort on the prior release and a relentless barrage of insults from the perpetually bitter Roger Waters.<br /><br />Although Gilmour claims the lyrics are not directed at Waters I think they are.  Check out some of the references in the title song and 'What Do You Want From Me'.<br /><br />The music is the important thing here and the band delivers on every song.  I'm not really that into 'A Great Day For Freedom' but that's not to say it's a bad song.  'Keep Talking' got a little overplayed on the radio and really isn't that representative of the overall sound of the disc but it's a pretty decent song.<br /><br />I saw the band on this tour (the Pulse tour) and had a great time.  This is clearly worthy of being in any true PF fan's collection.
B000BYA5G4|4.0|Lord of War stars Nicolas Cage as Yuri, a Russian immigrant who finds an unusual professional calling: he decides at an early age that he has what it takes to become an international arms dealer.  The film is \\"based on a true story\\" and the accompanying documentary on the DVD makes you believe that the director/writer Andrew Niccol did his homework.  Most of the weapons are cold-war leftovers that Yuri acquires from high-ranking former Soviet military officers looking for a little underhanded capitalism.<br /><br />Jared Leto is featured as Yuri's brother Vitaly and Bridget Moynahan is beautifully believable as Yuri's trophy bride Ava Fontaine.  Ian Holm is very effective as an \\"old school\\" arms dealer who first dismisses the upstart Yuri, then approaches him later seeking a partnership.  Eamonn Walker is chilling as the militaristic dictator of Liberia - a nation that was supposed to be founded as a home for descendents of former slaves, now turned into a perpetual high-stakes gang war.  Ethan Hawke shines in his scenes as the \\"honest cop\\", an Interpol agent who knows all of Yuri's underhanded dealings, but won't compromise his own integrity or bend the rules to bring Yuri to justice - a fact Yuri exploits more than once.<br /><br />It's not easy watching a film in which the lead character is such a scumbag outlaw, but Cage brings such an easy-going larger-than-life charm to Yuri that you're able to overlook his significant \\"character flaw\\" to get through the film.  I remember feeling something similar watching the gangsters in the \\"Godfather\\" films.
B000001ELF|4.0|Ace showed he had a lot of creative energy during these sessions.  Too bad he let booze and childishness get in his way when he got back with the band to record what would be Dynasty.<br /><br />While the other solo albums were more pop oriented - Ace stayed true to his hard rock leanings and the effort is consistent for the most part.  The only change of pace is with the hit single 'New York Groove' - and that isn't a bad song at all.<br /><br />The lyrics are a little silly in places (Speeding Back to my baby, Rip it out) but they aren't a turn off.  From a guitarist's point of view I look at this as a really cool display of some hot guitar playing in the hey day of the 1970's.<br /><br />If you like early kiss and hate what happened to them after the money started to flow in then you should pick this up.  Not bad at all.
1565117786|4.0|A Million Little Pieces allowed the reader a glimpse into the lives of a family and an individual living with an addiction. Written in the first person, the book explores the thoughts, feelings, and introspection of an individual dealing with an emotional and physical breakdown in his life.     In the book, he outlines the many characters that he has come across on his path to healing. He visits each character detailing how each has touched his life or affected him in a way that he would not have been affected alone.    Without having the foreknowledge that the memoir was indeed a novel (with a few elements of truth sprinkled in), I would have recommended the book whole-heartedly. The book was entertaining, thought-provoking, and well written.     However, in hindsight, knowing that there were myriad untruths and embellishments added to enhance the entertainment and dramatic value of the book, I am disappointed. The author and the publishers had a responsibility to the public to market the book appropriately. They instead took a different avenue that was driven by monetary gain and infamy to mislead their readers.    I would recommend the book as an interesting novel that allows a glimpse into addiction but not as a guiding light to healing or a genuine of account of someone's life.    As long as the reader is aware of these elements, they are free to decide on purchasing the book and taking away from it their own personal thoughts and enlightenment.
B000001EKX|4.0|Don't laugh. This is a very good album and it stayed in constant rotation on my turntable when it first came out.<br /><br />It's a rock guitar dream come true. Just listen to Strange Ways and tell me Ace can't play some fantastic guitar. This was in the days when they were struggling to make a name for themselves. Not the greatest sound quality. Still this is one for a true fan of the band and anyone who loves 70's hard rock guitar.
B00003CXC7|5.0|Rear Window is even better than when I saw it the first time. The DVD has beautiful color. A must for classic movie lovers.
B00004WKII|5.0|There have been a ton of releases lately from the Hendrix estate and I have to admit that it gets confusing on just how to get the most for your money.  Box sets don't always do the trick.  Luckily, this one does.  First of all, let me thank the others who have put down reviews before me.  They helped me make the decision to purchase this box set a couple of years ago.<br /><br />There are great alternate versions of classics, as well as a ton of interesting live stuff.  The mastering is very good - especially for the stuff recorded in small clubs in the late 60's.<br /><br />For you Hendrix junkies this should serve as a nice fix.<br /><br />I hope this review helps you.  And when you're looking at the rest of his catalog let the reviews guide you in your decision.  They have been very helpful to me.
6305754969|4.0|This film is one of those 1960's era John Wayne + (Fill in the Blank major Star)movies.  Actually it's almost an exact remake of another and better Wayne flick, \\"Rio Bravo\\" with Robert Mitchum playing the Dean Martin part and James Caan playing Ricky Nelson's role.
0316096199|4.0|I admire that Alice Sebold wrote this book. I didn't know anything about it before I read it, and there were parts that made me feel sick to my stomach because of the intensity of her descriptions. She is a fantastic writer. I thought it sort of fizzled out before it ended, though, and I probably won't read it again.
B00003Q43A|4.0|There sure is a lot on this DVD...all one disk.  The picture is quite nice.  The branching seems to work well enough, though there might be slight pauses during the extended version.  The only serious defect here is the DVD mastering engineer's use of dynamic compression on the 5.1 mix.  It's as if they were trying to compensate for people not having 5.1 systems and good DVD players or recievers that could fold-down the sound properly for 2 speakers.  During the loudest portions of the film, particularly with a lot of bass, the overall volume has been brought down...you can hear it happening, like an old 1950's pop song with a bad mix engineer.  Again, any compression is only necessary if you are listening to the 5.1 mix in 2 channels and your decoder doesn't bring down the volume overall for you, which it should be able to.  I'm not sure of any unit that doesn't already do this in some form for you automatically.  You don't master DVDs with this ahead of time, so it's puzzling.  Perhaps what the engineer/DVD authoring people actually did was accidentally encode the Dolby Digital Night Time compression schemes on the main soundtrack, rather than simply keeping them as an optional encoding.  The only other way I can think of would be if the engineer was stupid enough to play the entire 5.1 soundtrack after discrete decoding back through a mixer that combined all 6 channels into 2 channels manually for playback and monitoring through a single 2-channel meter and/or 2 speakers. In that case the idiot could have been incorrectly monitoring the levels.  I've got more sound expertise in just one of my butt cheeks than someone like that.  Regardless of how or why it happened, it's kind of distracting at the end and certainly doesn't represent the way the film was originally mixed.  4 stars for this \\"Five Star Collection Edition\\".
068484267X|5.0|I had barely finished the first paragraph of Angela's Ashes when I knew I would love it. Sure enough, the entire book kept me tied in to the story. I love Frank McCourt's writing style, his attention to detail, and the way he turned his negative experiences into a fantastic story. I was hooked from beginning to end.
B00003ETOW|4.0|George C. Scott is wonderful as Rochester while Susannah York is capable and satisfactory in the title role yet she seems to lack some passion inward or outward. Jack Hawkins is brilliant as the evil headmaster yet the motivations for his hideous nature are left unexplored. This version of JANE EYRE is beautifully photographed and richly textured and very compelling. John William's score is appropriately composed to augment the visuals. In all this is a well intentioned production but seems to lack some of the mysterious and enigmatic qualities of earlier versions, yet it is still very enthralling.
B00000K2UX|5.0|Man, I am a teenager again! This CD takes me back to my teen years I loved the movie and the songs in it! Now they have brought the CD back with all the other great songs that wasn't in the original release.  Great Balls of Fire and She lost that loving feeling and Sitting on the Dock of the Bay. :-) Love it.
B000301YY8|5.0|This CD is amazing! I had only heard one of James' songs on the radio before buying this CD, but I have come to love nearly every song on it! If you enjoyed his latest single \\"You're Beautiful,\\" you will love this entire CD!
0307276902|5.0|Gripping book! Makes you feel as if you're experiencing the addiction and recovery yourself. Should be must reading for all to understand the depths of addiction. The writing style was amazing. It was hard to put down, one of the fastest reads.
B0002NRRAG|4.0|Take a trip back in time with this young white singer who does the blues with the uncanny feel and lilt of black Bessie Smith.
0671027387|4.0|Deception point is good book with constant action, plot changes and high-tech toys. I found it hard to put the book down. If you like action, interesting plot, mixed with some technical jargon, I recommend this book. This will make a great action Thriller when it eventualy hits the theaters.
B00008977N|5.0|I was so amazed at this DVD when I watched it. If you have no other PG DVD this should be the DVD to own.     If I had to give stars on this DVD it would be as follows:    Audio 5/5 stars! Sounds like it is remixed and the concert is not like the CD verison. Kinda sounds like it was the other concert. When I mean that I mean by the CD version is one night of the concert while DVD is the other day of the concert.  Like \\"Shaking the Tree\\" CD version the 13th       \\"Shaking the Tree\\" DVD version the 14th     Video 4/5 stars! compared to other DVDs it is not the best, BUT it is great none the less. Plus it is in WIDESCREEN so that makes it very cool to watch on a Widescreen TV , but with that being said it doesn't take away from the film itself for some of us without widescreen television    Direction 5/5 Very well, Acted out and the crowd really gets into the songs like Sledgehammer and Solisbury Hill.     Song Choice and Extras 5/5 stars! They are great, but I would have liked to see more. Song Choice is the best of all the tours.     Just random negatives: NO Red Rain on the DVD, but Red Rain is replaced with San Jacinto, and that is about it!    In conclusion, PICK UP THIS DVD!! You will never be sorry! Though the songs are replaced and different they are still great and can make for a great gift or a gift for yourself. So pick it up.
0385335482|3.0|The first book i read by Sophia Kinsella was \\"Can you keep a secret?\\" and i really liked the book. So i picked up \\"Confessions of a shopaholic\\" without hesitation. The book kept me entertained- although it did get quite irritating to read over and over again about how Rebecca rationalizes all her spending sprees. My biggest problem with the book is the ending. The book just ends!! We have no idea what happens with Rebecca and Luke, or how her new tv show gig goes, etc. I understand that this is a series of books, but you have to have some closure!!!
0446608955|4.0|A Walk To Remember, by Nicholas Sparks, tells us a story unlike any other story about teenagers in high school. This book is not your typical boy meets girl, boy pursues girl and they all live happily ever after fairy tale. Within this book is a lot of struggle and triumph that go along with the romance of two young people in love.  <br />     Landon Carter is the big man on campus, if you will. He spends most of his time hanging around with him just as popular friends that lack a certain level of maturity. Landon seamlessly has the perfect life on the outside. He has the looks, the friends, and the reputation, but a firs is building within him and just once, Landon want to escape into something that's not familiar to him. Something, that sets apart the normalities of his every day life. Jamie Sullivan is like a mirror image of Landon. Though, very sweet and kind, Jamie is at the bottom of the social ladder at her high school. She keeps to herself, is very quiet, and isn't normally seen without her nose stuck in a book. Jamie's peers see her as strange and a bookworm and they don't make any attempt to understand why she is the way she is.  <br />     When Landon struggles in school he is desperate for Jamie's help only to find out she's not a girl to be taken advantage of. A meeting with fate brings Landon and Jamie together, and a friendship is formed. Landon, being the person he is, can't let anyone know that he is friends with Jamie so he tries to hide the friendship along with the growing feelings he is having towards her. Feelings between the two are reciprocated and the two realize there is more to their relationship then friends.  <br />     A secret is later exposed leading to a very unexpected turn in the book. Once one obstacle is defeated a bigger one is revealed. What will it take to keep the young love alive? Will the two break through the struggles of everyday life? Read to find out.  <br />
B000E6UK5K|4.0|As much as the phrase \\"Adult Contemporary\\" might generate negative connotations, that's the phrase that seems to best fit this new offering by David (he IS 60+!!).  Not surprisingly, the guitarwork and vocals are stellar and sweet to the ears.  \\"On An Island\\" is filled with very mellow music, very different from what one might expect if they have their hearts set on \\"Pink Floyd\\".  The most compelling piece is \\"Take A Breath\\", with a progression that challenges the listener and provides a phenomenal foundation upon which David unleashes some searing guitar.  Overall, the collection of songs vary quite a bit stylistically, demonstrating David's range of influences and musical competence.  I recommend \\"On An Island\\" very highly.
B000005HFH|5.0|Chet Baker singing -- nothing could be better!<br /><br />I love Amazon.com. They have all the CDs I'm looking for and my packages come so fast!
B000002J0B|5.0|Seriously, I'd buy the \\"greatest-band-ever\\" hype surrounding Zeppelin if only all of their other albums were as good as this one. FINALLY content to do more than just blow us away with sheer fits of volume, and temporarily done with ripping off blues songs that were far better than what the group themselves could do, Zeppelin instead perfected the folk-rock approach hinted at on IV. The hard rockers all either have acoustic textures or interesting change-ups that the previous ones lacked. Hell, even Robert Plant learned to sing tolerably and ditched the mindless sex-god posturing/\\"shoot-my-cheatin'-woman\\" cliches that had made up most of his lyrics with the group in the past.<br /><br />For a song-by-song breakdown, here we go...<br /><br />1. The Song Remains the Same: 10/10. The closest thing to a traditional hard rocker on this anthem, this is a big, bad guitar showcase with Pagey unloading solo after cool solo. Plus I the varying tempos in this song - they fly through the instrumental bits at breakneck speed, and slow it down for the guitar solos.<br /><br />2. The Rain Song: 10/10. \\"Graceful\\" isn't usually a word I'd apply to a Zep song, but I make an exception here - JPJ stretches out, playing mellotron and adding those lovely piano fills, and the riff is unforgettable. Some fans don't like this, and I'll admit it took a couple listens to grow on me, but now it's one of my favorites on the disc. Oh, and the \\"rock\\" section of the song furtherly makes it one of the group's precious few masterpieces.<br /><br />3. Over the Hills and Far Away: 10/10. Far and away the best song ever to emerge from the Zeppelin canon. Starts off with just Page's folk guitar (though I think I also hear a hint of a flute, correct me if I'm wrong), but it doesn't stay that way for long - the electric guitar enters, and it's a jolt. Best of all, the acoustic stays in, providing a nice rhythmic backbone. And listen for Paul Jones' bass during the guitar solo. Trust me on that one.<br /><br />4. The Crunge: 6.5/10. By far the weakest song on this album, a weak James Brown imitation/parody that fails to get anywhere thanks to the cheesy synth and Plant's vocals. Shame, because JPJ and Bonzo contribute some of their best rhythm-section playing on the record, accompanied by Page's chicken-scratch rhythm guitar. And the spoken comment in the end is amusing. I won't give it away, but it's worth listening for.<br /><br />5. Dancing Days: 7/10. Nothing special - the lyrics are far better than the standard Zep fare, but not much, the awful keyboard from The Crunge strikes back, and the melody's overly simple. But it's worth listening to just the same thanks to Page's Eastern-sounding lead. I prefer the version found on Complete Studio Recordings, though, since it adds more needed acoustic texture and drops the keyboard. That song gets an 8.<br /><br />6. D'yer Ma'ker: 8.5/10. Reggae from a rock band that actually WORKS is a rarity, even when the rock band's good - for example, take the Stones' failed attempts to play reggae. Great band, but when they do that... anyway, this reggae attempt manages to stay afloat. Several reasons why: Plant DOESN'T try to sing reggae (thank god!), Bonzo nails the reggae beat, and Page's Jamaican-sounding solo never fails to put a smile on my face. Maybe it goes on about a minute too long, but it's easily the most fun you'll have with the group.<br /><br />7. No Quarter: 9.5/10. Amusingly pompous lyrics, killer guitar solo, and JPJ's unforgettable grand piano solo. My only issue with this song is the watery electric piano sound doesn't do much for me.<br /><br />8. The Ocean: 9.5/10. I REALLY wanted to give this one a ten, but I can't stand Plant's vocals in the first part. So sue me. Don't get me wrong, though, it's still a total classic: a three-part experiment, part one being the crunching riff section, part two the a capella section, and part three the bluesy doo-wap fade out. Structurally, it's the most interesting song here, and the melody's killer - had Plant not sung it, it would've been a ten.<br /><br />I wish I could say that Houses was a turning point in Zep's catalogue (I find the first four albums, even the revered IV, to be uneven, with several great tunes but several bad ones too). Alas, it wasn't so. Here, and on the ragged-but-right sequel Physical Grafitti, Zep was briefly at the height of their powers. Then, they fell. Still, this is beyond Zeppelin's best album - it's one of my favorites ever, from a group I like, but not love (like many others do).sung it, it would've been a ten. <br /> <br />I wish I could say that Houses was a turning point in Zep's catalogue (I find the first four albums, even the revered IV, to be uneven, with several great tunes but several bad ones too).

B00000G3AZ|4.0|This is definitely a chick flick, but it is a real feel good movie.  I found myself frustrated, rolling my eyes, tickled, delighted, and moved with compassion at various times throughout the movie.  It is one that I will watch many times.
B000CCD0FI|5.0|By 1983, after three years away, Talking Heads achieved their first true Top 40 hit in the form of the now classic \\"Burning Down The House\\". \\"Speaking In Tongues\\" was the album that broke them into the mainstream. I find it to be one of their best recordings, and maybe their most dance-oriented. The digital remastering significantly improves the sound quality, but it's the dvd side with its 5.1 surround sound mix that really cooks. Another reviewer found \\"Speaking In Tongues\\" to be dated and without Eno's touch, but I disagree. The Heads do their own thing here and the quality isn't less than \\"Remain In Light\\" and \\"Fear Of Music\\". Many of the songs still sound fresh like \\"Girlfriend Is Better\\", \\"Slippery People\\", \\"Pull Up The Roots\\", \\"This Must Be The Place (Naive Melody)\\". However, I will say that I like the versions on \\"Stop Making Sense\\" the following year even better.<br /><br />The cd side comes with \\"Two Note Swivel\\", an unfinished outtake that sounds great alongside the other songs, and an alternate version of \\"Burning Down The House\\" which is okay.<br /><br />It's truly the dvd side that's worth the buy. You haven't heard this album until you've heard it in 5.1 surround. Plus, it comes with photos and two music videos for \\"Burning Down The House\\" and \\"This Must Be The Place (Naive Melody)\\". Again, no lyrics included, but you do get a comment about remastering the disc by Jerry Harrison which is interesting.
B000AP04L0|5.0|If you ever worked in an office of any kind, you will love this movie. This movie was remended to me by a coworker that could see the similarities between our office and the movie's. <br /> <br />
B000CCD0FS|4.0|\\"Little Creature\\" is perhaps the Talking Heads most pop sounding album. The songs are shorter, the music is simpler and the hooks are in every song. But, there's something missing. I don't particularly care for \\"Give Me Back My Name\\" or \\"Creatures Of Love\\" and \\"Walk It Down\\" is questionable. The best tracks are \\"Road To Nowhere\\", \\"And She Was\\", \\"Stay Up Late\\" and \\"Television Man\\" with \\"The Lady Don't Mind\\" and \\"Perfect World\\" coming in second. The digital remastering is excellent and on the cd side the bonus tracks are actually interesting like the early version of \\"Road To Nowhere\\". The early version of \\"And She Was\\" is pretty much the same as the final product. The extended version of \\"Television Man\\" is just what it says and nothing special.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this album doesn't lend itself to 5.1 surround. There's nothing instrumentally to fill in the void. It's much better in stereo on the cd side I think. The photos are okay and the videos for \\"And She Was\\" and \\"Road To Nowhere\\" are also okay. No lyrics are included and as with the other albums you get Jerry Harrison's take on remastering the album.<br /><br />All in all, a good, but not great album.
B0006MT314|5.0|This is the type of music you dont hear on the radio.  It gives you the opportunity to hear different bands that you wouldn't normally have known about.  BUY IT!!!
B000E6UK5K|1.0|One song I recognized from his concert dvd....not bad, mellow, has a melody.... <br />The rest is all crap....no structure, no lyrics, no lead guitar, no beat, no angst....Yuck. Unfortunately, I bought this unheard, and I will never do it again.   <br />If I think back, however, his solo efforts have always tended to suck, and venture into the wierd, in an inane effort to distinguish the work from that of Pink Floyd. <br />I feel cheated.  And I'm a huge huge fan. I've been waiting for YEARS for this.
B00005JOFO|5.0|This is the saddest love story I have ever seen, bar none!  Whether you're gay or straight this story will have a profound effect on many many people.  I believe a lot of people can relate to having a love so strong with another individual but due to certain times, situations, demographics, jobs or other possibly uncontrollable circumstances this love had to stay hidden.  I went and saw this movie three times at the theater and cried my eyes out each time.  Jake Gyllenhaal gave an outstanding and very emotional performance in this movie!  My heart just went out to him (Jack) and he is the reason for my tears.  Heath Ledger also gave an outstanding performance as (Ennis) who just seemed so confused about his heart and feelings.  When I first heard about the movie it was two gay cowboys.  I thought na, not interested.  Started reading reviews and it is so much more.  It makes you think of all that wasted time that could have or should have been spent with that individual.  It was about Love, Wasted Time, and watching your life pass by.  I will definitely buy the DVD when it comes out on the 28th of this month.  This is the best movie I have seen in years.  Powerful, sensitive, heartwrenching and just really makes you think about life and love.  These are two people who didn't look for but found love in an unusual place.  I believe this movie will stay with you a long long time!!  GREAT MOVIE!   If I could rate this more than 5 stars I would!
B0000V4M44|5.0|I love this music! I don't traditionally like instrumentals but this music is catchy and expressive.  Klaus Badelt is a genius.  It also brings back memories of the scenes in the movie.  Highly recommend!
B000DZIGE4|4.0|I'm a retired Sergeant First Class from the U.S. Army.  I didn't get a chance to see the movie at the theater but I bought the DVD yesterday.  Personally I thought it was a great movie. There was a great deal of reality to it.  Soldiers, Sailors, Airman or Marine, it matters not.  You have some that act totally ignorant in certain situations to help cope with stress while others just deal better with it.  I've seen it in many forms over my 21 years of Active Duty.  I don't think it shed a bad light on the USMC, because these troops didn't act much differently then some of the Vietnam troops did.  If you're a warmonger and want to see a lot of action this is not the movie for you, but if you are interested in the day to day or A Day In The Life of kind of movie that shows how a person or typically a servicemember grows this is the one for you.  The language is what it used to be like in the Army until they started changing the regulations.  The movie took me back to my Army days.  I loved it!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Not since Star Trek: The Motion Picture has there been an event like this.  Only this is more phenominal than that.  The creation of this movie was totally fan driven.  After the show got cancelled, with less than half a season aired, the fan support drove this movie to be made.<br /><br />Didn't see the show Firefly? Not sure you want to spend your time on it? That's okay!  This movie is totally self-contained. There is no previous knowledge needed to see it.  And for those of you who have seen the show, you don't get beat over the head with exposition.<br /><br />The comentary is excellent.  There's some deleted scenes (maybe some of these should have been left in) and damn funny outtakes.  There's even an easter egg.  Have fun watching.
0792165020|5.0|There are some differences between this film and the Patricia Highsmith novel it is based on. Some major changes to plot have been made, yet the intricacy of the original is not lost...in fact the screenplay and direction succeeds in inducing a sense of almost visual dizziness at the complex double life that Ripley leads and which constantly comes within a hair's breadth of unravelling. While the strengths of the film medium are successfully exploited, its unsurprising that the shocking sense of identification with a cold blooded killer which an intimite novel can provide is somewhat missing here. In fact Mat Damon's Ripley here is less of a psychopath and more of a sad loser that somehow blunders his way into an orgy of murder. Still, the superb playing of the leads together with a truly outstanding film score might well succeed in leaving you with an unhealthily Highsmithian sense of sympathy for the devil.
B00005JOFO|5.0|Amazon.com review, 9 March 2006<br /><br />\\"Brokeback Mountain\\" came as a long overdue movie exploring the lives and love of characters whose story has not been told before in a major motion picture, and the comments have been many.  I have to say I was extremely disappointed that \\"Brokeback\\" lost the best picture Oscar to \\"Crash,\\" a fine but far inferior movie.  Whereas \\"Brokeback\\" reveals a story that had never been told in literature until Annie Proulx published it in \\"The New Yorker,\\" and never in film, \\"Crash\\" explores issues that are extraordinarily important but that have been explored before, albeit perhaps not in the same innovative way.  Furthermore, unlike \\"Brokeback,\\" whose plot is poignantly and painfully real, the plot of \\"Crash\\" is so filled with coincidences that they nearly mar its message (and it is a message film, not one that tugs at the heart like \\"Brokeback\\").  I believe the Academy won't have another opportunity to vote for a film similar to \\"Brokeback\\" for years, if ever.  That is a terrible shame.<br /><br />But to \\"Brokeback.\\"  For once the hype lives up to the film. The performances of Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal are equally well done--beautifully understated with an understanding of their characters and the love they share. Surely they deserved Oscars for their incredible work.  And the love they portray is not a love based only on sex. Their long absences heighten the sex, but their love is based on mutual attraction and compatibility: mutual ways of life, mutual interests, comfort in each other's company,--just as any love is based on these things.<br /><br />Having read the story before I first saw the movie, I knew about the tragic ending. However, the most moving part for me was the climax when Jack tells Ennis they could have had a life together. Because of his lack of self acceptance, Ennis had long ago ruled that life out, and the regret Heath Ledger as Ennis expresses in his final scene is heartbreaking and even more moving the second time I saw the film. I've known too many like him in my own life as a gay man.<br /><br />The picture is directed and filmed beautifully. The gorgeous Wyoming (Canadian) mountain scenery matches the love Jack and Ennis express there, just as Ennis's squalid apartment and trailer match the sad, alternative family life he creates in the one and the barren life his own self denial and timidity create in the other. The symbolism fits well. A magnificent movie at every level, a lasting testament to all the artists involved, from Annie Proulx, Diana Ossana, Larry McMurtry, and Ang Lee to everyone else, including Rufus Wainwright, the openly gay singer on the soundtrack.<br /><br />\\"Brokeback Mountain\\" deserves all the awards it has won and all the Academy Award nominations it received and the three it won.oving the second time I saw the film.

0465011020|4.0|The Aquariums of Pyongyang was one of the most difficult books I've ever read.  Difficult in the way that it describes, first hand, the conditions of daily life in the North, not to mention the gulag.  <br /> <br />This book should be MANDATORY reading for all Americans, and for that matter for all residents of the western hemisphere who are unaware of the realities of North Korea.  The human rights crisis taking place there demands that we all understand what is happening in this part of the world. This book does a great job of furthering that understanding.
B000A59PMO|5.0|In an age of trite remakes, Veronica Mars looks to be just a modern rendition of Nancy Drew, with an added contemporary teen show element and maybe a few silly attempts at 'edgy'. (Aw, look Nancy's trying on Phillip Marlowe's trenchcoat! How adorable!) But once one watches this gem of a show, it's suprising to find out that VM is one of the most heartbreaking, intellegent, snarky shows around, much more in the spirit of Chinatown and other noir in  style and substance than Nancy.  <br /> <br />Filled with suprises that will kick you in the gut, rich well-rounded characters (even down to the tertiary pool), crisp, quoteable dialouge, and one of the most refreshing and complex heriones around (played by one of the handful of  stunning  young actresses to hit the small screen in quite a while), Veronica Mars is simply a delightful television show that goes above and beyond that title. Veronica's world isn't just a guilty pleasure escape haven to not think about your homework or finaces for an hour, it's a world that's admitable not our own (one where billionares attend the local public high school along with a 60's style biker gang) but still deeply inticing and 'real' in all of it's absurdity. <br /> <br /> Much in the same way, the title character Veronica is extraordinary. She's smart, reasourceful, snarky, fearless, gorgeous, and always with a witty response on the tip of her tongue ( a cute boy walks up as she's trying to fix her cat \\"flat?\\" Veronica, \\"Just as God made me.\\"). But most of all she's tainted and tattered at heart. All of these characteristics that make her seem like the most overzealous super girl have come to her by tragedy and pain. Kristen Bell wonderfully confeys the heartbreak of Veronica without turing her a pity party or an annoyance, but instead making her flawed in all the right spots. After having sexual comments thrown her way by the local biker gang leader, Veronica (via one very noir style VO), with the slightest bit of pain in her eye:\\"Quite the reputation I've got, huh? You wanna know how I lost my virginity? So do I.\\"   <br /> <br />It's in these words, we know that this isn't your average teen girl on your average teen show. Hell, it's within the second scene of \\"The Pilot\\", when Veronica lays her head down and looks subtly crushed  as a teacher gives her take on \\"An Essay On Man: Epistle One\\" that its clear she's so much more than that girl.  <br /> <br />Season One follows the journey of finding out who killed Veronica's best friend Lilly Kane (also so much more than just the  dead girl saint). A vivicous girl whose death projects pain not just for Veronica, but basically everyone, in a blackened ripple effect.(the opposite of another great show, Joan of Arcadia) Veronica vows and takes action to do whatever she can to find out the truth, and thus in the same determined fashion the show does so at just the right pace. It's a brillant, fun, and heartbreaking ride that plays out in much the same way as a compelling novel.(creator Rob Thomas does have some experience in that area)I would recommend the show to anyone who enjoys wonderful characterzation, snappy writing, and twisty plots that keep you thinking. Thus if you like great television, give Veronica Mars: Season One a shot! <br />
0061020710|3.0|Wherein we meet Rincewind, Twoflower, and The Luggage.<br /><br />If you've never read Discworld books, I envy you.  You have such a diverse and brilliant literary quest ahead of you, starting here.<br /><br />'The Colour of Magic' is actually a collection of four short stories around the theme of a tourist from one part of the fantasy world is visiting another part, with Rincewind, the most incompetent wizard as his tour guide.  Twoflower, the tourist, is all the sterotype tourists rolled into one.  Rincewind is, well, Rincewind, occasionally more so.  Rincewind is a wizard, except he can't really do any magic.  He would be the hero of the book, except that would require bravery, which is on a par with his magic ability.  Well, Rincewind is the eternal coward, who never wins a fight, never gets into a fight, but manages to survive every fight.  The Luggage is Twoflower's travel trunk, and both cleans the laundry and eats assailants.  You'll see that for yourself...<br /><br />As you read 'The Colour of Magic', you can feel how vividly Terry Pratchett must see this world, and the fragile roots of many later developed threads of the Discworld series appear here.  On the other hand, it is a first effort, and a little clumsy at times.<br /><br />On the whole, I enjoyed it, but nowhere near as much as later installments in the Discworld series.

It's part of the deal we made\\" (p. 172).<br /><br />\\"It's natural to die... The fact that we make such a big hullabaloo over it is all because we don't see ourselves as part of nature.  We think because we're human we're something above nature\\" (p. 173).<br /><br />\\"Death ends a life, not a relationship\\" (p. 174).<br /><br />Morrie was very brave in facing his death, as was Mitch in facing the death of his friend and mentor.<br /><br />This story is very easy to read, and is good for ages 10 and up.  It is life, and love, in the raw.  Share with a friend, and contact a loved one today to say hello.
B000BTJDGC|5.0|In an age filled with \\"horror movies\\" that belong in the comedy section, The Exorcism of Emily Rose was certainly an exception. A combination of great story-telling, production, acting, and music places this film at the #1 spot in my \\"favorite horror films\\" list (replacing Silence of the Lambs).  <br /> <br /> <br />There are 2 main reasons why this film is great in my eyes: <br /> <br /> <br />1) Realism - Most horror movies simply take things too far to the point where it's laughable. Rotating heads, superhuman strength, and monster faces effectively remind us that \\"it's only a movie\\" and snap us back into reality. While there were a few instances in The Exorcism of Emily Rose that were unrealistic, the vast majority of the occurances were scientifically explainable.  <br /> <br /> <br />The reason why such realism makes it scarier, in my opinion, is because it provokes a different type of fear. Rather than making us  look over our shoulders for slashers, boogiemen, and zombies, this film provokes a fear that we all have and can't escape from: The fear of losing our minds.  <br /> <br /> <br />The fact that Emily Rose was either epileptic/schizophrnenic OR possessed raises the question regarding whether or not there's a difference between the two at all. Could it be that those that are supposedly \\"possessed\\" are in fact crazy? Or could it be that those people that are supposedly \\"crazy\\" are in fact...possessed?  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />2) Intelligence - This is a very intelligent film. Although I'm not sure as to whether or not it was intended, the film's thought-provoking development made me realize something: While this film is BASED on the POSSESSION OF EMILY ROSE, it actually DEPICTS the POSSESSION OF ALL PEOPLE.  <br /> <br /> <br />This film illustrates how we're all possessed in our own unique ways and how our beliefs tend to take a back seat to those things we really want. In the film, each of the main characters were possessed by something that led them to do \\"crazy things.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />Father Moore was possessed by his need to tell Emily's story. This led him to risk his freedom and his priesthood. <br /> <br /> <br />Erin Bruner, the defense attorney, was possessed by her career, which led her to take the case despite the fact that she didn't believe in religion.  <br /> <br /> <br />Ethan Thomas, the prosecutor, was possessed by his career too, which led him to take the case despite the fact that he was a man of faith.  <br /> <br /> <br />Jason, Emily's boyfriend, was possessed by love, which led him to stay by her side even though he was terrified of her.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />The irony and metaphoric depictions in this movie, whether they were intentional or not, made this movie deserving of 5 stars.

B000002L9J|5.0|80s , 90s and so far have observed a lack of true classic albums, i mean really true classic albums not that one microwaved bands glorified by the rolling stone magazine, MTV and the whole media, just think about it what albums come to your mind when you think or you discuss with your friends regarding classic albums? Beatles revolver? , any Bob Dillan work?, Presley sun sessions? Zeppelin? of course right? but try to think of any classic album after the 70s and you will have troubles i bet my ass, well, Smiths The Queen is Dead at least is one repply to this matter, because the sober and at the same melancholic mood along with the charming and calm voice of Stephen Patrick Morrisey, the Jhonny Marr deligthfull strings and beautifull lyrics made not only of \\"The Queen is Dead\\" but all Smiths albums gorgeous collectible pieces of British contemporary music, elegance and refinement are the basic elements of their music, \\"frankly Mr. Shankly\\" is one of my faves, \\"i know its over\\" , \\"the boy with the torn in its side\\" you name it!!!! this album can be easily included into 80s few classics. <br />HM   <br /> <br />
B00004XPPE|4.0|This movie was very good to excellent, (VG++ on my reading scale).  <br /> <br />I did not give it 5 stars because there were some technical issues and minor character issues that kept me from giving it a whole hearted 5 star result.  <br /> <br />I had read in another review that it would have been helpful to have had some actual footage of the Vindicator bomber to make the movie more realistic. That is quite true, and in addition it would have been helpful to have had some soviet aircraft also. The only thing in defense of the director of this movie for not including actual footage of aircraft from each side is the fact that we forget this movie was made during the height of the cold war and there was a lot of paranoia over security on both sides. Therefore, it would have probably been impossible to show actual Soviet Backfire Bombers, fighters, or even actual Vindicator maneuver footage. This would have made the movie more interesting.  <br /> <br />I believe this movie will be considered extremely intense by anyone who lived during this time period. The fear of nuclear war was a very real fear, a very real frightening possibility. Just remember the Cuban Missile Crisis. We were very close to warfare at that time. Very close. I do not know how many people realize this, but nuclear war was certainly a possibility if we had sunk any of the Russian cargo ships. They surely had submarines with nuclear warheads prepared to defend these ships and we had the same prepared to defend our ships. One punch would have led to two then a flurry of punches. How do you stop this from escalating?   <br /> <br />I thought the acting was mostly superb. Even Walter Mathau's slap of the woman he drove home, which struck me as not necessary and idiotic, was ok if you consider he was probably being type-casted as a \\"moral\\" oriented person. Yet later in the story he favored us attacking the soviets, going all out now that we were mistakenly committed with those 6 bombers approaching Russia. This is not an indication of some one who is being type-casted as a \\"moral\\" person. When is war for war's sake moral? Therefore, I viewed this as a character flaw. Instead, if he had tried to make advances with her, but was then slapped by the woman, I believe that this would have been more consistent with his character. This might be considered a minor point, but the whole point of this story was the intensity of each person's response to the incredible pressures of a potential nuclear war breaking out. Consistency would have added power to this movie.  <br /> <br />One other point on technical matters. It was not clear whether or not the soviets used nuclear tip missiles against the bombers. It was shown as such - nuclear fireballs blooming a portion of the situation board. This was not discussed in the film. I think if the characters monitoring the situation boards had pointed this out or made issues of this, the use of nuclear tipped missiles against the bombers, this would have been a telling point that would have increased the overall suspense and approaching terror of what was about to occur - the bombing of Moscow. <br /> <br />One last point, the Soviets had caused the bombers to enter Soviet airspace by scrambling the radio reception when they were at the fail-safe point, this prevented the bombers from getting an all clear signal. Thus, the bombers continued with their mission and it was the inflexiblity of their training that resulted in the situation getting out of hand. So the Soviets should have shoulder some of the blame for the situation occuring at all. Finally, when radio contact is restored, the wife of one of the pilots tired to tell her husband it was all a mistake. He would not listen because he was trained, indoctrinated to not listen to anyone in case the Soviets used this sort of thing as a ploy to fool the pilots in not dropping their bombs. Yet. if I was that pilot, I would have asked my 'wife' a simple question only she and I knew the answer to. If she answered correctly, I would know it was her calling me and not a Soviet ploy. Once the pilot realized it was all a mistake he then has one choice, return home, no one gets killed. That is how intense this story was, you just wanted this 'idiot' of a pilot to ask some key question, to use some smarts to avoid an obviously horrendous situation from occuring to begin with. So was he being a 'patriot' by blindingly following orders, or should he first be a member of humanity and try to avoid making a terrible mistake? Think of all the potential answers to this question.  <br /> <br />Joe Patane
0553584537|5.0|I am almost finished with this book and I think perhaps maybe this is the best time to write this review. There are so many Characters to suspect wrong-doing of.( but not too many ) There's the high and mighty Judge who thinks his money and power can buy anything and his wife who thinks he is a God. There is Cathrine who was abducted as a child and is thought to be abusive to her own son. There is Officer Dodge who so innocent but feels so very guilty, and the Boston PD who is willing to back the powerful Judge. Amidst all the drama, lerking about fresh out of jail after 25 years is the same man who abducted Catherine when she was a 6 year old, looking to take her again...I haven't been able to put this book down.

B00000J7J4|5.0|What a comeback!  It was almost 30 years earlier when \\"Abraxas\\" hit number one on the charts and stayed there for weeks.  Santana's previous mega successful album that spawned the singles, \\"Oye Como Va\\" and \\"Black Magic Woman\\" but has become a classic rock classic also showed Carlos depending upon the work of others to get ahead.  Both tracks were covers and in the case of \\"Black Magic Woman\\" had the approval of the composer, Fleetwood Mac's Peter Green who was actively involved in the album but the other tracks like \\"Samba Pa Ti\\" were originals that were pretty good as well.<br /><br />Now, decades later, Carlos shows he has learned from this first experience by enlisting a whole hoard of artistes to create another mega monster album that sounds and plays a lot like a Various Artistes compilation album with Carlos the guitar sideman on all the tracks.  This recipe makes for a very good album that was richly deserving of all the Grammy awards that it took that year.  Carlos' guitar playing has also improved in its complexity and his tone has changed too showing that he has been practicing all this time as well.  The album has been produced very well and so the sound quality is quite good too.  All the lyrics are in the cd liner notes which makes it a very nice touch.<br /><br />Very interesting to find out which nuclear physicist they engaged to decide how to split the profits among the legions of artistes involved though but overall, a great album that's worth having in any music-lover's collection.

B0000062FL|3.0|I'm not sure why reviews of the gold, DTS and other versions are all on this page when clearly this page refers to the re-issued \\"re-mastered\\" 1998 version with bonus tracks but in any case, I'll review this version in case anyone's interested.<br /><br />The cd itself has got great liner notes explaining a brief early history of Santana which is a nice touch.  The bonus tracks, all previously unreleased, actually enhance the listening experience which seldom results as many other attempts at adding bonus tracks to otherwise classic albums tend to take away somewhat from the overall quality of the album.  Also, given the fact that these last 3 tracks were recorded live at the Royal Albert Hall, the sound quality is very good.<br /><br />However, it's with the main course of this meal and not the dessert that I have my beef with.  I don't know how much of this is due to a severely deteriorated master source but the sound quality of the album proper (i.e. the first 9 tracks) is quite poor.  The volume levels are low overall and the bass seems to overpower everything else.<br /><br />To its credit, nowhere on the cd does it claim that this album has been remastered only that it has been mastered by Vic Anesini which gives us hope that the powers that be can still seek out a better master source from the vaults or do a proper remastering job with today's state of the art equipment to truly do justice to this brilliant classic rock album.<br /><br />And now to the quality of the songs: Carlos Santana who once played with Miles Davis is very obviously heavily influenced by him, Tito Puente and Gabor Szabo (Gypsy Queen) and this is very evident on this album.  Peter Green from the original Fleetwood Mac and the composer of \\"Black Magic Woman\\" was also involved in the making of this cover version of his song which is arguably even better than the original which may not be the case for the other cover \\"Oye Como Va\\" wherein Tito Puente's version with lots more percussion probably is better and yet both tracks are every upcoming guitarist's dream jam songs.<br /><br />Speaking as a guitarist myself I can tell you that there are few joys that surpass that of jamming to \\"Oye Como Va\\" with a band and \\"Black Magic Woman\\" is one of the first songs that I learnt to play note-for-note when I first started playing years ago.  Although most people remember the album for these 2 tracks, the rest of the tracks are also very good and \\"Samba Pa Ti\\" is just a brilliant piece of mood music and great tone and phrasing on the part of Carlos on guitar.<br /><br />There is little doubt in my mind that Santana will make the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame soon if they are not already in there and that this album will be the main reason why.  My recommendation is to wait for the May release of this album on mini lp sleeve replica and hopefully with better sound quality by our friends in Japan who tend to do a better job of sound production generally and so I'm keeping my fingers crossed, having already pre-ordered my copy.<br /><br />If you don't mind too much about sound quality, then go ahead and get this album if you are a fan of great classic rock and/or you are an aspiring rock guitarist as this is essential listening if you belong to either category.<br /><br />Recommended.percussion probably is better and yet both tracks are every upcoming guitarist's dream jam songs. <br /> <br />Speaking as a guitarist myself I can tell you that there are few joys that surpass that of jamming to \\"Oye Como Va\\" with a band and \\"Black Magic Woman\\" is one of the first songs that I learnt to play note-for-note when I first started playing years ago.

B000E6UK5K|2.0|This album is not what I expected as a long time fan of David Gilmour/Pink Floyd. I understand his approach and intention wasn't the same as his previous solo albums. For me, it took alot of temptation not to skip any of the tracks in the hope of finding a song that will rise above the rest. I would have hoped to at least have one decent song on this album. I have to admit; David still has a wonderful voice and is a awesome guitar player. However, I wished that I did not rely on his past success in order for me to buy this album. I recommend previewing the tracks before purchasing so you won't be disappointed.
B000777J2S|5.0|Hi there, I thought I would review this. I don't often review things, so here goes.  <br /> <br />I bought this album, just because I like the name. I have no idea what the cover looks like, but I had heard good things. So I put it on, and just went, \\"wow! that's different,\\" when I heard the first song. You'll either like Antony's voice or you won't, it's relatively high but the vibrado is just...eery. I like unique voices, and then there's the lyrics, especially \\"hope there's someone,\\" don't we all wonder about that? That's why we have religion, right? The instrumentation, as has been stated, is pretty straightforward in terms of what is used, but like any good artist, it's how they use it. The melodies are not necessarily complex, but the subtleies that are in them allow for a complexity that is hard to grasp at first.  <br /> <br />Going back to the voice, I could definitely see why people wouldn't like it, but that doesn't mean you should just say, \\"oh that was the worst voice I've ever heard,\\" hey, at least the guy has the ability to sing, right?  <br /> <br />I like the sadness, the gentleness of it all, the rather sparse arrangement, but most of all I think that voice, there's nothing like it. Remember when Ray Charles first came on the scene with Atlantic in the '50s? People didn't like what he was doing, mixing gospel sort of sounds with the R&B of the time, but now do you doubt his genious? While I give a rather radical example, I encourage that this album be listened to multiple times and preferably early in the morning or late at night for atmosphere.  <br /> <br />Those are just my thoughts, you may read what you like of them or ignore them completely, but most of all, please be open, you'll never know until you try something, right?  <br /> <br />Peace if it can be found here at some point, <br />Dave
B000063WDH|5.0|I found these guys listening to Pandora online one day.  Had no clue who they were or what they were about.  Who knew some awesome blues could come from two skinny fellas from Akron, Ohio recording in a basement!!!???  First song I heard was Brooklyn Bound - great super dirty gritty blues sound that I love. Came to Amazon to listen to more clips and bought on the spot!  All three albums carry through this great sound...I honestly can't pick a favorite album.  Here are my top three fav songs on their three albums released to date...<br /><br />Off The Big Come Up<br /><br />Busted<br /><br />Do The Rump<br /><br />Brooklyn Bound<br /><br />Off Thickfreakness<br /><br />Title track - Thickfreakness<br /><br />Have Love Will Travel<br /><br />Hurt Like Mine<br /><br />Off Rubber Factory<br /><br />Just Couldn't Tie Me Down<br /><br />Grown So Ugly<br /><br />Keep Me<br /><br />Really good stuff if you are into thick, gritty, full sounding blues style music.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I purchased the Star Wars Trilogy for my husband.  He is an avid Star Wars fan and sincerely enjoys well-made films in general.  I knew this was something on his \\"wish list\\" and, as I suspected, he loves it!  If you have any person in your life who loves Star Wars, this is the perfect gift for them!
B0007PAMR4|5.0|Finally I have my own high-quality copy of the original DUNE full-length edition! For too long have I watched my recorded-off-the-tv tape, chopped up with commercials. A great story, reasonably well-acted, faithful to the original novel by Frank Herbert, with all the cheesy special effects. They even left in most of the errors from the first version! The Navigator attendant tripping as they rolled in the chamber was hilarious! Now I can proudly inflict this movie on my non-sci-fi friends without embarrassment, in glorious widescreen and without commercial interruption!
B00005JNX0|3.0|Willing suspension of disbelief is essential to watching any movie, play, etc., but all we ask is to not be thrown violently from the experience by things that just don't make sense--even in something that is obviously far-fetched.  If you find yourself playing MST3K in your head along with the action, there may be a scripting problem.  That said, this is entertaining.  The lemurs are a riot.  The penguins are a stroke of genius.  The \\"What a Wonderful World\\" scene is bone-crunchingly funny with depressingly horrific levity.  Watch it, laugh, but don't expect logical plot construction.

B0002VEPRQ|5.0|I am biased on this film.. I loved it since i was a kid!  I learned to read following along with my mom reading the \\"souvenier book\\" from the movie.  The transfer is superior, the special features are fun and interesting.  Watching it, I was 4 years old again (if only!)
B0002OERI0|5.0|This album is great at first when i bought it i only liked american idiot, holiday, and boulevard of broken dreams but now i think this whole album is great.
B000286RNY|5.0|WHAT AN IDIOT I AM.  This is EASILY one of the 10 best movies that I have seen in 10 YEARS.  Stephen Chow continues to prove hi brilliance with another touching story, with some of his most creative characters yet.  I am still having a hard time deciding who my favorite character is.  You have the iron head who is always smoking on the court.  Oh yeah, bruce lee is the team's goalie, then as back up goalie you have a very heroic performance played by the stomach master.<br /><br />Sorry I am throwing so much stuff at you here, but this movie is really that crazy.  The story is about a cripple(one leg) meets stephen chow(mighty steel leg) and teaches him to play soccer.  Stephen gathers his brothers together, and all try to redevelop their kungfu to apply it to soccer.<br /><br />Now even though this is a good movie all around, this movie really flips the switch when the soccer matches start.  This movie has that certain kinetic enery that draws you in towards the tv and, the only other movie I can think of is Iron Monkey.<br /><br />This movie is for all ages, with a very limited number of jokes(2-4) where your kids might have needed to look away.<br /><br />This dvd has both chinese and american versions.  The chinese version is of course like 25 min. longer than the american, but the american version is surprisingly acceptable.<br /><br />Best movie I've seen since lord of the rings, best movie I saw before that was gladiotar, before that was requiem for a dream, etc. so this movie is pretty freaking good, don't keep passing it over for the next year or two like I made the mistake of doing.
034544678X|4.0|The author is not only very informative but also humble about the fact that early on, she too could get frustrated.  We really do confuse our dogs and this book will not only tell you why but how to correct yourself.
0345357116|5.0|This book is part of the order in which I have people read the lord when they ask me to borrow it.<br /><br />My order goeas like this, I have people read the silmarillion, but before, let me put this in order, sorry<br />1.)the silmarillion(not the whole thing)<br />2.)now stop before you read the fall of gondolin, and read unfinished tales, tuor's journey to find the gate, it ends with ecthelion giving tuor and vorondel greetings.<br />3.)then read the fall of gondolin from book of lost tales 2<br />4.)then after you have read the whole story, you can read the silmarillion version for a quick recap.<br />5.)read rest of silmarillion, but the last chapter called 'Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age' SHOULD NOT BE READ YET.  It is a very good writing, but it would spoil the entire Lord of the Rings experience.<br />6.)hobbit<br />7.) then of course you would finally read the lord of the rings.  of the 3 people I have let have this particular experience, 2 told me it was worth all the reading beforehand, 1 said he would have rather read the lord, then experienced the silmarillion.  It's not like I forced it upon them, but don't try to have an old man go through all this like my grandpa, anyone else I think would have liked the 7 step process of getting the full experience, and then again, I could be COMPLETELY wrong.<br /><br />This book has plenty of stuff for you lord of the rings fans who did not care for the silmarillion, isulder and the things he did when he had the RING, the original ride of the rohirrum, and an odd story about galadriel and celeborn.  Since I am at work, and this is pretty much all I do at work is review stuff(mainly kungfu), I don't have the book in fromt of me, but I reread it at least every 2-3 years.  This book is FILLED with great stuff from what I can remember, even though I have only listed a few of them.
B000AY3KN0|5.0|Loved the quality of the transfer.  This movie was long overdue for release on DVD.  I kinda suspected that it would be released in time for the new movie by Peter Jackson.  I loved all the extras that were included.  Highly Recommended Purchase
B0000024IE|5.0|PE is another hip hop music icon that'll be talked about in 100 years as pioneering the heart and soul of America's truest art form of self-expression, joy, pain, heartache and real world problems and solutions. <br /> <br />You don't know hip hop and you definitely know hip hop music at its highest, purest form if you don't own, know of or even heard this album. <br /> <br />It's overwhelming Afrocentric (par for the course circa popular hip hop 1989-mid 1990). <br /> <br />For all listeners, you'll definitely get a strong sense that PE has something to say about Black Empowerment and challenging the status quo. <br /> <br />For white listeners, please don't be scared off by this album's Pro Black sentiments. <br /> <br />PE's Pro-Black messages are NOT anti-white ... PE's very much about self-help. <br /> <br />I can remember seeing tape of a documentary back in 1993 of a PE concert they performed waaayyy out in the boonies, somewhere in Middle America where minorities are an entity the local yocals probably only saw on TV. <br /> <br />Point is, they talked to several members of the overwhelmingly white, big hair, mullet-sporting crowd and to my surprise and delight, the crowd \\"got it.\\" <br /> <br />They spoke with respect and admiration of PE and explained themselves how they thought it wasn't offensive and that PE was just promoting Black empowerment and for more people to get education, question society's way and know their history. <br /> <br />Powerful stuff (both this album and that documentary).
B000E6UK5K|5.0|On an island is in my opinion one of the best releases after the division bell.Everyone knows that Gilmour was always the creative talent in the great Pink floyd,and he amply demonstrates this in this superb album.very highly recommended.
B0001XAPZ6|4.0|The humans of the future live on a badly polluted Earth, threatened by the ever-expanding Sea of Decay, a toxic forest inhabited by monstrous insects.  Nations war with each other over the remaining space and resources.  The idyllic life of the Valley of the Winds comes to an end when it is conquered by the warlike Tokumekians, launching the princess Nausicaa on an adventure that will enable her to save her people and reestablish a bond between the humans and the land. <br /> <br />This early effort from the masterful animator Hayao Miyazaki offers imaginative visuals, stirring action, and a provocative theme, although it does not quite rise to the level of some of his later efforts.  Thematically, it compliments Miyazaki's later \\"Princess Mononoke,\\" a story of the distant past in which man and nature were becoming estranged.  \\"Nausicaa\\" shows them coming back together again.  The hallmarks of the Miyazaki style are evident here: resourceful heroines, humanistic themes, strong relationships, and fantastic creatures.
B000006TRV|5.0|The wall is one of the greatest rock albums to be ever made.This great album has sold over 22 million copies to date and is popular in all the continents in the world solely due to songs like Run like hell,another brick in the wall and Comfortably numb.I urge you to add this beauty to your collection today.
B000E6UK5K|3.0|Clearly, a dedicated Floyd fan sees all the transitions the band had, from leaving the 60's psychodelics of Piper to that 80s snafu, Momentary - right down to the silly \\"Knight-Rider-esq\\" electronic drums.  This album has some Meddle and Division Bell aromas.  I think Meddle was by far the best they ever did.  DG digs in to that a little.  He typically has his super-crunchy strat over Marshall sounding style.  And he uses a slide to get those screechingly high and spooky notes.  The first track almost sounds like what Clapton did in the \\"Lethal Weapon\\" movies.  But, given his (their) history, this seems like an appropriate follow up.
B000EGDC14|5.0|For those who loved FELT MOUNTAIN, you'll be disappointed. For those who loved BLACK CHERRY, you'll be ticked pink. SUPERNATURE is the steroided-up for the U.S. market version of that import that came out last year, loaded with a BONUS DVD chock full of goodies, including an ultra-cool glimpse at Golfrapp's creative process (LITTLE BITS OF GOLDFRAPP) amidst the lush English countryside and lots of eye-popping, dead-cool videos, a wacky animated short film called JACKKO THE POET, etc. The album? If you've heard the pitch-perfect electro-glam-pop singles NUMBER 1 and OOH LA LA, you know what to expect: essentially, Alison has taken BLACK CHERRY's signature blend of electro-glam and tarted it up with traces of T. REX using cutting-edge technology as icing on the cake - it's a potent brew, indeed.  While the slower tracks, LET IT TAKE YOU and TIME OUT FROM THE WORLD, offer a faint taste of the early mystique of FELT MOUNTAIN missing from most of the cuts here, Goldfrapp's uptempo grooves peer into the future while paying homage to the past - and who can argue with the sheer power, craft, and joy found in the cluch of singles (in addition to NUMBER 1 and OOH LA LA, there's also RIDE A WHITE HORSE and Japanese bonus track BEAUTIFUL) that really impress.  Sure it's all a bit of a formula now and they might even be repeating themselves a tad, but if it ain't broken, why fix it?  Bottom line: is there anyone as drop-dead cool as Alison Goldfrapp these days?  This is the kind of pure pop perfection Madonna wishes she could create, but forgot how. When you combine the band's visual persona, the music, Alison's unique vocal instrument, and their overall total package, GOLDFRAPP is a force to be reckoned with - let's hope they finally have a massive breakthrough in America that they deserve it, finally showing all the other pop-pablum pretenders \\"how we do!\\"
B0000029DD|5.0|Ok, I am not a fan of music reviews. generally people feel moved to write a review because they love the album in question. Result? No objectivity whatsoever. Anyway, I am going to gush myself. There are few albums from the '90's which could be labled as classics. However, this is one of them. A stone-cold classic. If you disagree, I will utter only one sentence to you: you are wrong.
1400032717|4.0|The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time is written in the format of a book authored by an autistic young man.  The boy begins to write the book as the result of finding a dog, the pet of his neighbor, murdered by being impaled by a garden fork.  The young man decides to solve the murder by doing some detective work.  In the process, he ends up unearthing much more than just the original incident itself.    Quote: \\"Prime numbers are what you have left when you have taken all the patterns away.  I think prime numbers are like life.  They are very logical but you could never work out the rules, even if you spent all your time thinking about them.\\"      I enjoyed this book because it relates the story of a person who is autistic and possessing brilliance in the areas of math and science. Because it is written as if a book composed by the main character (with a special gift for remembering the exact details of people, conversations, and occurrences), it was different from everything I have read recently. Additionally, the plot ended up being more complicated than I had originally anticipated, which is always fun.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This movie is a nice little send off from the people of firefly, it was a very good series and I'd recommend buying the episodes of it however it was not original. The basis of the plot came from an anime series called \\"Outlaw Star\\". Malcom Reynolds is very remenisant of Gene Starwind so much so that i feel anyone who watched firefly would also watch outlaw star whether your into anime or not.  So if you have the movie and episodes don't forget the anime.
0743454537|4.0|I found this to be a beautifully written, lovely, heartbreaking book. The author writes it in short chapters that are told from the perspectives of the different main characters. At first I found this annoying, but I soon found that it really added a lot to the story, and felt them to be very well intertwined. There are few books that I devour straight through, because I have the attention span of a gnat, but this was absolutely one of them. <br />
B000E1YVZU|4.0|I absolutely loved this play, but was sceptical when it came to the movie. Somehow, plays never come out as good in movie form. This is the exception. It was just as amazing as the play.
B000050X31|4.0|Amazing singing... <br /> <br />I am not as enthusiastic with regards to the rest. The soloist are good, but each tries to show off his or hers strenghts without relating to each other or the rest of the production.
B00005JMX6|4.0|Worth a view. This film is more \\"cute\\" than it is funny, but it does have some very funny moments! Elisha Cuthbert is amazing. WOW! And the Leonardo DiCaprio look-a-like kid does a very believable acting job. The story is mostly a romance until the end when all signs of a romance dissapear and it just gets silly, pretty funny silly!

B000BT97AO|5.0|MirrorMask, in my eyes, is the quintessential children's story.  As I watch children's films that are released in today's Hollywood, I feel that we do not challenge the youth of tomorrow.  We give them rather unimaginative stories, bland and overused characters, stories that feel like they have been pulled off a cereal box, and yet we expect them to be creative individuals in the real world.  How can our children be creative when we only give them unoriginality to work with?  We need more films like MirrorMask to slip into our mainstream cinema culture.  I think the works of Gaiman and McKean are allowing this nearly untouched form of entertainment for our children to finally have their moment in the sun.  As graphic novels slowly (and respectively) start to become a standard part of our literary world, as artists like Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean continue to be imaginative and provocative, we will only see more films like MirrorMask be released.  As I watched this film for the second time in the span of about five hours, I could not help but still be impressed by the colorful world that McKean's paintbrush created, I could not help but be impressed by the simplistic, yet forgotten themes that Gaiman used in weaving his story, and I could not help but be impressed that the Henson Company put their seal of approval on this fine piece of work.  This only proved to me that Henson's dark side, his dream side, has not been forgotten and is ready to be experienced by yet another youthful generation.<br /><br />How did MirrorMask work on both a children's thematic level, but also a vivid storytelling level?  I ask this question only because these two-partnered ideas should be a staple to every children's film released.  Our young generation should be able to go to the theater and watch a movie while simultaneously being educated and entertained.  Is that too much to ask?  In MirrorMask I finally had the opportunity to see these paired elements in action.  Director and illustrator Dave McKean took great strides to recreate the emotion and power behind the classic 80s children's fantasy stories.  The key elements to the fantasy stories that I grew up with as a child were all in place.  He gave us a rebellious child that is forced to go on an adventure that will not only jeopardize their own life, but also change their outlook on the world that has been a burden to them (typically due to a misunderstood parent or unfair situation).  As I see McKean create this with the simple switch of his creative wrist, I cannot help but ask, \\"Where are these elements in today's cinema?\\"  They were so important in forging films like The Neverending Story and Labyrinth that somehow it seems that recently we have forgotten our roots and disrespectfully replaced it with bathroom humor, clich&eacute; characters, and unimaginative stories.  With MirrorMask, Dave McKean has recreated the lost wheel and he has succeeded by creating a film that is a step above anything in the past decade of Disney.  McKean finally gives us likeable characters, McKean finally gives us a world that we have never seen (and animation that will leave your jaw on the floor), and McKean finally gives us some honest themes that not only relate to our children, but return us to that moment in the 80s that changed us in that small way.<br /><br />Dave McKean may have been the director of this film, but from the opening scene you can immediately tell that famed author Neil Gaiman's words are heavily an influence.  Gaiman has this powerful ability to give us human characters that are pulled into a fantastic voyage.  His characters, like Helena in MirrorMask, somehow seep into our minds and hearts due to their commonplace internal/external struggles.  We, as audience members, can relate to a child that is rebellious against her family that escapes to a new, colorful world.  This film was like a perfect color by numbers puzzle in the sense that Gaiman gave McKean the numbers to color by.  It is due to Gaiman's literary genius that MirrorMask successfully worked both by a visual standpoint, but also by an intellectual standpoint.  Gaiman has this amazing ability to pull his audiences closer with each turning page, and while MirrorMask was not a novella of any kind, he still uses his technique by keeping us close to our heroine Helena while continually building a world out of nothing but pure imagination.<br /><br />You can have McKean's eye and Gaiman's voice, but unless you know what to do with them, the final result will only seem like Saturday's leftovers.  What I desperately fell in love with in MirrorMask were the themes.  To see our heroine, Helena, battle both internal and external demons within a colorful storyline was a breath of fresh air.  We, as audience members, have the honor of watching her grow up in front of our eyes.  She transforms from an upset bratty child into one that accepts her parents and enjoys the lifestyle in which she was handed.  The way that McKean used her parents both inside and outside the \\"dream world\\" brought a familiar, yet darker, Wizard of Oz-esque feel to the story.  I thought that her being able to see an \\"opposite\\" version of herself through the windows was highly symbolic of a child's rebellious times, or her teenage years.  We grew up with Helena, and the way that McKean demonstrated this was phenomenal.  Sure, you may be able to witness this in other films, but to have it work perfectly without seeming clich&eacute; or old, that is where the real talent of McKean and Gaiman can be seen.  I miss the Hollywood stories that structure themselves in this fashion.  McKean and Gaiman kept them simple yet paid a huge homage to the Henson 80s storyline.  I could not help but remember where I was when I first watched the powerhouse of a film called Labyrinth (a similar tale of teenage angst-and-woe) as I watched this film unfold.  Using both imagination and visually stunning colors, this team literally transformed one of their graphic novels into a moving picture.<br /><br />Overall, this film was spectacular.  After my first viewing, I had to immediately watch it again.  There are scenes in the film (like the giant boulder like statues that speak slowly and the birdmen named \\"Bob\\" and \\"Malcolm\\") that I believe have redefined the idea of animation.  Not to put to different types of films together, but it is great to see Frank Miller's Sin City then watch MirrorMask behind it.  These graphic novelists and artists are slowly creeping into our mainstream culture, and as hard as we will to keep them out, their imaginative stories and amazingly beautiful (and hauntingly original) stories will always creep into.  We, as a culture, pride ourselves on our imagination, and to see the originality of McKean and Gaiman burst onto the screen with so much dedication and respect to the genres behind them, I cannot wait to see what is in our graphic novel Hollywood future.  Jim Henson would have been very proud of this film!<br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****is due to Gaiman's literary genius that MirrorMask successfully worked both by a visual standpoint, but also by an intellectual standpoint.

B0002S94OS|5.0|F**K YOU!!! you obviously don't know good metal. Lamb of God deliver the most kick-ass metal i've ever heard. The singer Randy Blythe has an incredible screaming range of vocals and delivers everything from high-pitched shrieks to floor trembling growls. The guitarists Mark Morton and Willie Adler are phenominal and introduce amazing guitar work. The bassist John Cambell has a fat sound and can easily be heard. The drummer Chris Adler is one of the best out there right now. He delivers pulsing beats and crazy double bass. <br /> <br />Highlights: <br /> <br />Laid to Rest-First single off the album. Very diverse and very heavy. A nice chugging section near the end is just what the doctor ordered. <br /> <br />Now You've Got Something To Die For-The second single off the album. Good-ass drumming and a heavy as f**k breakdown near the end. <br /> <br />Blood of the Scribe-Possibly one of the best off the album. Very diverse guitar-wise and has some of the best drumming I've ever heard come out of Chris. <br /> <br />Break You-An all-around heavy song has nice breakdowns and is heavy as hell. Some really good drumming in this song. <br /> <br />Ashes of the Wake-A killer instrumental with crazy solos and guest guitar work from Chris Poland (Megadeth) and Alex Skolnick (Testament) and some killer solos from Mark and Willie. The 4th Solo (Willie) is my personal favorite because it is a slow and melodic yet dark solo. <br /> <br />Remorse Is For The Dead-My personal favorite off the album. It has a slow and haunting intro that suddenly explodes into a fiery verse riff. And the breakdown is the heaviest breakdown I have ever heard. I love it. This is a killer song and is heavy as f**k. <br /> <br />So if your a fan of good metal, I order you to buy this album no. DO NOT pass this up, it will blow your mind.
6301966562|4.0|I too have always liked this movie.  The music is great and the story is very enjoyable, if a bit improbable.  All in all, though, it's a good movie and should be on DVD at a reasonable price.  Why isn't it?

1572810408|5.0|Charming and exquisitely rendered, this deck is reminiscent of the of 17th-century alphabet symbols used to teach children (on display in Colonial Williamsburg, Virginia). Nevertheless, while the artwork is beguiling, don't infer from its beauty that this is a set to be taken lightly: It's just as multi-functional and expressive as any of the older, more traditional decks. Not only does the symbolism fulfil expectations, but the unique, silken finish makes this a sheer joy to hold - a tactile advantage that many decks simply can't offer. If selecting one's favorite tarot deck is based, in no small part, on the very feel of the cards in one's hands and the ease of interpretation, then this promises to be a collector's must.
B00004YA66|5.0|This movie is incredible. I don't know why I didn't see it in the theatres...I guess I was just kind of resistant but my friend brought it over the house and I watched it and right after I watched it, I watched it again.<br /><br />It's a movie that you can really never tire of because it's a movie that entertains the delightful question of \\"What if?\\" We all would like to change things in our pasts. We all have hidden regrets that we would like to change if we could and if we changed that one thing, maybe our whole lives would be different.<br /><br />But we shouldn't stay in \\"What if?\\" Maybe the whole point of this movie is to not have regrets about past decisions and past actions, but what can you do today to make your life different tomorrow. Live with courage, with love, with the knowing that something better is just around the corner just waiting for you to accept, embrace, and happily embody.<br /><br />The screenplay of this movie is extremely tight. There are no flaws to this movie. It is as close to perfect as it comes. The acting is incredible. Even the little kids that play roles in this film are amazing. It is one of those films that punch you in the gut and then gives you the grace to recover during the length of the film.<br /><br />Buy this movie. Let it entertain you but also keep in your heart and mind the question \\"What if?\\" Live today and let the regrets of your past dissolve into the Love that makes all things new.
055380457X|2.0|I thought this book is critical and worth first, based on the title; and second, the image on the book jacket. I presumed this book may be avoiding oft-repeated storytelling style so rampant in many cultures - that are fond of recycling gossip and funny tales. And, that it may be presenting stories using techniques of investigative journalism and competitive intelligence. Presuming, all this, by the cover of the book was my mistake. And so is true with many Amazon reviewers of Google's story, who feel let down by this 326 page book.    One thing I learned from this book appears in less than two lines. It refers to use of a tilde character (~). The idea is \\"a search for ~auto will also turn up Web pages that use the terms cars, trucks, automobiles, and more.\\" (Vise, p. 296).    But, this idea of using tilde is an untested theory, and soon fails. Results with tilde or no tilde made no difference in many other instances. I found this occurrence of results as random as the other recent reports in the media, including the Ashley Cole story.    To be precise, I would summarize what any reader will feel; that is, this book fits in a 20 percent rule. Which type of 20 percent rule is a different story and will be described in a little while!     Twenty percent rule, in this book, refers to flexibility, in time management. That is, the author narrates how Google permits its staff to spend a part of the business hours as-you-like-it. It is a free time that is granted with a hope that there will be a creative visualization form these minds on how to move ahead in the volatile world. (Vise, pp. 131-133, 137-140, 212)    The type of 20 percent rule, I refer here, is about how much of this narrative is consuming bulk of the book. With already many books on Google in the market we don't need to read same narrative history in every book. Hence, the use of a 80/20 scale is relevant here. 80 percent of the content, in Google's story, is simply PR or an official voice of the inside story captured and, described in this book.     The book, nevertheless, has some bits and bytes of investigative journalism and competitive intelligence. And in this lies what is essential for being a good book on Google -- 20 percent of the ideas and information dealing with the critical content is all that matters. Such a brief, but thorough analytical book would have definitely resulted in saving 80 percent of reader's time, money, energy, etc.     With this thick bulky book in hand and less critical content to digest one thing is clear: viz., the world of publish or perish will continue to prosper.     If someone needs to trace the history of how Google started and landed as a top stake holder, this book is excellent, and by and large a very useful document. All advanced students and techies can go elsewhere or continue googling.
0131479415|5.0|Mike Cohn prooves once again that he is one of the best at describing software project tools and techniques in a very straightforward and easy to understand manner.  This book could very easily be called just \\"Estimating and Planning\\" because the techniques he suggests are applicable and useful on all kinds of projects and are just generally good practice. This book is a must read for all those project leaders and development teams who want to improve their effectiveness in estimating and planning.
0060194995|2.0|This is a review for the hardcover, 40th anniversary edition of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird.\\"  I specify this because To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the all-time greatest American books, and this isn't a review of the novel, but a review of the hardcover edition of the novel: <br /> <br />The description for the book mentions that it is a hardcover special edition with a new \\"Foreward\\" by the author, Harper Lee, who hasn't been in the public eye since the book's original publication.  However, these facts stretch the truth a bit. <br /> <br />The \\"Foreward\\" is simply a paragraph, taken from a letter from Lee to the editors of the book, that says she doesn't like Introductions to books.  What kind of a \\"Foreward\\" is that??  Is it worth paying $5.00 more for over a paperback edition? <br /> <br />Also, the hardcover is not very well put together.  It is your standard unlaminated hardcover with glossy dustjacket, but the binding is cheap and the book will not survive several re-reads like a hardcover should be able to do.  In fact, if you want longevity I suggest going with a paperback edition... I've had mine for many years and it still is as strong as ever. <br /> <br />Granted, the book does LOOK nice sitting in a shelf, especially if you are a collector of the various hardcover editions of the classics that have come out recently (\\"On the Road,\\" \\"The Bell Jar,\\" \\"Catcher in the Rye,\\" all of Ayn Rand's novels, etc) but that isn't my purpose for owning books.  Each to his own, though. <br /> <br />Two stars, because besides all the edition's faults it still IS \\"To Kill a Mockingbird.\\"
B000002LE6|5.0|APART FROM HAVING ALL THE SONGS AS 1 TRACK, THIS IS STILL ONE OF MY MANY FAV. PRINCE RELEASES.
B000007T1M|4.0|This was the first CD of SOAD I ever picked up. It is so good! While very few of my favorite songs of their's are on this CD, it does carry my absolute favorite; Sugar. This is the first album System of a Down made. Songs I really love on this CD are Suite-Pee, Sugar, Suggestions, Soil, D-devil, War?, and P.L.U.C.K. Along with being my first SOAD cd, this was also my first metal CD. It is a good album if you are just getting interested in this great band and will still be really good when you get other CDs like Mezmerize and i thought it was a pretty good introduction for those of you not familiar with the genre metal, but then again, it may not be good for people just starting to listen to metal. :shrug: who knows? <br /> <br />Also, if you are already a SOAD fan bu thave not picked up this CD, it is worth listening to. Some really good songs are on it (like Sugar). If you are into their songs with notes and everything though, I wouldn't suggest this CD. Instead, get the spiders single. It is the only song with notes on the whole CD. The rest are really more of an emo taste. This is still a great CD filled with a lot of fun songs.  <br /> <br />Fair warning: Don't listen to these tracks around your parents.
B00004YZFR|4.0|I love how everyone loves to spout off about the Hells Angels in relation to this film.  I've heard many people claim that \\"oh, the Hells Angels were beating people with pool cues\\", well, if you actually WATCH closely, you see two people with pool cues.  One is a Hells Angels Prospect (meaning NOT in the club, he only has a bottom rocker on his jacket, no death's heaed insignia, no Hells Angels label), and the other is not wearing anything related to the Hell's Angels.  I fail to see how this means that the Hell's Angels were beating people with pool sticks.  Secondly, Everyone loves to spout off about the Angels murdering Meredith Hunter, the 18 year old black man who was stabbed at the concert.  Once again, if you watch the movie, you see Meredith Hunter (dressed in a very noticeable brightly colored outfit) pull a gun and point it at the stage.  He is then attacked by the Angels, who were providing security, and therefore were doing their jobs.  Yet they're accused of murdering a man who pointed a gun at the stage.  Hmmm.... Maybe if the Angels hadn't jumped on the guy, Keith Richards or Mick Jagger or one of the other band members would have suffered the same fate as Dimebag Darrel Abbot did at the Damageplan concert in December of 2004... <br />The Stones are a great band, and the DVD is worth buying just for them, but also for a piece of history caught on film that has been lied about for years.

B00065VTU4|5.0|I never gave this album much of a chance when it first came out. Maybe I thought it was a little to laid back at the time. After buying this 461 Ocean Blvd. [Deluxe Edition] disc I now feel it is one of Clapton's finest efforts and one of the finest albums of the 70's. When you add the many bonus tracks it is an irresistible must have. That said I will let other reviewers deal with the artistic content of this disc. I am cursed with an obsession for the quality of the recording and digital transfer. In other words how it sounds on expensive esoteric stereo equipment. This year I have been bitten by the SACD bug yet every time I play this CD I am shocked at how amazingly great it sounds. I do not understand how but this disc matches my SACD's when it comes to natural, warm, detailed, and dynamic sound reproduction. When you add the extra bonus disc of great 70's rock how can one resist. \\"JUST BUY IT\\" and thank me later.

B000DZIGDU|4.0|Jarhead is neither a heroic, nor an entertaining war film.  Instead, Sam Mendes employs the ample cinematic brilliance that he also applied in his astonishing films American Beauty (1999) and Road to Perdition (2002).  The characters are far from perfect, as their imperfections emerge throughout the film.  The characters are not depicted as heroes, but like chauvinistic mindless brutes trained for one single purpose - to kill.  The title is also an allusion to this notion, as it refers in slang to Marines through their haircuts, but also the symbol of the head being a hollow container.  The story becomes a journey into a personal hell based on Anthony Swofford's book Jarhead: A Marine's Chronicle of the Gulf War and Other Battles that capture the indoctrination and transformation to murderous warriors that will serve orders faithfully.<br /><br />The first impression that Jarhead makes is much like a reproduction of several other war films such as Kubrick's brilliant Full Metal Jacket (1987), Stone's bloody Platoon (1986), and Coppola's surreal Apocalypse Now (1979) among many others.  Some of the film's uniqueness seems to suffer from the similarities of other cinematic experiences.  Yet, it is also where some of the films strengths rest, as most people only can relate to war through the movies.  Thus, through the audience's recognition of other war films Mendes reaches all viewers when he makes one of the closing arguments that \\"Every war is different. Every war is the same.\\"<br /><br />A brief series of scenes portray some of the hard nose training that Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) had to endure, which included demeaning and cruel treatment.  It is some the methods that drill sergeants apply to bring out the hatred and anger needed for a cruel and merciless killing machine.  These images are put in the light of an introductory voice-over that echoes with the thoughtful notion that soldiers will never forget these murderous skills, as they will strive to reap the pleasures of life such as loving and nurturing.  It is obvious that Swofford truly hates it in the Marines, and sees the whole ordeal as a gigantic mistake, as he finds himself under a nasty drill instructor that tries to bring out the worst in him.<br /><br />Angry and troubled Swofford is shipped out to a new location where he meets his new unit, and is put under training as a scout sniper in the US Marine Corps. It is a rigorously harsh and difficult training lead by Staff Sergeant Sykes (Jamie Foxx) whose job it is to weed out the weak.  Swofford finds the snipping business intriguing, and excels, as he becomes partner with Troy (Peter Sarsgaard).  Eventually the training comes to an end, and the first Gulf Conflict commences a short period after the training.  The idea of war makes all of the trigger-happy Marines cheerful that they are about to ship out to face the enemy that they have prepared for through the brutal training.<br /><br />The blissfulness of war soon ceases, as they learn that they will dig into defensive positions while awaiting the war. It is an extremely difficult time for the soldiers, as they find themselves isolated from civilization and the loved ones at home.  As the days run by Swofford and the other soldiers hydrate, eat, masturbate, train, or sleep. In between the daily routine, they find much time to think about life and death.  Swofford thinks about his girlfriend, and how much he wants to be with her.  Meanwhile, his buddies in desert camouflage makes fun of how much they also desire his girlfriend.  However, as the time goes by it becomes apparent through the letters that his girlfriend becomes restless and seeks new friendships.  It is when his insecurities begin a personal war on himself, a war that can drive a person mad.  In a sense, Mendes captures some of the same mystique that Malick's poetic The Thin Red Line (1998) posed, as his soldier desires to get away from the war and enjoy living life and all of its pleasures.<br /><br />As most people should know the war eventually starts, as Operation Desert Storm begins.  It also means that Swofford and his brothers-in-arms can finally do what they are trained to do.  However, it brings the audience through a surrealistic experience, especially when approaching the burning oil wells.  There is one scene where Swofford encounters an oil-drenched horse under the pitch-black sky covered in the sooty smoke.  The scene brings to mind Salvador Dali's painting The Burning Giraffe, which he painted to show his personal struggle with the war in Spain during the 1930s.  Swofford also seems to undergo some personal struggle, as he tries to keep his humanity intact around the death and darkness that surrounds him.<br /><br />Overall Jarhead presents a terrific cinematic experience.  The camerawork is extraordinary through some of its emotionally scaring imagery and its portrayal of the characters.  The lighting also feels scorching with its overwhelming whiteness in the desert day scenes.  Gyllenhaal's personification of Swofford accentuates the psychological war that often is undergone in each soldiers mind in a truthful manner, which also enhances the cinematic experience.  Many of the supporting cast also enhance the emotional predicament that Swofford experiences.  In addition, the small, but meaningful appearances by Chris Cooper and Dennis Haysbert also enhance the overall visual experience.  However, the story is not unique, as already mentioned, and this portion of the film, even though it serves the film well, has an impact on the cinematic experience.  Nonetheless, Jarhead presents a truly intriguing and worthwhile viewing.leasures. <br /> <br />As most people should know the war eventually starts, as Operation Desert Storm begins.

B000AP04NI|5.0|Shirley Jones and Gordon MacRae are wonderful in this movie version of \\"Oklahoma!\\"  The DVD is especially valuable when you play the movie with the narration by Shirley Jones in the background.  I always like learning about behind-the-scenes stuff.  I highly recommend it!
B0008ENIAC|5.0|Mildred Pierce, the novel, tells the story of the self-made homemaker Mildred Pierce sometime in the middle of the Great Depression who decides to fight against the destitute and indifferent era.  Through her honed skills in baking, she makes delightfully tasty cakes and pies, which leads her to the realization that she can become the breadwinner.  It also deals with several family issues such as divorce, parenting, and death.  Yet, the overshadowing theme that heavily hangs over the whole story seems to be responsibility, as the characters often shift their own responsibility to the motherly, strong, and independent woman Mildred.  The cinematic adaptation makes one significant change with the story by changing it from a drama to a thriller, or more precisely to murky genre film-noir by introducing a murder into the story.<br /><br />The heavy buzzing sound of an airplane departing from Chicago with Amsterdam as its designated destination served as the location for my screening.  The lights were out and people were sleeping, as I carefully placed the headphones over my ears and turned on my laptop to view this historical film-noir.  The opening credits emerging across the sand dunes while washed away by the waves of the ocean brought me the notion of life's cyclical pattern.  Maybe it serves the theme of a mother's nurturing care and idea for parental responsibility, or just tries to enhance the mysterious concept that surrounds film noir.  Anyway, the opening scene shows two brief night shots of an isolated luxury beach house with a third scene of a man falling over by a gun shot in the chest.  Undoubtedly, the opening smacks the audience with suspense from the first minute, as the perpetrator tosses the gun on top of the rapidly dying man.<br /><br />[Deductive Spoilers Ahead]<br /><br />In a coastal town not far from the luxurious beach house, a woman, who the audience eventually will identify as Mildred Pierce (Joan Crawford), stands by the railing of pier while teary-eyed staring down in the water.  She steps up on the edge, preparing herself for a plunge when a police office slams the railing with his club.  Stunned out of her miserable moment she stops, as the police officer asks her, \\"What's on your mind, lady?\\" She brushes him off by asking him to leave her alone.  Instead, the police officer provides a simplistic answer of responsibility and the consequences of her actions.  Yet, it is within this basic idea, which the films gem rests.<br /><br />When Mildred's first plan did not succeed, she attempts a second, by bringing the old friend and owner of a bar Wally Fay (Jack Carson) to the same beach house with the murdered man from a couple of scenes ago.  They have a long friendship that stem from his affectionate care and interest in her, which has soured over some business deals.  Due to the circumstances, hastily Mildred acts, as if she changed her mind about Wally and invites him to her beach house.  It is not the kind of invitation that was common in the thirty's, as she is married.  Yet, in some way, Mildred attempts to pin the murder on Wally.  However, things do not run as planned, as the police later picks her up.  From this moment on, things are getting even more complicated, which forces her to tell the true story about the murder.<br /><br />Through Mildred's voice-over, a flash back retells a lengthy tale starting from when she was a housewife.  Mildred goes into detail to share how her husband was laid-off, how and why she spoiled her daughters, and her husbands philandering. She also shares how she became a successful businesswoman, and how her success continued to grow.  Besides the success, Mildred also tells of her misfortunes such as losing both of her daughters.  It is within the story of her daughters where the poignant tragedy emerges, as she shares with the Chief Inspector how she neglected and spoiled them.  It is a guilt-ridden tale that sobs out Mildred's mouth; however, the audience cannothelp to empathize with her while also seeing how she feels guilty.<br /><br />How damaging affection can actually be if not properly managed emerges through Mildred's relationship to her oldest daughter Veda (Ann Blyth).  Mildred's sense of responsibility seems overwhelming, as she always attempts to provide for Veda.  In the process, Veda gets a skewed sense of reality; as she always is sheltered by her mother and never gets to test her own wings.  Mildred is naturally to blame for Veda's blemishes.  However, the child also needs to learn the responsibility of ones own actions as an adult, which is a lesson that Mildred learns in a most profound manner.<br /><br />Mildred Pierce, as a film, employs a brilliant adapted narrative that encourages the audience to contemplate the actions of the main character.  It also allows the viewer to contemplate on personal improvement while it provides a fascinatingly dark thriller.  The camerawork and the mise-en-scene help bring out the oppressive and shadowy elements of film noir, which compels the story to feel even more intriguing.  On top of this, the cast performs radiantly with Joan Crawford and Ann Blyth providing dazzling performances.  Michael Curtiz's direction pulls it all together into a stunningly captivating story that keeps the audience in suspense and questioning the choices of Mildred Pierce.ence cannot help to empathize with her while also seeing how she feels guilty. <br /> <br />How damaging affection can actually be if not properly managed emerges through Mildred's relationship to her oldest daughter Veda (Ann Blyth).

B00005JOWF|2.0|CONTAINS SPOLIERS. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />This movie had alot of action which is good. But thats all that wuz good about this movie. This movie made no sense. It had no main point because it wuz starting 2 to make one but it just threw off into another path. It didnt explain how violet survived being shot. they said that she had to go through 3 hours of surgery. and plus shes a vampire and she got shot IN THE HEART. if a vampire gets hit by anything in the heart then its not gonna live. This movie wuz too long as well. It could have been 45 mins and still would have been horrible. Do see this movie if you were a fan of the comic books but if not wait to rent it.

B000000OQY|4.0|Overlooked, forgotten and underrated: these are the words best to describe this album. But it shouldn't be this way. Sure it only has 8 tracks and some songs have generated controversy but that doesn't mean it's not good. The first half of the disc includes covers \\"Nice Boys\\" and \\"Mama Kin\\" both very good espcially the latter. And two songs that I don't rate as the best from GN'R but they are definately not bad! But the second half of the disc is why it's praised and cursed for. \\"Patience\\" a slow acoustic song about how we just need a little bit of patience - brilliant really, \\"Used To Love Her\\" a song that was meant as a joke but some people take too seriously, \\"Your Crazy\\" a slower acoustic(and better)version of the song that was previously released on \\"Appetite for Destruction\\", \\"One in a Million\\" A great acoustic song with an amazing guitar riff and some of the best vocals by Axl, and a song that is often blamed of using inappropriate words towards black people and homosexuals. Overall this is a must have for fans and worth checking out to anybody.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|Based on the wonderful books of Patrick O'Brian 'Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World' is far and away the most authentic 'Age of Sail' film that has been made to date. The Ship used to play HMS Surprise was HMS Rose a replica 28 gun Royal Navy Frigate. The uniforms are accurate. In Battle the guns leap back & fire solid iron cannon balls (not shells) that produce the clouds of splinters that in fact caused most casualties in the days of the Wooden Walls. <br /> <br />The Director sets out to show us a close up of life in a crowded wooden warship in the early 19th Century & he succeeds in his aim, right from a very early shot of a mass of men sleeping in swinging hammocks. <br /> <br />Beautiful photography, a script including a great deal taken from Patrick O'Brian novels, several exciting battle scenes, humour, a very good sound track & some good acting add up to one of the best historical war films in years.  <br /> <br />There is so much in the film it actually is one that repays watching several times. I throughly reccommend it. <br /> <br />
B000000OSG|5.0|This is a truly great album, and I mean great as they don't make em like this anymore. The phrase \\"All killer no filler\\" fits this album the best. Every single song on here is great and the 1,5 minute \\"My World\\" at the end of the album is not a filler it's just a little joke. This album gets you hooked right from the start with the GNRish whistling and a quote from the movie \\"Cool Hand Luke\\" followed by a an epic anti war song with some of the best lyrics provided by Rose and great guitar work from Slash. Other higlights of the album are \\"Yesterdays, Knockin on Heaven's Door\\", \\"Breakdown\\", \\"Locomotive\\" and arguably the best song from the UYI albums \\"Estranged\\" - a haunting 9 minute epic that really shows what this band was capable of. Wait.... I almost forgot \\"You Could Be Mine\\" this song simply ROCKS and the rant towards the end is priceless. <br />So if you like Rock or music in general get this album today, you won't be dissapointed.

B000000OSE|5.0|The first UYI is the lighter,faster and I guess you could say more rocking part of the UYI albums, but there are also songs like \\"Don't Cry\\", \\"November Rain\\" and a ten minute epic \\"Coma\\" and creepy \\"Garden\\" which is a duet with Alice Cooper. NR and Don't Cry are arguably the most famous songs on this record but almost every song on this album could have been a hit. My Personal favourite potential hits are \\"Don't Damn Me\\" and \\"Dead Horse\\" but there is no point mentioning great songs on this cd cos I would end up naming them all, so if you like Rock or music in general go get this album today, you won't be dissapointed.

B000000OQF|5.0|This is pretty damn near to a perfect rock album, it's raw, dirty and it gets you with the opening chord from WTTJ and doesn't let go until the end of Rocket Queen. This includes the \\"Big Three\\": \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\", \\"Paradise City\\" and \\"Sweet Child o' Mine\\". But there's more \\"It's so easy\\" has a great vibe to it and is a really fun song that shouldn't be taken too seriously, \\"Mr. Brownstone\\" again has a great vibe to it and talks about drug addiction and how it starts from doing little until little won't do, \\"Nightrain\\" a pure Rock n' Roll track about a really cheap booze called nightrain, \\"Rocket Queen\\" song about relationship with an older woman that starts off as a rocker then changes to a ballad in the middle. What the hell am I blabbering about here? You have to hear those songs and others on the record yourself! Get this album NOW!!!
6304711905|5.0|For the reviewer who stated that there are chick movies and guy movies and this is a *guy* movie, may I say, I'm a chick and Tombstone is one of my favorite movies.<br />The excellent casting makes this film, and Val Kilmer stands out as the strongest attraction with his depth of range in his handling of the role of the complicated Doc Holiday. His work with the Doc role somewhat reminds me of the great work Marlon Brando did as the regulator in The Missouri Breaks ( another favorite). Anyone who likes westerns should add this to their DVD collection, it will prove to be a timeless classic as the years go by.

B000AU9UYM|5.0|The first overall reason is because this film goes out of its way to get the Batman story right and fully explain it, whereas all of the other pictures were just interested in the commercial potential of it.  Everyone in this film feel different than the feel of the other films, but that's OK since it's a different director and he's a very good director, so I don't mind the odd role that I don't connect with that much.  It's an all around solid film, something that couldn't be said of Burton's pictures while they were immensely entertaining on the outside layer.

I finally got around to it and am sorry that it took so long to finally do this.  The books are excellent.  Each are well written and flow right into the next.  Some people have told me they felt the third book was the weakest in the series, but I disagree.  To me they were all equally strong.  Each book flows excellently into the next.  Mr. Pullman crafted a fine epic tale.

0684824906|5.0|This book was a fantastic read.  Despite its length, it kept me engaged and it presented the characters in a way that left you constantly curious to see what happened next.  It's a great addition to Lincoln scholarship and an angle that even seasoned Lincoln readers will love.  My only criticism and its a minor one is that I don't think Goodwin explored Lincoln's faith.  She draws certain conclusions about his belief system that don't square with his own statements or those of his pastor, Phineas Gurley.  Having said that, it's difficult to get in the head of anyone's belief system, but her conclusions seem to be drawn from a lack of understanding of Lincoln's distinction between faith and religion.  Still, this was not a barrier to the work or a lack of scholarship.  Her work reignited a personal interest in related works about Lincoln's life.  I have a whole new appreciation for William Seward and for Doris Goodwin as a historian.  Great job!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I've been a Star Trek fan all of my life. I had never heard of the Firefly series due to an almost non-existent promotional campaign. A friend of mine in Australia bought the series for me. He told me in detail what happened with the show. I was skeptical when I first watched it. There is really very little GOOD sci-fi out there. <br />  By the end of the short series, I was in tears. I have never cried over a television show. The pulling of this show has to be one of the biggest blunders in network history ! It would have outdone and outlasted Star Trek. The realism and the humor are brilliant. The cast could not have been more perfect. <br />  My friend consoled me with the fact there was a movie \\"Serenity\\" soon to be released on DVD. The promotion for the movie was so lacking I never even knew it was in the theatres. I'd never heard of it. I purchased the DVD as soon as it came out. <br />  They had a very small budget to work with in making this movie. What they did with that budget is nothing short of miraculous. It is so very rare when every part of a movie is good. The story, plot, characters, actors, and special effects are all simply amazing. <br />  I heard today that the movie is now \\"out of the red\\" and making money through DVD sales. I have purchased the Firefly series for friends and will do the same with Serenity. The more people know about it, the more will get hooked and perhaps our influence can sway Universal to do another movie before the cast is old and grey. I heard NBC bought the rights to a 3 movie deal. That would be smart if they actually do it. It would be smarter yet to re-instate the original Firefly series. If they really want to show their IQ's, they will advertise it WELL. Firefly/Serenity beats Star Trek hands down, my condolences to Gene Roddenbury, but this is better. Never thought I'd say that. The big companies have a cult hit on their hands that could make them money for the next 40 years if they play it right. How they have handled it so far is a travesty. <br />  Buy Serenity ! Buy Firefly ! Send the only message the networks and movie companies understand...money. This show is worth it. You will not be disappointed ! Let's show them we want Firefly/Serenity back in any format ! If you are digusted with the poor entertainment on television and at the theatre, you need to speak out. This is intelligent entertainment at it's best !

0891416811|5.0|Author Donald R. Burgett jumped into Normandy on D-Day with the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment. \\"Currahee\\" is his well-written account of that experience and the training that prepared him for that day. The 506th is the regiment made famous more recently by Steven Ambrose's book \\"Band of Brothers\\" and the HBO miniseries of the same name.<br /><br />Burgett's account is honest, detailed, and graphic.  The tough training at Fort Benning that turned a 18 year old into a young infantryman, and the even tougher training that made him into a paratrooper of the 506th is thoroughly described.  The jump into Normandy and the confused small unit fighting that followed is the core of the book, and told from the hedgerow and foxhole level.  Burgett's account emphasizes the extraordinary initiative and courage shown by the paratroopers, who, despite being badly scattered in their drops, proceeded to execute their missions with the troops and weapons at hand.<br /><br />This book is highly recommended to students of the Second World War and to the heirs of the Airborne Tradition.  Currahee!

B000E6UK5K|2.0|this was the sum of a recent qoute i recently read from Mr. Gilmour.  I have been a huge fan of Pink Floyd and thier solo efforts.  I feel that Mr Gilmour made this album to solely please himself.  His guitar stands out through out the album and remains true to his style.  I feel this was so over produced.  his voice sounds as if it is piped through a number of effects which give it an out of place sound. <br /> <br />Mr. gilmour stated that he owed no one.  i disagree, Mr. gilmour you owe us the fans that have made you who u are today.  We have been with u from the beginning and have supported you.  We have bought your music time and time again.  by us staying loyal we have allowed you the freedom of creating what you like.  it is us the fans that you should be thanking not thrashing.   <br /> <br />With this album and comments i have knocked you down a notch in my book.  I had considered spending hundreds of dollars to travel to LA to see you in april but i must reconsider.  please give us another Floyd album and go in a different direction.   <br /> <br />the album can be tollerated but it is a lackluster attempt.  lets all hope that Waters stays true to his style in 07 with his new album. <br /> <br />

B000E6UK5K|5.0|David Gilmour for those who don't know is Pink Floyd's guitarist and vocalist. On an Island is a fantastic record. Before the review goesw on, the reviewer Mad Max needs to have his ears checked(chuckles). His review plagarized from Entertainment Weekly a magazine that kisses that loser Madonut and that tramp Bratney Sneers' buttocks. How can you say The Blue and Take a Breath, On an Island and Where We Start is trash. Those songs are superb. This is not a Pink Floyd record but a solo record and so what if the wife wrote most lyrics, David has said he can't write lyrics well. I say buy now!
0761119752|5.0|My daughter absolutely loves these books.  Because they are so accurate with the pictures she can even know the words.  They are bright and colourful as well.
0783219695|4.0|Director:  Ron Howard <br />Cast:  Tom Hanks, Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, Kathleen Quinlan, Mary Kate Schellhardt, Emily Ann Lloyd, Miko Hughes, Max Elliot Slade. <br />Running Time:  140 minutes <br />Rated PG for language and emotional intensity. <br /> <br />Director Ron Howard's emotionally draining \\"Apollo 13\\" surrounds the near-disaster which surrounded NASA's Ill-fated 3rd Mission to the moon. After two landings on the moon the missions had become almost commonplace and public interest in the space program was beginning to wane. This changed at 03:06 UT on 14 April 1970 when a malfunction in a heating coil caused an oxygen tank to explode, severely damaging the service module. The damage was so extensive that it forced the abandonment of the moon-landing and the severely compromised the ability of Astronauts Captain James Lovell (Tom Hanks), John L Swigert (Bill Paxton) and Fred Haise (Kevin Bacon) to return home, a task they were able to accomplish only by jury-rigging their available equipment under the direction of Houston and suffering cold temperatures before they were able to successfully renter the Earths atmosphere in their spacecraft.  Using computer graphics, the infamous \\"Vomit Comet\\", and realistic sets, this movie conveys what it was like aboard an Apollo spacecraft. The liftoff is breathtaking, with multiple views of the size and grandeur of the Saturn V rocket. Inside the spacecraft one sees the benefits (and drawbacks) of weightlessness. There's even a simulator in which the astronauts train for maneuvers they must perform during the mission. The movie is a \\"behind-the-scenes\\" look at the NASA space program in the 1960's and 1970's, giving all those not present at the time an idea of what it must have been like.   <br /> <br />Tom Hanks makes for a very effective choice as Jim Lovell. The way he tries to keep up the spirits of his crew while trying to mastermind the success of getting back to Earth is tremendously entertaining. His best scene is when they are going past the Moon, and can't land on it. Haise and Swigert are by the windows craning to get a good look, but Jim prefers to use his imagination. His sadness is profound and moving.  Bill Paxton and Kevin Bacon also put in some stellar support, especially the scene where they start arguing with each other about whose fault it is why the oxygen tank exploded. You could sometimes cut the tension of those scenes with a knife.  Back on Earth, we have Gary Sinise as Ken Mattingly, Ed Harris as Gene Kranz, and Kathleen Quinlan as Marilyn Lovell. Ken has to work around the clock putting together a procedure that will enable the space shuttle to reenter the Earth's atmosphere.  Ed Harris is almost pitch perfect as Gene Kranz and was robbed of a Best-Supporting Actor Oscar.  Although some of his lines of dialogue are very \\"all American\\", he is still very rousing as the head of Mission Control.  Kathleen Quinlan is a talented actress to be sure, but she doesn't get a great deal to do in this film. All she can do is watch and wait for her husband's shuttle to return home. She still gives it all she's got, and it would be hard to imagine the film without her.  Director Howard has assembled a superb ensemble cast, and has a decent script to work from. Everybody should know the basic story by now but this fact is impressively never allowed to destroy dramatic tension. No one with any sense would label Howard an auteur, and this works well for \\"Apollo 13\\" because it allows us to concentrate on the individuals in front of the camera rather than the guy behind it.  The moods in this picture are impressively judged, the historic build up (which admittedly does drag slightly), the perilous middle and the triumphant end. The effects are superb, but they aren't the only thing here, making this a true blockbuster with soul.  A true Hollywood feel-good production and one of the better films of the year.

B000E6UK5K|4.0|I am 51 years old, who has always been a big Pink Floyd fan.  From my point of view,  I really love the first 2/3 of this CD. My first impression was \\"this is awesome\\". Its like hearing Pink Floyd's newest album.  Remember though, its not Hard Rock, but more like \\"Soft Rock Floyd\\". It contains the same electronic sounds and great electric guitar sounds that we have enjoyed though the years. But it moves to an almost \\"New age\\" easy listening album on the last two or three songs. I didnt really care for the latter few songs.  If you are a Floyd fan, I would highly suggest buying this. Its like Pink Floyd again. Just beware that it does mellow out on the last 1/3.  Its like what's really happening to all of us as we get 50 and 60. We mellow out some.

B0000019HU|5.0|I'll be the third to reinforce the idea that you really have to let this CD grow on you.  I first heard of this band through the \\"Kids\\" soundtrack.  \\"Good Morning Captian\\" was the last song on the CD and I loved The Folk Implosion, who put that soundtrack together and I figured if they liked Slint I would to so I got Spiderland.  At first I blew it off as boring but then came back to it knowing something was there.  Then the genius of it struck me.  I have to be in the right mood but I always come back to it and out of my collection of over 400 CD's, Spiderland stays in my 100 CD changer 80% of the time. <br /> <br />This album will reward any fan of rock music that is earth-shatteringly original.  Creepy and intense without being loud or aggresive.  Trust me it gets it's hooks into you.  I'm glad these guys didn't have a 15-year career, true greatness only happens once in a while and rather than kind of enjoy 9 more mediocre records I can give all my time to Spiderland.

B00012FXAE|3.0|There's fun to be had in \\"Aliens,\\" but that's about it.  It's too insubstantial to stay with you.  For all its critical raves, it's really just standard Hollywood action/sci-fi fare, albeit one without much tension.  the magnificent beasts that unsettled you in Ridley Scott's 1979 original have been stripped of their mystery, their power to scare; only the queen (one of the all-time great creature effects, even by today's standards) has the ability to widen your eyes.  She's a beast that's stepped out of your darkest nightmares.  When Ripley first encounters her in her lair, the movie finally rallies it's ability to chill.  Until then, though, the movie plods along with banal action sequences and uninspired dialogue between the various faceless characters (who are mainly there to be eaten).  Only Weaver makes an impression, pumping up what little character she's been given through the sheer force of her acting.  She shows you that her survival is no accident: she possesses an inner strength that the others do not.  But movie has short-changed her, leaving revealing scenes about her character on the cutting room floor.  In the final film she only serves as a part of the story.  She's a cog in a machine.  Like any machine, this movie has no capacity for feeling.
B0000DIJO2|5.0|Outstanding concert performance, which contains all of the Bee Gee's top hits, including Grease Sound Track !!!! <br /> <br />A must for any DVD concert collector.
B00012FXAE|5.0|I absolutley loved Ridley Scott's 1979 classic \\"Alien\\", and hoped I'd love fellow cinematic genius James Cameron's 1986 sequel \\"Aliens\\" just as much. After all, the general consensus seems to be that \\"Aliens\\" is just as good, if not better, than \\"Alien\\". It turns that \\"Aliens\\" is indeed even better than the first one.<br /><br />The only survivor of her ill fated previous mission, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver in another powerhouse performance) has finally returned - after orbiting in space for nearly 60 years. She soons find out that everything she left behind when she left is long gone - her family, her friends, everything. When no one believes her when she tells her colleagues what went wrong on the last mission, Ripley is stripped of her license and feels as if she has nothing to live for. However, when a ship exploring the same uncharted planet where her last mission went horribly wrong, several of its colonists go missing, and Ripley is forced by the seemingly compassionate Burke (Paul Reiser) to return to space and find out what is wrong. She comes aboard to find she is working not with the skilled, intelligent crew of the Nostromo, bt with a group of slovenly marines with little sense of intelligence, dignity or compassion. However, Ripley is able to find a companion in the tough yet compassionate Duane Hicks (frequent Cameron cohort Michael Beihn, aka Kyle Reese from \\"The Terminator\\"). It is soon discovered that Ripley was right about their being life on these lands, but this time the beast is far greater than what she faced previously. She also become emotionally attached with Newt (Carrie Henn), a seven year old girl whose family has been devoured by the aliens. Blessed with the same courage and vulnerability as Ripley, the two form a bond that shows Ripley's soft side, and also shows how much of a badass she can be (the scene in which the alien is about to devour Newt when Ripley comes out in the steel body suit and bellows, \\"get away from her, you b*tch\\" has since become a classic).<br /><br />I still absolutley love \\"Alien\\", but \\"Aliens\\" is by far my favorite of the two. With more chills, thrills and suspense than the first one, \\"Aliens\\" is a film you can never get sick of watching. THis collector's edition, loaded with tons of bonus features, belongs in your collection.tch\\" has since become a classic). <br /> <br />I still absolutley love \\"Alien\\", but \\"Aliens\\" is by far my favorite of the two.

B000BT97AO|4.0|I'm a fan of Mr. Gaiman's. I think he's got a terrific imagination and the writing chops to do those ideas justice. That's why I had such immense hopes for MIRRORMASK.<br /><br />I'm a bit disappointed.<br /><br />If you read some of the reviews here, you know the story: Artistic, cute girl in conflict with parents (who own and work in a funky little circus), finds herself in an alternate (dream?) world threatned by a dark and devouring menace. She also happens to resemble (a lot) a princess of this world. With the help of a humorous, if cowardly, ally, she seeks a way back home and the object that will help the stricken queen of that world, who looks just like her mum.<br /><br />If you've read the other reviews, you notice there's a pattern in responses. It's good to notice this pattern, because it's a clue that will tell you where you may end up on the \\"love it\\" or \\"huh?\\" spectrum. Here's the pattern: The five star gushfests, full of glowing delight at all things Mirrormasky versus the ones that say something is lacking in the story, but hey, cool for the eyes and ears.<br /><br />I fall into the latter camp. Lacking, but cool.<br /><br />I couldn't ask for more delicious visuals. What artistry! The moodiness. The magic. The surrealistic feast of it. I can't praise it highly enough.<br /><br />The jazz music that weaves throughout is also exceptionally pleasing. Even the very strange--but oddly \\"right\\" and enjoyable-version of \\"Close to You\\" works. Kudos to whoever put the music together.<br /><br />Of course, there are those imaginative moments in a queer dream world one comes to expect from the author of the SANDMAN comics and the down-the-sewer-hole quest of NEVERWHERE (Clearly, Mr. Gaiman is intrigued by dreamworlds and quests for keys and doorways.) Books fly off to the library when they feel rejected. Boulder creatures with a hint of Botero playfulness and roundness float about, and we can't figure out why, but it makes a queer sort of sense that they do. Fairy tale and mythic elements make their appearance--the twin queens or dark and light, the sleeping beauty, the Shadows, the dark, the tower, the riddles from sphinxes, the masks. (Only these sphinxes and masks both manage to be amusing and threatening simultaneously, also something that seems a Gaiman trademark.) Playful, very British, bits of dialogue show up.<br /><br />And yet I was not at all emotionally engaged about the conflict. I didn't much care for the young heroine at a gut level. Aesthetically, yes. I was captured. I even laughed in various bits. (Gosh, I adored those albino ape-meets-silly-bird things called Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob,e tc, and Malcolm.) But I did't really care if Helena got out of the Mirror World or not. I didn't feel invested or touched where I should have been given her circumstance: in my heart.<br /><br />If you can sit back and revel in a nifty jazzy score and chomp from a brimming cornucopia of visual yumyummies, then you really should see this(rented or purchased). Oh, yes. Sometimes, having two senses supremely satisfied will do, especially when so much out there doesn't supply wonder and magic for one, single, yearning sense.<br /><br />Mir<br />(...)the twin queens or dark and light, the sleeping beauty, the Shadows, the dark, the tower, the riddles from sphinxes, the masks.

B000E6UK5K|3.0|I bought this CD on the basis of the short video on the Amazon site. The guitar work sounded like good ol' David. The orchestral arrangements, guest artists and harmonies made it sound very pleasing. I thought maybe it was going to be a revisitation of \\"Wish you were Here\\". it is and it isn't. If anything, much of this CD has the atmospheric feel of songs on Meddle, particularly \\"Cirrus Minor \\"and \\"Pillow of Winds\\".     The super guitar parts are on the opening cut and are very similar to WYWH,Terminal Frost and \\"Signs of Life\\". The first song, with Crosby and Nash, is just gorgeous. Sounds more like a Crosby song than a Gilmour song.    I read the lyrics before I played the CD, and was reeally looking forward to \\"This heaven\\". I was rather disappointed. The bluesy jam just doesn't go withthe words. One of the rare cases where David has missed something. Maybe it will grow on me. It is obvious that he has changed a great deal in the last 10-15 years. Mellowed, settled down, enjoying being a father, and so on.If you have seen the Gilmour in Concert DVD, which I received atthe same time, it makes sense. He seems to be into more acoustic  stuff,and is a great acoustic player, and is enjoying a softer side of the Floyd material, plus all his new material, much of it co-writen with Polly Samson,his wife .Her input really does lend a wonderful and often upbeat feeling to the lyrics.     Most of the songs are about their relationship, and address issues that are pretty universal, and also simply describe peaceful times, which is quite a departure from the hard-core Floyd days. I have mixed feelings about this CD, and hope that after another 20 hearings I will upgrade my rating, just because I think David Gilmour is so great, even if his voice isn't. But, his guitar work is beginning to sound repetitive, I am sorry to say. Maybe I have been listening to Porcupine Tree too much (not that such a thing is possible).
B000002JR8|4.0|This is a damn good CD people, if you enjoy music that is heavy as hell, and has enough energy to power a small village in Africa then check this CD.  In my opinion 5 Minutes Alone is the best song on here.  And by the way Mr. Nick Omans, Pantera is not death metal, so before you start talking a load of bollocks about music that you cannot understand, get your damn facts.  Another thing is, Avenged Sevenfold is really bad music (to me) so as you can plainly see musical tastes are all just matters of opinion, so just try to accept that.  I have to say that a lot of Pantera's stuff is not that good, but if you give it a chance there are certain songs on here that are just pure energy, and that's what music is all about. So stick that in your goddamn pipe and smoke it!  I just want you to know that I am very dissappointed in you Nick, and I think that before you can accurately review anything I think that you need to mature and have a more open mind to the glorious world of music, for Nick, where would we be without it.  Maybe you just don't see the true beauty of it all as it is intertwined with our being and our existence.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I'm a huge fan of all BBC productions, particularly the Pride & Prejudice miniseries starring Colin Firth. He's one of my favorite Brits, and I'm quite an Anglophile. However, the miniseries is a six-hour event, and while there are some occasions which allow me that much time, this new version is much easier to handle in one sitting. It touches on all the highest points of the story, and displays a terrific chemistry between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett. In two hours, the viewer is transported to Regency England, with all the gorgeous scenery and beautiful music, where two most favored literary characters fall in love. The direction and cinematography is also much cleaner than the BBC's production, so I enjoy this version for that aspect as well. All in all, whenever I'm craving a delicious story and a unique romance, this is a terrific alternative to the six-hour miniseries. Having said that, if you haven't seen the BBC version, it's essential that you do!
B00005JKG9|5.0|You wont understand much of it otherwise. There's a 10 minute scene with Alec Baldwin (his only appreance in the film) that I used to show my sales crew in my own business. All tongue and cheek but sort of not. Alec gives one of the best manager ass-chewings I've ever seen on film or real life. Its dark and dank throughout the whole movie. But not in a depressing way really. It also sets a record of sorts for how many times the \\"f\\" word is said. It's real world.  Jack Lemmon plays the not-quite-burnt out gray beard looking for one last home run. Al Pacino was totally, completly slick. You want to buy somthing from him but you can't because its a movie.. He's that good. Kevin Spacy is the whipping post beat on office manager and Ed Harris is just plain pissed at the world thru the whole flick.One of those \\"its everybodys elses fault\\" type roles.  But to fully take in and absorb G.G.G.R, a serious street sales background will bring this first rate production right into your head. EG; You'll \\"get it\\".  By the way, if you prefer certain movies that have NO female cast members anywhere, here's your movie. Not one. (Actually a waitress in a restaraunt makes a 2 second showing but that's it) Yes, Its a kind of guy flick but in an office setting and nothing blows up and no guns. Action packed however, except with suits and ties.
B000028U0Y|5.0|This album has been around for years and if others owners are like me, it was full of crackles and pops from replaying so many times. Now that vinyl can be replaced by an improved sound and complete recording of the whole concert. I didn't realise that the complete concert was even recorded but here it is and more enjoyable for this. Now that we are more aware of his personal problems or demons and that he was prone to occasional basic language this recording makes more sense. Although I purchased it, and San Quentin, separately I now see you can get both for the price of one! Excellent value.
B000000Y1H|5.0|This is a fantastic monk recording, because there is so much soul in the tracks.  Monk's unorthodox style is interpreted well by all the other players as is immediately evident on the first track.  The tempo shifts continually and the song takes on a completely eccentric life of its own.  Rollin's sax solo about 4 minutes into the track has a playful, whimsical, blues feel and roache's drum play is among the best i have ever heard on any jazz track, the way he shifts tempo during his solo is wonderfully energizing.  The intros and exits to both the first two tracks will hang in your head for the rest of the day.  Henry and rollins simultaneous play during these periods suggests a light-hearted, take-it-as-it-comes approach to life.  The bass solos are equally playful, like the one on \\"Ba-lue...\\"  From head to toe the musicians surrounding monk do a fantastic job assuming his style and create a recording that is the epitome of monk.   <br /> <br />     As far as monk's play, i am partial to his solo about 4 and 1/2 minutes into track two.  It sums up the feel of the entire album: cool, playful and confident. Monk's choice of celeste-play on \\"pannonica\\" is another deviation from tradition that hangs a mystical mood around a somewhat earthy track that couldn't be done without it.  I am also a big fan of monk's classical style and track four is rich and romantic.   <br /> <br />     This disc is a wonderful way of looking at the world that has never been done quite the same.  It is an optimistic recording that you will leave in a good mood after hearing it...every time.  \\"Brilliant corners\\" is one of those recordings that makes you thank fate that monk and the all-star cast that joined him created it and you happened to hear it after the session became history.
B000060MWU|1.0|First off...be aware.  Even though it isn't stated anywhere explicitly on the page, this item is PAN & SCAN.  That's what an aspect ratio of 1.33/1 means.  I missed that.<br /><br />Second, the print is total crap.  It's completely grainy, and it looks like it was transferred from VHS.  Stay away and look for another version of this DVD.
B000BNI90O|5.0|I'm surprised that no one has mentioned this. The last bit of music you hear at the end of the fan club credits on the FOTR extended dvd is NOT on this CD box set. It's an alternate version of \\"The Breaking of the Fellowship\\" track that is more emotional and more joyous. Don't get me wrong, this box set is worth every penny. I just wish that this one track would be part of the set.
B000008GEF|3.0|None of George's work can compare to his All Things Must Pass or even his Cloud 9 album. This one is definetly still worth buying though! Anyone who has enjoyed his work in the Beatles and enjoy his Solo work are sure to enjoy this one. There are one or two weak songs, but overall a good piece of work. Give Me Love being one of my favorite songs of all time. Anyone who is a George fan should definetly buy this album! Anyone who doesn't have any of George's solo work definetly start with All Things Must Pass (A very nice, somewhat acoustic, really beutiful work of art) or his Cloud 9 (A more rockier newer feel to it). But how can you go wrong with George Harrison?
B00006AG5N|4.0|The whole CD is good, then for some strange reason they tacked on a bonus song I had never heard before by Elvis that is very different than the songs on the CD. It ruins the CD...you have to run and grab it before it comes to the bonus song. Of course, music being good or bad is in the ears of the listener.
B000CBSHK2|4.0|WOW. It's really special to feel like you're experiencing the evolution and growth of an artist along with them. Beth Orton is so stripped-down, uncovered and real (at all times, not just this CD) that I feel like I'm taking up space on this planet. As noted by earlier reviews, this CD takes a few listens to absorb into your system. But when it does, you are there. It's stripped down, earthy and even has a lit grit in - like it was just picked fresh from a garden. The songs individually are excellent, but fit together even better. Where to start? I'm not sure. Personal tastes are just that. I think I love each and every song in its own way. Special to me are Shadow of a Doubt, (Heart) of Soul, Heartland Truckstop, Shopping Trolley and A Place Aside. I just can't choose one. Thanks to Jim O'Rourke for helping bring out this new twist on Beth. It adds great flavor to the drink of life.
B000ETRCMQ|5.0|\\"Transamerica\\" was easily the best film I have seen in months, and, furthermore, having just seen \\"Walk the Line\\" this week, I can say without any hesitation that the fact that Reese Witherspoon (who I loved in her role, as well) won the Oscar over Felicity Huffman is just wrong. Reese was adorable as June Carter, but Felicity Huffman's transformation in this film is astounding--the way she carries herself, the way she speaks, the subtle ways in which Bree becomes more and more comfortable in her body as the film progresses...it was a revelatory performance. There was not one moment where I didn't fully believe that she was a woman who used to look like a man learning how to be a woman in her new body. And she makes Bree so relatable, which is an enormous accomplishment considering transsexuality is a topic that makes so many people uncomfortable.  <br /> <br />I'm not even going to get into complaining that this should have been nominated (and won) for Best Picture as well, because, really, what's the point? But suffice it to say, it was brilliant, and also restrained. Although I am a fan of indie films, many of them do tend to have a pretentious streak, and this one did not. It was heartfelt, honest, funny, painful at times, and also short. Too short, in fact. I wanted to stay with these characters much longer. Btw, Kevin Zegers, who played her newfound son, gave a fantastic performance as well. It takes a great deal of talent to be paired with an actress of Felicity Huffman's skill and to not come across as inferior by comparison. He deserves just as much acclaim as she received. Even the screenplay was underrated. Many critics praised Huffman but denigrated the bulk of the film itself, and I could not disagree more with that, either. It's just a shame when such a great work at this is so completely unappreciated.
B00023B1AS|5.0|I am a ZZ Top fanatic of course I am going to like this.
0124297854|5.0|Let me preface this review with: I have a huge library of chemistry related books, of which books relating to name reactions has a prominent footprint. With that said, this is one of the most readable of its kind. Before this, I enjoyed the Jie-Jack Li name reaction book. However, as with all of them, it was just a reference manual. Kurti's, however, is a well thought out \\"text\\" with background on each reaction and color coded mechanisms. It is an excellent book for both beginners and PI's. Sick as it may sound, I actually purchsed a second copy for home as well as the office. My conclusion is that this is one of maybe 3 name reaction books that make a complete reference set.
B00097A5HW|1.0|This CD truthfully makes me dizzy!! Shakira lost all her talent by singing these dumb, bad songs. After her \\"Laundry Service\\" album, I thought she would do something even better, but she certainly did something even worse. Songs like \\"No\\" and \\"La Tortura\\" really make me sick, and I really haven't ever heard any of those completely. She totally lost \\"it\\" with her manly voice, added to stupid lyrics and bad and boring music.
B000957O82|1.0|Casting Will Smith's love interest in \\"Hitch\\" was not a simple black or white decision.<br /><br />Eva Mendes was given the role opposite Smith because the moviemakers were worried about the public's reaction if the part was given to a white or an African American actress.<br /><br />It was feared that a black couple would have put off worldwide audiences whereas a white/African American combo would have offended viewers in the U.S.<br /><br />Despite this, the movie offends Whites in other ways, by asserting stereotypes of Whites as fat nerds and Blacks as cool and sexy. Alongside the 'cool' Liberal - Clooney, Pitt, Gyllenhall, etc. - the pudgy, inadequate accountant played by Kevin James in the movie, is the default White character presented by Hollywood these days.<br /><br />For this reason I have no alternative but to regard this as much a racist film as Al Jolson 'blacking' up for a minstrel show in the \\"Jazz Singer.\\"
B000068IEU|4.0|Firstly, in response to a comment made by \\"Dudley\\", did you miss the entire second half of the film?  <br /> <br />*spoiler* <br /> <br />The killers are hunted down and brutally murdered for what they had done. That doesn't seem to be to be positive incentive to anyone who sees this movie and decides that they want to rape some teenage girls <br /> <br />*end spoilers* <br /> <br />This movie, to be completely honest, terrified me. The juxtaposition between the comedy, and the semi-happy go lucky music to served to make the scenes of graphic violence all the more unsettling. A good, recent movie to compare this to would have to be Rob Zombie's \\"The Devil's Rejects\\". The essential formula is the same, although the plot is quite a bit difference. It still has a very surreal feel to it. <br /> <br />Also, the people who bash this movie for poor film/sound quality, most movies in the 70's produced with such a low budget looked and sounded very much like this. You shouldn't really judge a movie based on the fact that technology of the time wasn't up to par with all the CGI and digital film of today, that's just not fair. <br /> <br />Anyway, if crimes against women are terrifying to you, then this movie will stick in your head for a long, long time.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Avril or is it Anvil Laveen Lavigne whatever the dumbkuff is called is the worst thing to come out of Canada pallies. This poseur is as fake as a $3 bill. If she is punk then beethoven is speed metal. Songs like My Happy Ending, Don't Tell Me and Nobody's Home are as bad as tooth decay and listening to this album can lead to diabetes. Her and them Sum 41 fools are the worst Canada has to offer. If you want great Canadian music, buy Rush or triumph or HEEGOTCHA!!!
0679777547|5.0|This book creates suspense around an unlikely crossroads of comedy, antique book dealing, Alexander Dumas, and, well, evil. The protagonist (Corso) is a charmingly unlikable fellow whom the reader slowly  begins to respect. Think of him as Philip Marlowe moving in the more literate circles of Spain, and you're on the right track. This is top notch storytelling, and it is also very funny.<br /><br />(BTW, if you've seen the Johnny Depp film THE NINTH GATE, it doesn't disgrace itself in imparting the book's musty thrills, but it is a second-rate way to enjoy a first-rate tale.)
B000088E6D|5.0|i was not familiar with this artist.  a friend   said she thought i should give it a try.  one listen, and i was hooked.  i'm usually a country music fan, but this is something else.  try it, if you haven't.  he's wonderful.
B00097A5I6|5.0|Great CD. I love the songs. It's very different from previous Oasis CDs but that is what I love about Oasis.
B000BOH8XW|3.0|Ok...I could be really extensive about this subject,but it doesn't worth it: To be straight to the point you can listen \\"Don't Bother\\" her first single...A song really bored,weak but still catchy( the video isn't bad at all,anyway),the entire cd is full of strong sounds and smart lyrics, but shakira fails in her pronunciation and with all these bad english in her exceptional voice is a mistake.<br /><br />Somebody tell me How Does She Does to put a group of tracks and always makes big hits, but this time she wasted all these scent and did an album very simple.I won't lie u, \\"Costume Makes The Clown\\" \\"Animal City\\" and \\"The Day and The Time\\" are great but the rest of the tracklist( specially the balllads) are just good or mediocres songs. I hope her new \\"Single\\" for the re-edition of this album called \\"Hips Don't Lie\\" improve a bit all this new effort of Shakira to please the international market. ( Maybe she should includes more danceable songs as \\"Timor\\" and not just a group of pure rock songs plus a few slooow ballads wich at the end result really boring and repetitive to listen), Sorry, Shakira, but i'm a bit dissapointed and i bet i'm not the only one.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|Before I review this David Gilmour album, I have to tell Gargamel or what the last dumbkuff one-star reviewer was. On an Island is David Gilmour of Pink Floyd moving forward whilst The Rolling Stones' last record while good had many clunkers on it. On an Island is a great record. How can you say Rough Justice and so forth are better than Castellorizon, The Blue, Where We Start and so forth. A Bigger Bang was a bigger whimper but still was a good record but On an Island is the first flawless record in a long while by any classic rock artist. Buy or HEEGOTCHA!
B0000549B0|5.0|love this movie it is funny and sad all at the same time
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I watched this movie with a variety of my friends, first by myself, there were several times I cried, and several times I got up and sang. Then I watched it with my father, who is a true 60's baby boomer, he loved the opening song RENT, and the other rockers, but the whole plotline went over his head since he was in a differen't generation. Then I saw it with my grandparents who hated it, not to offend anyone, but my grandparents are old and from a differn't generation, a generation where the term 'colored' is perfectably acceptable in general soceity, so every time Collins (my personal favorite charecter) came on, they said, \\"ooh, theres the colored person\\" they hated it, my grandmother said that she thought that these people should at least learn a leasson, and I say, well, I think they have, I mean, its not Roger and Mark's fault that Benny broke his fault, and its not like everything's perfect, these people get punished for their bad decissions just like real people, infact, this is one of the only musicals that really emphasises on this. I mean one chareceter dies and another charecter probably won't make it 10 days after the end of the film if it were to continue, so its not happy, it IS uplifting.  <br />As someone who grew up in the ghettos of San Francisco in the late 80's, I was extremly lucky to dodge the AIDS epidemic when it was a death sentance, although I did live it, so I relate myself to Mark, who doesn't have AIDS, but symphasizes with those who do. In fact, just a week before I saw the stageplay for the first time (1999) my good friend was pronounced HIV+, so this hit me hard. <br />So my point is, to enjoy this, you really have to have grown up and lived the experience of the late 80's, it hits hardest if you can relate to it.
B0000542D2|5.0|It was Nov 1964. I was in 5th grade in Renton, WA.  I had heard of the Beatles because the girl I had a crush on really liked some guy named \\"Paul\\" who looked like a girl and was ENGLISH!!! I was a crewcut toy-gun army playing boy who didn't like what I saw as \\"sissies\\". The \\"cool kid\\" in our class invited a bunch of us to his birthday party and we all got driven down to the Renton theatre to see \\"Hard Day's Night\\". It changed my life forever. <br /> <br />In the theatre the girls were going crazy and having what seemed like \\"fits\\". I found later from some of the guys whose sisters were in the audience about the release the girls were having in the theatre. Meanwhile I was mesmerized by how \\"cool\\" these guys were and how their music made me feel. To this day I remember the scene like it was yesterday. I came out of that theatre and my world changed in an instant. <br /> <br />Within 2 months we had all grown our hair and picked up on the Liverpool slang. It was still a couple years before I got a record player and started to collect the LPs but this movie was a pivotol moment in so many lives.  <br /> <br />Honestly, I just love to see it again and the sound is \\"good enough\\". I guess I have heard these songs so many times in so many moments in my life that they are part of me and whatever may be missing, my brain just fills in. <br /> <br />I love this movie, will always love this movie, and will always love the Beatles for giving us that great, great, music....which was the soundtrack to my life.
B00005JLEU|5.0|My answer is yes. Other than Howl's Moving Castle, I've seen all of Miyazaki's films and I think this is not only his best, but the best I have seen. Forget about Disney/Pixar, if you want to see an animated film, this what you should be watching.

Procrastination, need I say more.<br /><br />Since reading it the first time I have purposed to read it again each month for a year, one chapter a day most days. I have done this now 7 times and it's a great daily reminder of good principles of managing my time purposefully. I have bought a copy for each of our 3 children and have included in in the 'Must Read' list in our corporate library.<br /><br />Don't miss this little Gem.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Final Fantasy VII is an incredible movie. This movie is just incredible in the visuals Department, often times u forget dat its not even real. The storyline gets confusing if u never even heard of the game or seen it but makes sense much later on. This movie takes place 2 years after da events of the final battle with Sephiroth in the game, so its important dat u play da game first. Anyway three clones were made out of Sephiroths DNA and they are trying 2 look for ther mother called \\"Jenova\\" meanwhile in another city there is a desease named after dat name which is infecting kids and killing them in the process. I am Not going to spoil the movie but the thing that u will se often is the amazing crazzzzzzy ass battle scenes which happens very often but the good thing about it is that they are all different so u will never know what u will expect. GET DIS MOVIE AS SOON AS IT COMES OUT!
B000BUYP4Q|5.0|looking for an excellent batman movie for your DVD collection? <br />look no further! BATMAN BEGINS is fantastic, sticks to the TRUE storytelling of how the caped crusader began, and how it should be. <br />ingenious in all areas of filmaking, except for katie holmes, this as well as batman returns with penguin and catwoman, are both batman dvd's to own. <br />christian bale, a fabulous actor anyway, never lets you down in his role. very well thought out, and acted. <br />he is charming, yet, deep down inside, still seeks revenge for the person who killed his parents. <br />less cartoony, much more realism, and sharply directed! <br />also, it explains how the batmobile and his costume came about. <br />IT ALL STARTS HERE!!!!!! GREAT MOVIE!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />
B00005JOFO|5.0|Hats off to director Ang Lee, screen writers Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, a brilliant ensemble cast and the superb technical crew that contributed to the making of one of the greatest American films of the past quarter century. Now that the recent, disgraceful Academy Awards ceremony is history, the legacy of \\"Brokeback Mountain' will begin to grow in the aftermath of unbelievable stupidity on the part of card-carrying A.M.P.A.S. members.<br /><br />\\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is too great a movie to be merely tagged with \\"The Academy Award Winning Best Picture\\" label, a distinction that carries less and less weight, it seems to me, with each passing year. The amount of detritus picked as \\"Best Picture\\" in Oscar's past is truly staggering, so in a way \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" has received a backhanded compliment from \\"The Academy\\". The film joins an impressive list of magnficant losers: \\"The Grapes Of Wrath\\", \\"Citizen Kane\\", \\"The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre\\", \\"A Place In The Sun\\", \\"High Noon\\", \\"Giant\\"....the list goes on and on.<br /><br />\\"Brokeback Mountain' did manage to win three well deserved Oscars. Ang Lee's direction is brilliant, bringing alive a 20 year saga with the resonance of an epic novel. McMurty and Ossana's adaptation of Annie Proulx's eloquent short story is a model of craft, enriching the original tale with embellishments to characters and plot only hinted at in the source material. Gustavo Santaollala's original music score adds further power to the proceedings with plaintive themes and melodies evoking love and loss in the big wide open spaces. Last but not least, Rodrigo Prieto's stunning cinematography (which lost to \\"Memoirs Of A Geisha\\") surrounds the viewer in a world both majestic (those picturesque mountain pastures) and mundane ( drab Texas towns and  weathered Wyoming ranches).<br /><br />There were other fine movies released in 2005. In fact, three of the Best Picture nominees from that year are likely to endure in the years to come. \\"Capote\\". \\"Good Night, and Good Luck\\" and \\"Munich\\" were superb films. However, \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" was far and away the most striking movie of 2005. Adding to its luster is Heath Ledger's performance as Ennis, which will go into the history books as one of the most affecting pieces of acting ever put on the screen., and Good Luck\\" and \\"Munich\\" were superb films.

0812975219|3.0|This book is a consolation prize for those who can't trade but who can still afford to buy a book. The author's definiton of that which is random is that which he does not understand. Assuming that he understands as much as any one sapient being possibly can, therefore much of life is random. And of course, more of life is random than many people think. But then, the limits of human knowledge are more restrictive than most recognize, bien sur! What to his dim and limited imagination is randomness may to someone else easily more intelligent than he appear as obvious as 2 + 2! Which, interestingly, may imply that randomness is  the limit of ones ability to understand. And that may be species specific. Randomness is subjective, not objective. I found the book very comforting because I could assuage my envy by salving myself with the thesis that those who are more successful are really dolts. Is it such a surprise that failures love his book more than the wealthy? I am an atheist, but I must point out that Mr. Calvin would feel comfortable in his refutaions on this subject. <br />I rate this three stars because it is at least one level worse than Mr. Goodman's Fact, Fiction and Forecast, which in turn is at least one turn worse than Montaigne's Of Husbanding Your Will.
B00000J2PH|4.0|Now don't get me wrong, Carole King has talent to spare as obvious in her 60s hits for girl and boy bands of the era. Her songwriting skills are brilliant. But somehow other early 1970s singer-songwriters are more appealing, like Carly Simon. Tapestry has some great tracks on it, though; \\"It's Too Late\\" is a superior song, as is \\"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow?\\" But her songwriting skills take over her rough-but-unique singing skills. Tapestry is a decent record, but \\"I Feel the Earth Move\\" is decent as well; but \\"You've Got a Friend\\" is Elton John to a t, and about as boring too (in MY opinion). This CD is good, don't get me wrong, folks--but it's far from the best.
0385512104|5.0|It is simple, and yet deep. It is hilarious and a little sad too.<br /><br />While the subject of autism touched many of us a decade ago through Dustin Hoffman in the movie \\"Rainman\\", autism is many faceted. As a medical condition, it is poorly understood; a fact that is brought home in the book. I was told that autistic individuals lack a sense of empathy. And yet the author, an autistic 15-year-old boy abounds with empathy! He says that he relates better to animals than to people, is frightened by loud sounds, especially by touch, is overwhelmed by specific kinds of speech and sensations, notices smells, colors, manners and appearances more than personal traits that may touch the rest of us. He takes in visual sensations more than verbal ones. And he picks out part of the world around us that I for one tend to miss. His little book enriched my life for this reason and many others. And my friends who read it had similar reactions.<br /><br />  Just like we are all unique, one should not expect that autism is a one-dimensional human condition. Autistic individuals are like you and me!<br /><br />  The book is autobiographical and yet it concerns us all. It is both poetic and poignant. It is suspenseful, but above all, this little book is different and truly original: A delight to read. I read it in a plane going south. A page turner! Couldn't put it down! While it is a mystery, or a detective story with suspense and surprising twists, it is also a sweet mix of deductive logic and emotional complexities. And my plane ride had two legs, so I read the book twice. When I returned home the next week, I checked amazon and found that it's a runaway bestseller.<br /><br />  The book is penned by a teen age boy who is autistic in some sense. He is mathematically gifted but socially helpless. To find out exactly how, read the book. And I won't give away the plot or the ending!<br /><br />The book is probably not meant to be hilarious, but perhaps this made it all the more fun. Actually, I never knew if I should laugh or cry!<br /><br />  Christopher Boone, the autistic 15-year-old narrator reveals that he is from a broken home. That is part of the story. He is uniquely observant and honest. Not because he is better than the rest of us, he says, but because he is unable to lie! At times his narrative reminded me of Albert Camus's \\"The Stranger\\". Christopher's uniquely honest narrative is helped by a photographic memory: He remembers spoken sentences to the letter!<br /><br />  Initially, I came across a review of it in a math journal. Why a math journal? It is believed that mathematicians are a bit crazy too. Aren't we all!? And that is perhaps why many of us can relate to it: We recognize a little of ourselves in it.

B00005JOFO|5.0|Hollywood comes up with an endless string of movies every year. Some are (involuntarily) funny, some are spectacular, some scary... However most of them are meaningless - expensive wrapping for zero content, characters by the book, tiny obstacles and the foreseeable happy ending. Only every once in a while does Hollywood give us a movie that lasts, a movie depicting fates that rock our world even outside the theatres. <br /> <br />Those stories happen to be romances mostly. And interestingly, the ones that touch us the most, are the ones that don't happen.  My list of all time favourite Hollywood couples: Rick and Ilsa, Karen von Blixen and Denys Finch Hatton and of course Rose and Jack - not one happy couple! I don't even want to know why that is... <br />Anyways, Hollywood just added another couple to that hall of fame. Their names - Enis and Jack - might not be as well known as their predecessors' yet, but they sure earned their place among them. <br /> <br />\\"Brokeback Mountain\\", better known as the \\"gay Western\\", is really a love story. The two cowboys Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist get teamed up for a summer job guarding sheep on Brokeback Mountain in 1963. Up there under a wide sky, they fall in love. Hesitating at first but then all the more violently. The end of the summer also seems to be the end of their romance. Both go back to their civil lives, get married, father children. But they meet again and again for two decades trying to cling to that long lost summer. As in all the great love stories they don't end up together. <br /> <br />So what was there about a \\"gay Western\\"? Actually, the intense performance by Ledger and Gyllenhaal makes you forget that this is a same sex relationship. The longing and pain they show are so immediate, they become universal. The spectator physically hurts.  <br />Rick and Ilsa couldn't be together for the good cause's sake, Ennis and Jack are separated by the conventions of a prude society. But despite all obstacles, the two cowboys share a few moments of happiness and thanks to Ang Lee's divine direction, we get to share them, too. So no matter what Hollywood comes up with next, we'll always have Brokeback Mountain.   <br />
B000E8QVWY|4.0|Alright, let's cut to the end of the page: there is literally nothing in this movie that we haven't seen before. In fact, it's pretty much the same thing as \\"Ray\\" from the previous year, only with more subdued and less hammy performances. This movie was meant to be Oscar bait, and Reese Witherspoon did indeed walk away with a statuette, so mission accomplished. That being said... <br /> <br />Walk the Line is the Johnny Cash biopic, and within the quite codified conventions of the biopic (especially musical biopic) genre, it is quite good, at times, even excellent. If you didn't see this movie in the theaters, you missed quite a show, because the musical numbers here are something that most home audio systems won't be able to replicate. The director, James Mangold, does an outstanding job of staging these sequences, and it is easy to see how Cash's music electrified listeners at the time. It even delivered a sizable jolt to me, and I generally dislike country music (most music, for that matter). Joaquin Phoenix and Witherspoon are magnificent on stage, I suppose that technically they are better singers than the performers they are playing. Since the music is one of the big draws, I figured I would comment separately on it and just say that this part is fantastically executed. <br /> <br />As for the rest of it...credit Mangold and his screenwriters for not folding in every musical biopic cliche into their movie. There's no Freudian back door that conveniently wraps up everything, as in \\"Ray\\", which was completely untrue as to Charles' problems in real life. There is a groaner when Witherspoon tells Cash, \\"You cain't walk no line,\\" after a drunken, drugged-up, all-night jam session with his band. Still, this is familiar territory for anyone who as seen a biopic or gets VH-1 on their TV. The execution is better than most, but people who come to watch a completely original story or want to find some sort of message will be disappointed. <br /> <br />Overall, this moviesucceeds at what it tries to be, and for that, I give it 4 stars. One gripe though: even though Reese Witherspoon's Oscar was deserved, just looking at the last couple of years' worth of Oscar wins shows a pattern that anyone who is not a \\"serious\\" actor that plays a pop culture celebrity and does a good impersonation seems to be a shoo-in for an Oscar. I guess Jim Carrey's only mistake wasn't that he wasn't as good as the guy that won, he just picked out the wrong role--maybe a biopic about the secret inner life of David Bowie would get him some gold? Seriously, imitation can win awards, but let's tone it down, before Jamie Foxx wins Oscar #2 for \\"Stevie\\". Bunz singing \\"Cherie Amor\\". God help us.
B0002XNT0I|5.0|Another movie with sniffling and Kleenex.  Tom Hanks, as I foresaw in \\"Big\\", is absolutely superb.  Another comic, like Robin Williams and Bill Murray, with marvelous depths.  And yet the movie is not really about a man with AIDS, as all the critics say it should be, and then berate it because it isn't; it's about society's reaction to gays and AIDS, a much broader subject.  On that scale, it delivers well.  We don't need detail scenes of Tom Hanks and his lover, or his facing the disease, or any other of the nitty-gritty the critics said was lacking.  I think they missed the point entirely.  Washington was society, and his slow progression from homophobia to understanding is what Demme is trying to say to the audience.  And, increasingly, I am thinking, we should be out there, living life, helping people, instead of watching them on a two-dimensional screen.  Maybe movies really distance us from life, instead of imparting more knowledge.

Knowing what areas you really are strong can help youu re-focus your energies for better results.  The Strngthsfinder inventory is easy to take and for me and most of my staff they have been very accurate.
B000002UAX|5.0|When this album first came out as a vinyl record--and even now as a CD--it was really creepy because it had no title on the cover, or was plastered with pictures like most record covers:  it was just white (hence the name), with \\"The Beatles\\" typed on it.  But what made that even freakier was that soon enough some radio DJ found out that if you played the record backward, there were the sounds of a hectic car crash, sirens, and then a deep, ominous voice saying the words, \\"I buried Paul today...\\" <br />  This is the album that sparked all the controversies about whether Paul was really dead and they were using a double to fill in for him, or not.  I think, even without this mystique, this CD is awesome and definitely worth listening to.

B000002L7Y|5.0|'Hunting High And Low' was released in '85. It was A-ha's first album and the only one to receive any attention in the U.S.A. Containing -10 tracks- of wonderfully original, upbeat new wave/synth-pop tunes I consider it to be one of those rare, absolutely perfect albums/CD's. Every track is unique and immensely enjoyable, complimented by the most amazing male voice (Morten Harkett) I've ever heard.<br /><br />An unbeatable collection; 'Take On Me', 'Hunting High And Low' and my personal favorite 'The Sun Always Shines On T.V. Definitely one of my All-Time Top Ten CD's!<br /><br />My Highest Recommendation!!
006056251X|5.0|I loved this latest edition of the Wallflowers series. They just keep getting better and better. I liked the characters and their very real development. It is nice how the author brings back the other characters from the previous books in a very real way that is totally believable. Who couldn't end up liking Sebastian and how he came to care so much for Evangeline. This is a keeper.
B00082IJ08|5.0|Honestly, I liked BLUR, but was never a huge fan.  Imagine my surprise when I learned that cool FEELGOOD, INC. song on the radio was sung by the same guy who sang Song 2!   <br /> <br />I never heard the first Gorillaz CD, so this was pretty new to me.  I heard FEELGOOD, INC. and came to Amazon to check out the rest of the songs.  I'll tell ya, that 30-second sample doesn't give enough evidence to how awesomely cool this CD is.  I mean, these songs are thought provoking and the melodies stick with you all day.  It's tough to sit through a business meeting with \\"Kids with Guns\\" running through your head, but the drive home is a blast with that blaring through the speakers! <br /> <br />The melodies on this CD range from the Beach Boys-ish \\"Don't Get Lost in Heaven\\" to sounding like The Doors on \\"Every Planet is Dead\\".  And Dennis Hopper telling about the town of Happy Folk?  Sheer brilliance.   <br /> <br />This isn't your typical trendy music CD.  Gorillaz provides a huge variety of style, something you can groove to, and perfect for the ride home or background noise at a party.  Can't wait to see what they do next!

B00005JOII|5.0|Don't pass up the chance to see this movie....Bored of the tennis circuit Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) tries his hand at teaching the wealthy how to improve their game. Enter Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode) the wealthy son of an English gentleman. Chis sees the advantage of engraciating himself to Tom, his sister and Tom's fiance Nola. The love triangle continues when Tom extricates himself from the delicious but dead end Nola giving Chris the chance to have Nola himself..there in lies the rub. If he chooses Nola then he will have the dazzling sensual Nola in his bed but he will be automatically thrown out of the wealthy Hewett circle and all that it entails..his plush new job, new apartment and new wife, Chloe Hewett.  When he contrives to have it all...things go wrong as we know they will and he is forced to choose... <br />This is a sleeper of a movie in that it is a rich character study one which would have served the audiance better had the rolls been reversed and the wonderful Matthew Goode had the lead roll as Chris Wilton.  Matthew's acting skills still show thru even though he is relagated to being the bored rich boy. Keep your eye on him.  His leading roll in \\"Chasing Liberty\\" in which he stole every scene he was in (and didn't receive the credit)  was only a prelude to better things to come for this very talented British actor.
B00006CXSS|4.0|This is a great colletion if you liked the movie Saving Private Ryan.  It certainly makes you appreciate what our veterans did for our country
B000E97X66|4.0|Great stuff! It was performed when they were at their peak. follow their first (and in my option, best 3 albums).  Bruce and the entire band are really strong.  The drum work is exhausting! <br /> <br />To my surprise, the sound quality is fantastic.  Only one very small dead spot that only lasts a split second.  The balance is perfect.  It's great to hear all of the material come from one show, done at a small venue.  It sound like there were only a couple of hundred people there that night.  If you're a fan, you've absolutely gotta get it!  If you're a old school, died in the wool Springsteen fan, it's a trip! <br />
B00005A3KS|4.0|Great guy movie!! a must see.  A little chessy but who cares!
B00097A5I6|4.0|For the Oasis fan, I think this album marks a triumphant return to form. Liam's sneer can be seen and heard in \\"Turn Up the Sun, a song that kicks you right in the teeth letting you know who's boss.  Mucky Fingers is a good song, albeit a complete ripoff of \\"Revolution Man\\" by the Velvet Underground.  Other highlights include \\"Lyla\\", \\"A Bell Will Ring\\" and the best Noel penned song since \\"Sad Song\\", \\"Part of the Queue\\".  The thing about Oasis that most American fans don't get is the fact that they're all about the music and nothing else.  They dwarf U2 as far as live shows, not having to use the high-tech screens and lightshow Bono & Co. have to use.  They are the last of the pure rock bands in that they don't use a soapbox and feel they have to preach to the masses.  When on their form, they are the best rock band going and this album proves it.  If you've never seen them live, buy this and then buy \\"Familiar to Millions\\" double disc.  They will also be releasing a live CD in the summer of 2006 for the \\"Don't Believe the Truth\\" tour.  This album backs up their swagger; don't miss it.
B00005JLR2|4.0|There's been many cinematic bombs over the years. Where it underperformed or just simply tanked and didn't even get close to meeting its budget, the film became one of 2 things: proof that audiences DO avoid bad films from time to time, or that it was simply mis-marketed and didn't reach the audience it should have. Treasure Planet I would say is the latter, a pretty good sci-fi tale that didn't see much box office. <br /> <br />Jim Hawkins is your care-free and wild teenager who gets into trouble and is sad about it but keeps doing it(kinda like me). However, someone crashes near his house and gives him a big golden ball: a map to the legendary treasure of Captain Flint, said to have pillaged treasure from a thousand worlds. He boards a ship with a steadfast captain, a socially awkward professor and an obvious threatening looking crew, in order to find the treasure. <br /> <br />One thing you can always expect from Disney is great animation and this film certainly has it. From the crescent moon shaped spaceport to an awesome scene involving a duel supernova/black hole, the film just looks great. The music's ok and we have a Tarzan idea repeated: have a singer do songs instead of the characters and this time we get Johnny Rzeznick(I don't know how it's spelled) of the Goo Goo Dolls which admittedly does some ok songs but they're completely out of place. <br /> <br />The film doesn't really have memorable characters except one: the captain Amelia which Emma Thompson voices, and I did like David Hyde Pearce as the professor. There's one character that is memorable but for the wrong reasons and that is the Jar Jar Binks of Disney: B.E.N, voiced by Martin Short. Just like Jar Jar singlehandedly ruined Episode I, B.E.N is just awful being irritating and useless. <br /> <br />Apparently the directors have been wanting to do this for a long time, but they had to do Aladdin and Hercules instead in order to prove themselves \\"bankable\\". It's odd though since we get a story that doesn't explain anything and characters aren't written that great. For instance, one character dies yet no emotional investment. And speaking of which, 18th century ships and architecture but characters can survive in wide open space? Fireballs hit the ship but characters can breathe? Um, ok. <br /> <br />Granted they are script problems but the visuals alone should at least warrant a rental. Whether you decide to buy it, I can't say.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|This movie is great.  It is quite possibly the funniest movie ever made!
B000059Z8J|5.0|What usually happens for me is that if I've been exposed for one particular stage of pop culture for a long period of time, everything else seems kind of \\"off\\". Take for instance old country music: my grandparents/parents love it but I can't stand it. So when you take Superman, in which I've watched the animated series and 5 1/2 seasons worth of Smallville, anything else might not have that same luster. Like when I see this Lex Luthor, I always instead imagine Michael Rosenbaum, or Dana Delany doing the voice for Lois Lane. However, it's still a great film that was before my time but came out at the perfect time. <br /> <br />In case you've been living on Mars in a deep hole with metal music in your headphones, the story of Superman is the last son of the planet Krypton who arrives on the planet Earth. Capable of incredible powers, he decides to fight for good and stand against those wanting to cause harm or rule the planet, either/or. And so it is with Superman the movie, the same basic story but just up on the big screen. <br /> <br />This is a 1970's film so some images look very outdated. Certain flying shots in particular have an obvious pasted look to them but that's ok, since 1) this is the 70's and 2) you just don't care. One fault I did find though: whether it was my DVD player, the film itself but one of the chapters got a little ugly(for me it was the pilots on Air Force One talking about Superman), it got a little pixel-y. However, considering it is an older film, it's quite something to see the film restored. <br /> <br />My favorite Lex is probably Clancy Brown from the Animated Series or Michael Rosenbaum from Smallville. Here, Gene Hackman does an admirable job but there wasn't much of a threat there, he just seemed there to give something important to Superman to do. Dana Delany and Erica Durance are probably the hottest Lois Lane's but Margot Kidder is good in the role. Believable without being damsel in distress throughout the whole thing. It's upfor debate whether Marlon Brandon earned his 3 million paycheck(some say 10) since he's only in here for under 10 minutes but oh well he looks good as Jor-El. It's funny seeing him mispronounce names though(it's Kryp-TON not Kryptin). <br /> <br />And of course we come down to the Man: Christopher Reeve. Largely unknown at the time(much like upcoming Brandon Routh in Superman Returns), he embodies the character, bumbling and nervous as Clark Kent and confident and likable as our main hero. He even makes a scene work when late in the film Superman does a silly time rewind but the anger he displays makes up for it. Even in the lackluster sequels he still brings his A game which is quite something. <br /> <br />Da da da DA da, da da da DA da....it's hard not to finish watching Superman and not hum the main theme. It gives the opening credits a nice big epic atmosphere even though the dumb names keep going! It felt like one of the longest opening credits I've ever seen, or at least that's how it felt but the opening theme as well as the rest of the film is especially great from John Williams in a rare non-Spielberg film score. <br /> <br />Personally I hate Warner snap cases and this film really should've been on a big 2 disc release instead of a flipper but oh well we get a great film and that's what matters in the end. Now let's see how the new one does.

B00000J7JH|5.0|Mule Variations opens with Big In Japan, a humorous number in bluesy style with brilliant guitar and innovative arrangement, which is followed by the slow, eerie Lowside Of The Road, a real hangover song with striking imagery.<br /><br />Hold On is a typical sad Waits ballad, which means it's beautiful, tuneful and moving. It has an unusually light rhythm and melody though, unlike some of his other masterpiece ballads like for example In The Neighbourhood or Saving All My Love For You. House Where Nobody Lives is unique too, another gripping ballad with moving words and images. It makes me think of both Mansion On The Hill by Springsteen and the old classic Satisfied Mind.<br /><br />All Waits' styles are in glorious display including the talking blues of Get Behind The Mule and the deep bluesrock of ballads like Come On Up To The House and Cold Water. For someone who prefers his ballads and his singing voice, I find both quite appealing. The next track, Pony, is another one of my favorite slow melodic numbers embellished with exquisite pump organ, dobro and harp.<br /><br />This album certainly lives up to its name with its astonishing variety, like the spooky spoken track What's He Building and the story songs Black Market Baby and Eyeball Kid with its innovative samples and percussion. Waits even explores his Beefheartian side on Filipino Box Spring Hog. There's also the gentle love song Picture In A Frame with its elegant piano and the sorrowful country song Georgia Lee.<br /><br />This import version contains two additional songs: Buzz Fledderjohn and Big Face Money, the second a very brief snippet. Mule Variations is a masterpiece of an album that contains impressive, timeless songs of great lyrical depth, melodic beauty and stylistic variety. Whether you like Waits as a phenomenon by himself or whether you like only certain of his styles, this album will not disappoint as it offers enough brilliance for everybody.
B000E6UK5K|1.0|I know that About Face wasn't going to top the charts, but it had so much more energy. This album is so unstimulating it's amazing I can stay awake at all. The only other thought that comes to mind while listening is that I'm is some cheezy smoke filled lounge w/ a mirror ball glinting slowly around the room. I'm disappointed
B000001F7E|5.0|If Rod Stewart had carried on in this vein, he would have been bigger than Elvis now and with his credibility intact, like Tom Waits and the Rolling Stones. These songs are real gems, from the hard rocking Maggie May, the stirring Reason To Believe and That's Alright to the more folky numbers like Tomorrow Is A Long Time, Seems Like A Long Time and the deliciously sad but uplifting Mandolin Wind. The music is moving and authentic, the lyrics are poetic and evocative and the melodies are beautiful. Maggie May/Reason To Believe was a double-sided single and one of the biggest hits of 1971 on both sides of the Atlantic. A perfect blend of superb material and passionate delivery make Every Picture Tells A Story a classic rock album and one of the very best albums of the 1970s.

B000002HK4|3.0|Dream Theatre, as they are known in Europe, were ripe when they recorded this one. So why did this one turn rotten? Maybe its the one song divided into seven parts thing that was the maggot in this crap pie. I know this was a good idea, back when Pink Floyd did it. But the Dream team ate it with this set of good time melodies. Anyone else that says different is a Vic Henley lover. For those not in the know, he is a comedian that sucks. See my Southern Gents of Comedy DVD review for more details, then see Danny, Lover of Copper, Gold, and Uranium discredit me in his scandalous review. Later, Peeps!
B000HBK3MM|5.0|A friend just came back from London and brought me a copy of this cd.  Although I`ve only been able to play it 4 times so far, I love the whole cd - thoroughly enjoyed every single track.  Not enough for me to name a favorite yet, but `Like A Star', `Till It Happens To You', `Put Your Records On', and ` I'd Like To' really stand out.  Then again, I could name all the tracks I like, but that wouldn't be picking a favorite would it.  Frankly, I don't know if I'll have a fave even after listening to the cd more, but maybe.  I look forward to seeing Ms. Bailey Rae when she gets over here.
0782008119|5.0|Very,VERY good stuff. I have been a fan of the (shall we say..)loud stuff for quite some time.Everybody gets a turn at bat.

I happen to like a lot of the bands that were on this tape(I am from NY BTW)The Posies needed to be grouped in there because they played with (and are friends with) Nirvana, which brings me to my next comment...If you don't like the sound--\\"FINE\\"-but when you are happy because someone is dead,you are a messed up person. If you like the Hollies,good for you. I like their stuff as well,but to wish death upon someone because you think the movie \\"sucks\\" is absolute rubbish.These bands kick ass on their own terms and did not ask to be filmed. I for one am happy they were.
B0009WFFS6|3.0|Ok Ok, I know Im going to hear this from everyone but all though I really admired the concert, seeing all 3 members on stage again, Claptons guitar has got to go!!!!!!! Im tired of hearing the same ole Clapton tone!! Clapton plays his Stratocaster the entire concert. Listening to Claptons guitar is like listening to Michael Bolton sind with his same ole same ole tone. Boooooring! The Cream from the olden days, Clapton played Gibson guitars. Now dont get me wrong and accuse me of working for Gibson, but if your going all out and having one of the greatest reunions of all time, why not use the same equipment you used back then?? Clapton didnt even use a crybaby that I recall!! Ok, for all you Jack Bruce fans, Jack was the highlight of the concert! Sounded just like him. Same with Mr. Baker. Personaly I enjoyed the Cream Farewell concert better as far as raw footage. Allthough the footage is not crisp and clear like the new one (and should it be ??) it has lots of energy!
1558216847|5.0|I read this book many years ago, and passed it around throughout our family and those who read it found it enjoyable and inspiring. Eventually it got lost, and no one of us could locate it, but in our conversations we referred to the story many times, and lamented our loss. Recently I was able to locate two copies and bought them (one for a backup to ensure against another loss. I reread the book with great enjoyment. It is the story of a handful of brave men who yearned to be free of their captive oppressors, and undertook a very difficult journey in order to secure that freedom. The journey itself is quite interesting in its details and it was hard for me to put it down. It seemed that I always needed to get into the next chapter to see what was going to happen. And the end of the story is quite satisfyling in itself.      The story of his adventure was related by Rawicz and contained a description of an encounter with a strange creature, large and hairy, that walked upright and was seen on the southern slopes of the Himalayas, by the men who made the journey. A British journalist learned of the sighting and was interested, even fascinated by it. Though Rawicz never referred to it as the Yeti, the Abominable Snowman, the journalist supposed that is what it was and wanted to write about it. Rawicz, on the other hand, was interested in telling his story about his capture by the Russians, his imprisonment and torture, and his exile to the Gulag, and then, his escape and flight to freedom. So they collaborated, the British journalist and the Polish lieutenant, and they produced a very good adventure story, detailing all the cruelty of their captors and the extreme harshness of their trek. They were always vigilant and wary of meeting strangers who might turn them back to the Russian authorities, who would have again imprisoned them. So each new day was an adventure for them, and the account of all these adventurous days makes for some very interesting reading. The severe climate they had to endure, the meager supplies they had, the necessary vigilance to prevent recapture, all of these things tested their resolve to continue on.     They made their escape on a night when it was snowing heavily, with the thought that the rapidly falling snow would cover their tracks before it was discovered they were gone. After the arctic cold they felt more comfortable in the milder weather, passing through an area without either ice or snow. Food was always a problem and they scrounged for whatever they could find. Then came the hike through the Gobi desert, where the only food they could find was snake meat,and water was so scarce that they nearly perished. And then came the perilous trek through the Himalayas, with ice-cold temperatures and snow and treacherous ice. Finally, when they reach India and are welcomed by the British Army, they are exhausted, emaciated and relieved. What follows is a lengthy rehabilitation. Medically speaking, they were a wreck. The whole of knighthood would have been proud of their successful quest.

2070518426|5.0|Having just finished a degree in English Literature, I've been avoiding any remotely serious reading like the plague. I've also been a fan of Harry Potter since one of my friends sat me down and told me I wasn't allowed to make snotty remarks about Harry Potter fans unless I at least tried to read one of the books. So when I decided that my post-graduation project would be to dust off my French skills, reading the French translations of Harry Potter seemed the way to go. <br /> <br />I was actually pretty surprised at how much I was able to understand. The grammar and sentence structure is relatively simple, and the wry voice and wit of Rowling still shows through. There was definitely a lot of vocabulary that I had to look up, but there was also a lot of vocabulary that I could pick up from the context: in particular, hibou, voler and cicatrice (owl, fly or steal, and scar). Granted, my familiarity with the series provided a bit of that context, so I would consider this to be between reading a book you have no familiarity with and reading a dual language book with the English on the facing page.  <br /> <br />My main complaint with the translation is that some of the names were changed. I'm in book 2 right now, and I still have a hard time accepting Professor Rogue as Professor Snape. Neville Londubat is not quite as bad, but I think there could have been a better way to convey that Snape's name has certain connotations in terms of the character's personality.  <br /> <br />Overall, I've been thoroughly enjoying reading in French, which I could not say when slogging through some of The Classics in class. The more I read on, the more I realize that I'm not translating to English in my head but thinking in French. Highly recommended.

B0002B15WE|5.0|After a moderate success with his big-screen starring debut, \\"Blind Date\\", and a flat-out dismal failure with \\"Sunset\\" (both directed by Blake Edwards), Bruce Willis seemed destined to get booted right back to the prime-time TV hell. Luckily, the atypical casting of him here proved to be a stroke of genius -- he's phenomenal as the action hero of this phenomenal action film.<br /><br />Based upon a truly mediocre novel, Die Hard tells the tale of an NYPD officer (played by a plucky Bruce Willis, in a role turned down by Richard Gere) and his attempts to outwit a gang of European terrorists who've seized control of a downtown Los Angeles skyscraper on Christmas Eve. His estranged wife (the appealing Bonnie Bedilia) is one of the hostages, and the leader of the terrorists (a brilliant Alan Rickman) -- whose dress, demeanor, and intelligence suggest a Wall Street investment banker -- is prone to equal bits of self-admiration and cold-blooded violence. The central gimmick -- McClane running around the building clad only in undershirt and pants (sans socks and shoes) dusting off terrorists singlehandedly -- is palpably absurd, but John McTiernan's muscular direction keeps all of the outlandish story aspects intelligently aligned; we have that rare feeling of knowing we're in the hands of a director who knows exactly what he's doing, so we feel comfortable giving ourselves over to his 'vision' and leaving our common-sense detectors at the concession stand. The action sequences are, quite simply, the best ever filmed, with McTiernan's imaginative staging making the most of the limited set pieces; and when the action transports the audience out of the building and to the goings-on of the LAPD and FBI, the tension (which you could cut barbed wire with) is expertly sustained. But the film's secret weapon is its off-hand humor. Whether it's the nifty set of one-liners the gifted screenwriters have afforded Willis (as they similarly afforded Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy in 48 Hrs.) or a bit of humor that's agreeably understated (like a SWAT officer pricking his finger on a rose bush), it helps sustain a jovially entertaining mood to help offset the sometimes-gory violence. Even a go-for-the-Oscar scene in a bathroom, with Willis tearfully telling a fellow officer on a radio to tell his wife he's sorry, comes off better than it should. I saw Die Hard at a sneak preview without expecting anything great from the director of Predator and the star of tv's Moonlighting. Suffice to say, I (along with practically everyone in the not-quite-packed theatre) were left stunned and filled with unbridled admiration. I still am.<br /><br />The first sequel had its moments but was too mechanically executed by Renny Harlin. The one after that, which was helmed by McTiernan, was more spirited and fun, but it still lacked the organic clarity of the brilliant original.

Does anyone who has seen the movie and actually served on active duty really think ANY military personnel act like this in a combat theater?  If they do its the rare exception, not the rule. Scout snipers must be some of the most mentally stable individuals in the world.  The nature of the job demands it.  The movie would have you believe the USMC would let a bunch of borderline psychos run into combat with hangovers, virtually unsupervised, carrying loaded M-16s and grenade launchers.  As a veteran I can tell you I seriously doubt it.  After seeing this movie I won't be buying the book.   Save your money. If you want to see an awesome DVD about the realistic horrors of war get \\"Band of Brothers\\" about the war in Europe or read \\"Into the Rising Sun\\" and \\"Beyond Valor\\" about WWII in the south Pacific, but don't believe all of this modern Hollyweird crap they're putting out these days.
B0002X314C|5.0|From the assisted production with Kanye West on cuts such as Jay-Z's `Encore' and Alicia Keys' `You Don't Know My Name', to the powerful well strung vocals on chart movers such as Slum Village's `Selfish' and Dilated People's `This Way', John Legend has been the emerging talent creeping through the creeks of the R&B floor in 2004, the same year his affiliate and producer, Chi-Town's finest, Kanye West, blew hip hop out of its waters. Now, signed to Kanye's new label G.O.O.D. (Getting Out Our Dreams), through the powers of Sony, could John Legend finally get his chance to shine?<br /><br />The first track to be taken from the album is the catchy West-produced `Used to Love U'. The lead single, currently rotating all over American TV screens on BET, is finding its airplay over here in the UK, and with John singing the delicate hook to the soul influenced record with polished effect, and witty lyrics such as `Baby I should rob somebody/ So we could live like Whitney and Bobby', the track is likely to climb high, hopefully just as high as his collaborations have been.<br /><br />The Ohio native steps up the album displaying his breathtaking piano skills on `Let's Get Lifted'. He even proclaims his plans to `change the game' in the track, and encourages his listeners to `get lifted'. The soul influences begin to flow like an electric current through the album on `She Don't Have to Know', a superbly written record, mapping John's extensive songwriting skills. John sings calmly and patiently of cheating on his girl with another women: `Someone's watching/ Gotta be careful next time or we're through/ Damn it's so stressful doing the dirt we do'.<br /><br />The big Snoop D.O Double G assists John on easily the most outstanding record on the LP, `I Can Change', a record which showcases John crooning perfectly over the piano keys similar to that found on Talib Kweli's `Get By'. On `Ordinary People', John sings out his heart to a beat with almost no drums, trumpets or horns. Instead, faint piano synths, leaves him little over which to soulfully elevate himself. John eliminates the need for a decent rhythm, and with mellow effects, gently sings sweetly creating a unique effort for an R&B star on their debut album.<br /><br />John introduces his gospel roots to the world on `It Don't Have to Change', an ode to his childhood memories in the church with his family. John continues to bring up his impressive 80s gospel talents on the track `Number One' featuring Kanye West.<br /><br />With attempts to create a `mac-daddy image' on `Alright', results show that John is better sticking to performances on heart touching ballads such as `Refuge (When It's Cold outside)'. Meanwhile, `Live It Up' sums up the album perfectly, with the help from another Kanye West recruit, Miri Ben Ari (her sounds are heard on Twista's `Overnight Celebrity'), the first ever specialist violin player to be incorporated into the sounds of R&B and hip hop.<br /><br />With `Get Lifted' scheduled for a release in early January 2005, John has created a masterpiece from the foundations of hype received through his work this year on both sides of the Atlantic. His work with Est'elle on `Hey Girl', injected a touch of soul and gospel into the UK star's debut release `The 18th Day', whilst endless collaborations and `behind the scenes' production assists have gotten people talking again. However, with a strong fusion of hip hop, R&B, soul and gospel, John with collective discipline, moulds each track into a sweet melody, without the need to throw the likes and success of Twista, Talib Kweli, Common and others on his tracks.rns.

B00000DLUO|1.0|Sorry, guys, but this is not the music for which we like Bill Evans. I think this is not Bill Evans music at all. For all those who want to know who real Bill Evans is, I would recommend 'Moonbeams' and/or 'I will say goodbye'. These are very good albums to begin with.
B00005AQE8|5.0|Maybe it was his time in prison, or maybe it was simply his signing with Suge Knight's Death Row label. Whatever the case, 2Pac re-emerged hardened and hungry with All Eyez on Me, the first double-disc album of original material in hip-hop history. With all the controversy surrounding him, 2Pac seemingly wanted to throw down a monumental epic whose sheer scope would make it an achievement of itself. But more than that, it's also an unabashed embrace of the gangsta lifestyle, backing off the sober self-recognition of Me Against the World. Sure, there are a few reflective numbers and dead-homiez tributes, but they're much more romanticized this time around. All Eyez on Me is 2Pac the thug icon in all his brazen excess, throwing off all self-control and letting it all hang out -- even if some of it would have been better kept to himself. In that sense, it's an accurate depiction of what made him such a volatile and compelling personality, despite some undeniable filler. On the plus side, this is easily the best production he's ever had on record, handled mostly by Johnny J (notably on the smash \\"How Do U Want It\\") and Dat Nigga Daz; Dr. Dre also contributes another surefire single in \\"California Love\\" (which, unfortunately, is present only as a remix, not the original hit version). Both hits are on the front-loaded first disc, which would be a gangsta classic in itself; other highlights include the anthemic Snoop Dogg duet \\"2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted,\\" \\"All About U\\" (with the required Nate Dogg-sung hook), and \\"I Ain't Mad at Cha,\\" a tribute to old friends who've gotten off the streets. Despite some good moments, the second disc is slowed by filler and countless guest appearances, plus a few too many thug-lovin' divas crooning their loyalty. Erratic though it may be, All Eyez on Me is nonetheless carried off with the assurance of a legend in his own time, and it stands as 2Pac's magnum opus.
B00000AFGM|5.0|From the minute that you start listening to the first song you start realizing how serious Marilyn Manson is about his music. The lyrics are awesome and so emotional that you can actually reflect upon yourself with this cd. All the songs are perfect and never get boring in my opinion. Dont miss out on this cd and buy, it will be one of the best things you've ever done. Trust me.
B000002U82|5.0|Fire one up, throw on some good headphones, and get lost in this great album. There's something for everyone in it, but if you're into poppy commercial music, this one isn't for you. If you can truly appreciate an album that was monumental in every form of the word, this album is for you.
B000001Y5X|5.0|Yes a very good beginning to an awesome band.The best songs in this cd to me are Dogma, Cake and Sodomy, Lunchbox, Dope Hat, and Misery Machine. The rest of the other songs are great too but these i cant seem to get enough of. Check this cd out, i'll doubt you'll be dissapointed.

B00003CXCQ|4.0|Disney. Listen up. You make movies for children. People have children who didn't have them before. Those children grow up and aren't children anymore. Are your DVDs only for the people who happen to have children during the period you choose to sell them?     When this movie was released, I didn't have a child. I didn't buy Snow White. Now that she is getting to the age that she might enjoy it THE MOVIE ISN'T AVAILABLE! I WANT to buy Snow White, but I CAN'T buy Snow White. By the time you decide to re-release it SHE WILL BE TOO OLD TO ENJOY IT! I WON'T buy Snow White.    This idea of limited issue of children's movies has to be the dumbest idea...ever.    EDIT: I found a copy on eBay. I don't know if it's legitimate (there are a *lot* of obvious fakes available) and, frankly, I don't really care.
B000002H97|2.0|I have to wonder if the people who give this album 4 or 5 stars came late to the Metallica party. I remember early Metallica---it was like nothing we had ever heard before. Well, it was kind of an amalgamation of heavy metal, hardcore, and punk. It was groundbreaking. They were a band seemingly uninterested in conforming to the standards set forth by radio and MTV. Fantastic! Heavy, fast songs with complicated arrangements and interesting lyrics. Metal up your a**, indeed. I feel they reached their peak with \\"And Justice For All\\", which was a pretty successful work---and had a video in heavy rotation on MTV, all without changing the way they did things. The Black Album changed all that. Gone were the heavy, fast, 6 minute epics. James even sang a BALLAD, for cryin' out loud. The change in Metallica is one of my greatest disappointments as a music fan. Another is Guns N Roses inability to grab the brass ring and become the next Rolling Stones, but that's a story for another time. Suffice it to say, I hated this album, and haven't bought a Metallica CD since. If you want to listen to the band, start with Kill 'em All and STOP at And Justice For All. I highly recommend Garage Inc, if only for the second CD, which contains the Garage Days Revisited EP.
B000068QY7|2.0|Perhaps its the fact that \\"Owen Morris\\" is not producing their albums anymore, or the fact that they need a producer, because Oasis produced this album themselves, and while thats all well and good. Noel Gallaghar (singer/songwriter/lead guitarist)said in a interview around the time of this release that the band should take responsibilty for their own records, its actually very dissapointing even compared to \\"Standing on the Shoulder of Giants\\" and \\"Be Here Now\\" both which got more flak than they deserved because they were by no means bad albums at all, they were just unfoccussed. <br /> <br />Heathen Chemistry is pretty watered down and weak, it does not stand up well as a entire listen and too much of the tracks sound more filler than anyhting else.  <br />\\"The Hindu Times\\" \\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\\" \\"Little By Little\\" would make you think that Oasis are back with a vengeance, to re claim their status, but they just don't cut it with their best songs, and in their own way lack alot of life. <br /> <br />Whats worse is that \\"Don't Beleive the Truth\\" is even worse, much worse, and unfortunatly saw Oasis previewing their entire album, miming to the album on TV, just before its release. <br /> <br />If Oasis want to pull out a stunner they need to get out the electric guitars, crank up the amps and get Owen Morris who produced their first three albums to make them sound \\"live\\" and \\"loud again.\\" Oasis are a live band, thats the sound thats missing from this album. <br /> <br />

0446677450|1.0|I bought this book based on the fact that Yahoo Financial occasionally publishes articles by Kiyosaki. Yahoo needs to either mark these articles as paid advertisements or drop them. <br /> <br />Kiyosaki does a nice job of reiterating what should be common sense to everyone. Limit your liabilities and build your assets. Put another way, buy what you need not what you want. But this is not new advice. He also does a nice job of promoting control of one's own fear, greed, and ignorance when it comes to money. Good advice indeed, advice he inadvertently shows us how to properly apply later in the book. He proudly describes how he bought a property from a troubled homeowner for $45,000 when it was really worth $65,000 and later sold it for $95,000. This is one example of many that illustrates the true secret to wealth and riches that has worked since time immemorial. I give it to you now at no charge: <br /> <br />\\"Control your own fear, greed and ignorance; use the other persons fear, greed, and ignorance to control them.\\" <br /> <br />This book not only describes this philosophy, it is an example of it.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|If you like mid-period Floyd, especially Meddle and Obscured by Clouds, but also Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You were Here, then do not walk, run to the record store and buy this thing.  It is beautiful, subtle, heartfelt, homespun and profound.  It has plenty of the texture of mid-period Floyd, but with a new kind of timeless grace that sometimes reminds me of the later Beatles or Brian Wilson.  It's NOT an album that you are going to absorb immediately, so give it time.  It doesn't sound much like later Pink Floyd--fans of The Wall or Momentary Lapse of Reason may be intially dissappointed...  The big Bob Ezrin sound is completely missing, replaced by a much more intimate production.  It sounds more like Division Bell, but mostly because that album brought back some of the mid-period Floyd sound.  I think it's the best Pink Floyd solo album, better even that Roger Waters' Amused to Death and Rick Wright's Broken China, both excellent albums in their own right.  Really, no Floyd fan should be without this.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|I have probably seen Metropolis in every version available starting 25 years ago. I've seen it with no music, rock music, disco music and now with the original score. The Kino Metropolis is by far the most complete, most viewable version of the film. The film itself is by no means perfect, to modern viewers the ending may seem simplistic and unprobable. It has to be put in the context of the era it was filmed. Communist ideology had currency and philosophers like Spengler where debating the effects of machinery and science on humanity. Metropolis is a science fiction film but it's also a political statement favoring a christian and humanistic resolution to the raging conflicts between the capitalist magnates and the industrial workers in 1920's Germany.<br /><br />So why I like this film so much? Same as most people, I find it groundbreaking, visually and esthetically beautiful, with great mob scenes ect... but let me just make a couple of points. First of all ... Brigitte Helm... has there ever been any bigger, bluer, crystalline, hypnotic eyes in film than the eyes of Brigitte Helm? I don't think so, even when she is doing that silly dance scene you cannot take your eyes off her. In short she is HOT. Second, the robot of Metropolis has become iconic. From the Ultraman series to C3P0 in Star Wars the design and beauty of the Metropolis robot is yet to be surpassed.<br /><br />One final point about this version. The restored original score is surprisingly good. I particularly liked the machine room music leading to the Moloch scene. It truly enhances the film. This DVD is a must for movie aficionados and it cannot be recommended highly enough.
0792844890|4.0|So, I haven't seen SpaceBalls in a while and I've been on a Mel Brooks kick, so I of course was quick to pick this one up.<br /><br />You do have to admire a truly prolific spoof artist!<br /><br />It's great to not only take an idea and spin it, but you get a little fun with ethnicity (\\"Funny, she didn't look Druish\\"), a series of off color body part and sexual humor (\\"I see your swartz is as big as mine\\" still rates as my fav) and that lovebale WB cartoon knock at the end. When that alien leaps out of that guys chest and then sings \\"Hello my Baby, Hello my honey\\" like that little frog from the cartoons, I laughed aloud. I smile now just remembering and typing.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|Life is change. Some things seem to remain constant, but only because of our limited human perspective. People age. Some aspects of life appear rather constant, others shift as we grow older. Musicians and other artists are in a peculiar position of having those changes under more public scrutiny than most. When a piece of work moves someone with power and force, the impact is so breathtaking, so overwhelming, even life-changing that they want to experience that moment of awakening again and again. And so some will always want to freeze the artist in time, demanding that they replicate their favorite work over and over out of a desire to experience the same powerful feeling again and again. <br /> Such is the fate of David Gilmour and his solo work. With the release of \\"On An Island,\\" the cry goes out \\"It's not Pink Floyd!\\" \\"It's terrible,\\" \\"He's lost it!\\" \\"He's over the hill!\\" But this reaction is not actually valid artistic criticism, but a reflection of the disappointed listener's desire to have \\"The Wall\\" or \\"Wish You Were Here\\" come out for the first time again, triggering that same feeling they experienced when they first encountered these masterworks. Gilmour is not an machine, despite the desire of some to freeze him in a past time and have every guitar solo to tear their heads and hearts like \\"Comfortably Numb.\\" He's a person who lives, loves, learns and changes like all of us. The mature listener knows how to change and accept change, growing with the musician, hearing each new work with a \\"beginner's mind,\\" to borrow a concept from Zen. The mature listener is able to hear the aspects of the artist's sound that are so unique and instantly identifiable, yet are also able to hear the greatness in the inevitable new aspects of their favorite's creativity and art. David Gilmour is not a slave of the public, nor is he an automaton who rewrites the same formulaic song over and over again. <br /> Nor is he Roger Waters. <br /> I suspect that the criticism that \\"On An Island\\" isn't Pink Floyd simply reflects a preference for Waters' work, for the hard-edged, bitter cynicism that permeates so much of his work, and which I have enjoyed myself. The out of hand dismissal of the excellent work on \\"A Momentary Lapse Of Reason\\" and \\"The Division Bell,\\"as well as on Gilmour's first two solo efforts, suggests that the complainers should be following the career of Waters' post-Floyd work if that is what they prefer. <br /> Yes, David has aged and, in some respects, mellowed, but the genius has not dimmed, it now illuminates the parts of his life experiences he wants to share, which are, after all, the only real source of inspiration and artistic creativity. \\"On An Island\\" is a beautiful work of maturity and insight. Gilmour hasn't lost a thing. On the contrary, he's placed his creativity in the service of the perspectives and insights he's gained in life; perspectives that rarely come except with age and wisdom. True, with the exception of \\"Where We Start,\\" the lyrics are courtesy of his wife, Polly Samson, but their marriage has extended well beyond their personal lives and into their art producing a fine union of words and music. Perhaps you have to experience this kind of togetherness to fully appreciate their combined artistry, but I think not. The real question is whether the words and music form an artistic whole, and they certainly do just that on this wonderful \\"solo\\" effort. (Is any work that employs the artistic contributions of others ever truly \\"solo\\"?) Do Polly's lyrics have the searing cynical power of Waters'? Certainly not. But why should they? Should we dismiss the poetry of Emily Dickinson because she wasn't a Roger Waters? Certainly not. And why even go there in the first place since the human condition can't be contained in the work of any single writer - even Roger's. Even Shakespeare's, although he probably came closer than anyone. There's room in the world for beauty, loveliness, even sentimentality and tenderness, all of which are exhibited here. <br /> How sad for those who want only raging cynicism or anger, rather than being open to experience all that life has to offer. How sad to only want hard rock and never experience the wonders of a string quartet or a folk ballad. Yes, the overall tone of \\"On An Island\\" is slower and more mellow than some previous Gilmour compositions (though \\"Take A Breath\\" should certainly remind us that David hasn't forgotten that life produces some harder edges in a person than others). And, as in so much of the classic Pink Floyd material, there are the self-referencing melodic lines and lyrics. \\"The Blue\\" suggests the Pink Floyd of \\"Meddle\\" while the opening phrasing of the title track easily yields a memory of \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\" and even begins with the same word: \\"Remember.\\" The ambient sounds of children, the city and nature harken to view the same elements of earlier works in a new light of age and maturity. <br /> David has done fine work here and we should be thankful that he's out there still making music for those who can grow with him.
B00001PE4D|3.0|This is a revised version of the book Les Liaisons Dangereuses and Dangerous Liasons the movie. Unlike Shakespere's Romeo and Juliet that updated the look but kept the prose, this movie was very smartly written and the lines that the characters deliver are both believable and worthwhile to listen to. It makes you not want to just fast forward to the steamy parts.<br /><br />What was surprising was how much Reese Witherspoon's character Annette changed. You aren't necessarily surprised when she succumbs to Sebastian's (Ryan Phillipe) charms. What disappointed was how out of character she ended the movie. I won't tell you, watch it yourself and judge.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|This latest CD from David Gilmour is incredible, blending a collage of instruments for a unique sound.  I love all the guitar solos; they carry incredible emotion and though some find this CD boring, I found several songs subtlely intense, adding another layer to this already wonderful CD.  At $10 this is a steal, go buy it, you won't be disappointed.
B000CSUYFQ|3.0|I went out of my way to locate and obtain this album before its domestic release based entirely on a glittering 9.0 review on Pitchforkmedia.  For those unfamiliar with Pitchforkmedia, a 9.0 is akin to Rolling Stone giving an album a 5 star rating or most others a max-plus rating.  I had liked OK their previous album THEY THREW US ALL IN A TRENCH AND PUT A MONUMENT ON TOP.  After having gotten the album and listened to it the minimum ten times before I will ever review anything, I realize that I paid insufficient attention to a key phrase in the review about the \\"continued exploration and evolution of the sound that turned much of their fanbase against them.\\"  Well, yeah.<br /><br />This is thick, atmospheric stuff.  They pretty much have abandoned lyrics, melody, and rhythm.  What they have left is experiments in sound.  I'm not theoretically opposed to this in all instances, but my complaint here is that I didn't find the experiments in any way interesting or compelling.  To me it has much of the same appeal as non-acoustic jazz (and yes, one of my biases comes out there).  It struck me as pretty limited in its appeal and I have a pretty wide ranging field of interests.  There isn't much that I don't find interesting.  But I personally like my music to go somewhere.<br /><br />I would urge caution in getting this album.  I wouldn't recommend this to ANYONE who didn't love the Liars' last album, THEY WERE ALL WRONG, SO WE DROWNED or who doesn't love experimental music in general.  I did not care of their last album and like experimental music only selectively.  Personally, I think that most people will intensely disagree with the 9.0 Pitchforkmedia rating.  Dedicated lovers of experimental music will perhaps agree with the rating, but few others.<br /><br />My main point is, this is an album targeted at a very small number of fans.  I think virtually any fan of music will love Arcade Fire or White Stripes or Sufjan Stevens, but I think this appeals to a very, very small audience.  So, if you are 100% certain that you have a rough idea what this music is like (i.e., you have heard and loved the Liars earlier albums, in particular their second one), get it.  If you have no idea what it sounds like and are just browsing for a new album, go get The Hold Steady's SEPARATION SUNDAY instead.ery, very small audience.

0553296981|5.0|This book was about a young Jewish girl forced into hiding because of the massive extermination of Jews Hitler was causing.  The holocaust was caused by the German people losing Word War I.  Hitler(the German leader) used the Jews as a scapegoat for Germanys losses.  Hitler built many concentration camps along with extermination camps to rid Germany and surrounding countries of the Jews. Anne Frank was born in Germany in 1929.  By the time she was 13 her family was in hiding, hiding as to not get caught by the Nazi police and be transported to a death camp.  But one day in Augest of 1944 Anne's family was captured and taken to concentration camps.  Every person Peter, Mr. & Mrs. Van Dann, Mr Dussel, Margot, Mrs. Frank, and Anne herself perished in a death camp.  The only living person was Mr. Frank, who after going back to the \\"Secret Annex\\" found Anne's diary, the last memento he had of his daughter.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I was never a big fan of Rent as a musical.  The Broadway recording left me cold - with only a few songs lingering in my memory. <br />However, with new; harder, orchestrations and the songs come to life in the movie. <br />It saddens me to see reviews on Amazon that are obviously homophobic and intolerant.  Maybe I'm stupid - but I thought we were finally living in a better society than that. <br />For those people who like musicals this is a must-own.  And no, it's NOT a gay film by any means.  The film focuses on 2 gay couples, 1 straight couple and 1 straight single man.  But, more importantly, this is a show about friendship and courage in the face of a terrible disease. <br />As for those reviews from people stating it's immoral and promotes lifestyles that are 'wrong'...turn around and look behind you and you might just catch a glimpse of the Victorian era creeping up to bite you in the rear.  Get over yourselves and learn to live with the rest of world in all its wonderful states of variety. <br />To end - and excellent film, impeccably acted and directed from a gifted composer. Buy it!
1594481717|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book and learned much from it. The author gives a lot of examples and references to his points. He believes that the right-brained people (creatives) will ascend in importance and left-brained people (accountants, programmers, MBA's) will descend because their information processing skills will be offshored or computerized.  <br /> <br />I don't think it will be the big shift that he claims but I do believe that he is making an important series of observations and predictions. I don't think we'll make a large shift because the left-brain functions are required to generate much of our GDP and that currency and wage fluctuations will equalize how much we do and how much is offshored. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book. It is a fast and easy read. Please visit the web sites that he lists in his exercises at the end of most chapters. I found them quite delightful. <br /> <br />John Dunbar <br />Sugar Land, TX
B000001XO3|5.0|I've not heard this Gala \\"pressing\\" of the '53 Bayreuth RING under Krauss -- but I've been playing this same performance on the new (Feb2006) edition from Opera d'Oro.  It is glorious sound in a performance to be treasured.  Clearly, someone needs to hold up the two against one another and compare their sound to see if, objectively, Opera d'Oro is better than Gala. And the $45-55 price, depending where you buy it, is a steal.
B0006GAOBI|4.0|I remember watching this movie when it first came out on the theaters in 2001 and I was very moved by it. Needless to say, there was no one in the room with me and very few people heard of Donnie Darko during that time. I moved to England in 2004 and the movie was a huge cult success. It obviously got there much later as most movies do, but it put the movie into the spotlight.  Donnie, a mentally ill teenager starts to get visions of a giant bunny rabbit who warns him that the end of the world is coming soon. He suddenly is given a book that describes his experiences so he tries to change the future by changing the past. Good performances, great soundtrack, original and remarkable script make this movie one of the most representative of its decade.The director's cut is more slow paced and makes things easier to understand.Here you will find all the deleted scenes for the first Dvd release,some extra special effects,and a slightly altered soundtrack. The special features have this Donaldson character who is elected as The number one fan of the movie...He is quite creepy and funny at the same time, seeing him kissing Richard Kelly and freaking everyone he meets out is pretty amusing.This dvd is certainly worth buying.
B00009P1O0|2.0|I am a huge Neil Young fan and that is the main reason why this album disappoints me.This is not classic material by the godfather of grunge; it is basically a commercial shot into a time where nearly everybody was trying to be a so-called singer/songwriter and trying to make money out of it.Dont get me wrong, there are some good songs here and there that are listenable, but, my expectations were much higher from one of my all time favourite musicians ever.
B000002UB3|4.0|JPG&R, after producing the landmark, but somewhat depressing White Album, needed something upbeat to give their fans. I'm sure \\"Abbey Road\\" was intended as the result, because it is much more positive in mood and outlook. Even the socially critical stuff: \\"Mean Mr. Mustard\\", \\"Polythene Pam\\" and \\"Come Together\\" are comedic, cartoon-like and nowhere near as doleful as the corresponding tunes on \\"The WA\\".<br /><br />That aside, I must say that George, who I had always relied on to compose some of the more thought-provoking music of the Beatles' later years, produces some of the worst treacle on this album. Sorry to say, but I am NOT one of the fans of \\"Something\\", easily his most syrupy tune. I'm more the \\"Within You, Without You\\"/\\"I Want To Tell You\\" kind of George fan. George always impressed me as the AYM of the Beatles...the Holden Caulfield. Always observing, always complaining or critcizing, however gently, the passing scene or personality types he remembers. This goo is not him. LENNON, on the other hand, is true to form again, as the cheeky buffoon of the group, with funny songs like \\"Mustard\\", \\"Come Together\\", \\"Polythene Pam\\" and his influence on Paul is showing here as well, despite the fact that the two were headed in separate directions by the time this album was being recorded. Songs like \\"Her Majesty\\", \\"She Came In Through The Bathroom Window\\", \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\"  and \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" are pure \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\"/\\"WA\\" era Lennon, with the schoolboyish McCartney's certain spin on them. Odd... McCartney was NEVER a jokester in earlier albums or the films, but on this album, he's Henny Youngman!<br /><br />The next album after this, the half-heartedly recorded \\"Let It Be\\" took the comedy bent of Lennon and McCartney even further, with between-track banter like \\"I Dig A Pygmy, by Charles Haltry on the Deaf-aids...Phase One, in which Doris gets her oats!\\" and \\"Like the FBI...and the CIA...and the BBC, and B.B. King....and Doris Day! Dig it! Dig It! Dig It! Dig it! That was 'Can You Dig It?' by Georgie Woods! And now we'd like to do: 'All The Angels Come'!\\" Lennon is still cutting up, McCartney is still acting crazy, but George is back to being George, albeit somewhat cryptically, with \\"Brown Shoe\\"...no more syrupy, middle-period McCartney-like treacle for HIM anymore!<br /><br />If only somebody had cloned Lennon and Harrison...things would be SOOOO good today!g It! Dig it! That was 'Can You Dig It?' by Georgie Woods! And now we'd like to do: 'All The Angels Come'!\\" Lennon is still cutting up, McCartney is still acting crazy, but George is back to being George, albeit somewhat cryptically, with \\"Brown Shoe\\"...no more syrupy, middle-period McCartney-like treacle for HIM anymore!

B000002TQV|5.0|Well all of Radioheads Cds are great. I would recomend this Cd to enyone. The only problem I had with this is when I recieved it in the mail the jewel case was broke.
B000E6UK5K|1.0|i've been into the floyd for many years plus i've got all the solo albums of the guys but it pains me to say this record is very very average and em... boring. gilmour has recently stated he owes no one anything. so what we get here is a very personal work from a man indifferent to what is expected of him. maybe that's the problem. this self indulgent body of work has no drive. it is not engaging. it's just gilmour meandering here and there. there are some nice touches of the trademark gilmour guitar sound but within the context of bland songs his musical talents are wasted. furthermore, the lyrics are truly awful. example - \\"along by the river we feed bread to the swans/and then over the footbridge to the woods beyond/i light a campfire away from the path/we lie in the bluebells, a woodpecker laughs\\". my  head is in my hands.  tellingly, the lyrics were written by gilmour's wife. gilmour should have had the sense to take heed of spinal tap's troubles. don't involve the wife (\\"or girlfriend or whatever the **** she is\\"). hardcore gilmour fans might dig this. floyd fans may not. what this album will not do is to attract a new audience. but what does that matter when that was not gilmour's aim when putting this album together. this aint rock. it aint even dad rock. it's granddad rock.
B000683VI4|5.0|Other reviewers as well as the Amazon editorials have adequately covered the plot of this movie. So this will be a brief review.<br /><br />I watched this movie about two weeks ago. Since then I have not been able to forget it ... it comes to me during the drive to work, while walking the dog, while cleaning house. This movie was simply beautiful and breathtaking in it's scope. It is a bittersweet love story that is so real, so well acted, and so well written. This is not just a few hankies movie, this is an entire tissue box movie. It's meaning will resonate in your soul and you'll feel better for having experienced it.
068981528X|4.0|I found this to be an enjoyable twist on the common tale.  Even the high school students that I shared it with enjoyed it.  The illustrations added to the text and helped set the stage for the story.
B000AL730O|5.0|We saw Sir Paul on \\"Great Performances\\" on PBS and witnessed the genius in the recording studio. In the show, he played and sang of some of his songs from this new album, and told stories of how he and Nigel the producer came up with ideas.  It was fascinating to see how he plays all the instruments and sings, layering the sounds in his unique, inimitable style.  <br /> <br />I subsequently ran out and bought this CD and our whole family has been delighted with every single song.  We grew up with the Beatles and always liked them, but have been rediscovering them,now,as the musical greats that they certainly were. Paul has now outdone himself. He has deepened and matured yet he retains a certain optimism and playfulness. I love the driving rhythms of bass, guitar and drum, yet it isn't boring, noisy, hard rock; there are captivating melodies, there is counterpoint, changing tempos, and pleasing little surprises, like the piano harmonically winding in and out of the singer's main melody in \\"A Certain Softness.\\" His use of the piano is one of my favorite features.  <br /> <br />The lyrics are clever. Take \\"English Tea\\" for instance--engaging poetry, and a tune that stays in your head all day. Or \\"Vanity Fair\\"... magical sounds, with depth; as in Shakespeare, the words can have double or triple layers of meaning. \\"At the Mercy,\\" expresses a universal feeling, with evocative chordal modulations. \\"This Never Happened Before,\\" is one of my favorite love songs of all time. It would make a great wedding song. And Sir Paul's voice is incredible; better than when he was young, I think. Like George Martin said about the Beatles, this work is \\"impeccable.\\"  <br /> <br />Somehow Paul achieves the perfect balance needed between repetition and variety. Somehow he makes the lyrics match the music. Somehow he finds the \\"Fine Line\\" between chaos and creation.  <br />  <br />Two hundred years from now, most \\"artists\\" will be forgotten, but the name and works of Paul McCartney will beclassics. <br />
B0000042H4|5.0|I'm still amazed at the bashing this studio recording takes from some people. It was cast with the \\"best\\" available singers at the time, staged magnificently for stereo, and nearly half a century later is till an exhilarating listen. If you are new to the Ring, this set (along with Deryck Cooke's intro, also available on CD) is your very best introduction to Wagner's vision. The other stereo studio recordings have weaknesses in casting this set avoids. It is expensive, but the you will find yourself well repaid by a most enjoyable listening experience. Seasoned Ring fans will also want to check out the Karajan and Levine studio recordings ... and if you can take \\"live\\" mono sound, the Archipel Keilberth (Bayreuth 1952) and EMI Furtwngler RAI performances are certainly worth your time. A UK company, Testament, is currently in the process of releasing the very first recorded stereo Ring from Bayreuth 1955 in splendid sound ... at thi time of writing only the Siegfried is available and it may well be the best stereo Siegfried ever recorded ... but at almost $80, it's very costly. For now (March 2006), the complete Solti Ring is the best way to go if you want a memorable studio stereo performance with magnificent singing.
B000E1ZBH2|2.0|I admit it.  I'm totally biased to the BBC miniseries with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle as well.  But I've also read the book enough times (more than 20 times over less than 10 years) to feel this version of Jane Austen's book is a terrible reflection of her work.  I felt the casting of almost everyone in the movie was completely wrong - something that perhaps might not have appeared so bad if the actors in question had bothered to read the book themselves to know how they should be portraying their part. <br /> <br />Matthew MacFadyen was rather unlikeable - he spent the entire time sneering at everyone and everything and by the end of the movie, one was left wondering how on earth Elizabeth decided he was a nice person.  Apart from the one scene between Elizabeth and Darcy where he proposes to her the first time, there was absolutely no chemistry between them whatsoever.  Keira played Elizabeth kind of OK, but her speedy change from hate of Darcy to love was just bizarre.  I'm not a big fan of Keira's anyway, and I felt that she was very wrong for the part.  And Mr Bingley, who was portrayed as a kind of moron... I was horrified. <br /> <br />All relationships that were so well defined in the novel were completely underdone in this movie version; the story did not flow at all well.  It's like the writers closed their eyes, flicked through the book, and randomly pointed their finger at a page to decide the storyline.  As someone who has read the book so many times, at least I knew what happened in the \\"missing\\" sections of the movie so my mind could make sense of what it WASN'T seeing - I can't imagine anyone who has never read the book would understand why Elizabeth and Darcy got together in the end.  They had very few scenes together and again, no chemistry at all. <br /> <br />At the end of the day, one must consider that this IS a Hollywood flick after all - you can't expect much from them and have to take it all with a grain of salt. As a big Austen fan, it was a hard thing to do with this movie (as it was with Gwyneth Paltrow's \\"Emma\\").  As a relatively entertaining flick, I give it the thumbs up - while Pride and Prejudice is my favourite Austen novel and this version is... well, terrible... I'm always a sucker for a romantic film!!  As a good adaptation of Jane Austen's novel however, I give it two big thumbs down. <br /> <br />If you're into light entertainment - buy it.  If you're a hardcore Austen fan expecting anything even remotely as breathtakingly awesome as the BBC Firth/Ehle version - stay well away from this one!
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|MOst of the aspects of this film were very well done.  Perhaps the best part was Knightley's role.  She was excellent.<br /><br />I feel most of the negative critiques below this one were overly harsh.  This really is a great movie...and if you have seen the previous edition (who hasn't)...then you will be disappointed the wedding scene was left out.  My wife was. Yet, the interactions between key actors are very well done.<br /><br />The nuances with videography and music add touches that my wife and I both noticed and enjoyed.  I think this one is a keeper and will watch it again sometime.  Get it and enjoy it!
B000002UAI|5.0|Despite the fact that \\"The Beatles for Sale\\" is often looked upon as one of the lesser Beatles albums, it is still a treasure.  The bottom of the Beatles contributions would be the top of any lesser group, anyway, so this C.D. can't be dismissed. Besides containing the hit \\"Eight Days a Week,\\" it has lesser known gems like McCartney's \\"I'll Follow the Sun,\\" and a beautifully harmonized version of Buddy Holly's \\"Words of Love\\".  Although it seems to be a transitional album, it has a consistent country-rock feel to many of the songs, which include a worthy rendition of \\"Kansas City\\".  In addition, Lennon comes up with a heartfelt confessional song, \\"I'm a Loser\\".  Containing about half original and half remakes, not all of the songs are great, however.  Lennon's \\"No Reply\\" and \\"Baby's in Black\\" seem substandard, and the remake of \\"Mr. Moonlight\\" has some of the most languid instrumental accompaniment of any Beatles' song.  Nevertheless, buying this C.D. gives any Beatles fan an opportunity to relish some gems seldom heard on the radio.  It is like finding lost treasure.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|Rust In Peace (1990.), Megadeth's fourth studio album<br /><br />When Dave Mustaine was kicked out of Metallica, shortly before the recording of the band's first studio album, 'Kill 'Em All' in 1983, no-one would have guessed that the exiled guitarist had the ability to form a band that would rival Metallica. However over time, Dave Mustaine's thrash metal band Megadeth were to become one of the definitives acts in the genre. Initially though, the band's line up was far from stable. After the release of the well acclaimed 'Peace Sells...' album in 1986, guitarist Chris Poland and drummer Gar Samuelson were both kicked out of the band by Mustaine as they sold the band's equipment for drug money. Then after a one album experiment with guitarist Jeff Young, Dave Mustaine had to put the band together yet again. However the recruitment of guitarist Marty Friedman and drummer Nick Menza turned things around for the band. 'Rust In Peace' was the first release from what many fans know as the classic line up of the band and has gone on to be perhaps the bands most acclaimed work. So, how much does this album really rock?<br /><br />Dave Mustaine's aim was always to be better than his former band Metallica. In the 80's, Megadeth's output was good but never quite matched albums like 'Master Of Puppets' or '...And Justice For All' which were at the forefront of developing the thrash genre. However, 'Rust In Peace' changed all this. This album is 5* material all the way and it definitely is on a level with some of Metallica's classic work (I say that as a big early Metallica fan myself). In fact, this is one of the all time great thrash albums, and with metal in general. 'Rust In Peace' is a 40 minute musical onslaught which hardly lets up. The album is full of blistering riffs, crazy solos and memorable tunes. On 'Rust In Peace', everything works - there are hardly any flaws. It is top notch songwriting from Dave Mustaine and co.. Indeed, this album spawned some of the band's most famous songs such as the awesome 'Holy Wars...The Punishment Due' and 'Hangar 18'. Mustaine's rhythm guitar work (and occasional solos) are ultra precise and hard hitting and Dave Ellefson plays out some awesome bass lines (such as at the start of songs like 'Five Magics' and 'Poison Was The Cure'). However, what maybe takes Megadeth up to an even higher level with this album is Marty Friedman's guitar work. Some of his guitar solos are phenominal and make other guitarists seem like they're playing with broken fingers! Plus his solos are diverse and always interesting to listen to. Another thing which really succeeds for Megadeth on this album is the structuring of their songs. The band never follow what I would describe as standard song formats (ie. verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, solo etc) but instead play out their songs in unique style. It doesn't make the music any more difficult to appreciate - I loved this album on the first listen but instead adds that extra dimension to the bands music. All in all, 'Rust In Peace' is thrash at it's best.<br /><br />Recently, a large amount of Megadeth's catalogue got remastered and reissued. The 'Rust In Peace' album was no exception. However, the remasters have met a mixed response from fans. I personally think the remaster is great - the CD has some good extras and out-take bonus tracks and the sound quality of the album is very clear and crisp. However, some long time fans have found complaint with the remastering of Dave Mustaine's vocals. I'm only familiar with his singing on the remasters so I can't personally comment, however some long time fans have found the vocals to be garbled and butchered, in comparison to the original album issue.<br /><br />Going back to the songs on the album, Megadeth's masterpiece kicks off with the well acclaimed fan favourite, 'Holy Wars...The Punishment Due'. This is the longest track on the album and is perhaps the best also. The opening blistering riffs with Dave Mustaine'scries about the perils of warfare make an awesome attacking start. Then, after a mini acoustic sequence, the second half of the song thunders in, with more crashing riffs. The latter half of the song is full of solos from both Mustaine and Friedman, all of which are awesome. It's hard to put into context how much is packed into this song alone! 'Hangar 18' follows, kicking off with a fast chugging riff. This is another classic driving and thrashing song with no respite throughout it's 5 minute running time. 'Take No Prisoners' is a shorter but no less inferior song, with some great bass and drum rhythms layered by fast guitar work. The 'Take No Prisoners, Take No Shit' vocal exit packs a heavy musical punch. Next up is one of my personal favourites on the album in the form of the underrated 'Five Magics'. The 2 minute opening sequence is brilliant, featuring a downcast but flowing bass melody from Dave Ellefson coupled with soaring guitar work. Then the song goes into all out attack through fast verses and an odd but miraculously catchy 'Give Me Alchemy' chorus. Friedman plays out more great solos and Mustaine's guitar exit is first rate, played at blistering pace.<br /><br />'Poison Was The Cure' follows, a short 3 minute gem. The nifty bass opening lines from Ellefson are great before the song hurls into top gear, courtesy off a fast, blues styled guitar line from Marty Friedman. The song also has some intersting, chromatic bridge riffs. 'Lucretia' follows, a brightly opening song which leads into another hard hitting thrash song, with more great solos. 'Tornado Of Souls' is another top moment on the album, incorporating racing guitar riffs and well placed bass empashasis. The vocal bridge mid-way through is a highlight. The quirky 'Dawn Patrol' follows. This is basically 2 minutes of spoken verse over a pretty cool bass line. Still this song is no filler and breaks the album up nicely. Next, to finish this great album is the title track 'Rust In Peace...Polaris', a thrash classic with a nuclear war theme. This is another fantastic song with more breakneck riffs and solos.<br /><br />This album is one of the hallmarks for Megadeth and is definitely one of the all time thrash classics. Few albums are consistently excellent as this. Megadeth, under their new line up found their creative peak and produced works like this one. Megadeth are somewhat an underrated band, often classed by some as Metallica clones. However, that couldn't be further from the truth and this album is proof of the band's own genius. 'Rust In Peace' is a must for any heavy metal fans collection, no question!e make an awesome attacking start.

0446310786|5.0|When I was 14 years old, I was a typical teenage boy of the times. Reading was more of a drudgery than it was an enjoyment. Then, I entered my freshman year and God's providence placed me under the guidance of an English teacher named Mrs. Lemke. She had an uncanny ability of matching students up with just the right reading assignments. A few weeks into my freshman year, after she had gotten to know her students, she assigned me two books, WATERSHIP DOWN and TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, to read and report on. When I learned that one was about rabbits and the other, a little girl, I was furious. The least she could have done would be to give me westerns or war stories. Eventually, I conceded to the fact that the two books would have to be read and so began my journey into a life long love of books.  I credit those two books with totally changing my outlook or reading for the sake of enjoyment. What a brilliant teacher Mrs. Lemke proved to be and I thank God for putting her in my life.<br /><br />That was over 30 years ago and I would venture to say, I have read Harper Lee's TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD probably 15 times.  It's one of those rare volumes that you just have to take down off the shelf, dust it off and re-acquaint yourself with its brilliant narrative. I just consider it a travesty that Harper Lee wrote only this one single masterpiece. She had such a way of luring the reader into a love affair with her subjects.<br /><br />The story of Atticus Finch and his two children, Jem and Scout, or Jean Louise as she so detested being called, encompasses so many of life's lessons and virtues. We read as the children struggle with their father's identity, racial tension, social differences and a neighbor shrouded in mystery and myth. We romantically consider their world \\"simpler times\\", but to these two children and there good friend, Dill, they seemed anything but simple. And the portrait of their father, Atticus, is so magnificently portrayed by the author as a bastion of virtue. There should be a little bit of Atticus Finch in all of us.<br /><br />These days, I don't read much fiction, but this old favorite comes down every couple of years to be enjoyed over and over, and I can honestly say, with each reading, I enjoy it as much as ever. Thank you Harper Lee, for giving us this treasure, and thank you Mrs. Lemke for changing my life.<br /><br />Monty Rainey<br />[...]d be a little bit of Atticus Finch in all of us.

B000002VCT|5.0|Alan Parsons was assistant engineer on The Beatles \\"Let It Be\\" and \\"Abbey Road\\" which was only the beginning of his career. He later was the engineer of Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of The Moon\\". Additionally, he produced the album \\"Year of The Cat\\" by Al Stewart. Obviously he has impressed many with his engineering talents and he rose to the top to form The Alan Parsons Project (with partner Eric Woolfson) in 1975. I was taken in by this progressive rock group around 1980 and had some catching up to do after hearing the albums \\"Tales of Mystery...\\" and \\"I Robot\\" then the song 'What Goes Up' from \\"Pyramid\\" on a Charlotte AOR station. As a result, I just couldn't get enough of TAPP in the '80s. \\"Pyramid\\" is the work of brilliant engineering and an ear pleasing blend of rock and electronic wizardry. Highlights here include the before mentioned plus 'Voyager', 'The Eagle Will Rise Again', 'Can't Take It With You', 'Pyramania' and 'Hyper-Gamma Spaces'. This is good headphone music for sure and my favorite Parsons album.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|\\"You can be as you choose to be. It takes some discipline but it can be done.\\"<br /><br />I first saw The Bodyguard in a hot summer day. I waited in a long queue for my ticket and the theatre was fully packed. Tired and frustrated, I could not enjoy the film but it grew in me over time. It was different experience when I saw it again. In fact, The Bodyguard is a serious, original and very well told story. Love can be as real as me, sitting and writing here, and still be impossible and bitter-sweet. I can relate to this. Don't we all go through it at lеаst once in our lifetime?<br /><br />I love Kevin Costner's performance as Frank  Farmer. I find him very convincing in the skin of this tough, self-disciplined guy with a heart of gold. I admire Kevin's portrayal of Frank's emotional  torment when he had to choose between his duty and his heart. Whitney Huston is surprisingly good and her enormous musical talent makes up for her lack of acting experience.<br /><br />The Bodyguard has it all: action-packed scenes, cool lines, pearls of wisdom, tender loving and fantastic soundtrack! This film is definitely worth your time.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|To start out, I've gotta say...Reese Witherspoon definitely deserved the award she won for Best Actress this year, and even though Joaquin Phoenix didn't win the award for Best Actor, he certainly did a great job himself.  <br /> <br />Probably the most stunning part of the movie was that Witherspoon and Phoenix both learned to sing and play instruments. Neither of them had had any previous knowledge of music or singing, yet the result was stunning. While Phoenix does not sound exactly like Johnny Cash, and Witherspoon does not sound exactly like June Carter, they definitely evoke the feelings and do the songs justice. <br /> <br />One of the great parts about this movie was that neither of them were imitating their characters, they were simply emulating them. Certainly, Joaquin Phoenix does not REALLY look that much like Johnny Cash, but in the movie he portrays him so well that you begin to think he IS Johnny Cash. The fact that that element is present in this movie makes it a cut above your normal fare.

1400031001|5.0|This, Boyd's greatest work, has to rank up there in the top four literary works which have influenced me, along side Hemingway's \\"The Sun also Rises\\", Salinger's \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\", and Camus' \\"The Stranger\\".  In a way, these books are all related, because they are all examples of distinctly \\"modern\\" literature which pertains and deals with the \\"emptiness\\" of the modern world.   Essential reading for any man who knows this kind of suffering, or any woman who wants to understand him.  Here is a deep and moving work, that doesn't allow a complex plot to hinder its simplistic and real views of the world.   <br /> <br />Following this, I also read Boyd's \\"Stars and Bars\\", which, while entertaining at times, is not nearly as good. <br /> <br />Boyd deserves our general appreciation for this fine contribution to modern literature.

It had all the elements of many of my favorite films, not the least which was topical plot and a cast a crew with a diverse and respected pedigree.  Add to this generally glowing reviews by most of the country's \\"name\\" critcs, and \\"Syriana\\" looked to be a can't miss; a searing political thriller filled with twists and suspense and eye-opening facts on war, corruption and big business.  That's at least what the reviews and the film's trailer (literaly) promissed.      What the forces-that-be behind \\"Syriana\\" have infact delivered is a great trailer and premise in search of an actual movie.  I almost feel cheated and lied to.  The movie I was promised is not what turns up on screen.  It is one thing to not have your expectations met because you didn't really understand what kind of movie you were bellying up for, it is another to be dumbfounded because a movie was promoted to be a bookend to a movie like \\"Traffic,\\" turns out to be something more akin to watching 2 hours of CNN analysist bicker back and forth, yet all be in agreement of what the others are saying.  There were a few critics who slammed this movie, but I think most of the one's who praised it didn't understand it or know what to make of it, but they knew the movie must have been importaint because it was about big, importaint issues, so at the risk of looking like they didn't get it, they praised it as being as great and importaint a movie as the people invovled obviously thought it was (lest they risk looking foolish if the movie garnered all the awards and attention a movie like this can garner, but not surprisingly, didn't).      The truth is, \\"Syriana\\" is the film equivelent of washing your dishes before putting them in the dishwasher:  It is a lot of extra work (to get to the same outcome either way) and ultimately pointless.  This movie begins with a rather straight forward story and then piles on characters, b-stories and characters with b-stories (what was the deal with the Matt Damon character and his family?) and then ends up right where it began with no one any the wiser for all the trouble; least of all the audience.  This film demands attention, and a good film that rewards the attention paid in the end deserves it.  But this movie puts you through the ringer trying to keep with what's going on; you're never sure you get it or if it makes sense (not your fault as a dumb viewer mind you, but the writters'; its one thing to say pay attention, it is another to expect us to make sense of something that, as written, makes no sense).  In the end many of the stories connect, but as a viewer this does not make for any kind of brilliant catharsis; you get it, but you're left thinking, 'so what?'  The finale would like to be thought of as shocking or tragic, or something that leaves the audience with something to think about, but it feels, not only anticlimatic, but after working so hard to follow what was being said and done, it just wasn't worth the trouble.  That hardly follows the rule of rewarding the audience for having had to decode everything that lead up to that point.      I'd be willing to wager someone could watch the first 15 minutes of this movie and the last five and come away with the same message and understaning of what the film is trying to get across; which could also be summed up in a sentece or two by any one involved in the film.      \\"Syriana\\" comes off as a long, overblown journey to nowhere.  You can't fault the actors or the director - they no what they are doing, but someone should have put the script through a serious rewrite.  This film is so muddled it is almost completely incoherent.  It is obviously well-meaning in its mission statement; and its thesis is strong, but the way in which the movie sets out to prove its point (a point that really needs no actual \\"proving;\\" it's a fact that some of these type of events occur, so what's the point?), all it really does is preach to the choir; and that's if the choir even gets that they are being preached to.  It's not worth getting into a big political discussion about this movie, because I think a lot of people won't be able to figure out if this movie is in agreement of their views or against them.      And that may be \\"Syriana's\\" biggest failing.  Everyone invovled with this film, especially George Clooney, has said they wanted to make a movie that would make people think as well as entertain.  But they have made a movie so impenetrable, that is does niether.  You can't discuss a movie that you don't understand, or when you you're too busy bitching about how frustraiting it was having to sit through it.    A damn shame considering the movie, the one I still want to see, that was in the trailer.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|It took a while, but I have FINALLY decided that I like the third David Gilmour album very much. Many seem to be measuring the work against the second Gilmour solo album, \\"About Face.\\" That probably is the best way to go about reviewing \\"On an Island\\" because I feel that the first Gilmour album is an under-appreciated master work. I would put this new one ahead of \\"About Face.\\"     Some of the criticism offered on these pages is valid. There does seem to be some repetition in Gilmour's riffs in some places, as one reviewer noted, though many of the repeated patterns are signature Gilmour such as the multi-step bends and the whammy pedal slides. I agree completely with the assessment that in order to appreciate this album fully, one will likely need to listen to it multiple times. I have listened to it four or five times, also. I was disappointed the first time around, as well. The melodies really start to come together during the second and third listens, however; then the subtleties of the compositions become gradually more apparent.    My favorite tracks are the title track, which is among Gilmour's best-ever solo compositions, \\"A Pocket Full of Stones,\\" \\"Then I Close My Eyes,\\" and \\"Red Sky at Night.\\" \\"The Blue,\\" \\"Smile,\\" \\"Where We Start\\" and \\"This Heaven\\" are also nice. \\"Take a Breath\\" is my least favorite, although it does have some great steel guitar work -- surpise, surprise.    The collection is very moody and relaxing. You may fall asleep around the middle of the album -- a criticism in the text on Amazon that is NOT valid. The track most likely to induce sleep is entitled \\"Then I Close My Eyes,\\" after all! On an Island is a very quiet album. Quiet albums are relaxing!     The editorial reviewer on Amazon mentioned that \\"This Heaven\\" ventures into unexpected territory with its R&B feel. The statement is absolutely ridiculous given that Gilmour has always been a couple of guitar effects away from being a blues guitarist! The reviewer's use of the term R&B isnot entirely incorrect. The term as it is used today is different than the traditional usage -- \\"blues\\" used to be a much more prominent aspect of R&B. However, straight \\"blues\\" describes the song more suitably.      I would like to say regarding a certain reviewer's musical \\"equation,\\" in which \\"lyrical content\\" was said to be an essential element of music, that instrumentals have NO \\"lyrical content.\\" Therefore, \\"lyrical content\\" is NOT essential to great music. Are the countless instrumental classical compositions and soundtracks not music? Hey, here's an idea! Let's all pull out an AC/DC album and listen to the lyrics! How about a Van Halen album? Now THAT'S deep! Do I hate AC/DC & Van Halen because of their \\"lyrics\\"? NO! They are in-your-face rock 'n' roll bands! Lyrics are a BONUS!     The opinions regarding the lyrics on \\"On an Island\\" seem to be mixed, as far as I can tell. I think the words are fine -- very moving at times, especially those of the title track. They work very well with the music. They are NOT all about happy themes, either, which is not to say that lyrics have to be sad in order to be good.    Yet another reviewer compared the songs on \\"On an Island\\" to some on \\"Meddle.\\" While I can understand the \\"A Pillow of Winds\\" comparison\\", possibly even the \\"Cirrus Minor\\" one to an extent, I must point out that the latter is on the \\"More\\" soundtrack, not \\"Meddle.\\"    One song \\"On an Island\\" brings to mind for me is an obscure Floyd track, often called \\"Rain in the Country\\" -- a trimmed-down version appears on the Zabriskie Point soundtrack under a different title -- \\"Then I Close My Eyes\\" seems to have a similar feel (without the blues part). \\"Poles Apart,\\" from \\"The Division Bell,\\" has a number of the atmospheric characteristics present on this new album. When I first heard \\"The Blue,\\" I immediately thought of the Alan Parsons Project song from his Edgar Allan Poe album entitled \\"To One in Paradise.\\" Some of the same impressions I had upon hearing \\"Obscured by Clouds\\" are here, also; although I was more immediately enthusiastic about The Valley soundtrack than \\"On an Island.\\" My enthusiasm has definitely grown, however.    \\"On an Island\\" is a very thoughtful, beautiful, and emotional album. Give it a chance, and you will find yourself listening to it again and again. The album should easily withstand the test of time.    Oh yes...why do you narrow-minded Waters fans keep buying, or at least listening to David Gilmour albums, anyway? You guys ARE smart, aren't you?
0451169514|5.0|This is one of Kings finest books. Right up there with The Shining and Pet Cemtery as his 3 best books! I read his book whenI was 10(3 years ago), which is when I had a short attention span. I found it to be okay but too long for my tastes. I reread it a year later and found it to be one of my favorite books! Derry seems to be a very bizzare town. I can't explain it... but there's something really strange about it(which is what I assume Beverly was trying to get at when she was saying that something was wrong with Derry). It's cool how Stephen made every main character encounter It(whose actual name is Penny). Take note, as in most horror stories, the killer is usually just affecting one person, and if all of the main characters friends are just killed off. In It, every character is affected and has a fear of It built for It to feed on and eventually kill.<br /><br /> Still, the main character is clearly Bill Denbrough. He's the main character mostly because of his fair grudge against Penny: murdering his little brother. His frineds are, at the same time, helping him to get revenge, getting back at It for the things It did to them, and protecting all the kids in Derry from It.<br /><br /> It's funny reading all the one-star reviews saying that the book is so bad just because it's long and that you shouldn't read it simply because it's \\"morbid.\\" ALRIGHT MORONS!!!!!!! The one-star reviewers either have no interest in horror whatsoever, have short attention spans, or can't live with the fact that some people have different opinions than them. I have a suggestion for all of you: Why don't you go into the sewers with Penny? I hear that everything floats down there!
B000002J6H|5.0|This CD contains 2 of the greatest guitarists ever. Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton.<br /><br />With Stills at his creative peak this is a classic folk, rock, blues combined album.<br /><br />A must get.
B000AP04OM|5.0|What else can be said of a classic?  It does not disappoint!
B000AMJDHY|5.0|I see some people giving this band bad reviews just because they became popular are because the lead singers voice sounds like that dreaded Fall Out Boy's lead singer. That fact may be true, but I for one can't stand Fall Out Boy, but I love this band. At times this cd does come over a bit cliche, but they do it so well. This band is not my type of music at all. but I can't help but like them. They are so catchy and the Cd is put togethor very well. Like other reviews have said.. this band doesn't write lyrics containing; love sick tragedies about their g/f's. They write lyrics about modern day music and how everyone is trying to mold them into something they're not. I'm convinced that this band is exactly what Fall Out Boy would have became if they would have mixed dance elements into their music instead of whiny g/f lyrics like every other band these days. I truly love this band and they never fail when it comes to putting me in a good mood.. I look forward to seeing more of this band in the future. If you're still reading this review, stop. BUY THE CD. The price is unbeatable.
0156027321|3.0|This book was good and unlike anything I have ever read, but probably would have been better had I read it with a book club as there are so many themes within the story that would lead to much spirited discussion.  Let me say that this author is so talented, his writing style is fluid and easy to fall into even in the beginning before Pi left Pondicherry, India and the topic of zoology dominated the pages.  I love Pi Patel.  His character is as real as any you'd meet on the street.  It is he and Richard Parker that I will remember from this reading experience.
B00004Y6O7|4.0|By this time, Eddie and Dave were not getting along too well. Eddie wanted to branch out and experiment, while Dave wanted to stick to the same sound the band always had. So what we got was an album that was overall darker and moodier, but still just as great! Mean Street is an awesome rocker. It starts off with very fast playing by Eddie, you can practically hear the frustration and anger when he plays this. I love when Dave goes \\"Lord strike that poor boy down!\\" Dirty Movies is another good rock song, a bit mediocre, but pretty good. So This is Love and Sinner's Swing are both killer and upbeat rockers, when you hear them you really want to get up and just rock out.  <br /> <br />Unchained is an awesome and catchy tune, probably the only one off of the album that people will know. It could have fit in on one of their earlier albums since it is not as dark as some of the other songs on this album. Push Comes to Shove is kind of odd, it has more of a funk feel, it is different but interesting. Hear About it Later has a nice, slow intro. It's very emotional, but afterwards, the song picks up into a melodic rocker. Sunday Afternoon in the Park is an eerie instrumental, the whole song is basically some creepy keyboard sounds. It was totally different for Van Halen at the time. The song goes straight into One Foot Out the Door, which is a fiery and intense rocker. Aw, screw hard rock, we may as well just call this song heavy metal. There are keyboards in the background, but these are the happy keyboards from songs like Jump and Dreams, these keyboards are darker. Dave sings like he is about ready to kill, and Eddie's solo at the end is fast and furious. I really can't think of anything else to say except that YOU NEED TO BUY THIS ALBUM PRONTO!!! <br /> <br />
0375713751|3.0|Despite being very witty and well-presented, this book wasn't the fun and relaxing read one expects from British chick-lit. I found myself feeling downright exhausted and stressed-out reading about Kate's difficulties juggling a high-powered job and her home, as though I had been through the ringer myself. Perhaps I took this story far more seriously than the author intended, but I have problems being sympathetic towards a character who puts her career ahead of her family. Why bother to have children if you are going to have someone else raise them, especially a flaky nanny? And why bother to get married if you can't properly nurture the relationship or be attentive towards your partner's feelings and needs? Kate's blatent neglect of her family didn't sit well with me. I also had problems with her super-woman mindset: why attempt so many things only to spread herself so thin that she couldn't do a satsifactory job at any of them? On top of it all, she put unnecessary pressure and guilt upon herself, fretting over insignificant things like providing homemade goodies instead of store-bought ones to her child's class. The time and energy wasted on appearances and what other people think could have been put towards quality family time or other more important uses!<br /><br />For a story to evoke such powerful feelings and a strong reaction, it must be very well-written! It certainly made me think about what's important in life, and about setting priorities so that the children and family life doesn't suffer at the expense of a career or lifestyle. It's too high a price to pay.  As a working mother, I certainly didn't sacrifice to the extreme Kate did and was able to find a better balance in life, and therefore couldn't relate to many of the problems I felt she brought upon herself with unrealistic goals!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I love this series.  I don't know why I never saw it on TV.  I saw the movie then was told about the series.  LOVE IT!!!! AND Amazon got it to me so quick.  I LOVE AMAZON TOO!!
B00005JN0T|5.0|Personally, I thought this movie was very cool.  I'm not familiar with Isaac Asimov, so I can't speak from the perspective of someone who has read his books.  I don't know how much or how little it matches up with the books.  But from someone who hasn't read the books, I thought the movie was very good.  You don't have to listen to anyone's advice about it though, go check it out yourself.
B000AMUU94|3.0|Previously issued as three separate discs, this set covers Bowie's career through 1987.  This ignores the last 20 years, in which Bowie released eight albums.<br /><br />If you're a casual fan, the 2-disc \\"Best of Bowie\\" is a better bet.  It includes all the hits and features selections from the later albums such as \\"Tin Machine\\", \\"Outside\\", and \\"Hours\\".<br /><br />The four disc box set \\"Sound and Vision\\" covers the whole of Bowie's career (so far) but leaves off \\"Fame\\" and \\"Let's Dance\\", while including two or three rarities.<br /><br />This leaves \\"The Platinum Collection\\" squarely in the middle. All the hits are here, although many of them are radio edits, which may be jarring if you're used to the full-length cuts.  (The edit on \\"Young Americans\\" is particularly weird, and to my knowledge has never appeared on CD before.)<br /><br />For the completist, this set includes a handful of rarities, some of which are unavailable elsewhere (\\"John, I'm Only Dancing Again 1975,\\" for example).<br /><br />This may be an ideal one-stop solution for a casual fan, if you're not interested in the last 20 years.  However, the 2-disc \\"Best of Bowie\\" is still a better choice, because it's more comprehensive and the full-length edits are all there.
B00003TL18|5.0|This is a fantastic concert by an artist that will never be replaced for matchless beauty of voice. Every song is a symphony when sung by Mr. Orbison. Backed by the all-star cast makes it even more priceless!
B000244FDW|5.0|Of all the versions of Jane Austen's novel that have made the screen, this is the one that is truest to the novel.  All the characters ring true with fine performances from all concerned.  Forget the rest.  This is it.
6305603847|4.0|But I felt the need to respond to \\"The Baddest Critic's\\" review. <br />Brokeback mountain? That's simultaneously funny and sad. <br />In addition to that, I looked up what other reviews this person had made. Apparently they hate classic rock. Also - just incase you were still wondering whether their opinion mattered, let's have a look at an excerpt from one of their reviews for a Britney Spears CD: <br /> <br />Isn't it time you start trusting a mature and experienced critic like me? Isn't it time that you start lsitening to quality timeless music? Then get \\"...Baby One More Time.\\" You won't regret it. <br /> <br />... <br /> <br />*hem* <br /> <br />Anyway, as for the movie itself. I have mixed feelings about it. <br />I love some parts of the movie, and others I don't like that much. If you like the album, you should definitely watch it though. You won't regret it if you do. The best parts in the movie make it worth watching, and watching it gives you a deeper understanding of the wall.  <br />Also, the scenes in the movie where Pink is a child are especially good. <br />In short, I do like this movie a lot, and anybody who likes the album The Wall should like it too, and will gain a deeper understanding of the album.
630542845X|5.0|I think this is a wonderful movie that can take one through many wonderful and upsetting emotions.  I think it can give humanity the hope that somewhere inside all of us, we all have to some extent the \\"gift\\" that Powder has.  Maybe one day, we'll all try and use \\"our energy\\" to the best of our ability just as Jesus Christ (whether you believe in him as God or not) is still trying to show us by his word; he had the faith that one day, we can all get in touch with our humanity to change the world if we would all only do it.  I disagree with one person's view that the shower scene had an homosexual feel to it.  I think it was related to Powder's longing to have his body look like the guy's body in the shower so he wouldn't have as hard of a time fitting in this world.  I think there was an admiration on Powder's part, and in this instance, I think it's easy to misinterpret is and sexualize it.  A beautiful film that says it all in a dramatic and even pace.
B00005T5YK|5.0|An excellent addition to any Eagle fan's collection. Set up your surround sound speakers and sit in the middle and listen to the music from all sides. There are differences to the album some of the guitars sound different (Try and Love Again) and some of the guitar licks aren't so prominant (Life in the Fast lane). But there are many guitar and intrument sounds that you just don't hear on the cd version. It is like listening to the album as new again. Have a listen and enjoy.
0792164903|5.0|I LOOOOOVEEE this movie, i always loved the story of The Legend of Sleepy Hollow in all its formats, from the made-for-TV version starring Jeff Goldbloom as Ichabod Crane to the Disney mini-classic of the story, this has always been one of my favorite scary halloween tales. I remember when the film first was announced and i saw the commercials, i was sooooo excited to see that tim burton would be making a live action version! of course, this is a very different take on the tale. lots of blood and gore, and yes, you may be thinking \\"whhhhooaa! that wasnt in the book!\\", well i know it isnt, but before you think this means the film is just a stupid freddy krueger-type slasher, think again. this movie has two things that makes it absolutly spectacular to experience: GREAT style and GREAT music score. Elfman is just.............SUPERB in this one. his music is so emotional, so SCARY and DARK. gives you goosebumps, and it stays with you. His music is superb. theres no question about it. and he seems to be at his best when hes working on Tim Burton movies. the movie follows ichabod crane who is a kind of detective/invesitgator for the law in this version and he is sent (by Christopher Lee!!) to a little town called Sleepy Hollow where cases of \\"decapitations\\" have been happeneing and is told to solve this mystery. Well, it turns out a myseterious figure called the Headless Horesman is cutting off peoples heads left and right. The plot deepens, and it really is a shocking surprise. this is a very suspenseful, atmospheric horror movie that has such great set designs, great acting, VERY atmospheric (lots of fog, hardly any sunlight, lots of dead trees and everything very dark), this movie has it all for a big horror fan and while it does have some gross moments (personally, i think they are scary as hell), it really is done so well that it grabs you and doesnt let go. the first scene in the movie makes hooks you in and it takes you on a real scary ride! if your a Tim Burton fan, this is a must see. if your just a movie fan looking for a GREAT horror movie with style and substance, you NEED to tsee this. so well done!! Kudos to Burton, Elfman and Co. Ill never forget when i first saw this on video when it came out (i couldnt bear to see it in the movie theater), and i had nightmares about it! i thought i'd never be able to watch it again, but now i find myself watching this great horror flick on a monthly basis! its sooo good. The only thing i wasnt crazy about in this movie was chistina ricci. how did she get this part anyways? she was pretty stiff, as someone else has mentioned, and she was just annoying. she didnt even kiss ichbod or anything! she just wasnt great. but hey! one dumb actress doesnt make this movie any more worse, johnny depp is funny and very cool and he gives alot of humour and great acting to the story. michael gough (who played alfred in Burtons Batman movies) is in here as well, along with miranda richerdson, and that other actor who also was the fther in tim burtons other classic \\"Beeatlejuice\\". many great perfomances in this one, so just cuz the love was lame cuz of ricci doesnt make this a bad film. i still give it 5 stars, great movie-making.
B00004Y6NT|5.0|Communique is a perfect reflection of where they were at the time.  My dad always used to be into sultans of swing but felt that knopfler was a poor singer.  Let's face it, he isn't the best singer but he is one fantastic musician, up there with neil hannon, brian wilson etc. And it's the music on communique that gets you going, I've loved this album ever since I had it on vinyl.  News, Where Do You Think You're Going, Angel of Mercy are all classic tracks but there's nothing disappointing on here.
B00005M91K|4.0|This movie was recomended to me by a website article as one of the ten movies that were a must see for photographers. I must agree, the images are stunning! The 70mm format used by the filmmaker captures scenes like nothing else, the soundtrack can get a little tedious but it is well worth the view.
0385513755|5.0|There's not a soul in the world who would regret this purchase!  It was a great book to read even without the illustrations, but WITH the illustrations deems this book positively captivating!  Having the pictures included ensures that all references made by Dan Brown are right there at your fingertips.  And contrary to the reason many people avoid The Da Vinci Code, this book enlightens without attempting to destroy one's belief in the Almighty.  I could (and will) read this book over and over!
0062502182|4.0|I though the Alchemist was a really good story it has a lot to do with people finding their personal legend in life. Its a really good book for all ages I just finished it and gave it to my Stepdad to read. When he is done I will probably read it again. If you have a chance to read this you should its not that hard to read and its a fun book. The next book I'm going to read is probably one by the same author because I like his way of writing.
B00000272N|5.0|Facelift was the start to alice in chains with their more hair metal start over their grungey end(Tripod). all of the songs are magnificent but nothing about torture yet and this is really good with the variety but personally their music is better with the torture of layne.    We Die Young 9.5/10 Great start with a heavy riff by jerry and then some awesome lyrics by layne lead to one of their best songs sadly though i heard the remastered version first and when i first got this album i thought it was crap and they messed it up etc.    Man in the Box 9.3/10 One of their most popular songs and the emotion is great. this song is great however the start is easy to do on a guitar which is un-alice in chainsistic. but overall a good song      Sea of Sorrow 9.4/10 A less heavy song but is a very good song with great lyrics too bad this got no radio time    Bleed the Freak 9.1/10 While i didnt like this song until the live version its still really good and sadly has yet no radio airtime    I Can't Remember 6.1/10 Too much of a filler and competly ruins the great beggining to the album    Love Hate Love 9.9/10 One of my favorite on the album and the live version is one of the best ever all the emotion and probably their only love song even though its a hating type of love song its great    It Aint Like That 9.5/10 See this is one of the best songs but love hate love makes it look bad    Sunshine 6.7/10 Dang it its of course a filler and not too many will tell you that they like it.    Put You Down 8.7/10 Brings back some heavy but not enough    Confusion 9.8/10 When i saw it said that mike starr is only the backing vocals i thought well it must be really good in all. i was not surprised at all. the song is great and i dont see why many dont like it.    I Know Somethin (bout you) 10/10 Awesome in short the chorus is  awesome and the bass thump made the career of mike starr before inez came    Real Thing 9.1/10 I think that it is good however it's long as h*ll but its deinetlyabout his past      As you can see this is great.
0671510991|3.0|I'm an (unemployed) agronomist and I'm a brazilian.I read this book translated to the portuguese, here in Brazil.This book covers centuries of world's history.This book is easy to read, even being a little long. <br />The failures of this book really exists.One of then is the author's passion for machiavelics such as Cardinal Richelieu. <br />The machiavelic politic can be good during, a life.The Christian politic on the opposite can be bad, during one life, but becames good for rest of history.Richelieu died powerfull, but his poltic for Germany was the beginning of two World wars, centuries later.The Dutch's politics for Indonesia, linking to islamics kingdons, seems good in XVII century.Today, Indonesia is a \\"hot bed\\" for islamic terror.The England's decision to help Iran in a war against catholic Portugal was good, in XVII Century.Now we think and know that, this decision was clear a bad decision. <br />In other words:a interest's polics can be good during his life, but if this decision is against God's will, the result is bad in long term. <br />The author of this book, Henry Kissinger (a jew), can be showed as an exemple of this reallity.Mr. Kissinger supported the link between Iran and USA.Henry Kissinger also supported the invasion of East Timor by Indonesia in 1975.The Kissinger's politics for Iran gave billions of US dollars to USA, but it also help the ascension of Khomeini.The Kissinger's politics for East Timor was the begining of a terrible genocide, by islamics against catholic population in East Timor.Good business in short time, but terrible results in a few decades.

B0009S4IHY|5.0|Stephen Chow hasn't stopped amazing me. His other movie Shaolin Soccer about the Kung Fu master trying to find a life's purpose and does so by incorperating Kung Fu into Soccer was a good story and quite funny. But his new story for Kung Fu Hustle had a more serious tone to it. I really enjoyed the story a lot more in this installment. The scenery for the time period was done well and the comedy was not overpowering but just right. If you've seen some of his other films this one may shock just a little when serious parts occur but this film is nevertheless one that is done quite well and should be given a good review for it.
0670033375|5.0|Wow, can't say enough of Diamond's book \\"Collapse\\". Along with his previous book \\"Guns,Germs and Steel\\", he portrays a vivid forecast for our societies and our environment. I believe that Diamond has a firm grasp of the whole Earth picture, albeit scary. His books are a wake up call for everyone.... <br /> <br />Hey, wake up everybody!!!
B00009V7P8|4.0|There are some songs on the album that I really enjoy to listen to. He's got a very \\"interesting\\" way of singing; that being said he does sing off note quite a few times. I do enjoy this different type of singing though I know some that clearly don't mainly because of his \\"difference\\". There are a few songs that I don't care all that much about but the ones that I do, I really do. Overall it is very good.
B000E1YVZU|4.0|I don't want to disturb the ebb and flow for the Rent heads who love everything Rent.  I admit I never saw the play and never heard about the tragic events surrounding the playwrite/composer.  But to be honest and post an honest opinion I didn't get into the story until La Vie Boheme.  The whole first act (except the opening number) I just wasn't feeling it.  Then maybe I don't see enough musicals to judge.  I did love Chicago's film adaptation and admittedly it took me a minute to get into Phantom of the Opera's movie too. (but that's a different review for a different day.)  When everyone calmed down from singing so much and took time to tell me truely what the story was about, I was all right.  On second viewing, I liked it much better--so it grows on you.  This movie will tug at your heart and I like the overall message to love big and live big.  Take care of your friends and they'll take care of you. Recommeded.
B000000WG4|5.0|I first heard this in the Mid-70s and have loved it from then until now. It has been 15 years since I heard it, and the CD was beautiful. It was great.
B000BB1MIC|5.0|I got hooked on the Gilmore Girls after a friend gave me Season 1 for Christmas.  The fast, witty, incredibly funny dialogue really kept me interested and I grew to love the show very quickly. <br /> <br />Season 5 finally gives us what we've been waiting for for 4 years:  Luke and Lorelai.  Though there are bumps along the way, the season ends with quite the surprise! <br /> <br />The rest of the cast is, as usual, fantastic and you can't help but love them all.  This is one of the best ensemble casts on TV in a very long time.  While Lorelai and Rory are the main characters, they couldn't exist without the rest of Star's Hollow or their family.   <br /> <br />Should you buy season 5 of the Gilmore Girls?  Only if you've seen the first 4!  And you really should!
0767812387|4.0|I usually stay away from the chick-flick genre that I was forced to watch with my ex-wife, daughter and, prior to that various and sundry dates...but, from the first viewing of this contagiously exciting film, I was drawn into the world of proffesional Latin dancing. I readily admit that my initial interest was to see Vanessa, since, in my opinion, she makes too few films. But, the infectious sountrack and the easy-looking, but incredibly intricate dance performances of Chayanne and crew, made me say, to quote a line from the film, \\"I want to do that, too!\\"<br /><br />Chayanne, who is probably a superstar in latin circles, gives a utilitarian acting performance, however appealing his personality, and this whole movie was never in danger of being an oscar contender, however, I reiterate, the dance sequences are exilerating. A solid family movie, and with the popularity of \\"Dancing With the Stars,\\" should be a must-see for fans of that show.
B000055ZB8|5.0|There's an art to it, definitely, the whole business of frightening the audience. I'm no fan of slash-gash-scream-gore type films, but when the terror is part of a tapestry most delicately woven, a piece that is subtle and blatant, a love story and a horror story, a gripping and shocking piece where the opening of a door becomes a  moment of nail-biting tension... then it's not a slash-film but a film of art.<br /><br />\\"Nosferatu\\" has been described as the greatest horror film of all time. I cannot disagree - Murnau's remarkable use of double-negatives and his various lighting techniques impart such a wonderful sense of the macabre to this film. The acting varies - the young estate agent is no Olivier, but oh mon Dieu... oh, Max Schreck... what a superb performance his Graf Orlock is.<br /><br />It's the creepiest performance of a vampire that has ever been seen. The makeup is wonderful - the atmosphere is wonderful - the truly frightening creature who is almost uncontrollable at the sight of fresh blood is wonderful in a grisly sense.<br /><br />This is a film not to be missed. Whether you are a fan of the horror genre or not, Nosferatu is a classic in film-making.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|I shouldn't be shocked that some here have really trashed this album.  Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and my opinion of them is that they are obtuse and incapable of accepting anything that doesn't sound like The Wall or DSOTM.  Get over it people.  Those amazing albums will never even come close to being duplicated.  David brings us a super smooth, and super mellow album.  He is an aging rocker, and like many of his contemporaries he has produced a solo album that isn't injected with 30 year old testosterone-laden songs.  It is well arranged and has rich textures and soundscapes, and David's voice is as smooth as ever.  Polly does fine work on the lyrics, contrary to what others here have said about them.  I agree that when David and Roger worked together, they were a perfect example of the whole being much bigger than the individual parts.  But so what.  That Floyd magic lives on, but will never be equalled again.  So enjoy this album for what it is...no delusions of grandeur, no attempts to slide a fast one past anybody.  It is a personal endeavor for Gilmour and for those who enjoy it will enjoy it immensely.  For those who don't (there will always be the few), too bad for your close-mindedness.  Looking forward to seeing you, David, in Chicago in April!
B0002KPIKA|5.0|What a delight this DVD is!<br /><br />The instrumental playing and conducting are wonderful and appropriate, providing excellent support for the equally wonderful and appropriate cast. Each member not only sounds right, but all of them sound right, too.<br /><br />Right? More than right. Veronique Gens is utterly admirable as the scheming Agrippina - she looks beautiful, and that lovely caramel-and-champagne voice of hers is wonderfully right for the role. Her not-quite-as-intelligent-yet-scheming son Nerone is beautifully portrayed by Philippe Jaroussky, and particularly as he warms up, he sings delightfully. I particularly enjoyed his final aria, a killer of an aria that requires precise and fast control.<br /><br />As the pair of flattering courtiers interested in somehow gaining Agrippina and licking the boots of whoever is in power, Fabrice di Falco and Bernard Deletr&eacute; are good indeed, and in their personas as well as their singing, they convey the right blend of seriousness and comedy required.<br /><br />Ingrid Perruche is a charming Poppea - I do agree with the review below that the voice does not really soar, but after a reasonably good start, she gets even better. Shorter than the statuesque Ms Gens, Ms Perruche presents a vivacious and pretty Poppea.<br /><br />Claudio himself is beautifully sung and played by Nigel Smith, whose attempted seductions of Poppea are deliciously hilarious to watch - do not miss his crawling across the floor as he hems in the reluctant Poppea whose major concern is whether Agrippina will arrive in time to thwart her husband's lovemaking. Wonderfully done!<br /><br />The sympathetic role of Ottone is sung by Thierry Gr&eacute;goire - and beautifully, too. He cuts a heroic figure (the only honest one in the whole bunch!) and he is willing to give up the throne of Rome for love of Poppea. (Never mind about the historical reality - this is Handel, not the true history - be prepared to have fun rather than take notes.) His singing has moments of very great beauty indeed, and he looks right for the part, too.<br /><br />The faintest of drawbacks may be seen in the backdrops, which are inexplicable, but thankfully for the most part one doesn't even see them. The setting itself is simple, a minimum of blocks on the stage - and this detracts not one whit from the beautifully acted, beautifully sung opera.<br /><br />All in all... so delightful that it's a keeper. I'll be watching this DVD again. More like this, please!nging has moments of very great beauty indeed, and he looks right for the part, too. <br /> <br />The faintest of drawbacks may be seen in the backdrops, which are inexplicable, but thankfully for the most part one doesn't even see them.

B000E6UK5K|4.0|HELLO EVERYONE: WELL WE FINALLY HAVE SOME NEW PRODUCT THAT'S RECOGNIZABLE ALMOST AS PINK FLOYD BUT AS IT TURNS OUT IT'S THE VOICE AND GUITAR OF THAT LEGENDARY BAND. DAVID GILLMOUR'S \\"ON AND ISLAND\\" IS A MORE MELLOW REFLECTIVE OUTING COMPARED TO THE FAMOUS ALBUMS OF HIS PAST BUT THE FLOYD TRADEMARKS ARE THERE. THE ATMOSPHERICS OF CASTELLORIZON AND THE BRETHTAKING MOODY VOCALS OF ON AN ISLAND SEEM RIGHT OUT OF THE FLOYD HANDBOOK OF MEDDLE AND OBSCURED BY CLOUDS ERA FLOYD. THE REST OF THE ALBUM IS MORE LAID BACK WITH THE RELAXING ACOUSTIC SMILE AND THE BEAUTIFUL ENDING OF WHERE WE START REALLY MAKES ONE APPRECIATE THE TRUE LOVE BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN.  <br /> <br />IF YOU ARE EXPECTING DARKSIDE TO WALL ERA FLOYD YOU WON'T LIKE THIS ALBUM BUT IF YOU LIKED THE MORE LAID BACK EFFORTS OF ACOUSTIC PINK FLOYD MIXED IN WITH SOME MODERN INSTRUMENTAL FLOURISHES THEN YOU WILL CERTAINLY BE PLEASED. I THINK DAVID ACCOMPLISHED WHAT HE WANTED WITH THIS ALBUM. HE GAVE US FLOYD FANS JUST ENOUGH OF THE ATMOSPHERIC EAR CANDY WE ASSOCIATE WITH THE FLOYD YET MADE A MORE MELLOW LAID BACK PERSONAL RECORD THAT A MUSCIAN WHO IS ENJOYING THE FRUITS OF LOVE AND CONTENTMENT CAN SHARE WITH FAMILY AND FANS ALIKE. WELL DONE DAVID AND I HOPE YOU WILL TOUR THE UNITED STATES SOON. SHINE ON EVERYBODY! <br />
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I want to start by saying I loved this movie.  It was not really true to the book, however.  I hadn't read the book in over 20 years and so pulled it off the shelf to reread it.  They certainly used many quotes from the book, however it was rarely the correct character who spoke them.  Still, it was a lovely movie.  They made Mr. Darcy seem more awkward and nervous than haughty.  He was definitely not as sweet in the book.  He was a snob.  That doesn't seem as obvious in this adaptation.  I hope many people enjoy the film and will read the book as well.  Both are a delight!
B00005JO1R|4.0|This movie biopic merits praise simply because Hollywood Movies these days are nothing but garbage.  This film is stunningly photographed, though the direction could have been better. Everything is done at a shot and clip pace which is a little distracting.  But the actors and their performances outshine the film's flaws.  Joaquin Phoenix deserved the Oscar for this performance in this film!!  He is incredible and I feel he was robbed.  Reese Witherspoon, is a charming, perky, sassy and pretty June and while I certainly agree that her performance is Oscar noteworthy, I feel it should have gone to Joaquin instead if they were going to choose one over the other.  Nonetheless, the performances especially during the music scenes which are fantastic, give us a great take on The Man in Black and His Woman!!  Well done!!
B000777J2S|2.0|I was taken aback hearing this for the first time. Judging from the voice, I thought he was black - it is a soulful croon. The album has its moments, but the vibrato gets old after awhile and most of the cuts sound alike. Boy George sounds awful - a far, far shadow of his former self. He sounds like he fell out of bed after a binge of drugs and booze. This \\"sensitive\\" singer should have thanked Bryan Ferry in the credits b'cos that's who he's bloody ripping off.
B00005JNNZ|5.0|The best thing about this dvd was how cystal clear the picture and the sound is. <br /> <br />Also as you know I enjoyed every second of it........... <br /> <br /> <br />Continue the excellent work and job that you are doing <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Lady \\"T\\"
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I have never seen the play RENT but went to the opening day showing of the movie with several of my rent-head friends. It was one of the most amazing movies I had ever seen. The muisic combined with the heartfelt story of seven friends united by their love of a good time combined with their everyday struggle with AIDS whether they themselves have it or their friend has it. It is a truely touching story illustrating the finer points of true friendship and the hardships that people without an income living with AIDS face on a daily basis.
B000001ESF|5.0|RUSH were amongst my favorite Canadian groups along with TRIUMPH and 2112 is one of their best albums after FLY BY NIGHT and their epic debut album.This contains anthems like SOMETHING FOR NOTHING and THE TEMPLES OF SYRINX.very highly recommended.get all three albums.Thanks.
B00003CXCW|5.0|Although William Holden and Erich von Stroheim gave great performances,  it is Swanson who lights this film's bulb.  Perhpas Billy Wilder had a little to do with it,  although \\"Some Like It Hot\\" is another dud,  I have to say that it is Swanson who IS this film.<br /><br />Her acting is a template that NO other actress today can use.  Most don't have the skill to act today.  Swanson acts the viewer into bliss.  She is perfect.  Her vocal character and physical mannerisms are superb as well,  only complimenting her presence on screen.<br /><br />I feel I've been priviledged to view this film.  It has truly entertained me and will continue to do so.  It is unmatched,  should I say Swanson is.....
B000002JS6|5.0|BACK IN BLACK is my favourite albums with Brian Johnson.this is a terrific album with songs like BACK IN BLACK,YOU SHOOK ME ALL NIGHT LONG.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.GET IT TODAY.
006056251X|5.0|I think the contrast between Evie and Sebastian can't be more pronounced and that what makes this novel a real great read. I read one not-so-good review and the other two novels although also very well written seemed more on thr typical of current novels were women are somewhat stubborn headed. But what makes this truly my favorite is how love can transform a person into loving something that one didnt expect. This is purely magic. As for that one reviewer who said that Evie is boring. There are still few girls around who is  quite like her and they are also quite rare. Need I remind you that Sebastian fell in love with Evie because she was different and innocent. He was already bored into having affairs with women who are exactly her opposite because they seemed to be quite common!
B00008BXJ6|5.0|High Voltage has always been the most underrated album from the aussie superstar but it is fantastic containing hits like TNT,THE JACK and IT'S A LONG WAY TO THE TOP.Highly recommended.
B000E0WJIC|5.0|I had never even heard of this band until about a week ago. I bought this cd because a friend of mine recommended it and he has almost the same taste in music as I do. After I listened to it I couldn't believe that I had never heard of this band. I felt embarrassed. This cd is so good that I look forward to what this band will offer in the future. I don't have a favorite song on this cd, the whole thing is good and I recommend that when you put it on listen to it from the start to the finish, don't skip ahead to any one track in particular. If you have to do that with some cds then that is a sign that the album is not that great. That is not the case with this cd. It reminded me of the first time I listened to the band HIM. I was just speechless.
B00008BXJG|5.0|HIGHWAY TO HELL is most certainly the best album from this great aussie heavy metal band and should rank amongst the greatest albums of all time due to songs like HIGHWAY TO HELL.TOUCH TOO MUCH and SHOT DOWN IN FLAMES.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B00003CWPL|3.0|This movie seems typical of David Lynch in that it makes little sense but is totally unforgettable. His movies seem to focus on the visual aspect rather than a story line, and this movie did just that. The entire movie made me actually uncomfortable. If you are looking for a story line, this is not the movie for you, but if you are a fan of David Lynch, then by all means you must add this to your collection. It is a great movie for debate, confusion, and some laughter.
B0000033P0|5.0|TARKUS is a great album amongst their best after their brilliant debut.this is prog rock at it's best.get both albums to day.Highly recommended.
B00013F35I|5.0|I've been to 3 Bruce concerts, and this DVD concert is better than any I went to. The power, and passion Bruce and the entire band exert is energizing, especially in the opening song \\"The Rising\\". The addition of Suzie Tyrell to the band is as Bruce sings on \\"Crush On You\\" c'est manifique! She delivers a sound, and a warm-friendly look which captured my attention. This concert DVD is a must see. I'm just praying it will be digitally mastered to CD, because I'll be the first to purchase it.
B00000JQFM|5.0|This album showcases a brilliant musician at the height of his powers and is probably his best album; at the very least, it's my favourite work of his as it manages to show the versatility and technical proficiency of Joe in 10 fabulous tracks.<br /><br />From the speedy pyrotechnics of the first track \\"Surfing With the Alien\\" replete with everything from wah-pedal to wild tremolo bar vibrato to two-handed tapping to the mellow, sentimental \\"Always With Me, Always With You\\" which is also replete with vibrato and two-handed tapping but in a more subdued and always accessible manner.<br /><br />Taking a page from another guitar great, Jeff Beck, Joe has his own answer to \\"Jeff's Boogie\\", the original standard for flash guitar playing, with \\"Satch Boogie\\", raising the bar even higher for what makes a brilliant guitar boogie-woogie showcase. Where Eddie Van Halen does acoustic guitar tapping on \\"Spanish Fly\\" from \\"Van Halen II\\", Joe does his version on \\"Midnight\\" to great effect.<br /><br />What I like about Joe as well is his great humility and generosity. He doesn't keep what he knows to himself like a trade secret but he openly shares his knowledge and is a great guitar teacher. He's had Steve Vai and Kirk Hammett among his long list of admirers and students and he continues to inspire guitar enthusiasts and guitarists like myself after all these years.<br /><br />This version of the album has been very well remastered and the sound quality is hence very good. Very highly recommended if you like rock guitar instrumental music and essential listening if you are an aspiring rock guitarist.
B000B8QEYC|1.0|I truely adore Enya's music.  I have almost everything she has done and listen to them repeatedly.  In fact, she is my favorite choice to listen to in the dentist's chair while undergoing nitrous oxide!  However, this one left me cold (with the exception of track #7, which is very pretty).  The songs and music on this album lack the grace, lyrical qualities, enchantment, and ability to carry me away that the rest of her music manages effortlessly to do. One of Enyas most ardent fans, I'm sorry to say, was let down big by this one.
6305513414|3.0|Gene Roddenberry's moralising continues on Vol 2 with 2 more great episodes.  In \\"Mudd's Women\\" we are introduced to the likeable villain Harry Mudd who tries to sell wives to lonely miners except that the women only keep their beauty with regular intake of pills.  Why Harry doesn't get normal girls to begin with isn't explained but I suppose we'll give them poetic license and get on to the overall moral which is to not judge a book by its cover and to seek out the beauty within.  On \\"The Enemy Within\\", the moral seems to be to accept that we all have good and bad parts of our personality but the secret to success and happiness is to control both impulses for good and evil to hopefully end up with a synergistic, \\"whole greater than the sum of its parts\\" situation.  Not among the stronger episodes in the entire series but not among the worse either and so recommended.
B000003S5H|4.0|I'm a big fan of trip-hop, so I was thrilled to stumble on this album.  It is great ambient music, no doubt.  But if you want the best of the genre, check out anything by Zero 7. You won't be disaappointed!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|great album. very mellow, unlike the more rock sounding mer de noms or the industrial feel of emotive. if you enjoy the mellow aspects of tool or a perfect circle you probably will enjoy this. if you only like the heavy, it may not necessarily be for you. it took a few listens for me to really appreciate it, but now i consider it to be a very solid release - probably i'd go as far to say as the best album from perfect circle (although it is difficult to pick between mers de noms and thirteenth step).
