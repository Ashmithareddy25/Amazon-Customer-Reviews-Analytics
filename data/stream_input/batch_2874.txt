B00A285OOW|5.0|I love reading about the Tudors, I find the family fascinating! I enjoyed this particular book because it covers Henry vii which Philippa's other books don't. This book fits in nicely with her other ones and leads directly into the constant princess, the book about Katherine of Aragon.
B00EAIMGDW|4.0|Like all of the best games, this starts off looking like simple kid stuff and gets harder and harder. As time goes on, you will find it increasingly difficult to collect the various treasures. *Not* an Angry Birds knock off, but look for the one small tribute. They need to make new levels for this as soon as humanly possible!
B00D7OMNXS|5.0|This film was entertaining and fun. People who are looking for a deep, cerebral film are looking in the wrong place coming into this film. This isn't a pretentious film trying to shove it's message down my throat. It's a film that says \\"hey man, do you want to be entertained?\\" and I'm all like \\"YEAH! Entertain me movie!\\" And it was all like, \\"ok get ready for some superhero fun!\\" And then I was all like \\"thanks movie, you sure were fun!\\" And then the nurse was all like \\"are you ready for your pills today sir? Your not still talking to your movies are you?\\" And I was all like \\"nope.\\" So anyway, the pretentious message of this review is to not lie to the nurse or they'll up your dose. Great fun film.
B001MEJY8W|3.0|I was recommended this movie along with \\"Inside\\" I watched Inside first. It was stupid. So my expectations for this one was not too high. I have to say. I' glad they proved me wrong. This movie, unlike Inside, actually has a plot. It's about a girl named Lucie who was being tortured and she escaped. She was then place into an orphanage where she meets Anna and the two become best friends (with one wanting more). years later Lucie tracks down the people responsible and well, things doesn't end too happy for them.<br /><br />I won't spoil much but the movie was very good, the acting was top notch. The pacing was good. It kept us interested for a long time. No one was falling asleep on this one.<br /><br />However, this movie does suffer its problems. It makes characters do stupid things to push the plot along. For example, One girl wanted to hurry up and leave the house, yet after certain events she just lingers and lingers and lingers because the plot needs her to stay.<br /><br />The last maybe 30 mins of the movie was a nightmare, but not the good or scary kind. it was boring as hell and went on for far too long. We didn't need it, it was pointless, it was trying to make a statement that was stupid. It's like I was watching a bunch of filler crap. And honestly, the whole \\"it's an organization\\" plot shock isn't much of a shock when the reason behind this \\"organization\\" is retarded. it's like the last 30 mins tried to be Hostel but was too afraid to just take the idea so they had to come up with their own excuse for this organization which was not nearly as good or even well thought out as Hostel. We were all sitting there going \\"Really? That's what this is about?\\" Honestly, before the last 30 minutes I was ready to give it five stars but those last minutes that dragged on and freaking on with pretentious religious babble and torture was mind numbing. The person who recommended this movie claimed people walked out the screening cause they were so affected by what they saw but honestly I think they walked out ont he last 30 mins of this movie cause it freaking sucked.y saw but honestly I think they walked out ont he last 30 mins of this movie cause it freaking sucked.
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|My daughter was so excited when this doll arrived in the mail!  She's perfect..lot's of little pieces as most of these dolls have.  Her hair is the perfect shade and her outfit is to DIE for!!! :)
B009AY04A8|4.0|I have been playing in the no penalty mode, and I am enjoying the game. I like that there are several types of games to play: find matching items, solve puzzles, search by silhouette,search by word,etc. I like searching with a flashlight, it is a nice spin on a searching game. Kindle Fire HD.
B000PMG16U|5.0|Star Wars is very deep, not simply about wars in the stars.  The prequels represents what is happening and what will happen in this country and the world (as you can see the empire gobbling up lands on the news as we speak) and how only a few cause all of the problems of most people, for their selfish, greedy reasons.<br /><br />I would advise everyone to pick up this version before the Disney versions slight revise some of the films in order to change some of the core meaning of the stories around.  I still don't believe that Lucas sold his nation changing creation (he was anti-Hollywood too) of his free will.  He did not look like a guy who wanted to sell, plus he gave away ALL of the money he was paid for Lucasfilm.  That alone says a lot!  If he was going to do that, he could have just given away LF to many people!  The films have meaning that reflect real life and the empire got to Lucas as well.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Really like this on my Kindle.  I check the weather frequently and it is helpful to have at a moment's glance
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder is a book about a boy that is ten and is going to school for the first time. 5th grade. August makes some friend at the beginning and loses some friends. But in the end the whole school is his friend. It is a great book
B007VUA7VO|5.0|A very convenient way to check how much battery is left in the Kindle.  I note the battery goes quickly and this helps to remind me to charge more often.  Wish the battery had more life
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Pretty good. I used to not really like horses. Now i like love them. My favorite part is dressing them up. Though it IS a little hard to get money. :(
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very good its like you get to expirence a minons life it's allot of fun but there's only one question how do you know if you won minon of the year
B009WUAK2M|5.0|excellent action, lots of action stars, great plot, unbelievable weapons, great fights non stop action with great one liners, must see!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Thoroughly researched.  Makes great use of the available historical evidence to give new insight and support his conclusions about The historical Jesus.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|great game but very hard to get any were with out having to buy some all the time. would be better if you could get more exp. points.
B004W89LS8|5.0|Foo fighters its my favorite band, they always rock hard and hard, this album is the best of all, love the foo's!
B004OXCL5Q|1.0|It is impossible to rate because I could not watch the movie. It only plays on european players, I could not play it on my American player
B0006PV5US|5.0|Beautiful performance and recording. Very lush sounding, with depth and quietness that accentuates the slow build-up of Bolero and intensifies the passion.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Ms. or Mrs. Suzanne Collins out did herself with the sequel to the Hunger Games. I rated this five stars if I could have rated it higher I would have this book is simply phenomenal. The book is suspense full, keeps you wanting more and difficult to put down. Has good amount of action, digs deep into the characters story it's a must read no dislike in this book and highly recommend able to everyone to read it
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|It works very well with my iphone and google nexus 7. The price is also reasonable. I strongly recommend it.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I started using this keyboard a few days ago. It is really easy to use and is accurate.<br />I kind of actually enjoy typing on it
0064471837|5.0|I first read Sabriel as a teenager, having only read books aimed  at a much younger audience than this. I remember it having quite an affect on me. It was a lot more adult than I was used to and the themes involving death , the Land of the Dead, for a young girl were quite a dark, though enthralling, change. At the time I was lucky to have never lost anyone I loved, so death was quite foreign to me. Still, Sabriel struck a cord with me and to this day I think of the series fondly.<br /><br />I'm used to thinking of Necromancers as bad or evil, they raise the dead to hurt others. Sabriel gives us a different way to see it. Sabriel is the perfect gateway for bringing young adults into more adult stories.<br />I've loved Sabriel (and the rest of the Old Kingdom) series ever since I first read them and fully intend to reread them for a long time to come.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|very good game. a must in any library of games. kinda  like the old gauntlet game.very goood game get it now
B00957T6X6|5.0|Not much to be said about this. Either you know of this story, or you don't. If you do, you either hate or love it. I love it, and wish I would have read it before the TV series(which I love also, by the way) started. Having said that, now that I have 3 seasons of the show, reading the books, its refreshing to see how much HBO has tried to stay true to the books. Hoping I can catch up and be ahead before season 4 starts, but that's a lot of reading!
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|What the He!!..... So which was it?  Remake, Sequel, or Prequel? Very disappointing. No remnants of the original film whatsoever!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Such a heartfelt story. I am a huge dog person and I really like the idea of where dogs go when they die. Gives hope.
B00CB2MT1S|5.0|So, I've made about 3 or 4 builds for myself and friends with this CPU.  Here's what I like:<br /><br />1) Unless you're a serious gamer, the integrated graphics on this thing are surprisingly boss. For something like HD video, you're not even REMOTELY cracking a sweat with this CPU.  Now, I don't suggest you play the latest generation of games set for maximum settings on this--it's certainly not good enough for that--but you'd be really hard pressed to do better than these graphics without buying a $100+ graphics card.<br /><br />2) You're still getting two cores on the Richland CPU series (so, I guess one Richland \\"unit\\").  Really quite snappy.  The next step down from this (with integrated graphics) from AMD would be something like an E-450 or E-350, and this thing thermonuclearly annihilates both of those.<br /><br />3) More than enough power for instantaneous web browsing/email/all the usual stuff, and even some of the modern games, if you can live without \\"maximum\\" settings.<br /><br />4) When this thing is going on full blast, CPU cores maxed out, pinned, the whole rig (including motherboard, etc) isn't even going to crack 100W.  This means it's a great choice for a little case with a little power supply, or what have you.<br /><br />In my view, it's just about the most amazing thing you can buy in the $50 range.  Here's some of the builds I have made with this CPU:<br /><br />1) Paired with an inexpensive micro-ATX motherboard, we built a RAID NAS/file server/mail server running on a Debian distro.  When all of these things are maximally in use at the same time, the CPU isn't even breaking a sweat.  My friend says this is much, much, much, much faster than he expected, and is much faster than the older refurbished computer he was going to use for the purpose.<br /><br />2) Built a computer for a kindergarten-aged child, who is mostly surfing the web and watching movies, on Windows 7.  Was a thousand times more than enough for that.<br /><br />3) Built a Windows 7 server/HTPC--not even cracking into the CPU's power when watching 1080p videos, etc.<br /><br />So yeah, if you're making an inexpensive build that is going to be devoted to run-of-the-mill, light-duty tasks, I give this three thumbs up.  The included cooler and fan is sufficient for this CPU--it's kind of a loud fan, though, when it's running at full--so you'll definitely want to run the CPU fan as low as possible (either in BIOS, or with something like Speedfan software).  Generally speaking, that's more than enough cooling on the A4-4000.  I'm not so sure I'd use this for a computer where I am going to frequently edit videos, rip DVD's to mp4, etc, or other max-use fully-threaded CPU applications.  But web browsing, file serving, videos watching, etc etc?  Slam dunk.<br /><br />Note: There *IS* an Intel Celeron (G1610) offering that is VERY SIMILAR to this.  In exchange for slightly worse graphics, you get slightly more CPU.  Compare and contrast before buying.  Motherboard availability is MUCH more diverse with the Intel CPU than with this AMD CPU.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is the best app ever. I love it every since I got my account I can't stop pinning. When I do, it's for far too long and I go on a pinning spree. There are so many things to look at especially the food. So many ideas and possibilities. Such a great app, you'll love it once you start pinning.
B005LAII4E|4.0|Ok just to be clear, this is an action flick so don't expect Academy Award plot and acting. With that in mind, I must say the samurai scene on the cliff is one of the best 3D action sequences I have yet to see on the big screen. How that will transfer to the small screen we will have to wait and see when it's released. Too many people go to shows like this and expect more than fun and action. I personally enjoyed the movie. Yes people it is a movie and the intent is entertainment. Suspend your grip on reality and enjoy.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Sheriff Longmire is the coolest and since I'm required to type more words .... sheriff longmire is the coolest guy ever.
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|Have a Bose Sounddock that was manufactured in 2004. This product allowed me to play streaming music from an Android phone, an iPhone 4s and iPad 2.  It sounds great. I highly recommend it.
B000FBJAEG|3.0|While Baldacci's writing is better than so many other authors', this book failed to enthrall. It was as if I could hear Baldacci thinking the story through. There are so many characters, and their appearances are so spaced out, that it became difficult to remember who they were when their names appeared chapters later.<br /><br />The hero is frequently propositioned by women, and yet, there's nothing irresistable about his character. He seems a nice guy, and Baldacci tells us he's handsome, but nothing in the writing shows me this. In fact, all the characters feel like what they are -- words on a page.<br /><br />In addition, the story is somewhat drawn out, so that I wanted Baldacci to hurry up and finish the darn thing! Nothing in Split Second made me roll my eyes, and I finished the book, but I was easily able to put it down between readings.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|I purchased the set for my grand daughter.  She loves the movies as she has already read the books twice.
B0087GF8ZG|3.0|I have had this light for about 2 weeks. So far it works as described: it only turns on when it's dark and the motion sensor seems to work form about 8' away. The problem I have had with this, is that if you're relatively still around it, it only seems to stay on for about 10 seconds. This is not very good when you use it for a bathroom! The directions mention something about sensing heat, but even really close to me, it seems to have that issue and I would have to swing my arm to get it to come on again. I actually bought something else for the bathroom and am using this for my front entrance, where there isn't a light switch as soon as I come in. It has been adequate for that purpose.
B00D3LA5WG|3.0|Plot to fragmented. Kinda slow and drawled out. Difficult to keep interest. McConaughey is to good to just headline a so so movie.
0061711292|4.0|I like the idea of owning first edition copies of books but perhaps not the practice of purchasing them. Nonetheless, having long had a vague intention to read this book, when I came across a first edition copy, I bought it. I'm happy to say I wasn't too precious with the book, and read it quickly.    Reading books on a Kindle has become my default mode so it was nice to get back to the beloved paper and spine. The smell of old pages only added to the pleasure.    To the point...the book is quite good. Spark writes well and her characters resonate. One of Miss Brodie's \\"set\\", Sandy, is given the most prominent role in the story, as both a participant and observer, and we see her imagining and writing stories from quite early on. This proclivity seems not to be a product of Miss Brodie's tutelage, but Sandy finishes with a nod to the influence of her former teacher. However, Sandy's latter day notoriety is not due to her publication of a creative novel but rather her publication of a book on psychology. So her acknowledgement of Brodie as an influence directs the reader to contemplate the novel as much in psychological terms as in artistic ones.    With that, and the title of Sandy's book, \\"The Transfiguration of the Commonplace,\\" we are forced to see Miss Brodie's teaching as an attempt to mold the minds of her charges, not that this is unusual for a teacher. But while Miss Brodie disdains the assigned curriculum, she is forever looking at her girls for the most likely to become the \\"creme de la creme.\\" Unfortunately, she fails to define her term well, perhaps suggesting a muddled intent. And if Miss Brodie sees herself as a vehicle for turning her girls into something more than commonplace, the reader is left to wonder Spark saw her title character as a failure. Indeed, only Sandy achieves something Brodie might have deemed worthy, but from within the self-imposed confines of a nunnery, complete with bars separating her from the rest of the world.    Spark gradually, deftly, undermines the aura of noble resistance surrounding Miss Brodie at the outset. For instance, the depth of the teacher's sympathy for fascism becomes clear only slowly. Her \\"set\\" remains at least loosely bonded throughout their lives, though, so Brodie can be credited with creating that bond, which is defined partly through the memory of herself. The other element of that bond might be a resistance to what she represented, which ultimately seemed to be a deluded self-importance.    Spark avoids valuing the later lives of the girls against one another, leaving the results of Jean Brodie's \\"prime\\" ambiguously judged. Jean Brodie herself, however, receives a harsher judgement, leaving the reader to contemplate with concern the pitfalls of self-aggrandizement.
B00942Y4IY|5.0|I've always loved this movie, and it is worthwhile to watch again and again. It goes above and beyond a typical Ancient Egyptian film. Great action movie.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I have a 2 yr old and a 5 yr old. I had debated on paying for this game along with another toca boca food game and decided upon getting them. Greatest thing I've bought in the long time! As they mention, there are no further in app purchase require to play the game (Thank you!) And it does not require a Wifi to play the game, which again I can't thank them enough for. Simple enough for my 2 yr old to interact and play with and entertains enough for my 5 yr old. They both love the game and can't let them down.  Perfect for long drives and restaurants entertainments, since we can't always have wifi signal these games were perfect. So please keep more Toca Boca games coming for Amazon kindle please!! Oh they have these apps on the google play too! I installed these game on my phone as well.
B00AAQRNQ8|3.0|For the price it is an ok gaming mouse. I found it to be uncomfortable for long gaming stretches. It was responsive. I think I will stay with the deathadder.
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|An engaging read.  The authors capture you from the first story.  I enjoyed the entire tome.  And I will refer to this book often throughout my career and life.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is soooo fun! I love temple run. it is fun to play and it is relaxing. temple run is probably my favorite game.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I first read this book a long time ago and enjoyed then as i did just now. With the movie coming out it was refreshing to realize how much i had forgotten and how enjoyable it was. A great sci fi classic reborn.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|It's nice to be able to change the games to keep fro getting bored. Some level are better than others. That's why 4 stars.
B00AOVXOQW|4.0|The toy is well constructed and works well.  My only criticism is that  no coupling exists on the front of the locomotive. I had purchased two locomotives and was unable to connect them because both  lacked  frontal couplings.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|I have always heard references to this classic story but was never interested enough to bother reading it. So basically I went into this movie not knowing anything about it, and I was not disappointed. The atmosphere is just awesome and somehow manages to mix 1920's feel with some kind of fantasy world which is hard to describe. In one word...magical. I was concerned this movie was almost hours long, but it never felt like it. Myself and my wife connected with the emotions of the characters, Leo's emotions really came through the screen, you could feel them yourself. Well done.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|Aslan has a good concept; approaching the life of Jesus from a historical perspective.  But he fall short of his intent of not using any Bible references. And, he only uses Bible references, out of context, to support his premise that Jesus was just another zealot bandit.  From my perspective, disappointing and inmature as a research project.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Emma Chase is amazing- I was laughing almost from the start...romance? yep. Playboy who found his match? yep. Told through Evan'e eyes made this story enjoyable, swoon worthy and down right funny.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love these characters and this series. This is the second time I have read them. I can't wait for the next book.
1447231171|4.0|I found this to be  less well done than the earlier books in the Clifton Cronicles but certainly of interest to<br />all who are interested in following the development of the family's continuing saga.
1439153663|5.0|I couldn't help but get extrem,ely involved in all the book's characters.  There aren't many and the book is written so you become invested in every single one.  I LOVED this book!
006016848X|5.0|I think this one of the best relationship books I have ever read. John gives clear cut no nonsense advice and defines the differences<br />between men and women so well. I highly recommend this book!
0062255657|4.0|First of all, you must open your mind up to that NAYTHING can happen.  Once you do that, it's a real page turner.  In fact, I couldn't put it down. I was sorry when it finished!!!! Very small book & very short read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app! I had Temple Run 2 first and thought that nothing could get better than that. I was totally wrong! Minion Rush hits all the stops with cool graphics and by just being an easy to navigate game. Fun for kids, this isn't educational, but definitely a good game to have when you just want to play. Perfect for Despicable Me fans! :)
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Boy this game lives up to the hype, I like to use big words like application and superficiality and the game is very fun but
B00ECUX7HC|2.0|First the cover art is very cool. It conjures up images of thundering blues based rhythms and soaring blues inflected lead guitar.<br />Unfortunately for the most part the actual songs don't live up to the images the cover art creates in my mind.<br />Not enough heavy blues riffs and screaming blues guitar!<br />And more than half the songs feature horns in the rhythm section.<br />Really? Horns? I hate horns! If you like horns then you might like it.<br />(No Horn Players were injured in the writing of this review) \m/
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it it is so much fun I play it all the time I let my brother play it he says he loves it
B003G4W49C|3.0|I recommended this to my grand kids but as I got into it I changed my mind I have 8 children and  to have a 6 year old do and think what he does in the story is really far fetched, it seems like a short story that the author just keeps going on and on...not sure I will go see the movie after reading the book
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Never know what is going to happen next or who will be the next victim in this series, keeps me coming back for more!
B004DHUAZQ|1.0|Don't waste your time on this movie...  it was lousy.  This will  probably be the last movie I rent from Amazon  instant  video because the playback of the movie buffers and  stops...  my system never does this with Netflix  or other channels on my Roku.
B000063DGC|5.0|Without the Randy Rhodes era there would not be an Ozzy after Black Sabbath. This cd is a must have for any rocker. I have been listening to this album since it came out and it is timeless. Randy set the bar for anybody that ever picked up a guitar to a new standard of perfection and greatness.
B00CATSONE|5.0|This was a wee quick yet informative story.  It is perfect for young people as well as adults. I found the facts fascinating and stunning to believe that none of this is taught to our young students.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I always take off my earpiece when not in the car and typically have to put it in my pocket. Now I can tuck it into this little box and it charges the unit as well. It is about the size of a 1/2 thick pack of cigarettes and fits easily in my pocket or briefcase.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Im not a big supporter or  science fiction,but I enjoyed the hell out of this book.<br />Just bought Shift and I'm looking forward to some non stop reading...<br />Thanks Hugh..:)
B004LZF2LW|5.0|As my grandchildren go off into the world ( watch out world) I wanted to see what time it was where they are. That what it said it did, and that's what it does! Was easy enough to figure out how to add locations ( click on the plus sign) :-)
140006922X|3.0|The author presents Jesus as a rebel: the hypothesis is far from new. Aslan insists in the long years that it took him to research this book, which is not impossible, but his bibliography is very incomplete. This book popularizes an interpretation of Jesus of Nazareth's life which has been repeatedly refuted. He does not address the arguments against it, but insists in what is obviously a simplification, already attractive in the 70s, perhaps less today.  Zealot is well written, very easy to read. Nothing new is said, nothing profound can be glimpsed. For New Testament scholars this is a deja vu of commonplaces. For the devout Christian, seeking inspiration, it is useless. For the historian it is superficial. I don't know who would profit from this book.
B009AY04A8|4.0|Love this game. Very intriguing. Hard at times. Not crazy about all the dialog but not bad. Worth the download
B0086700CM|5.0|I have all the Temple Run games.  They are very addictive.  I hope they come out with more real soon!
0345529057|5.0|in Medieval Fantasy that I have read in a long time.  Tolkien, Dune Martin is unbelievablly precise in  his character development.  The details are so rich in even minor characters.  Plots and themes with differing points of view develop side by side.  I am preordering Dance of Dragons.  I am watching Game of Thrones on HBO.  Reading his series has so many more details.
B00EKR61FM|4.0|If you're a big fan of the Twilight Saga, then you're going to love this set.  If you don't yet own the movies on blu-ray, then this is probably the set you'll want to purchase.  If you do already own them, then you need to decide if an upgrade is worth it.  I'm not sure if it is, but below is a breakdown of exactly what's in this set (the most important of which is 2 hours of new Bonus Features) so you can decide for yourself.<br /><br />The packaging is double-sided, with Edward/Bella on the front and Jacob on the back.  The blu-ray discs come housed inside an exclusive photo-album case (with the discs inserted into the pages rather than in normal blu-ray cases).

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great graphics, fun and addictive, and it is free. You can't beat that.  Good for any fan of the movie or its minions.
B000IZ8DZQ|4.0|This is a great movie and it has everything: car chases, bumbling crooks and a classic, British comedy soundtrack. Not to be missed!
B0017R5UAA|3.0|Not exactly what I expected after reading the mix of music types used. It is okay and I might try another one of their cd's. I think I bought more for the album cover.
B007VGXS8M|5.0|Love it! My childhood book is on my kindle and I get to enjoy it on my spare time. Where's Waldo Now? app is challenging and very fun.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Vince Gill is a national treasure. Paul Franklin makes the Steel talk. These two artist have made a classic! A tribute to Buck Owens.
0061692034|3.0|I enjoyed the first half but once the character went to Canada I wondered if the author was getting paid by the word.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Easy to read. Kept my attention! Not sure about the unexpected ending....it wrapped up rather quickly and I guess I wanted more.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|Wow even after all these years they still have it! This album really shows how they have developed as a band!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I did enjoy the book, however, I did find that it was difficult to keep up with all the characters and remember what had happened with them before.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Good calculator if you need a basic mads functions. would give this app if it had advanced functions such as sin and cos.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  It kind of kept you on the edge, wondering what was going to happen next and I was not disappointed.
B002APU580|5.0|One of my favorite older movies that I have seen. It's one of those movies you can watch over and over again and never get tired of it.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|This isn't your average sudoku game. You have to count to make the numbers add up, but you can't have doubles! All in all a fun game that keeps you on your toes when you think you've completed a level.
1933308087|5.0|This is an must have resource for the serious quilter.  The section on drafting is excellent and the assortment of blocks depicted is exhaustive.  Wonderfully written and beautifully photographed, this is already one of my favorites.
B0058VW36U|5.0|The little green monster has arrived at your doorstep and he's hungry....for candy! Feed him candy while getting stars to move onto the next level and to unlock new adventures. Lots of fun, I enjoy playing it.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Ordered this for my girlfriend and she loves it.  It was in great shape and the shipping was super fast.  The platinum edition has all the deleted scenes and the upgraded graphics.  Great video in great shape.
0345529057|4.0|The books themselves are excellent, and we were pleased with the quality. 4 paperback novels. Not going to last forever if not well cared for, but the included case makes that easy!
B006M4F67A|5.0|I love trying to keep my mind active.  I have played this game before and loved it.  I have gotten  hooked.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My Wife said &quot;Is that another one of your stupid games?&quot;  Then I got her to try it and she was hooked.
0064471837|5.0|I first read Sabriel as a child -- one of those books that you see in the library and pick up, knowing full-well that you shouldn't be judging a book by its cover, and yet the cover has drawn you in so completely that you really can't help but wonder if -- and hope -- that what is inside is as good as what is on the cover.<br /><br />And it is.<br /><br />As a child, Sabriel was a book about a girl-hero that looked very much like me. The plot was full and well fleshed out, the world detailed and -- on both sides of the wall -- mysterious. My one regret was that there was only one book and no further chance to investigate Ancelstierre or the Old Kingdom...<br /><br />In 2001 a familiar typeset on a hardbound book's spine let me and three friends to dog-pile each other in an effort to climb a bookstore shelf quickly enough to grab the last copy of Lirael, the second Old Kingdom book.<br /><br />(We did make peace and resolve to share the book amiably.)<br /><br />Sabriel: good enough to support sequels, good enough to stand alone, passes the Bechdel test, and more than fifteen years later is still my favorite book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|BEST BOOK EVER! I LOVED THE BOOK SO MUCH! I CAN'T WAIT TO READ CATCHING FIRE! I WANT TO SEE THE MOVIE!
B00992CF6W|1.0|This update by a one s mean this update but it is awesome none the less but this update is a slap to the face to us it's ridiculous  that actually allowed to go and be played
B00CWY76CC|4.0|On stage six, I tried to get the code for the thing under the boat, but there is NO hint to the code at all.<br />Not that I can see.
B00008J2PG|5.0|Great movie! with WWII history!  Too bad they don't make movies like this any more, & have actors like Gregory Peck etc... any more!<br />Good men... not girly boys like we see so much of today!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love the game and all the responsibility it teaches my daughter. It also very easy to use for her while she is learning to read.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|in my opinion it is fun to play because it is silly.  the expressions on the little guys face when he hits something is fun.  so what more can I say.
1451620829|3.0|\\"Have you ever tasted the barrel of a .357 magnum that's halfway down  your throat??\\" Those are the opening words in the Kiss' drummers autobiography. That alone should let the reader know his story will be more than rock'n'rolling all nite and partying every day, although it is every bit of that as well.<br /><br />Peter Criss is a proud Brooklyn kid, and tells his story in the \\"dese and dose\\" prose of those streets. At times, I found it a weird combination of off-putting and putting-on street airs, but Criss maintains his voice throughout the book and comes across as (mostly) believable.

0770437400|5.0|It s good book, its not like your normal zombie book of zombies eating everyone and people running and shooting. It  covers what it would actually would be like if it ever happened. Didn't you ever wonder in all the zombie movies what in the hell happened to the armed forces? Well it actually covers that with plausible explanations. If you like zombie stuff then you will like this book.
B00DHSK3RM|3.0|I thought that this game was like one that my wife had on her pad.  Also it was for children.
B003VXMMTK|5.0|I loved this - acting and story were wonderful.  Wondered why I hadn't watched it before!  I highly recommend it!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love this puzzle game! Each level holds several mysteries and I LOVE trying to sort it out! This puzzle game is fun and inventive. If you like solving puzzles an  feeling  creative, then you will love this all
B00CTSDDVO|3.0|The film was entertaining and I looked forward to adding the 3D version to my collection . But to get all the available special features at this time one would have to make 4 seperate purchases from 4 different entities . This is very poor merchandiztng .
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my horse is a fun family friendly game that makes me smile every time I play. I hope everyone that plays it shares my good experience.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I found this book surfing through the kindle books to find something to keep me happy. When I first started this book, thought I had it figured out and what the husbands secret was. Once I got through the book I was totally wrong and was excited to see what happened next. Great end to the book and the it really makes you think on how many ways our lives could have gone. If we met this person, did this action or that instead of making the choices that lead us to where we are today. I highly recommend this book and have already gotten my mom, sister and friends reading it as well. Looking forward to reading more books from this author.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|I really liked the music, actually. Yes modern artists, but with a timely twist.  This movie isn't a modern take, it's just a take on the book - and I feel that it was done very well.<br />Leo breaks my heart as Gatsby, and I went through the roller coaster of emotions with Daisy. It has been years since I've read the book, but I felt the characters come back to life as I watched it.<br />Not perfect, but really great.
B00992CF6W|5.0|cool updates<br />I like building<br />doing lots of fun stuff<br />I like fiting<br />I have lots of dimonds<br />fire!<br /><br />houses is fun building creepers rock
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have a GS4 and the stock keyboard didnt like me at all. When google keyboard came out, i immediatly replaced it. But now, this is my main and only keyboard i need.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|As you continue us to the next floor, the game becomes more challenging.  My husband and I played together and we both enjoyed it.  Looking forward to additional rooms and increase in difficulty.
B000MV8XPG|4.0|it wasn't quite as easy to assemble as i expected.<br />but given its complexity, the rather clumsy way it shifts from 'up' to 'down' seems unnecessary.  why not a continuous control?<br />the little boy to whom it was given is delighted (as is his big sister).
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini crafted a tapestry weaving the life experiences of characters who crossed over and through each others lives. It was a wonderful reading journey that I will probably revisit....
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love these kinds of games. I used to play them on the Internet and my friends and I were all drawn into it. Just found this one and got started. Having fun!
B002RKSZWG|5.0|I love the stories of Jane Austen and this is a good one.  The characters are vivid and the story is intriguing.  I enjoy that the story usually has a happy ending for the main character.  It always amazes me how the characters she describes are like people I know today.  They reassure me that people really haven't changed that much over the centuries.  Some are kind and loving, some are mean and shallow.  It's a wonderful read.
B00COGY6YO|4.0|We watched this on family night and the kids loved it. Lots of action without all the bad language, Great.
B00005JLKB|3.0|Since this purchase was for someone else, I really cannot say much about this other than if it was requested, it must be liked by young adults.
B00C2U6G7C|3.0|Amazing sound that brings life to the movie. The package is very beautiful and well made. Comes with downloadable songs.<br />I loved ir.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Incredible how the author drives you around different characters. Great Story that will give you hours of epic reading.<br />Totally recommended.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a very well done show.  Another great season.  I was surprised how they ended the season and I can't wait for next oen.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I am a huge fan of Batman. This complete set is a definite awesome for me. I spend half a day to watch all 3 movie at once and i'm not disappointing at all. I hope there will be a next sequel to the dark knight rises. Hopefully.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I saw the preview for the movie so I decided to read the book. I love it. Very well written. I would recommend this book to teens and adults.
B00594XOZU|4.0|Kik is a really useful app for talking to your friends.  It's really easy to utilize and the only problem I have with it is that it auto corrects abbreviations, names, and words it's unfamiliar with so sometimes your messages to other people don't say what you want them to say.  Other than that small and sometimes very annoying imperfection I have absolutely no problem with Kik. In conclusion, Kik is a great app and I give it my recommendation.
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|Best Tablet For The Price!<br />Picture quality is excellent!<br />Browsing is a breeze.<br />Con: Pay not to have advertising pop ups
B00B7Y0206|3.0|I personally love YouTube but the kindle app is extremely frustrating.  It claims to have really fast loading but it takes FOREVER!  Not only that but after waiting all that time for it to finally play your video it just decides to crash.  The commercials are really annoying especially since they never actually play correctly.  When a commercial plays you only hear the sound and there's no picture.  The only thing the app has going for it is that it's free and it has pretty much all the same features as YouTube.com.  Overall, I wasn't impressed with the app and I wouldn't recommend it to someone who lacks patience.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|If you have enjoyed this series this is a must read. Jordan/Sanderson really knocked it out of the park with this one.  This is the finale this series deserved!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I love this movie! The characters were great and the actors did a phenomenal job! I've watched it a lot.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|great game. very entertaining and fun to play. fills time. good good good good. recommend to anyone who likes fun.
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|Fairly tale stuff with modern Gatling Gun action. I especially liked how the gorgeous woman could turn at a moments notice into the ##$%# busting witch (sound familiar).<br /><br />Good family entertainment (despite the R rating which I kept waiting for the shocking scene - if not the bum shot of the redheaded \\"white\\" which, this move would likely have been rated PG13).<br /><br />The troll (Edward) is delightful .... \\"you want to fight me friend? ... well here's me friend, fight him\\" ... I wish I had him as my friend! LOL
B009UWYFFK|5.0|This is a great movie with loveable monsters--just enough scare to delight my six year old without giving her nightmares.  Funny enough for her dad and I to enjoy with her.  Great movie!
B00ESY77LO|5.0|This is a well produced movie, with lots of action, romance, and fun for the whole family (my daughter is 16 and we watched it together). Shocker ending though so have the Kleenex available.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|pretty good game. good to pass the time while using your brainnn. my only concern is that it told me after 10 levels that. I need to rate the app to get updates on new levels...? are there only 10?
B00CXVX1OQ|3.0|Played it and it was fun at first, upgraded character and customized characters but just got boring and repetitive to quickly.<br /><br />Fun as a free app but wouldn't waste my money on it otherwise.
B007P2DQJI|1.0|I bought this battery to replace a 2 year old stock battery, in hopes that this would hold a charge better.  This one turns out to be worse and drains in &#60; 12 hours.  I have switched back to my previous battery.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I ended up having my appendix out recently and was in the hospital overnight. I typically sleep with a sound machine with white noise and of course didn't have that with me in the hospital. Thankfully at 2:00 am I remembered this app, called it up and put it right next to my head and was able to sleep for several hours. I've used the app more for relaxation since and it's wonderful with sounds for every mood.
0061743526|2.0|I couldn't believe when received: poor paper quality, worn paper, badly cut.<br />This book deserved a better quality anniversary edition.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I downloaded this app to my android phone and use this all the time at work. Does all the basic functions I need and has been a lifesaver.
0679746048|5.0|For the memoirist lover.... great read and fine writing! Strong story and characters.  The book is much better than the movie.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I watched the first half of this recently on tv but had an appt so couldn't finish. I've seen it a couple of times before and love it. Decided the only answer to having a regular fix was to buy it.  The mingling of the past with the present is fascinating to me and leads me to look at things more carefully.
0061537969|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read not only because I love dogs but also because it's written so well and it tells a wonderful story.  This books is placed on my shelf in a decorative manner because I believe it is part of literary greats and deserves display.
B002HFP0QU|4.0|There were a few songs on the album that i did not recognize.  I thought it would only be their greatest hits.  However I guess to fill up two cd's there had to be songs that did not make it as popular as the others.  I really enjoy listening to it and when the songs that made hits I really enjoy it
0385523394|5.0|Piper is a great writer and I'm happy she is bringing mass attention to the war on drugs and the victims it locks up.  Thank you Piper for writing this memoir and exposing what so many people try to forget or pretend doesn't exist.  It would have been easy for her to just go on with her life and forget about that nightmare but instead she took a horrible situation and turned it around for herself all while exposing very important criminal justice issue.  Good for you Piper!
B009JZTOG8|3.0|However, it showed up nicely on my laptop, no complaints there, but the actual show wasn't for me, that's all.
0684857820|5.0|For Alice to write about her rape the way she did was pure bravery.  Lucky is one of those books that will stand out in my memoir collection.  I'm proud of Alice Sebold and her courage.  She inspires me.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Have you ever read a book that rang so true that for a moment, you felt like you were looking into a crystal ball?  I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend, and for the first couple parts I couldn't put it down.  Then part 3 came around and I put it down for a couple months (if you stop reading to avoid the spoiler, please note that it was because the book was so good that I was afraid of how it would end).  ***SPOILER ALERT***  Not because I lost interest, or because it wasn't good anymore, but because I loved the character so much that I was afraid a pattern had been set forth and I could not bear the possibility of losing a dear friend.  I finally picked it up again, and I quickly moved from part 3 to part 4.  When I told my friend that I was reading it again, he laughed and said that when I told him I put it down and why, that he had to bite his tongue to not tell me what happened next. ***SPOILER OVER***<br /><br />For me, this book is beautiful and terrifying in the same way that Fahrenheit 451 was, and that is my favorite book of all time.  As the story unfolded, I felt more and more like it was a not too distant possibility.  I feel that great literature is great because it examines uncomfortable truths in a way that helps the reader feel like they are a part of a terrible possibility.  That is what I felt while reading this book.  This isn't kid's stuff like the Hunger Games or Life as We Knew It. This book scared me because as a military spouse, I know that there are people who exist that carry these possibilities in their hearts.  I know it because I have heard it espoused by people who were too drunk to edit their most secret thoughts, people who believed that they were in a group of like-minded individuals, and scariest of all people who were neither and still didn't care who heard it. My only hope is that none of them achieve a level of power that would allow them to make it a reality.<br /><br />This author should be immensely proud of his creation.  These types of stories should be mandatory reading in high school, right next to books like Fahrenheit 451 and To Kill a Mockingbird.  If people start thinking about these scary possibilities, maybe we will be able to avoid them.  Fahrenheit 451 is still my favorite book of all time, but I haven't finished this series yet. :)<br /><br />In short I love it, and I am proud to put a rare 5 stars on one of my reviews.s creation.

B005D9MUWY|4.0|Excellent keyboard. The predictive text is amazing. I only don't like the number pad. Otherwise, I would recommend this for the price.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|I'm not a committed animation fan, unless it's something really new in terms of style & story concept. But I found this very funny,<br />with impressive graphic design, & very original (as opposed to the line-up of Shrek sequels, for example)--a great script & terrific voice acting. My only reservation is that it's clearly made for 3-D, so in 2-D there are a lot of kinetic moments that are made for the process & not necessarily for the flow of the narrative & the comfort of the viewer. (I'm assuming it was originally released theatrically with a 3-D option.) There are a lot of things flying &#34;in your face,&#34; coming at you rather that moving laterally. A bit of this isn't bad, but I found two things happening. First, after the first hour I began to feel assaulted visually, animation fatigue. Second, I began to feel like an outsider--someone for whom the movie, as clever as it is, was not intended. It's a small reservation though. I liked it enough so that after watching it &#34;on demand,&#34; I purchased a Blu-ray copy from Amazon. I'd say that constitutes a strong overall endorsement of this popular movie.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Well, I've only complete one section with out shuffling, but it is still a fun game.  My 6 year old granddaughter likes it, too. She will probably do much better than me!!!
0792846443|5.0|What can I say? WOW! This movie was GOOD! Loved it! This movie was filled with twist and shocking moments. One of the BEST THRILLERS EVER!!!!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This double duty cable is really good to have. I have only used it to charge my Kindly, But it could be used to transfer files as well.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I just bought an Asus Nexus 7 Gen 2 tablet. Unfortunately when I set the Kindle app to use the larger fonts it randomly duplicates or loses lines when I turn pages. I'm shocked \\"the latest thing\\" has such a major bug. Works fine on the smaller fonts but that's hard for me to read. This is really bad for what's called \\"the best that's out there.\\"
B000006TRV|5.0|Very much like the original album.  They clipped a couple tracks at the ends but maybe that was something in the analog to digital conversion.  Still one of the best albums of its kind.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|Love this app, I've been using it for like 2yrs or so now but the one thing I've been waiting to be fixed still hasn't been fixed after multiple updates. Why aren't all of the Android emoticons/emojis available within this keyboard app. I truly love this app but it is the most annoying thing in the world to have to temporarily switch to a different keyboard app (stock android/Google keyboard) just to be able to use a certain emoticon/emoji and then switch back to SwiftKey. Please finally fix this one thing asap!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Loved this app until the upgrade!  Cumbersome to use, hard to find the info I need. I give it no stars!!
B00821OX98|5.0|Great show with an amazing story. I was thinking it was going to just be a shooter but It's not. Worth the watch.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|Frankly was no doubt providentially selected for his time so that he could deliver this message to the world. His thoughts on the meaning of life have given me invaluable insight into my own life and  how to move forward in my future. It's definitely a thought-provoking book - not one you can breeze through in a weekend. Nonetheless, you won't be disappointed. You come away with more perspective  on life. I highly recommend this book.
B004IYWN7C|5.0|I just really love this movie. It's hilarious and has tons of great songs. So I let my kids watch it and they love it too!
B00007GZQZ|5.0|This movie. It's so good! One of the funniest films I've ever seen. So happy I could get this inexpensive, used (but in great condition) copy of one of my favorite movies.
0060512806|5.0|I.... am a voracious reader. Slow... yet voracious.<br />That said, I am not a professional reviewer.<br /><br />A friend of mine recommended this book years ago, and after reading it, I became a huge fan.<br /><br />It has been years, and I plan on reading it again... but I will tell you that while some say you might want to be into history, military, code, etc... to truly enjoy this book... none applied to me, and yet I did not want to put this book down. It was awesome.<br /><br />Neal is not one of those 'light read' authors. I have described his work as an author who packs 20 pages into one.

1250012570|3.0|This is a cute teen romance that will hold a lot of appeal for adults who came of age in the 80s. I previously loved Rowell's [[ASIN:1250030951 Fangirl]], and I didn't love this--perhaps predictably, since the romance was not why Fangirl stood out to me and is the whole point of this book--but it's a fast read and a perfectly decent choice if YA romance is your thing.<br /><br />To its credit, Eleanor & Park is an unusual teen romance. Eleanor is overweight, dresses bizarrely, and has a terrible home life. Park is biracial and isn't comfortable with the traditionally masculine mold his father wants him to follow; he even realizes he likes wearing eyeliner. They bond over music and comic books, but the relationship doesn't go smoothly, mostly because of the serious issues Eleanor has to deal with. The book is divided into lots of short chapters and jumps back and forth between the two protagonists' points-of-view, but we get to know Eleanor much better than Park; she's a well-developed and realistic character, while he spends most of his time thinking about her and is as much dream-boyfriend as developed character. Meanwhile, this is Eleanor and Park's show, and most of the other characters are fairly flat, particularly the siblings and classmates.<br /><br />Other good stuff: the dialogue is snappy and realistic, the family dynamics seem believable although often shunted to the sidelines, and the author hits the right notes with the awful adults in Eleanor's life, who are infuriating without being too over-the-top. And I appreciated that Eleanor takes her safety seriously and doesn't dither in a bad situation. On the other hand, a couple of the choices she makes at the end didn't make much sense to me; I had the same problem with Park's father's choice, which seems like weirdly irresponsible parenting. Also, the 80s pop culture references are a bit overdone; my unfamiliarity with them rendered some of the conversations nearly incomprehensible.<br /><br />Overall, a fine choice if you're looking for YA romance, particularly one with a genuinely sweet relationship that doesn't romanticize abuse. It didn't make me swoon, but not many authors can do that, so don't let me stop you from picking it up if it sounds like your thing.fine choice if you're looking for YA romance, particularly one with a genuinely sweet relationship that doesn't romanticize abuse.

B004SBQALA|3.0|The movie was one of the more extreme HS full of incredibly beautiful young ladies, buffed and handsome guys are the back drop of this new kid on the planet/fish outta water kinda flick.  To be honest, I bought this movie because of two things, the young actress who plays the love interest of the hot but complicated alien guy, is absolutely adorable.  The second reason is one I discovered while the movie was playing on Showtime for a month several months back, I would begin watching this movie, within 45 minutes into the movie, I would be dead asleep.  This movie is better than a sleeping pill, so this is why I now own it.  I've sometimes seen as much as 50 minutes as of today.......ZZzzz

B00CA6WLAE|3.0|In this 2nd installment, th action continues, but I was very disappointed with the Harry Potter similarities.  I don't want to provide spoilers, but I wish I hadn't been thinking of the horcruxes or Harry's sacrafice and dream of Dumbledore.  It was entertaining, but not unique in many spots.

B004XN3FHA|5.0|The body is constructed of aircraft Alumnium and is impact resistant.  This is a rear clicky flashlight, and it's about the size of the old school C battery type flashlights that my father always had in the car.  The body has a gnarled grip and is essentially slip proof.  The tail cap is flat allowing it to stand like a torch.  Unscrewing the tail cap gives access to the battery magazine that has an 8 AA-type battery capacity.  It can run on only 4 batteries up to the high output setting.<br /><br />The finish is an anodized matte black.  Over time, it will inevitably fade away at the points of contact or impact.  Not a big deal.  Frequently, I have sanded down the finish of other similar gadgets.<br /><br />Use<br /><br />Once batteries are installed, you simply push the button on the end cap.  To switch to different strobe modes, simply double click the button.  To switch to different output modes, simply hold the button for greater than a second.  It will toggle from Torch (630 lumens) to low (13 lumens) to mid (93 lumens) and finally to high (277 lumens).  For rummaging through a drawer, the low output will suffice.  Lighting up a room or hallway will need about a mid output setting, and lighting up your yard or driveway will need the mid or turbo settings.<br /><br />The light is obviously very bright, and this is more of a thrower than flood light.  Quality of the light is cool and very easy to distinguish colors of objects.<br /><br />The IPX-8 standard allows operation from beyond 10 meters underwater.  I cannot find an IP standard for impact resistance.<br /><br />Carry<br /><br />This is a big light and your options are jacket or rucksack, the lanyard or a holster.  It is not a mini light.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />For the money and features, it surely beats many incandescents of its size.  It's durable, well made, waterproof, and versatile.<br /><br />This is still a Chinese-made light, but it is a very good one.

B00COGXX7A|5.0|Loved this movie. I just knew that Julianne Hough would be a great star, and she sure didn't disappoint me. I was a bit worried that the plot might be like a few others I have seen. But there were enough twists and turns to make it a script of its own. I look forward to seeing Julianne in more movies. She is a lovely girl with a multiple of talents.

0307341550|4.0|Sharp Objects is a page turner.  Gillian Flynn writes as though she is peeling an onion, just enough of the layer gets pulled away and there is another thick layer, with an intense odor. It was just too much!  I like her style, but there were so many negative elements, and the plot was thick with \\"red herrings\\", the outcome was obvious from the first encounter. I will not spoil this for anyone else. I finished it to see if I had guessed correctly.  I liked many of the twists and turns, but at one point, it was as frustrating as being stuck in  Ikea. You know your way out- but you have to slog through the whole thing to get there.
B009AY04A8|1.0|ok  little game.  main problem is the company bombards you with requests to leave reviews and if you do you'll get a free game.  only thing is they don't tell you that it's only the PC games.  very mean, why should I want a short game like these on my desktop when I have a tablet.  Dissapointing
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|Book three continues the wonderful story told by Christopher Paolini in Eragon and Eldest.  He maintains the prefect balance between detail and flow that make reading his work so rewarding.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Ok so I watched the movie and fell in love with it so I decided to read the book. It was amazing. I would say watch the movie first so there's less disappointments. When you read the book and find out that it's better than th  movie, it'll be a much better experience. Love this book. Love it!
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I haven't read the book yet, but heard from all my family members and most of my friends that this movie was a must-see.  I finally got around to seeing it and while it is somewhat clever in the different stories it tells, it's a bit much in terms of made up words, all the accents, and the stories told.  Some may be taken with the action and oddities of the movie, I found them to be a bit too cumbersome.  I had to pause after 40 minutes in because I was bored with it, and then talk myself into watching the rest.  I found the stories to be drawn out and too long, unnecessarily so, and lacked reality.  Basically, it's 3 hours I never will get back and I think it's a waste of time.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|The whole family really liked the movie. From Star Trek fans to science fiction enthusiasts should enjoy it. We watched and purchased the movie streaming on my 70\\" Vizio, the app works great for me. Hope you enjoy the movie

B009NQZVKG|4.0|Rollins has produced another fine tale. I love his mastery of building suspence. This story has all of the charms and twists I've come to love about Rollins works. His weaving real science into the plots always has me researching one topic or another to learn more. His intent I'm sure. This one didn't disappoint me.

B00E5Q1LTY|3.0|Movie companies, in order to lessen their risk will look at something great and try to recreate it. If a particular movie has a great laugh 5 min into it, you better believe the sequel will have one in the same spot. That is why sequels are less and less original as they go along. When will Hollywood learn?<br />  To many, this franchise needed an overhaul. The 2nd installment to the new look should be quite disappointing to true Trek fans. The score was great, the actors did a great job with what they had. Chris Pine, I thought played a great role. Alice Eve was an excellent choice for Carol Marcus. What I cannot fathom to understand ** SPOILER ALERT** is that great things were done once before, why can't it happen again. The 1st movie relied on the idea of the Kobiashi Maru, which the remake didn't even dive into the whole \\"I don't believe in the no-win scenario.\\", which again came from the 1980's Khan movie. Movie companies keep coming up with the idea of,\\"yeah that worked in the 1st movie, put it in there this time.\\" This is why the ship has its core knocked off line, and someone has to go into the radiation chamber to save the ship and die, all the while being separated by the glass, and using mostly the same lines as the 1980's Khan movie. Does any of this sound familiar?? The 1980's version of the Wrath of Khan is probably one of the best sci-fi movies to date, in my opinion. It is great, for many reasons. This movie took a carbon copy of some of the famous lines, along with the same scenarios and made a less than original re-make. Spock dies in the Ricardo Montalban version. It's another reason why its great. The audience is left pondering, \\"But isn't how we deal with death as least as important as how we deal with life...Just words, but good words. And that's where ideas begin...\\"<br />Chris Pine dies for a total of 5 minutes, but is resurrected. You kind of get everything in one movie. Sad, but not to worry, we won't really kill him. UUHHHHH! Stop giving me the one-stop-shop. The Wrath of Khan is a great movie, leave it be. You want to create another great movie, fine, do it. But stop borrowing from other greatness. It only cheapens this movie. And, on a final note, William Shatner has about 10 different ways to sell you a line. And he sold me on Wrath of Khan. Sorry, but these guys repeating them with less enthusiasm and less meaning, because you didn't bother to take time to set up the message on why that's important, just missed the boat.
B001I45UFC|5.0|This is not just for children; actually it's meant to bless adults as well and adults will really get more from this and want to read the entire set again and again.  C.S. Lewis is an amazing author with everything he writes but this has to be his best!

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|If all you need is something to hook up to your TV to watch Netflix/YouTube, this is the perfect device. If you want to stream video from your phone or your computer, that's tricky.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|The mistake many writers of science fiction make is not creating characters one cares about.  This book goes in the entire opposite direction!  It made me care about the characters so much, I can't wait for the next book!  I have been reading science fiction for about sixty years.  This book ranks up there with Childhood's End, in my opinion.  The premise is all too possible, and like much science fiction, is a believable \\"if this goes on\\" type of story.  I am impressed by the writing and glad for the editing that preventing any misspellings or grammar gaffes to throw me out of the story, which is the problem with too many kindle books.  Bravo, and more, more!
B000UJ48WC|3.0|The Shining Bowling for Movies Score: 165.375 of 300<br /><br />What is Bowling for Movies you might ask - it's a score that I, just your average dude, have come up with to rate and score movies.  I gotta lot time on my hands and I watch movies - many MANY movies.  Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.  A score of 108 would be a \\"just ok, not particularly good / bad\\" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.  Throw too many \\"gutterballs\\" will land you under 100 and well - you get the idea. :]<br /><br />The Shining - we own this bad boy on Blu Ray as part of a three pack of Stanley Kubrick films (along with 2001 and A Clockwork Orange)<br /><br />Movie Explanation (no-there is too much, let me sum up):<br />An aspiring writer takes the perfect job - a winter groundskeeper at an upscale resort in the high mountains of Colorado.  Jack Torrance thinks he's got the perfect plan - complete silence and solitude in which to work on his novel - time alone to spend with his wife Wendy, and their young son, Danny - light duty job keeping an eye on things at the closed for the winter lodge with all the heat, food, and endless time he can stand.  But as the days drag on cabin fever sets in (not to mention the spooky warning about a previous employee's murderous rampage and the fact the lodge was built on an Indian burial ground) and \\"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\\", Wendy tries her best to hold it together and just keeps swinging, and Danny's psychic awareness provide interesting playmates... this can only end badly - and leaves a serious chill up your spine.<br /><br />Let me start with a disclaimer: we are not really big horror fans so if this is your personal favorite psychological thriller I strongly encourage you to write a review - as it sits here at The Thomason Society for Movie Goodness, a bowling score of 165 places it in the area where I would tell a friend it was certainly a good movie but falls short of great - in Amazon stars it would land itself in the 3 2/3 zone comfortable but it would miss that 4th star for us.  I don't want to spoil anything here and I won't get into specifics but I will say this - the movie was moving along swimmingly, like seriously going to crest about a 200 bowling score but by the end it just faded.  Let me say it another way - imagine you're married and your wife is going to have your first child. You're all packed and ready to go.  You're sleeping in your clothes \\"just in case\\" - day after day pass and with each passing hour the tension mounts.  You go over the map to the hospital a thousand times and nothing happens.  Finally, its 3:00 in the morning and your wife shakes you... \\"Honey, I think it's time,\\" she says, \\"something's happening!\\"  You spring out of bed - your SHOES already on your feet and go around to help her out of bed.  As she leans forward she lets out a HUUUUGGGE burp and then says, \\"Oh, never mind - must have been the bratwurst, sauerkraut, and spaghetti chaser.\\"  That's kind of what happened here.  There was incredible tension - the suspense was crazy - and then there was just a bad smell and all the excitement was over.<br /><br />What went right:<br />~ Gosh, a lot went right - the storytelling was wonderful, the acting was great, the musical score was intense, and the tension was palpable.  The story intertwined cabin fever with a truly creepy ghost story.  The fear and confusion displayed in this movie was truly intense...  It came up on you from behind.<br />~ I think Jack Nicholson may actually be insane - he plays it so well - dude does creepy and he does it well.<br />~ The cinematography was simply incredible... The hotel's colors and decorating were absolutely amazing.  Danny's trips down the halls on his Big Wheel really showed the scale of the hotel.  The scene where Danny and Wendy were in the maze and Jack saw them from the model in the hotel was just epic.<br /><br />What went wrong:<br />~ This movie could have easily pulled down a HUGE bowling score - right up to the end, totally anti-climactic; I was totally loving this movie and then got left cold - Mrs. Movie Dude opined the same, what can we say<br />~ Mrs. Movie Dude also felt like they could have traded some of the gore for more character development; she said, \\"I did not need a naked dead rotting grandma - what I needed was an ending that matched the grandeur of the rest of the film!\\"<br /><br />Hey, if you have a question about this review, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer promptly. I will be leaving more movie reviews with bowling scores so check out my other reviews. Bowling for Movies is in no way affiliated with Amazon nor do I have a website or other business interest - I'm just a dude who watches movies (and dabbles in quasi/pseudo-science) :] Want me to review a movie and score it in an Amazon review - I'd be happy to - if I have it, you'll get it.y's trips down the halls on his Big Wheel really showed the scale of the hotel.

B004TIKXCE|5.0|Marcus Aurelius was the last of a group of \\"good\\" Roman Emperors.  His profile was raised most recently in the \\"Gladiator\\" film, where appears as a benevolent leader of an increasingly corrupt empire.  If his thoughts as outlined in this document are any indication, then the movie portrayal Marcus Aurelius is not far from the truth.  These thoughts appear piecemeal as epiphanies written by the Emperor between 170-180 AD.  Aurelius considered himself a philosopher, which was the equivalent of a dedicated scientist in his day.  He believed in a life of humble service and dedication to improving the world around him.  His view of world included the need to better understand and forgive others for their shortcomings.  It is a window into the Romans view of how to ideally conduct themselves in public and private life that is incredibly fascinating.<br /><br />The content and tone of these writings belies the fact that Marcus Aurelius governed an area that reached from Britain to Egypt (most of modern Europe and the Middle East).  \\"Alone of the emperors,\\" wrote the historian Herodian, \\"he gave proof of his learning not by mere words or knowledge of philosophical doctrines but by his blameless character and temperate way of life.\\" (From Wikipedia).  There is a tone and tenor to his writings that aligns well the Christian doctrines that will soon transform Europe.  \\"If any man has done wrong, then the harm is his own\\" (location 1403-7, Kindle Edition).<br /><br />So much of the modern western world owes its foundation to the Roman Republic and Empire.  If you wish to better understand the decline and fall of modern republics (and empires), then all roads still lead to Rome as the model for the demise of democratic governments.  The distance of nearly 2000 years melts away and you might find yourself wishing for an opportunity to meet the man who many consider the greatest Roman Emperor.

B00E5Q1LTY|2.0|All three of the main characters, Kirk, Spok and McCoy are perfect in their portrayals of young Star Trek icons... They really pull it off and push it further. Their interaction is beyond tight.  Uhuru is somewhere near the intimacy, but hasn't made it into this fast clicking interaction yet.  She is still aswesome on her own, but she is not ensembling as well as the other 3. I hope they remake every single orignal episode whith these actors. How will they resolve the Time paradoxes though?  They can't make too many more with Vulcan as gone... it doesn't compute, isn't logical.  This just rings false and needs to be addressed pretty quickly.  Still it's going to be fun watching how it all unfolds.  Thank God for Star Trek and the whole cultural lift it has given us all.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Great free app.  Needed something to remind us during the day to turn some of our plant lighting on and off  and to take time sensitive medications.  It allows you to set up to four alarms and there's a large selection of types of alarms and sounds.  You can adjust the volume and it starts out low and slowly gets louder.  Like it very much.  Just remember the alarms work on military time.  Thanks

0743454537|4.0|Jodi Picoult did an outstanding job on this novel and I believe she is very talented author.  The main topic shows a lot of controversy as well as emotion and different beliefs.  I liked how the chapters were split up by being told by the different characters.  This way you could feel diverse opinions and you could pick sides, which made it easier to connect to the book.  One thing that I did not like about this novel was that there were a lot of dull points.  I felt like there were parts with information that ended up being unimportant.  Over all it was a very good book with a unique topic that will keep you reading.
B005I6EU48|5.0|I love this cover for my kindle. it looks like an old book and people comment on it all the time.
B000002J2D|5.0|In college, my roommate and I used to listen to side 2 of this album ( back in  the days of vinyl LPs ) just before going to sleep. While side one of the album is good too, side 2 was awesome. Those songs were intricate, complex, well-crafted and fun, all at the same time. This is a great album which I highly recommend. NOTE: Deep In The Motherlode was the first song on side two of the LP version.
B00CW6DAKC|3.0|Fun to play. My kids like it too but it always messes up and kicks me out. Needs a kindle update. My wife's iphone downy have the same problem
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|If you have someone on facebook to share this one with it looked like fun but I did not so I did not get a chance to play it  :(
B00CHMBQRA|2.0|What in the world was the movie about? I just did not like it. This was so unreal. I felt that the creator could have put more in to making the plot a little stronger and easier for the viewer to understand. I just did not like the whole movie at all. I really want my money back.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I am all caught up and officially addicted on this series!  I can't wait for season four to start in January!
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Enjoyed it, been awhile between Reacher fixes, and this one hit the mark.<br />Slightly different structure with multiple character viewpoints and shortened timeframe.<br />Reacher just never gets old.

No complaints about the quality of the albums classic they are and probably should have looked closer at the albums included my bad. It was shipped and I got it on time so no delay there and the product was as advertised. It was a good mix of priests evolution as a group over the years.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book. I could not stop reading it. Reading this first book makes me want to dive into the next one immediately.

B0007LGCB8|5.0|I am delighted with these shoes/sandals.  They are extremely comfortable, nice looking and very durable.  Easy to put on, and to remove.  They are waterproof, so I don't worry if they get wet.  I certainly will buy another pair when these wear  out.<br /><br />I am very pleased with the Amazon price, and the quick delivery (sooner than promised!)<br /><br />Doug Stewart
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Overall I loved the book.  At times the main character was so frustrating, it was angering, but it was worth finishing the book.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Loving IT! Not so difficult that you have to spend hours on one area and very thrilling when something works. Always a surprise.....
B006LSZECO|4.0|At times, my hatred went from the husband to the wife and kept going back and forth.  I won't give the book five stars because I simply hated the ending.
0553582445|5.0|Whoa!  If you haven't yet read Hobbs' Assassin trilogy, stop now and do so before embarking on this leg of the journey.  The Tawny Man series forms a seamless whole with the earlier saga centered on FitzChivalry farseer, the besieged Catalyst chosen to alter the orbit of his world.<br /><br />Fifteen years have passed since Fitz' quest to save the Six Duchies from the Outislanders' Red Ship raiders.  He has found a measure of peace and is more or less satisfied with his new life until a familiar figure enters his life and turns it upside down again.<br /><br />Somehow or other - and I salute her for it - Hobbs manages to tie all the threads of this complex and compelling story together.  (To see how, you will have to finish all six books, but you will be glad you did.)  Hobbs introduces many fascinating new characters but makes sure to bring many of the familiar ones back to present Fitz with a major dilemma:  How can he keep his identity secret, while returning to Buckkeep to help his beloved Queen find her son, the heir to the Farseer throne?<br /><br />The resolution of this particular challenge involves danger (of course), political intrigue, human interest and a good measure of humor along the way.  Hobbs' style in all these books is tight and effective, enhancing the drama of the events as they unfold and creating an atmosphere of suspense.<br /><br />If you haven't started reading either \\"The Assassin's Apprentice\\" or \\"Fool's Errand\\" by now, you should have! :)
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|So far I am enjoying this game. It's a fun way to pass time and doesn't require purchases in game, although you can. I am, however, apprehensive about losing all my progress. I do not have a facebook account and as such, can<br />not backup my game. Other than that, this app is fun for all ages.
B00B5QGPZC|1.0|Too much of an overdone production.  What a disappointment. I have two of his earlier DVD's and they are both treasures. He is still an excellent violin player, but what a waste of money this DVD is. If one is into never ending flashing lights and a big big production overshadowing the music this one is for you.
B003JH8LPW|3.0|The story is built around an encryption program/method for which no (brute force) unencryption will ever be available. The heros, NSA employees, try to find a &#34;backdoor&#34; password. As usual in DBs novels they narrowly escape from dangerous situations and collapsing structures in the most unlikely way, while villains die by the dozens.<br />*****SPOILERS*****<br />The final scenes are particularly interesting; a virus has slipped into the central NSA  database system because someone opened a bypass. This results in a major hacking vulnerability and attempts to break in from all over the world. The progressing hacks are visualized as a process in which several subsequent layers of protection (firewalls) are compromised. Of course, a few seconds before the final breakdown the heroes realize what the password for the encryption program is, type it in and everything is over and they live happily ever after. I fail to make the connections with any really secured data system but then I have no insights into NSA operations.
B00E978FGQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, the characters were fun and the casting was great.<br /><br />I felt like it could have been a little better, tighter plot or less flitting from plot point to plot point perhaps. I can't quite put my finger on what was missing for me.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Currently going through experiment #3. You have to love it.<br />Remember. The universe is a field of possibilities. And we are like magnets.
B00275EHJG|4.0|Beautiful graphics, fun story, great characters as always.  But for a young child, some scenes will be quite upsetting. The idea that a loved toy that gets lost by a child is sad, lonely, or even cries will be very unpleasant for viewers who are still young enough to anthropomorphize their toys. And a scene near the end when all the toys are about to be incinerated could be too intense for a young child. Great movie, but better for slightly older (5+) kids.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This is a fun app. I love to play it when I have time. I don't have a phone I like to have to think in games.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|My only problem is the C key and space bar. I keep miss both. But the intuitive prediction and speed at which it learned my typing habits is mind boggling. Love it!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Very addicting game. Lots of fun. Lots of play time for a low price. I wasn't sure if I would like this game but it very addictive. I just wish you got more crystals. The energy can take awhile also.
B007N3GZ9C|4.0|I liked the information it provided but as a caregiver of a stroke victim, I found it a little to technical.  I skipped over some of that as suggested and the rest of the book was great.
B004R6JG7Q|4.0|Great, historic footage, McQueen is cool as usual, but could use a story!<br />He tries to make some kind of connection with an old girlfriend, but that's about as deep as it gets.<br />Still this as a time capsule of a great period of time in auto racing and in a sense is<br />almost a silent movie.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I have hesitated to post this because i hate to write a bad review for book, but i really didn't like this one.  I wanted to stop reading after the first few pages and it never got any better...<br /><br />This writing style is probably intentional and driven by the main character, but in any case, it made me crazy.  It is very glib, very pretentious.  It's like having to spend hours at one of those cocktail parties where everyone is trying to impress everyone else with how smart and witty and urbane they are.  (I had the same reaction to the movie, The Out of Towners, (Jack Lemmon version) if the example helps any.)  So, maybe another of the books by Gillian Flynn would be very different with a different set of characters...but I'm not willing to pay for another book to find out.
B001EIOOV8|5.0|This movie really is based on a true story and has some of the greatest actors in it.<br />The portrayal of all these underworld types and the lives they try to lead is compelling.<br />The shots of Las Vegas are worth the price of admission.<br />This is probably the best movie that Sharon Stone ever did!<br />De Niro and Pesci are their usual greatness!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|it was good for easy puzzles,  wish there was more than ten levels but all in all not a bad game
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I would like this game a lot more if I would receive the bingo credits I'm supposed to.  I have complained several times from my Kindle and my laptop and have NEVER gotten an answer or a fix.
B0083I90HU|5.0|How sad that the historical tragedy that this book describes was swept under the rug. It's a real-page turner and a great book club book.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|Ordering on-line was much more efficient than trying to locate this dvd at a department store with a limited selection.  The price was reasonable.
B00BCOQSSQ|1.0|This book reads like it was written by a 12year old.  The names of the different species and lands was unoriginal.  The author actually calls the bad guys \\"Them\\" as the name of their species.<br />There is absolutely nothing creative or original in this book.  The writing is disjointed and the characters have no depth.<br /><br />I'm so glad I got this book for free as I would have wanted my money back.<br /><br />Don't waste your time on this book.

0226264211|1.0|Friedman is a good marketer. It's pretty clear why people without a deep logical background, or analytic training, would believe this book has something to say about freedom. Friedman slyly uses the terms free, freedom, and free enterprise, in every three sentences. Eventually the weary subconscious relents, and accepts that the man must be talking substantively about issues of freedom, why else is the word so omnipresent!? Of course he's not really. For Friedman, freedom is negative liberty, the liberty not to be interfered with, and he takes his starting point of analysis to be the individual (which rarely holds since he'll quickly talk about net economic effects that are never started by an individual, nor realized by them either). But capitalism is a lot like the old Chinese proverb about the butterfly effect, except far more potent. To start with the individual, in a system that is so necessarily interconnected, inter-impacting, globalized, and omnipresent, is as silly as to start with the atom in analyzing the relationship between the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy. Both in economics and in astronomy, little progress will be made!<br /><br />But what about this idea of negative liberty - that freedom is in essence not to be interfered with. Well given the necessary butterfly effect of the economy, it is an obvious absurdity, since your job choices, prospects of employment, educational venues, duration of employment, financial stability, etc., are all frequently impacted by sources outside your control. But even if they were not, is freedom really negative liberty? That seems dubious, and fortunately philosophers are finally coming around to the idea that freedom is actually realizing your fullest potential, not being left alone. We are social species, and we realize are fullest potential in social relationships. Friedman is right to promote voluntary co-operation, but he's wrong that capitalism is the best outlet for this expression.<br /><br />Okay, so how does all this really play out in the book? Can 200 pages really be objected to by just rejecting negative liberty out of hand? Maybe not.<br /><br />Friedman has one argument that if accepted justifies almost all his conclusions throughout the book, but if rejected, undermines the entire text. He attempts to show that capitalism really is the best expression of negative liberty. Here it is:<br /><br />\\"As in that simple model [of a non-coerced barter economy], so in the complex enterprise and money exchange economy, co-operation is strictly individual and voluntary provided: A) the enterprises are private, so that the ultimate contracting parties are individuals and B) that individuals are effectively free to enter or not to enter into any particular exchange, so that every transaction is strictly voluntary.\\"<br /><br />The first problem with this position is that the barter economy he refers to is qualitatively different than free-market corporate capitalism. He's comparing apples to oranges, or at the very least a game of catch to the NFL. But even if he weren't, the privatization of the means of production into a few hands, (which is A), undermines B. Individuals that do not own means of production are not free to enter or not into particular exchange, for if they do not enter the exchange (of selling their labor power), they will starve to death. If one cannot avoid the exchange all together, then one cannot reasonably be said to be free to enter into it. If one wants a more detailed explanation as to why this is the case, I would recommend reading CB Macpherson on Friedman.<br /><br />Anyone that reads my reviews knows I am a socialist, so finding problems with this book was bound to happen. And anyone who doesn't know my views is going to read this review and think it sucks because Friedman showed that socialism and freedom do not go together. The problem is for Friedman there's only one kind of socialism, the USSR. Instead of a few capitalist owning the means of production, the state does. That's it for Friedman. Two possible modes of production. He never once deals with the argument as to whether the workers should own the means of production democratically. I recently saw a debate with Friedman and Samuel Bowles where this question was raised. Instead of answering it, the host quickly changed the subject. So Friedman knows this `possibility' exist, but refuses to address it.<br /><br />So before the naysayer reads this review and wants to spit fire at me and accuse me of being a tyrant, go pick up Richard Wolff's \\"Democracy at Work\\". It's a very short read. It's well argued. And anyone of average intelligence can understand it. If, and only if, after you've understood what a Workers Self Directed Enterprise is, you still have problems with my advocacy of socialism against Friedman's warped cold-war dichotomy, will I engage in a critical discussion.ns of production, the state does.

0385343248|4.0|I liked this book for a while, and needed to replace the old mass market paperback that I'd read for the past decade. It's a very interesting book, and I consider it a primer for people looking into Japanese culture that's more accessible than books like The Way of the Samurai or The Book of Five Rings, and is more &#34;reputable&#34; than Usagi Yojimbo comic books (though Usagi has far more detail of the culture). Very pleasant read, and a good way to pass the long flight to the Far East, or the subway.
0060989157|5.0|I loved it!<br /><br />Great summer read - I normally recycle my books, give them to friends, or donate them but kept this one.<br /><br />Seriously silly I know.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|This book had me in a love hate relationship with the book. I found aspects of it rather beleaguered and slow, but it did not ever lose the plot. Clever twist in the end leaves you on the edge, but an abrupt end left me wanting to conclude the story....maybe we all want fairy tale endings and that is half the intrigue of the story, the 'bones' are there but the story is definitely not fairy tale! A good read hard to put down.

B007SYWFRM|2.0|I bought this game for my Samsung S3 mobile.  I played it everyday for nearly two weeks and absolutely loved it - until I got to Level 14 when the animals stopped giving me coins which meant I could not feed them and get any blue stars.  I reported this problem to Gamesloft and they never even bothered to reply.  Tried to find the fault on Google which came up with nothing so I had no choice but to remove the game from my phone and reinstall it.  I have now lost my original village and have to start all over again from scratch.<br /><br />I'm just glad that I didn't actually spend any money buying additional coins and acorns otherwise I'd be even more livid about it than I am already!<br /><br />Also I can't get this game to work on my Ipod, it keeps crashing.<br /><br />The graphics are great on the Samsung S3, amazing detail and really bright colours.<br /><br />The other annoying thing about this game is that it is constantly trying to get you to invite friends via Facebook. I don't have a Facebook Account - Can I not just play it by myself?!!

B002SSUQFG|5.0|Nice watch, light and durable, great for everyday wear. Really like the sturdy band, well made, not cheap cloth like so many other watches. Never have to wind, movement winds it. Only downside would be if you don't wear for two days have to reset time as self winding last about 48 hours if not wearing.

B00A8ECU24|3.0|This game is fun and cute . I love playing . It has a cute story line and decent graphics the only reason I am giving this game less than four stars is because you have to spend gems on all the main characters and you do get some gems free but not enough to buy any ponys without saving up for several years. And that is not an exaggeration they only give one or two every now and then and the cheapest  character that costs gems costs a couple hundred gems .Not thirty or forty but over one hundred gems .  Thank you for reading my review I hope it helped you in your decision .
B001VTTRC6|3.0|You will either really take to this film or you won't.  East Coast Italian neighborhood. Then and Now tragedies.  Cast of excellent actors.  Acclaimed Eastwood film.  Why then only three stars?<br /><br />This film was ahead of its time in dealing with sensitive subject matter, and at the time it came out, the lengthiness was perhaps perceived as an indication of a serious, profound film.  I simply question whether it would have achieved such high acclaim had it been released today... because frankly:  It's not hard to guess what takes two more hours to s l o w l y unravel.  I am not an impatient sort, but found myself bored and aware that the majority of scenes WOULD have been shortened to make a tighter film today.<br /><br />Some people will love this film for specific aspects (die-hard fans or the appeal of an investigative murder mystery set in an East Coast Italian neighbohood from a past generation) ... but brace yourself as it is slow-paced

The story unwound very slowly until the end and then everything was a rush to the finish. I dislike when authors seem to run out of steam and give an outline at the end instead of continuing to tell the story.

B002FE5XVK|5.0|Many people consider this film one of the top concert films of all time and I agree with that perspective. I saw the film when it first came out and eagerly bought the VHS tape when it was released, only to be disappointed by the poor video quality and complete lack of bass. The DVD was a bit better, but still the sound quality was not up to that of the albums (I have both vinyl and CD versions). However this blu-ray transfer fulfills all the excitement of the original film and the digital soundtack has tight, deep bass and good clean sound, plus HD video crisp enough that you can easily tell it is from film, flaws and all. The only minor disappointment is that the bonus tracks are in standard non-HD format; but I recommend watching them as they are quite good and should have been included as part of the original film. Highly recommended purchase.
1592802974|5.0|like this book very much specially learn how a great investor trade in the market, will buy again whenever a new version is out
B00DI5DPE2|5.0|To begin with don't get Mobile Fidelity confused with Audio Fidelity.  At one time Audio Fidelity always used the Master Tapes but now they use other sources and you can hear the sound quality suffering.<br /><br />I played the Mobile Fidleity versions and it was amazing they still only use the first generation master tape and the sound quality shows, I hear sounds I never heard before and it was crystal clear.<br /><br />This is well worth the extra money.
086547897X|5.0|Excellent for beginners and advanced animators.<br />A book to have at reach of hand while working.<br />I also recommend the 16 DVDS pack.
B003G4W49C|1.0|Decided to read Ender's Game since the movie will be out soon. Sorry but I don't see this as an outstanding work. Nothing to get excited about.<br /><br />Movie was bad as well.
140120841X|5.0|A &#34;must read&#34; for comic lovers.<br />A mature script, by the hand of the artist Alan Moore.<br />This graphic novel is a proof that comic is an art.<br />Also recommend watchmen (the comic, not the movie please).
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Albeit friends had already given away some crucial ending info (no I won't do the same here), there were still plenty of surprises. I laughed, I cried, ...everything I experienced with the first 2 seasons and why I came back for more. Can't wait for season 4.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I really want the update to come out I love you mojang and please update to come<br /><br />WITH  achans and endermen !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is one of the best series ever written or recorded.  It is a way of life that kept me intrigued and wanting more!  My only comment would be that I wished they had given more details about the weddings and time following.  Looking very much forward to Season 4......and buying it on Amazon!!!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|THE APP IS SIMPLE TO USE AND THE SOUND THAT WAKES YOU DOES SO WITH ENOUGH FORCE  TO GET YOU UP BUT NOT SO MUCH AS TO MAKE YOU WAKE UP WITH A HEART ATTACK
B009MCRHH6|3.0|First, this would probably benefit from the bigger screen of a tablet. Even then, it's frustrating to have no help screens, no tutorials, no examples. I'm sure Google could find some. The game didn't motivate me enough to explore further. It is pretty.
B00594XOZU|5.0|100% free texting!!! On my other texting apps, it didn't notify you when you got a text, but kik does. On my other texting app, I couldn't send or get pics, but on Kik I can. I would recommend this app for everybody. Now finally I have a great kindle fire texting app, instead of a kinda sort of ok one. Thank you kik!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Our secret insecurities, dark thoughts, and feelings of guilt, are poignantly portrayed in this poetic story. I want to read it again.
B007TXN4TK|3.0|This game is super fun and challenging. When it has sound. One day I was practicing and no sound was there when I played. But this is fun when it has sound. You start easy, doing stuff like &quot;We Wish You a Merry Christmas&quot; and upgrade to very difficult songs like &quot;Flight of the Bumble Bee.&quot;<br />I love how this isn't a game that you can beat in five seconds, like some. I love how you actually get to pick the songs you play. It's challenging, but not so hard that you hate it. You move up at your own level.<br />There are 4 levels, Beginner, Apprentice, Expert, and Custom. If you have never heard the song that you are playing, this game allows you to listen to the song first.<br />So when this game starts always having sound I'll do five stars.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Game is pretty good. Better than temple 1. Cart part could be better. Monkey guy is funny looking. Coins are expensive. Bonuses should be easier to grab.
1878424319|5.0|The content was great and I definitely have recommended it to  several people.  It is well worth reading and using as a life time guide.
057809665X|1.0|Basic stuff, nothing really new. It's all about listening and mirroring- read about NLP instead as it is what he's referring to in an over-simplified way
0756688701|5.0|My son is obsessed with the Cars movie cars and he loves looking through this book. He got one as a gift last year and looked through it so much that it started falling apart so this is actually his second copy.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I had to get the book and read it BEFORE I had a chance to watch the newly released movie. I wanted to get it read before the movie trailers ruined the story in my head.<br /><br />I like this story. I really like the main characters, Jace and Clary. I enjoyed Claire's depiction of this supernatural other world that takes place all around us, a world in which only a few can see or be seen. Needless to say, that is right up my alley and I was drawn in immediately! As Claire begins the tale, she leads the reader on an interesting road of discovery; the reader must sift through the `good' guys and the `bad' guys. After an intricate plot, the reader is left with some serious surprises to think about!<br /><br />Final Thought: I am anxiously waiting to read the next book to `see' if some of my predictions will come to fruition or if I am WAY off!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Lots of food for thought and adds a lot of context to the times and conditions that led to the gospels.  Not through it all yet, but so far an easy, compelling read!
B0014BY72Q|4.0|This is a good little sci fi film and I enjoyed it (who could not like Jenny Agutter)  So I bought it to relive my earlier days.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Mahjong 24/7 from 24/7 Games LLC is not exceptionally different from many other companies that put out Mahjong games; however, the visual displays and the tile and background colors are fairly vibrant and easy on the eyes. I am enjoying this game very much. Also, the background music is pretty good. I hope 24/7 keeps up the good work !
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I learned so much from reading this book. I would highly recommend it. I will read it again with a notebook and pen. There are lots of facts that I don't want to forget.
B004SEUJ82|4.0|My 15-yar-old niece talked me into buying the film and I was not sorry I did.  The ending astounded me.
B00ACBN9CI|3.0|I like the graphics and the concept.  Actual gameplay needs a lot of work.  No where near usable as far as the controls go, changing sensitivity just screws up play even more.  You can unlock more aircraft, but gives you different blocks of the same model...really?  This is more for aircraft history buffs than actual flight sim enthusiasts.
B009JVSAVM|5.0|This was very entertaining, we're still waiting for season six.<br />Would recomend to others.<br />This series will be funny years from now.
B00CBKLO52|4.0|Controls are squirrely.  Camera angles are a bit off.  You start off with three choices to control and then have to pay $2.99 each additional model. This is a good concept to play around with on a tablet or Kindle.  No where near realistic enough to simulate an RC model, but that isn't why you're buying this in the first place.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Really good an ends with a great beginning of the next book I just loved it I can't wait to read more
B006LSZECO|5.0|If you like Game of Thrones, where almost everyone is varying degrees of rotten, you'll love this battle of wills with a couple who take putting on a good face to the extreme.  I won't reveal the plot, since the twists really make the book.
B003XF1OJK|4.0|The book gave meaning to the game and also made me want to read more about halo. This book can stand on its own without the video game. A great read!
B005QYKD4I|3.0|I'm kinda on the fence about this movie.  I liked the first two movies, but this one kinda fell short.  I guess if Megan had stayed on for this movie, it would probably be better...the character of Carly just didn't work for me.  Everything else was good, though.  Good action and music.  I just wished the volume had stayed constant the whole time...I viewed it through my xbox 360 and I was constantly turning up and down the volume in order to find the \\"happy medium\\".
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Nice when your camping or getting wood. When you have a family member who is sick and you need to know how hot it well be, this is a good app to have.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Amazing story! Happiness,sorrow,relief,worry and so many more emotion fill u when u read this story.It isn't a book u want to put down.P lan reading a lot!
B000002GXX|5.0|Love the band, love the songs. It was delivered quickly and if your a fan of the Eagles you'll enjoy this CD too.
B00BTYMPYU|5.0|Great remake movie. Good to compare with previous movie. I will definately let others see this movie. Nice copy and very fast shipping. Thanks.
B00DHHWYAW|3.0|Sick & Stupid Score: 3/7*<br /><br />Hollywood directors and screenwriters these days have the artistic maturity of a 15-year old.  Having been brought up on video games, comic books and throwaway MP3s, they seem to be completely incapable of understanding the subtleties of art, literature, and music.  Hollywood's latest attempt at a film version of \\"The Great Gatsby\\" is sadly just another example.<br /><br />After about 30 minutes of Roaring 20s hype--scenes filled with loud period music absurdly mixed with modern hip-hop, exaggerated dance routines, bizarre costumes, comical art deco sets, and ridiculous computer graphics, all carried along on a tidal wave of alcohol--the movie finally settles down to the business of telling a story.<br /><br />If you make it through those opening scenes without being blinded, rendered deaf, or deeply insulted by the infantilism of the performance, you might extract some entertainment and enlightenment from the rest of the movie.  That probably depends on how familiar you are with F. Scott Fitzgerald's work, and how much you desire to see whether the movie succeeds in bringing his story to life on the screen.<br /><br />The acting is competent, but the characters are flat, especially the female characters.  Cinematically, the viewer gets the impression that the director has watched \\"Citizen Kane\\" too many times, and the screenwriter has aided and abetted this addiction by having Gatsby gasp \\"Daisy\\" in his dying moments, rather than whispering \\"Rosebud.\\"<br /><br />_____________________________________<br />* The Sick & Stupid Score ranks movies from zero to ten in each category. For example, a Sick & Stupid Score of 5/5 indicates the movie is about average Sick and about average Stupid. A Score of 10/10 indicates the movie is so gross and idiotic no one should watch it; whereas a Score of 0/0 is a perfect movie.
B00006JIA4|5.0|Love this group. Reminds me of my past where I could only afford to listen to them on the radio.
B00ADS98FC|1.0|Even my wife hated it. She accidentally bought it by mistake. Like dance dance revolution in singing form.  I would rather watch glue dry. I would rather watch a turtle race.

B00CFA222M|5.0|Great new movie. A new turn on original fairy tale. I will definately let others see this movie. Nice copy and very fast shipping. Thanks.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Excellent Movie with an added dash of comic humor for good measure.  Chris Pine and crew do a great job as younger versions of the old crew.
B00005M989|5.0|Love this musician. Reminds me of my past where I could only afford to listen to them on the radio.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|This is a good game to play. Addictive.  The only negative aspect is that you have to wait a long time to replenish the lives.

B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Right now the device is very limited. For me the biggest flaw it's that win XP is not supported, so will buy one for sure when they support it. Also I understand that the Chrome tab casting is beta so it might work, not guaranteed. It doesn't work through VPNs. Doesn't support full 1080p streaming. Doesn't like 5GHz or Dual-Band 2.4GHz/5GHz routers. It only supports android 2.3 or higher.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|Love this group. Reminds me of my past where I could only afford to listen to them on the radio.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|My son loves this movie. Good fun for the entire family. I would recommend this movie to anyone with children.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I am a total trekkie and I loved this movie. J.J. Abrams did a great job with the casting, Benedict Cumberbatch is an AMAZING khan, he stole the show. I highly recommend it to everyone who loved the first movie :)
B004SKHJF2|3.0|Is a great app, but it need to be updated to the last version, because the actual one is a old version of it.
B000HEWHAU|5.0|Loved the characters in the movie. Watch it often. It has become my favorite movie to watch with my friends.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is awesome I love it l think  you should buy it would make you scream It is so awesome

B008Y1YK0I|5.0|What can I say about the greatest movie ever filmed?  I have owned a version of this film in VHS, DVD and now Blue Ray.  Stunning restored version, colour saturation perfect and the extras truly make this a film buff's collector item.  Well worth the money.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|This is a fast paced game that certainly keeps you entertained. Though it's a ton of fun, the lame avatars are annoying. Also it's pathetic that you can only add friends by signing into Facebook. I don't mind signing in, but my wife does mind playing through her account. Therefore, we can never play together.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Brilliant start to the best murder mystery to come out of Britain since Prime Suspect.  Watch it on BBC America - fantastic
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Very good book about the life of the most prolific sniper in American military history. I definitely recommend this book.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Pam has a way of making universal laws & truths both memorable and accessible. Her writing style is so down-to-earth and her experiments are so enjoyable and easy to do!
B0060MYKTY|5.0|Don't expect a fulfilling show. Showtime cancelled this after season three. The story goes to nowhere. It was an excellent show but not worth giving your money away unless you realize you'll never see the end.
034580404X|5.0|Couldn't put it down. I felt an overwheming amount of emotions while reading this book.  Well written.  I look forward to future novels by E L James.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Any review I could write would not do this book justice so I'll keep it simple.  I LOVE this book - enjoyed every page and can't recommend it enough.
030758836X|1.0|This was chosen for my book club so I felt I had to finish it.  It was full of needless profanity. I can understand there are appropriate times for some crude language in a so called \\"thriller\\", but this was so over the top. I am very disappointed that a woman writer would have any of her characters use the \\"c\\" word. Disgusting. It would seem that someone as intelligent and experienced as this author could use a much broader vocabulary. Aside from all the filth, the story wasn't even remotely interesting. If you want to read a good thriller,try someone like Harlan Coben. Please don't waste your time on this.
B006FS22Y8|5.0|One of my favorite artist. I really enjoy her voice on this album, it was so nice and soulful. So sad. RIP Amy.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's a fun, easy to learn game that is just the right amount of challenge to be fun but not work.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Easy to use.i love the different colors you csn use as background.give it a try, youll like it. ok ok
B003G4W49C|4.0|Ender's Game has a great Sci-Fi story with awesome imagery, but also builds complex characters and relationships.  It is more than the average Sci-Fi novel.
B004LROUNG|5.0|A fast read. Very enjoyable! This the Grisham I remember.  You will not be disappointed. A little bit for everyone.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Vikings is very engaging! Make sure you buy the whole season to save $ because you will NEED to watch every episode.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|this book is awesome it has a lot of action and anyone who rates this below 4 stars are dookie theres alot of romance in it but lots of action
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Thought it was simple enough but still fun to play. Graphics were actually pretty good. Should have more ways to get coins faster.
B003O86FMW|5.0|this is a good book it has a lot of action and its really awesome i recomend this book cuz its awesome its to long rhough
B000002KBD|5.0|Liked a lot of this music for a while but mostly the commercial hits, but I have discovered the mans music is very comfortable to listen too.
6305903182|4.0|Scream is one of my top 10 favorite movies and while I can't say that any of the sequels were as entertaining as the first I'd certainly recommend them to anyone who's looking for a great thriller full of suspense.
1781162646|5.0|Loved this book it was a very enjoyable read again I couldn't put it down so that always ranks high with me! Devin Jones college student goes to work at Joyland Amusement Park for the summer and gets the ride of his life in many ways!  His mother has passed away, his girlfriend is a brat and he just needs something different in his life this summer and finds all this and more at Joyland.  Don't want to be evasive but I definitely don't want to spoil anything in this book for you but it is a must read and definitely on my firstreads list.  Stephen King is the ultimate scare master but in this book it has a little bit of mystery but more a coming of age book.  I loved the amusment park and the carnies and this kid is just a great kid and it will surprise you of who the bad guy turns out to be.  This book is perfect if you are normally scared by Stephen King's books this one isn't that scary but it is just a great book 5*!!! Keep them coming Mr. King!

B004T4LUPW|2.0|When I purchased this app for my Kindle Fire two years ago it met my needs perfectly. With a recent update however it will no longer allow me to use the app unless I am online. This is a problem since my Fire only has wireless. I have been relying on the app to keep track of all my appointments but I'm not always able to be connected when I need to change an entry. With this change the app becomes mostly useless to me. I'm currently evaluating what app to use instead. It's too bad because I really did like the app until this change.
B007REV4YI|1.0|I made a mistake buying this DVD along with Bond 50 with Amazon.com because it is much cheaper with Amazon.fr.<br /><br />I was just taking advantage of the reduced price for Bond 50: The Complete 22 Film Collection<br /><br />I paid so much cost for freight and ??? with Amazon.com instead buying with Amazon.fr !!!<br /><br />Quite upset and frustated.<br /><br />I cannot understand why there is a so large price difference between the 2 sites within the same company ?<br /><br />Best regards,<br />Jean
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Thank you sign painter. Your words of wisdom will inspire a generation. Great game with interesting social commentary. Great for those who enjoy physics/puzzle games.

0425166805|5.0|The past reviews looked good and I am glad I believed them. They were right, this was a very good experience.
B00AF82WTO|5.0|While the Ciaran Hinds/Amanda Roote version remained very true to Jane Austin's book, I much preferred the actors in this version ... Sally Hawkins was a wonderful Anne Elliot and Rupert Penry-Jones made a very handsome Capt. Wentworth.  For some reason, I just felt the romance and tension much more in this version.  I am happy though that I own both versions ... I love them both.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|Pretty funny, good cast.  Made me laugh and cry at different parts! I recommend it to anyone who has had a child or wants to.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This book is an interesting, satisfying, and compelling read, and the best of the three books in the series.  One of the best things I can say about any book is that it is rereadable, and this one is.

B00B9366VO|5.0|Dave Grohl tells the story of the legendary Sound City Studios in great detail. He starts where all good documentaries should start at the beginning. There are interviews with all the major players in the studios success. For instance, He tells the story of how the studio was a key factor in getting Mick Fleetwood together with Buckingham and Nicks to form the Fleetwood Mac we know today. Their album Rumors was recorded at Sound City. After that everyone wanted to record there. Great documentary.

0767919408|5.0|\\"One Summer: America, 1927\\"<br />Written by Bill Bryson<br /><br />One of the most elegant and edifying nonfiction writers of today, author Bill Bryson has a penchant for slightly off-center, esoteric topics. This time around, he's drawing a deft portrait of life in the United States during the summer of 1927, a time of great prosperity and modernization, with the as-yet-unsuspected Great Depression just around the corner and the existential upheavals of World War Two completely unimaginable. It was a season of mass interests, as radio linked the world and intercontinental flight became a reality, igniting the passions and imagination of humankind as never before. Babe Ruth, one of the great iconic baseball players, embarked on a stunning new home run record, with his fame rivaling that of aviator Charles Lindbergh, while politics, high finance and a scandal or two swirled in the background. This was a marvelous book, and a fun read with a puckish but informative historical view.  I've had the fortune to hear him read other essays and so I had the added advantage of being able to imagine him reading this one: be great to have this as an audiobook, as well.  Recommended! (DJ Joe Sixpack, ReadThatAgain book reviews)
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|The movie was so bad - I was waiting for Nicholas Cage to show up in a cameo as Oblivion was about the quality of Cage's films these days...
B00701QRB8|5.0|This is one of the best-achieved, most inventive, most powerful rock albums of the late 60s. This record, with Strictly Personal and of course Trout Mask Replica represent the infusion of rock with an unaffected surrealism, presented by a sensibility totally unique to the period.
B005PK1G76|4.0|Haven't used this yet.  Looks like it will accommodate a drink or medium water bottle with no problem.  Center storage large enough to hold small wallet, keys, cell phone, or snacks etc.  The wire frame keeps everything in place.  I think I will like using this item.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|SO glad I got a chance to read this! fantastic storyline backed by a style of writing that makes a lot of other dystopian scifi feel rigid. Was recommending to friends before I was half way through!<br />Q&A section inspired me to write my first review on amazon after over 100 books bought.<br />Keep going Mr. Howey! I'll make sure no one draws profanity in your books. Your writing doesn't deserve it.
B005D9MUWY|2.0|Nothing special. It's just regular android keyboard and not even better than regular galaxy. So, why bother to have this
B004QBWU02|5.0|Authentic through and through. I saw this movie at the time of its initial release when I was ten. At that time, it was paid homage to an era that wasn't even two decades out, but it captured another time and another place like so few works (Diner being one of the few) can do, and as a result, the movie only betters with age.
B00COCY67A|4.0|It was incredible listening, going thru the process to reach the final masters, I'm not sure if I'll ever get enough of ELVIS'S voice. There was a tremendous amount of talent in the Stax recording studio, during that time frame. Sit back, listen to 1-3 cds and it becomes quite easy to pretend you're there in person. Enjoy!
B000HKYNQ0|5.0|I liked Star Trek every since I was little. I wanted to be smart like Mr. Spock. Thank you for having it.
B004T4LUPW|2.0|seriously I don't want to create a new anything. says you can supposedly use it without creating an account, but the instructions don't work
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book along with the rest of the series are must reads. Once you start reading you just can't put it down. And it's a book you can read over and over. Trust me, this is my second time!! This book is truly for any age over the age of 14. There are some sexual moments but nothing too graphic. So come on and buy this book, but make sure you read the first one. :)

B003UBTX6S|4.0|This series gets better with each book. The plot and back story gets deeper with each book. Just don't watch the movie. It's terrible.
B000ZOXDFA|5.0|A wonderful treatment of a great figure and a great event.  it is a romantic treatment on some levels, but well worth your time.

140006922X|5.0|It is time someone with Reza Aslan's ability of combining exciting and clear writing with academic proofs of the reality of what Jesus was about, is told.  I always thought that this man was more of a radical visionary than was depicted by the \\"organized Christian church\\" leaders.  Mr. Aslan presents the scholarly research necessary to dispute the \\"cleaned up\\" version of the story of this Jewish rebel which the Christian leaders at the Council Nicea (beginning in 325 C.E.) decided would be best for their needs and the needs of the powerful and the Roman Empire -- my thoughts on this unique story. Thanks, Reza Aslan!
B005LAIH2M|2.0|Exactly which audience was this film going for-Teens and Adults (as the R Rating, language and violence would suggest) or Children? (as the over the top hammy dialog and its ridiculous hyperbolic delivery would have you believe)<br /><br />The premise of Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters was rife with potential and bad a**ery.  Unfortunately the campy acting and overly exaggerated villain-speak made me feel like I was watching a silly little cartoon instead.  Eye rolling and palms to the forehead aside-it was disappointing that the witches could manage to exaggerate every single line of dialog, yet Hansel couldn't even manage to fire his gun for the first forty minutes.  Sadly this film didn't even get remotely interesting until the last twenty-FINALLY making good on its promising premise.  By then it was too late though.  They even set things up pretty good for a sequel but given H&G's poor reception I doubt it will happen.  I'm convinced a sequel would've been a better film given that the original (hopefully) got all the crap out of the way.<br /><br />It's disappointing to see Hollywood squander yet another promising premise. I couldn't tell if this film took itself way too seriously or not seriously enough.  I was prompted to watch \\"Army of Darkness\\" immediately following because for the entire duration of H&G I kept imagining the witches boasting \\"I'll swallow your soul\\" then Ash popping up on screen to shove the siblings aside and blow the witches arrogant little heads off.  If you're gonna fight cocky supernatural baddies that's how you get the job done.  Talk just doesn't cut it.  :)
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|I was looking for something similar to 24. This one is good. It does not come even close to it, but definitely watchable. 24 one could at least watch sometimes with kids with somewhat caution. This one, definitely not, because of language used.
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|The story kept me interested and turning the pages but it was very sad. I need 5 more words .
B006RXQASA|1.0|my friend's brother just couldn't stop talking about how funny this movie was so we decided to check it out....and....well....we found it very boring.  we didn't find it funny, witty or the least bit amusing.  i just don't find jokes about the amount of oral sex one has performed very humerous and when it just goes on and one...well it put me to sleep and my boyfriend finished up the laundry.  i guess that is a plus that watching this movie prompted him to explore the exciting chore of laundry!<br /><br />overall i found the movie to be boring and i could care less about the character, unengaging dialogue and slow pacing.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|Still learning game. May improve rating later. I don't play it every day so it may takea while to learn it well.
B004AM5QT4|4.0|I found this book less riviting then some of his other books.  It was a good summer read.<br /><br />PS typos found throughout.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|The story was very engaging...couldn't put it down.  I love all of his stories, as I have read them all.
B004SKHJF2|2.0|Hi. I'm reviewing this application because I recieved a email from Amazon to doing it so I only have to say that both the free and paid versions on Google Play are updated to the latest version, but the Amazon one is still to be updated... I would like that Amazon updated this App as soon as Google does.<br />Best Regards<br />Tiago Leite
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Love this game! I thought it was just for kids but I'm addicted! The graphics are awesome and the minions are just so cute
B0063M22QO|5.0|Good perception processes.  Makes your brain think while having fun.<br />Each game makes you observe just a little bit closer.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Girlfriend wanted to see Red 2, so we figured I should experience red 1.  It was a good flick.  a
1416583432|5.0|I thought this book was excellent.  My dog is happy I read it also.  I recommend it to anyone who cares about their dog.
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|This racing game is amazing!  I have tried three of the best racing games on the appstore and this is by far my favorite.  The day I got this app, my son played on it the whole day, literally.  I would have paid $5 or more for this app.  If this was an Xbox game, it would probably be worth at least $60.<br /><br />Good:<br />+ Amazing graphics<br />+ Only one type of money (most racing games have two types, and you have to buy one kind)<br />+ Nice selection of cars<br />+ Cool tracks<br />+ Many cool racing modes<br />+ Good sound effects<br />+ Shortcuts<br />+ Wrecking other cars<br />+ Two different kinds of multiplayer<br />+ Free<br /><br />Bad:<br />- Takes up tons of storage space (because of the great graphics)<br />- Hard to get really far without buying credits from the game<br />- The game occasionally lags after playing for an extended period of time<br />- I paid $0.99 for this game, but it is now free<br />- IAPs<br /><br />Bottom Line:  I love this racing game, it only has a few small flaws.  I definitely recommend it for anyone trying to find a good racing game.  It is way better than other racing apps.  If you have some spare storage space, GET THIS APP!<br /><br />(Note: If you found my review to be unhelpful, please tell me why by commenting on my review so I can improve in the future. I try my best to make my reviews as helpful as possible. Thanks!)
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|I just read this again for the who knows how many times and it once again made me cry while filling me with joy.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|i love the history of rock and roll and this filled the bill for me  everyone should get it just for the story
044024630X|4.0|As with all of Lee Chids books I enjoyed the story line even though I could not buy into how he set it  up.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Best game ever but a lot of bugs in the game.me and my brother log in and the doors open by there self and it takes 1 minute to text something.
B00821OX98|5.0|Very good tv show ... little slow at first but boy! what a treat! A must watch for sci fi fans!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game is a very good free app. I would recommend this to anyone. It is really good for me in my old age. It's like exercise for my brain.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|This film really put my head in a blender for a while. Twists, turns not knowing what the truth is... A very good but, not great psychological thriller. However, the cinematography definitely was great.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Best series on TV that I've seen in a long time, well done! Can't wait till the new season starts.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this app.  Since I download I have not had a single problem.  It loads quickly and easily and it keeps me entertained even without Internet service!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Love this game. I like how the rooms don't change but the items change that you are looking for. Makes it very challenging and keeps it interesting. Just learning the ins and outs of everything. But that's the fun of it.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I liked bringing these characters and their personalities together in one well written story.  As mighty as each character is, their individual flaws were appropriately exposed and woven together to create a solid, captivating story line.
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|Not a bad show, definitely worth a watch lots of action little dialog, plot twists. Felt like they could've put more into it but it is what it is.
0062255657|5.0|The novel starts slow, veers off into magical realism, and then suddenly becomes so riveting that you won't be able to put it down.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game rocks. My kids and I love it. They play it over and over. The only downside is that El Machos place is kinda tough.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I would recommend this app. Stimulates the mind. Looking forward to more levels. Really keeps you alert and wanting more.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I saw the Hunger Games movie and had to buy all three books so I would know what happens. They did not disappoint.  I loved them would recommend to all ages (I'm 60).
B005LAIIPS|3.0|not bad but, not close to the first three with matt. it dose leave room for the adventure to continue.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|This film just rocks from start to finish. It's a Macho, buddy, road trip and romance movie all rolled up into one entertaining film. Worth the coins spent.
B003HKN52A|4.0|elvis is the best ever, everyone should get to live part of the music and see him in the movies.
B00DVKOYBM|1.0|Can't recommend this game! I've lost about 5000 points due to game glitches!<br />It IS fun when it works ...buy at your own risk.
B0000542D2|4.0|no problems, works fine. would buy again. beatles are the best group ever. they will live forever through there music.
B00EOO55GW|4.0|big fan of theres but I can honestly say its not there best. but it does have some good tracks on it and doesn't disappoint.
B009MF5BXK|3.0|lots of action, more body count than the first one. if you like action and body count you will like this movie.
1400052173|4.0|The book was in excellent condition. I was surprised ( and a little disappointed) when I found scribbles, underlines and footnotes on some of the pages. So new wasn't really new.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This game is entertaining. There are funny announcers that bicker from time to time. Gophers pop up randomly (not too much) like whack a mole while you play. There amusing mini games to help you progress and break the monotony. There is a store where you can spend your &quot;golf bucks&quot; that you earn on helpful items. Also, (and most importantly) there is a free trial version. Give it a try you won't regret it and for 99 cents why not get the full version!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I have mixed feelings but overall a good book!  There's more to it than most people think or have been told.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I'm a fan of the PianoGuys. I'm not up to date with what's happening in the music world (I have no idea who's & what's popular these days--and I'm 27) 'cause most of the stuff out there nowadays isn't MUSIC. It's just noise that's OK for now. The PianoGuys have made MUSIC in every sense of the word.<br />There are a few songs in here that are new arrangements of popular songs from today and the past, but I prefer their version to the original in a few cases (that's unheard of from me).<br />If you're a person who loves and misses true MUSIC, buy & listen to this album. You won't regret it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This was a decent read. I did enjoy it, just not as much as the first two. It's always interesting to see how a writer ends a trilogy :)
B00BWLKTOS|4.0|I like their first album more, but this one is still one of the best I've ever heard.<br />Like what I said for their 1st album, if you appreciate true, real MUSIC, you'll be doing yourself a favor by buying this album too.<br />The only reason I put 4 stars instead of 5 was because i like their 1st album more. That's all.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is an great game. The only reason I don't like it since the next map or update takes to long. Aim for Spike I've heard and seen he's fast also energetic
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Well, it's great fun if you like extreme violence and soap opera. Normally neither one of those by itself can get me excited, let alone combined. In this case Kurt Sutter and crew have pulled off a masterpiece. It takes great writing, great producing, great directing and great acting to get me interested in the lives of people I wouldn't want to know, let alone be, and that's exactly what 'Sons of Anarchy' has. Sutter manages to borrow just the right amount of Shakespeare's 'Hamlet' and 'The Godfather' to make a show similar to 'The Sopranos' but from the bottom of the criminal barrel rather than the top. I had never heard of Charlie Hunnam, but this British-born actor is perfect as Jax Teller. Katie Sagal takes a dark turn from her usual comedy as the biker bitch queen who will do just about anything to protect her family, even when it's from people whose only crime is to not fit her twisted idea of perfection. She walks a fine line between &#34;saving&#34; her son and driving him away. Ron Perlman is also terrific as the king of the Sons, who not only has to keep his stepson in line but also keep him from finding out about his own darker deeds.<br /><br />The rest of the cast are also perfect for the roles they play, and manage to make a group of not-very-nice characters into someone we can consistently relate to, if not exactly like.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|THIS GAME IS GREAT. If raising a unicorn isn't then I don't know what is!!! I love it so much.
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|Good show - can't wait for the finale for the season. Waiting for Season 2 to see where it goes.
B00AZ3027I|4.0|I wish I was able to turn the volume up more... Difficult to hear in some parts. Otherwise just as I remember it...
B001OR0AEY|5.0|Great documentary, its kinda sad it reminds me to all old school folks including my old man, great music also!
B000FBJAEG|4.0|This mystery was hard to put down. The plot was well thought out in an easy to follow format with no discontinuities. The characters have a life that displays emotions and frailties of real people. Mr. Baldacci is a great story teller!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really like this game, the sound is really funny. Some other game is boring but this is fun. Really liked it...
B00DGMVJAO|1.0|computer graphics were bad. acting was bad. violence was worse than PG-13. no one in our 4 person party enjoyed it.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|This is by far one of the best of The Camel Club, although all were great and worth reading. I could not put this book down, had to stay up late in the night to keep reading.
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|In this classic 1959 Alfred Hitchcock film, Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) is an average advertising executive. He is suddenly kidnapped by two individuals who mistake him for a Mr. George Kaplan. Thornill has no idea what is going on and only wants out, but then realizes his life might be at risk. From there, he ends up being chased by mysterious people across the United States.<br /><br />The film is a true classic that can still be enjoyed today. It has a complicated, interesting, and very well written plot.
B00EI6E0QM|5.0|Very well written and catchy. I'm not a die hard Gaga fan but i really love this song! Would definitely recommend
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Absolutely amazing. Great book. I loved it and enjoyed reading it a lot. I can't wait for the movie! Wonderful!
B0010T0QOK|1.0|They are non- slip as they say but they are NOT comfortable. Working for 8 hours my feet would be sore about 4 hrs into a shift. Very disappointed bc i was looking mostly for comfort. Will not buy Crocs brand again.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|It's like an international Forrest Gump who starts life as a Swede and lives lots longer. I would recommend this to anyone as both a fun read and fascinating adventure through history. I haven't laughed so hard---or so often--- while reading in a long time!
B005LAII4E|1.0|My wife and I tried to watch this movie. Made it through the opening scene. Despite all of the action I was already nodding off. Actually, I don't even think I can finish this review...zzzzzzzz
B005F96URI|5.0|Everyone should see this movie.The acting was great, you really wont regret it. I really don't understand why its not better known.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really liked playing game...this game is so realistic and fun for bigger kids..it's life-like and neat the different tricks you can do.
0307877965|5.0|I have listened to all of his books. This being the last was terrific. Lots of twists and turns. A master writer with intense details and thinking. I hope we get a cure and can bring him back, since its sad to have it end. Was a great series of books, I couldn't watch the TV series but am amazed at the written books. READ THEM IN THE RIGHT ORDER
B005K17RU0|5.0|I can wake up every morning a check the weather on the fly. It's easy to use and it has everything I need on the front cover. Plus it lets me know if any up coming storms are in the areas.
B00CATSONE|4.0|History is sometimes very unfair to the great geniuses. Tesla is one of those forgotten geniuses, who wanted to improve the lives of mankind.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|A short, entertaining overview of an extremely interesting period of Jewish history.  Only provocative to fundamentalist Christians.  So buy it already.
B00DM0UTPQ|1.0|I had expected a decent knock off of; &#34;The Hunt for Red October&#34;. This movie was a total let-down. I couldn't figure out what was going on. Don't waste your time on it.
1781162646|3.0|I pre-booked this on Amazon when it was first announced, and I thought it was a paperback original like the very first Hard Case crime written by Mr. King. Alas, I found out there were at least two other 'limited releases', and I wish I knew about those. As a book it is Mr. King at one of his quietest moods. Nothing much happens but the writing holds the narrative together; the characters are flimsy. Somewhere there are nostalgic reminiscences, as it should for an ageing writer. I enjoy the shorter Kings more than his tomes.
0812982622|5.0|This is one of the scariest most powerful novel I have read in a long time. I am actually having a hard time finding the next book after this powerhouse.Holy smokes.
B000BP86OG|5.0|I'm just discovering this album 8 years after it's release but better late to the party than never especially when the party rocks like these guys.  I've not heard the prior album so I'm judging this one based on it's own merits and you can color me impressed!  I love the RTB production and Queen-ish vocal layers, the playing by the band, and the songs just flat out rock. And all the 1 & 2 star reviewers here are SO off base, they're either kids that don't know what rock is to begin with or people content to listen to the homogenized crap on the radio today.  Too bad these guys didn't stay together, the world needs more real rock & roll like this.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|well it was cheap and did what I needed to do. If u need a knife sharpener it works but it will not give u a razer sharp edge but it is still sharp enoff to cut most anything.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|This book is amazing, funny and poignant all in one.  Drew is really something else but you love him.  He met his match in Kate and she is a prize.  The storyline is perfect and I totally recommend you read this book.  This author is great.  I will read this one again.
0783231032|5.0|This was the first R-rated movie I ever saw and is still one of the funniest movies ever made. Extra scenes, that's like extra scoops of ice cream.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|It's fun to go back and to see how it all began. A review of previous seasons gets us ready for the start of the new season. And because seasons are so very short, it's great to go back and see them again. I would highly recommend this.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Fun to play. I have never spent any Real money on this game. Play the Scratch game and win what you need with patience.
B009LMTDL0|2.0|I did not make it past the first chapter. I don't like the way she uses exclamation points in regular texts. I was not interested in the story at all.
B00CPLGGXM|2.0|The APU installed easily and had excellent options and features to choose from in the BIOS and it worked fine the first few weeks, however, it is very delicate.  Every time I tried to do anything out of the ordinary it would stop working and would not even let the mainboard start up.  The A10-5800K APU I originally bought is much more robust and is the backup I've used every time this unit goes bad, it just keeps working no matter what you do.  This was my 3rd unit and every single one has stopped working after a couple of weeks, the last one conked out while I was just cloning my hard drive!  It must be a bad lot at Amazon because most other reviews don't mention this weakness.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Well worth reading. This was a great book, it was wonderfully written with amazing characters. I loved every part of it.
B005L38QK2|4.0|It could be a little more complex, but it work, i would love to see a horned mouse or maybe some crystals growing from the mouse, but maybe is just the simplicity that make its good enough.
B005HED08I|5.0|Incredible how the thought of such High tech things so long ago. It is as modern as today. 1964 is like 2013!<br />You need to see it to believe it.
0307352153|2.0|I saw the Youtube video and was highly impressed.  Went out and bought the book.  Way too much detail.  Might be appropriate reading for Psychology PhD's but filled with case study after case study to the point of reading exhaustion.
B00B1OWEVC|4.0|The album Welcome Oblivion by Trent Reznor's How To Destroy Angels is a must-have for any NIN fan.  However, I will caution that if you did not enjoy the Ghosts album by NIN, you will probably not enjoy this album as a whole.  Songs like Ice Age and The Space in Between are very good, but others have a more instrumental focus.  The lyrics have a haunting, yet oddly relatable feel to them, which NIN fans should be familiar with.  All in all, a good buy!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. The ending has a great twist, I like the following of the 4 different woman. Great great book!
B00001QEE2|5.0|I love this movie very much. I works really great and the kids love it and its at a fair price too thank you
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I saw the movie first and I have to say reading the book was far better.. I liked it quite a bit, good easy read. I read it within 2 days.. Great reading material for a rainy boring day!!
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Tom Cruise action movie... you'd trust it would be good, but has his recent stuff been up to par.  Who cares!  Oblivion was original and just down right entertaining.  I loved every second of this action packed sci-fi film.  Enjoy!
B009JBZH54|4.0|This reboot of Batman is done right, it's dark and gritty, if fun and you'll love the characters. This is a must see on blu ray, Skip the dvd!
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Tom Cruise doing what he does best.  Running around and buy the hell out of people.  I thought the movie moved very slow, but the fight scenes and the action sequences were pretty fun.  I'd recommend renting this if you're in the mood for an okay story, good acting, and good fight scenes.
B001AGXEA6|4.0|What a classic film and the perfect example of upscaling older content to blu ray. This movie is one of my favorite dark whimsical Tim Burton film with such a fun cast. You'll be quoting this movie and talking about favorite scenes with friends for years to come! enjoy
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I personally found this book interesting, furthermore this book was a sad book with a spot of happiness. After all, the mood is a side effect of living.<br />I recommend this book to the kind of people  who can handle a sad story
B0055D3EFU|5.0|It was a very good movie! Full of mystery and it had a great plot. A horror movie that went beyond un- need gore!!!
B0058VW36U|4.0|Great brain workout! Starts easy to get you accustomed to the game then gets progressively difficult. Live every minute playing this game!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I like it for its monitoring capabilities. It lets me know when I need to clean my cache and does the job efficiently, allowing me to move on to my next task.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|This is a great product, but I really wish that I could use it on my tablet, a Galaxy Tab 2. App Store says that it's not compatible, which is a shame because I'd rather draw on a 10\\" device than my phone :(
0394826817|5.0|The book arrived promptly, in excellent condition. Very pleased to see a  classic, childhood book available and in good condition. Excellent book for children. Lots of 'fun' pictures to amuse them with and fun way to learn life's basic manners :-)
B0063IH60K|5.0|As usual, MobilityWare does their outstanding job.  I have been more than impressed with their quality.  My wife says the same thing and she is even more critical than I am about her games.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I downloaded this app to take notes in class on my kindle. It keeps everything very organized and handy. Defiantly a must for student.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|I couldn't be any more thrilled with my purchase. I am a beginner photographer and this really added exactly what I needed in those low lighting settings. I am so happy that the other reviews helped me decide which flash to go with. This was worth every single penny
1932100385|5.0|If you are someone who goes by the sociatle standard of true health then you are not very healthy. If you read this book and use this as a guide to health you can never go wrong. Amazing study and kudos to Mr. Campbell.
B005LAII62|5.0|Bought it for my granddaughter n she loved it n I loved it to.  Was not just a kid movie.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I have been a player of Team Lava for a year now.I have played Fashion Story,Bakery Story,Farm story,And Pet Story.Now Restaurant Story!These games are QUITE amazing and pretty addicting.!I recommend them!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|One of the best fantasy novels I have ever read, and a worthy follow up to the equally fantastic \\"Name of the Wind\\". I highly recommend reading both books in chronological order. I was so pleased and enchanted with Name of the Wind that I wasn't sure the sequel could live up to my own expectations, but it did. Rothfuss has created a masterpiece with this trilogy. His prose is beautiful and mesmerizing, and his lead character is fascinating. I couldn't put either book down until I had finished them. Now I am counting the days until the third book is released. The bottom line: read \\"The Name of the Wind\\" and then read \\"The Wise Man's Fear\\". You won't be disappointed.
B00CO4KGYA|4.0|&quot;Tennis In the Face&quot; is a fun yet exciting game.Yet,not addicting.It is a resemblance of &quot;Stupid Zombies&quot; Yet using Tennis Balls.I like how the game as a nice beginning story and tutorial,but lacks the great set up like Cut The Rope,Angry Birds,Ect. The cartoon style along with the great graphics sets a wonderful attitude for the game.The Characters go along with the story VERY well.I still suggest a few smite changes for this game.I don't think it deserved free app of the day.But it is,what it is!Over all it is a good app.I recommend 10 and up...It is a bit TOO...just not suitable for under that age.The characters are set for higher age groups.Over all!A good app!I recommend it!
B008ZCWFEE|5.0|I love this app and will be sharing it with math educators everywhere.  It is a great way to teach the rules of solving algebraic equations!
B00AEBB8YW|4.0|This is a great movie and I was really looking forward to watching it. The movie is of low grade quality which was disappointing. The sound quality was very poor as well so I had to turn up the volume a lot.  I think I will switch my movie purchases to Walmart or Best Buy. I have had better luck there.
B00EAH3GHI|5.0|They must have been so sick of Teen Spirit, to not play it at a concert..Btw folks the 20 year old to 40 year old thing doesn't apply to Nirvana..Kurt was born in 67, so he'd be 45 this year..so try like 15-55 year olds..
B0039NJTLQ|4.0|This was a very good movie with excellent actors.  Would recommend it . It was quite an emotional movie.  Really liked it.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I use this on my android phone and kindle fire. A great clean up app. One of the best free apps in the market.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|If you haven't seen this you must buy it! It's perfection in one movie! As close as you can get to Broadway!
B00881VLCE|5.0|GREAT GAME, SO MUCH FUN.  THE ABILITY TO PICK THE NUMBER IF PIECES MAKES IT VERY CHALLENGING.  THE FREE OPTIONS GIVE YOU A LITYLE TASTE THAT YOU WANT MORE.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I really liked it, I do think this should have been book Four part B instead of Five, and I understand why some were not as happy with this book, however, it was a great story, one that must be told to prepare us for the next. It was to much to put into one book, so here was four and five. Great tales, betrayals, and twists. Had me on my toes. As an avid reader, this was great! Things are happening! There are many stories in this series. All of them are intense. Great read.
B0001GNJQ0|1.0|The dvd sent me doesn't work and would like it replaced. When I put the dvd into the player, the words 'incorrect disc' come up and the player will not show the movie.
0399255370|5.0|I chose this book for my grandkids because of the high ratings and was disappointed.  I truly enjoyed the creativity and my grandkids loved each color's story.  A real winner of a book
B008XBHIEY|4.0|I watch Jaws every few years, to me it's something of a classic. I first saw it in the theater when I was pregnant with my son and it almost scared the baby out of me!
0385535147|5.0|John Grisham did it again!  I truly enjoyed this book, the story was easy to follow even tho he was not giving all the details of the story, leaving a surprise ending.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I love Mahjong. Really enjoy this version. Best part? Free -- and NO annoying and obnoxious ads!!! Download, install, and enjoy!
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|I am really looking forward to saving some money on batteries. So far it seems to be doing what it is supposed to do.
0545586178|5.0|I love this book.  Ms. Collins is a spectacular writer and the book is hard to put down<br />LOVE IT
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Liked it better than the first one of this series.  Action packed lots do fun to watch. Great type casting
0439023521|5.0|I love this book.  Ms. Collins is a spectacular writer and the book is hard to put down<br />LOVE IT!

0439023513|5.0|I love this book.  Ms. Collins is a spectacular writer and the book is hard to put down<br />LOVE IT
B0013Y1UHO|1.0|I have been reading the kindle version of this book and I am very disappointed.  There are updated comments that would be in the margins of a print book that just show up randomly in the kindle version. There is not formatting in the book to give you clues when switching from the original version to the twentieth anniversary comments.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is a well written story. I have a connection to characters that I couldn't  feel completely with the show.
B005EHILV4|5.0|This unit is great:) It allows me to do my weekly radio talk show in my office. I also use it to do recordings==great value for the price.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|I wanted to like this Movie but found it to be a big disappointment. Too much of everything, decor, sound and acting.  I'd seen the Movie Gatsby with Robert Redford and Mia Farrow years ago, it was a 5 star experience.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I decided to download  this app since it very easy and simple to manage your desire search plus saves time.<br />I am very pleased and gladly recommend to anyone.<br /><br />Many.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Awesome keyboard, I like the fact that you could change the layout with different colour. I recommend it. Galaxy s3
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This backpack is super padded. I can fit both my film slr and my DSLR into it along with four other lenses. 10/10 would buy again. AMAZING product.
B00992CF6W|4.0|My youngest daughter likes this as it is easy to navigate, my 11 year old however finds it too simplistic and not enough to hold her interest.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|LOVE THIS CD J COLE WENT HARD! A MUST BUY FOR SURE! CANT BEAT THE REALNESS UNLIKE KANYA AND ALL THE OTHER FAKE ARTIST
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|My daughter (8) is a Leukemia Survivor, I often looked about the wards and met teens who were on treatment, some with good prognosis and others not so much. I find that John Green captures some of the teens I met and the feelings they had regarding their cancer precisely, and others not so much. In the end, this a a novel, it is fictional and he states as much. The book is beautifully written...<br /><br />The ending is disappointing and predictable, you know it is coming and want it to be more, yet in the world of cancer perhaps (spoiler alert)...... there just isn't more to be said.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Was getting ready to go on a trip with a few long layover and decided to find a few free games to occupy my time.  Boy did I!!! This game is just what I was looking for.<br /><br />Couple of annoying things like health potions not able to be purchased anytime you want.  This is actually good because you won't find yourself grinding hours of play away.  It gives you reason to take a break which I like.<br /><br />Each day gives me a goal.  Once I reach it I'm done and can do something else slot might mark it down because of this but I see it as a plus because getting lost in a game is fine but breaks are good too.
B0096HK46S|4.0|Bad special effects and a silly plotline, but this is just a fun campy movie to watch on a rainy night.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i like this bible version would like it offline so i can check  out bible scriptures elswhere besides home enjjoy the reading
B0085RZGG8|5.0|Superb book.  If you are interested in a soldier's point of view regarding WW II, specifically D Day to the invasion of Berlin, this is a must read
B000NDIAWY|4.0|I'd been enchanted with &#34;The Story&#34; since I saw &#34;The Lucky One&#34; and was pleased with the acoustic work on the entire cd.
B004CFAWK2|5.0|The book jumps around a lot in the beginning, by  once you are able to keep track of the characters and storyline it is amazing. Really well written and a heart warming story of love and the lost life of registration. This book really makes you stop and reflect on the role of colored people an  their loyalty in the 1930's-50's.
B00CO4KGYA|3.0|I like they made this game free but before it was 3$ which was not necessary at all this game is fun but boring at the same time
1571200851|5.0|this is a book my mother in law wanted so I ordered it on my account. she is very pleased with it and says anyone that quilts will love this book.
B009SKPVO8|3.0|Great  but it doesn't fit well to my camera with the battery grip, but for my camera only it works very well.
B00DH1G7DS|4.0|It is a fun game, especially for beginners like me. The only reason I docked it 1 star is that is crashes every so often. I recommend it for hours of fun!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My sister loves this game, and she plays it all the time!!!!! I recommend this to all girls who love horses and taking care of them.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|This game is great.  Some of the puzzles are pretty easy but some are very difficult.  I got stuck on several and needed help.  My lest favorite is round and round it just takes me to long to complete.  I give this game a 5  star.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This game is fun &amp; challenging for all ages.  My grandma &amp; great-grandchildren love this game so much I have to stay up late to get a chance to play.
0316067598|5.0|Amazing Book! The best most personal account of true heroism you'll ever read!  What that ran endured its heart breaking but the personal struggle for Marcus to survive is inspiring
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|Pretty cool game.  Nice that it's free today but I would've paid a buck for it.  Not too hard and not too easy so far. I definitely recommend.
0143124544|5.0|This is up there with my favorite novels of all time.  Everyone I have recommended it to has loved it also.  Can't imagine someone not liking it.  I am now reading more novels by the same author.
B005FVA3LK|5.0|If you are a die hard U2 fan, or if you think &#34;Achtung Baby&#34; is one of the best records ever written or produced, this is the box for you. All the extra CD/DVD's and notes provide profound insight to the making of this masterpiece: It's like getting a behind the scenes look to your favorite record. The documentary, is a great piece of film, with some amazing confessions from U2 band members, plus you get to read for the first time what two of the greatest producers of music of all times - Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois - thought and did during the making of the album: Priceless. I waited two years for the price to get down for this box, and now I am sooo happy, it went above and beyond anything I ever expected. Please take your time to listen and go through everything, there is a surprise behind every nook and cranny. Have a great bottle of red wine available to accompany you through the voyage, I guarantee it's a great partner to the trip.
B00C8YOIR2|5.0|Dead Medium by Peter John is a new favorite book for me. There was absolutely nothing that I didn't love about this ghost story with a twist.  A medium is someone who can speak to the dead but the dead speaking to the living, well this is what May Elizabeth Trump can do.<br />This is not your average ghost story. May is so funny that I often laughed out loud, from her very first realization, that to her utter horror, she has \\"passed on\\" because she choked on a piece of cake and her living room is left in minor disarray. The developing of the story is smooth and the characters have great chemistry as they banter with each other and try to save the home of Chole that has been in her family for generations. To do this, the plan is to act as medium between ghosts and the living and raise money. Can this possibly work with so many things that can go wrong?<br /><br />This is a fun read where the characters came to life along with their surroundings. Reminding me of my own cantankerous grandma who was also very loving this story kept me turning pages until the end came all too soon.<br /><br />I was gifted this copy of Dead Medium for an honest review and I highly recommend this ghost story with a clever twist for a great read 5 stars and I can't wait for another book by Peter John.
B005LJITS0|3.0|I thought this was a very poor portrayal of the Hal Jordan character. The story line was also too condensed.
B00DSOG0QS|5.0|Bodies: Book #1 Staged Fright is a  high action packed mystery/suspense thriller.  The author Sameer Ketkar has developed a humorous story-line interweaving with this very dark plot of a body that is discovered with a deadly disease.<br /><br />There's a quarantine, terrorists, germ warfare, pot dealers, and much more in this riveting plot and there's Neil, he tells the story from his point and I hope in the next book he is stronger than ever, even if he feels he doesn't explain things well he is an excellent narrator. He will find the truth if someone will just listen to him.<br /><br />There wasn't much I didn't like about the characters and their development through the story-line, there was always something going on at the end of every chapter. I couldn't stop, just one more page, but the interest held and so I gave up and just read it all. Very smooth flowing and everything comes together splendidly.<br /><br />Overall this is a captivating read that I received from the author for an honest review. I highly recommend this book and like me you too will be waiting for book 2, 5 stars.
B00992CF6W|5.0|you have the  best game in the hole wide  world.  and i hope you make  kool  games to.  and i very love that game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is such a fun game it looks very real and it is very fun I really recommend this game. :) :)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its fun when you need to pass some time and loos yourself for awhile.. entertaining for my niece who is 3
B008M0NDOK|2.0|This thing is too small to support the game, and now a few fun games to be charged hundreds of dollars, not worth it, if you can support more games, then good, looking forward to some day.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Not worth reading. I kept on as it was for book club, but none of us felt it had any redeeming quality. Characters, plot, outcome were all as disappointing as the language. So unnecessary and distasteful.
B006JPS1OM|1.0|I really liked this game BUT like I have seen with other reviews after you close it it will NOT REOPEN .... AND I PAID FOR THE FULL VERSION!!!! Too bad I didn't read the reviews before I PAID for the full version. I definitely will from now on!!!! VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!! I wouldn't have given any stars but couldn't post without at least 1 star.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|Its a book about the historic Jesus and its good for someone who are beginning interesting in this issue. Definitely its not for believers or anyone that is looking for Jesus Christ the Christian God. There are others (a lot of) good books about the historic Jesus and the only peculiarity is presenting Jesus as Zealot with reasonable arguments.
1614270198|5.0|Murphy has done an excellent job presenting a very powerful description and analysis of how your subconscious mind affects your life in every way.
B0049VZ222|5.0|I love it. cannot get enough. Have played it for several people who are now hooked/ My husband teases me about my addiction. LOL. Just plain love it
1607066017|3.0|the artwork in this graphic novel is great but the violent storyline seems more intense because the characters are a family, probably not actually any more violent than other such works.  My old husband hated it but I think my 18 year old grandson will like it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|A good quality free app. The widget looks nice and it displays all sorts of neat stats like how much time is left on the battery depending on what you plan to do with it (like read, play a 2d or 3d game, or browse the web. A neat feature)
B00DAABKQK|5.0|I love this movie.  Many say it is the worst ever made,  It is actually one of the best movies ever made.  Watch it twice, buy it and watch it again.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I put off reading  this series for a while because I heard from my friends what it was about. I co worker opened my eyes a week ago and told me it was so much more than just kinky sex. After finishing the third book I whole heartedly agree. This is a raw passionate love story that many readers may find unconventional. I have been reading romances since I was 13 and I really was not shocked or appalled or offended by anything in these books. Good job!
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|I invested 2 hours of my time, not including download wait, before the movie froze up. The movie was so bad I decided I didnt want to invest more download time then finding my position in the movie to watch the end.<br /><br />I am highly disatisfied with the download concept of movie watching and will very rarely and judiciously use this service in the future.<br /><br />I only wish I could give the movie a half star.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|it is a great alarm clock I will use it everyday.I sure glad I got this app thank you very much
B004T4LUPW|4.0|It is a very nice Calendar I think its one of the best for Android phones. You should try it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|very addictive.  just wish there were more!  I hope they hurry with the updates,  I need more levels! definitely a fan .
B003JHKORK|4.0|Love how they bring the cheaters to life . Rick Riordan is amazing writer. Can't hardly Waite tell the next movie comes out.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I was not expecting a lot witb this ap.  I was pleasantly surprised. that. this Ap. was as versital as it was,  and had several. extra items that it monitered
B009GEAWOU|5.0|This is a show that definitely has you guessing what will happen next. My wife and I have enjoyed watching it together - admittedly she more than I. Looking forward to getting through all the episodes.
0812983459|5.0|I started this book with no expectations and with some trepidation. Ended up loving it and Harold. What start out as a &#34;piece of fluff', dragged me in and ended being quite a memorable and deep book. I would strongly recommend this to anyone.
B009AY04A8|4.0|Very fun game.  I couldn't stop until I finished.  There are hints if you get stuck,but you probably won't need them.  Good story line, too.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I haven't had this much fun in a farmville type game ever before. sure its a shameless cash grab but I have no beef with that.
0553801473|4.0|The book is well written and full of action as befits the 5th book in this series.  I get really ticked at not being able to get through the whole thing and having to wait for the next book to be published.  Reading the book after seing the series helps you visualize the characters.  I notice the differences and cannot say one is better than the other over all but I tend to favor the books.  I am not really happy with the Saturday morning serial cliff hanger ending in this volume. I would be buying the next volume in the series anyway. Cherryh's Foreigner series does a much better at making each volume also stand by itself, that is the one big failing of this series.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|It is now more difficult to find the info I want/need. At least it is still free. And that's it.
B00ALQSNV6|5.0|I love this mini-series.  I seriously have lost count on how many times I have watched it.  Though there were bigger dinos than T-rex, I still think he is the King.  The dinosaurs and stories rock!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|really makes you think things through. not so hard that you get frustrated and lose interest. I look forward to more
B007C4ZJ0S|4.0|Its about time a woman took control on things and got to the end and made things right. hahahaha yeah
1908117230|1.0|I would think Pierre would explain more on how he came to be the dominant macaron sellers in this book, even we might have read some articles over the newspaper or periodical, but it would be nice to read some other unknown stories in his own publish. Other than that, recipe is easy to follow.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|It was undoubtly a very moving picture to watch. But it made you realize how blessed we are to live here.
140006922X|5.0|It is an emphatic and documented relation of the historical role of Jesus and his surroundings and brethren in his times. It is a very good journey in history, a seminal périod and place, that reverberate to our days in our lives.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|i liked it so much, I watched season 1 & 2 within just a couple weeks. It was excellent. I could not get enought of it.
1401938906|5.0|Written in a easy to read fashion, interjected with humor, witnessed with real life examples and packed full of simple wisdom. Love it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|you should get it but it might take a couple minutes to load and I think you should put it on game circle.
0062255657|3.0|I enjoyed Neil Gaiman's story telling and the way he speaks to his readers. However, I found the plot of the story rather strange. I began reading the booking thinking it was a story about an adult man looking back on his childhood. The story begins that way, but then turns into a strange story about magical beings. It turns out that his childhood memory is of some sort of encounter with being who are either magic of from a parallel universe. The fantasy story line seems to come out of no where, and often isn't very well explained (there is a strange scene between the boy and his father that I was unsure if the father was supposed to be under the control of the magical beings or just a mean father).<br /><br />If you like fantasy fiction, you may enjoy this book. If you are looking for a book that focuses more on remembering childhood, you most likely will be disappointed.
B00A2H9PLG|3.0|While I have to say, this film was entertaining, because of the high octaine action, and (for the most part) a really good cast. Now onto the story, this has to be one of the most overused plots ever, and some of the characters are horribly written, and there is a couple of scenes in the movie that'll make you laugh out load, especially one scene that's near the end, has to do with Chaning's characters daughter, so freaking funny, especially when this thing is mentioned in earlier in the movie. And there are many more, if you are coming in to see an emotionally engaging story, go somewhere else. If want to laugh at crazy action, stereotypes, oneliners, and hysterical moments, you'll have a great time.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|I enjoy the game but polnts are not generated often enough.  Purchases of points have to be made.  The old game allowed you to play longer.  I also requested a rematch and lot my points.
B003UYUP58|5.0|A fascinating book.  Reads like a novel and yet is so informative.  Finally, I understand why cancer is so difficult to beat.<br />A real eye-opener.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Mmmm, it is easy to talk about a very good book, or a very bad book. But when you have to talk about an average bookyou only can think about the other books you could read during the time you spend reading it.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I really love this game and have  played it quite often since I have had my kindle. Nice the app is free and it is really fun to play
B006LSZECO|5.0|I had read the reviews on this book put it on my list of must read.  Another woman in my book club picked it for her selection.  This book did not disappoint.  I may read this again.  Really great character development.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|I didn't know if I would like this game but was free so downloaded and it keeps you hopping and very fun.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  It flowed well & was easy to read & get into.  I enjoyed the complexities of the relationships between the characters.  While it didn't blow me away, I would absolutely recommend it to anyone & I will be starting on book two today.  I already have book three on my Kindle as well & plan to purchase the rest of the books in the series.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|A very good bag with so many racks to have ur Handy cam, Camera, Lens etc.. It should have made water proof for getting 5 stars.. Everything else is pretty good..
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I wasn't expecting much, hadn't heard of the author, thought it was just a cheap book for a quick read etc. I couldn't put it down! I enjoyed this book and the whole time I was wondering what would happen next. The ending could go one of two ways and I didn't think there was anything obvious to tell me which way it would go so I was still surprised at the end.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Beware, you will not be able to put this book down. Great book, even better the the show (which is one of my favorites).
B00DF92E7U|5.0|Great album, hope it is the first of many to come. Definitely recommend to any who like Stephen Stills or Kenny Wayne Shepard
B00D2HTRVQ|5.0|Seriously, we have loved every Dr Panda game we've downloaded, and this is no exception. Very interactive, entertaining, & real life tasks with a fun twist.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Really awesome book! A must read!! Had me wanting to read me and more each day. Now I want to continue on and read the other books in the series.

B00CTKHXFO|5.0|I havent been an avid gamer since high school but I have bought every MGS game to come out on playstation. i think its the best series out there. other games cant keep my attention and i sometimes even have a hard time following the plot of MGS but i still love the action the game has.
0937381888|5.0|This is a definite must have for anyone trying to home brew! Read it once and already brewing like a pro!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Rothfuss' writing is beautifully crafted and compelling. His characters are people I don't want to let go of. I'm re-reading these first two books of the series anxiously awaiting the arrival of the 3rd.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Couldn't put it down, it is Stephen King, after all.  The ending was a little disappointing, felt a bit rushed.  Fast read for 800 pages!
B00992CF6W|2.0|Had this on my other phone. Got a new one and tried to download. Downloads quickly, but when I try to open it, a box immediately pops up, and makes me force close... I dont know what it means though
0316789798|5.0|My daughter immediately loved this book and started to draw different scenes with the animals.  She drew everything from safari animals to an aquarium.  I would definitely recommend this book.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game has amazing graphics and if brilliantly plotted the weapons and armor are great the one downside is that you can only have one fairy unless you buy a bunch of diamonds
B004IFD9HE|2.0|boring movie<br />Mr Sandler wasn't a very good actor, and the writers did a very poor job on the script. It was a waste of time watching it.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|I think it's a great game love the challenge it offers. Thank you for a great game...... looking for more games like this.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I love this journaling app. Writing is simple and you can add your own flair. It's very easy to draw with fingers or stylus pen.
B00785P2QC|4.0|It is fun. Because I think it is fun . Enough said give me my readers. Oh I need more now do I? Ok here you th o
B004LQGXLE|5.0|I don't think this movie needs my review but I'll write it since Amazon asked.<br /><br />This movie has everything, humor, action, drama and romance.<br /><br />Paul Newman is one of the greatest actors, I wish he was still alive.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|Story was entertaining and the writer keeps things moving along quite well in this book.  Enjoyed reading it and look forward to more!
B000P6PVLC|5.0|...actually worth watching! so many films aren't interesting or thought provoking...this one however was worth it...<br />Brad Pitt is often just something nice to look at but not all that interesting in terms of the characters he plays, this was pretty good.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|My wife finished every level on the Wii version, and now says the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 version is better due to more accurate placement of the ... &#34;Goo&#34;.  On both platforms, its a great game, certainly not just another remake of a game we've all seen many times.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you never saw these episodes - - - or if you saw some of them - - - or if you saw them all;  this is a 'must have' for any sci-fi fan.  The series was canceled before it really got off the ground.  No pun intended.  It had the potential to be a very long running series.  A treasure for any collection.
B0007XT87G|5.0|To the uneducated ear, Porcupine Tree (and their eighth album, 2005's \\"Deadwing\\"), come across sounding like pure, 100% Opeth worship, as they do feature an Opeth-ian sound, and even go so far as to include a few tracks that have a cameo from said Swedish band. But the thing is, P.T. formed in 1987, three whole years before the formation of Mikael Akerfeldt's progressive death metal outfit. Indeed, this band was one of the original prog rock/metal groups, and one that looked towards Neurosis, Dream Theater, King Crimson, and Radiohead for inspiration. Definite traces of Tool, Rush, Nine Inch Nails, Queen, and Yes can be heard, here, as well.<br /><br />So, on the whole, the effort is first and foremost influenced by Seventies prog, but it does filter in some Eighties elements, in addition. And as is the case with any Porcupine Tree effort, \\"Deadwing\\" is a treasure trove of wonderful melodies that are only occasionally offset by mean metallic crunch. It is highlighted by a wealth of technical acoustic guitar work, including numerous acoustic solos, and technically-proficient guitar leads. The end result is easily one of the finest prog rock and metal records of the new millennium.<br /><br />\\"Deadwing\\" can mostly be broken down into three main sections: The heavy, the proggy balladry, and the songs that fall somewhere in between. First I will describe the former subset. Lead single \\"Shallow\\" is a surprisingly speedy, aggressive, and riff-oriented rocker/metal song with some of the busiest and heaviest riffs ever written by Porcupine Tree. It also features up-tempo drumming and impressive bass work (including a grumbling bass bottom and mini bass interlude) flowing throughout. And only occasionally does the tune venture into proggy territory with some gorgeous string breakdowns. And \\"Open Car\\" is another pleasantly surprising inclusion, as it is quite possibly the album's heaviest song, and one that boasts big, meaty guitar riffs. It all makes for a much more accessible and mainstream piece than what is find on most of the album, too, in that it is straightforwardly heavy and fails to crack the four-minute mark.<br /><br />Now, on to the second group of songs. \\"Lazarus\\" is a fantastically gorgeous, docile, and all-around heavenly ballad with breathtaking, placid string arrangements, some cool piano keys, and U2-meets-Coldplay-inspired clean vocal cooing. And moving along, \\"Mellotron Scratch,\\" is another piece of beautiful, strings `n' all balladry, this one, however, is highlighted by falsetto, operatic, and even at times a capella and angelic-sounding clean singing. Then, following the ever-so aptly-entitled \\"Start Of Something Beautiful,\\" another b-e-a-utiful and minor-key ballad that marries spindly melodic guitar lines and tunefully humming/grumbling bass lines with some heavenly, classical music-derived piano playing, comes the last ballad of the bunch in \\"Glass Arm Shattering,\\" which is a very fantastically dreamy, \\"The Wall\\"-era Pink Floyd-inspired interlude.<br /><br />And next we have the songs that fall somewhere in between the two above-described styles of songs. \\"Deadwing\\"'s set-opening titular cut begins by finding some very Opeth-ian clean singing trading off with creepy, spoken-word-esque whispers. And these two vocal stylings are both elegantly laid over a crashing drum beat, a moderately-heavy guitar riff, and flowing, dexterous, propulsive bass lines. The odd keyboard and organ splash pops up here and there, too, as does a short but sweet melodic guitar solo. It all makes for one overtly Opeth-inspired opening epic, and one that clocks in at well past the nine- minute mark. And only occasionally does it dabble with heavier territory, like venturing into some chunky, ominously bottom-heavy chugging.<br /><br />But \\"Arriving Somewhere But Not Here\\" is an even more expansive, sprawling, and involved epic. It is a twelve-minute and two-second long album centerpiece, and one that opens with some lonely acoustic strumming being anchored by aquatic-sounding keyboards. The number, which is also of note for featuring a cameo from no other than Opeth's Mikael Akerfeldt, boasts some very warm, harmonic, and soulful crooning which helps to further its epic and ambient vibe, as do its melodic, beeping bass lines, and soaring harmonic guitar leads. The number eventually (and very gradually) gains momentum, though, building off of its own energy and speed until it eventually climaxes by settling down into an industrial-strength, chugging groove. And the icing on its cake comes from when it drops in a divinely pretty (and, needless to say, eminently infectious) acoustic solo.<br /><br />These above described three parts might make up most of the album, but that does not mean that they are not its only standouts. One absolutely must mention \\"Halo,\\" which is driven by a nimble-fingered, technical, slapped bass line and some calm, melancholy, near spoken-word-esque vocal muttering. And better yet, the closing \\"Shesmovedon\\" weaves in some niftily hooky, \\"wah-wah\\" guitar licks in with a surprisingly lengthy and emphatic, wah-drenched guitar solo (which carries a large portion of the track's second half). It all makes for a delightful little curveball on a Porcupine Tree release, and one that is certainly likely to stick onto the listener's brain after only one listen.<br /><br />\\"Deadwing\\" is not a flawless effort, as it could stand to be a touch or two heavier (a couple more big riff rockers never hurt anybody!).

Essential listening? Definitely!mming being anchored by aquatic-sounding keyboards. The number, which is also of note for featuring a cameo from no other than Opeth's Mikael Akerfeldt, boasts some very warm, harmonic, and soulful crooning which helps to further its epic and ambient vibe, as do its melodic, beeping bass lines, and soaring harmonic guitar leads. The number eventually (and very gradually) gains momentum, though, building off of its own energy and speed until it eventually climaxes by settling down into an industrial-strength, chugging groove. And the icing on its cake comes from when it drops in a divinely pretty (and, needless to say, eminently infectious) acoustic solo.<br /><br />These above described three parts might make up most of the album, but that does not mean that they are not its only standouts. One absolutely must mention \\"Halo,\\" which is driven by a nimble-fingered, technical, slapped bass line and some calm, melancholy, near spoken-word-esque vocal muttering. And better yet, the closing \\"Shesmovedon\\" weaves in some niftily hooky, \\"wah-wah\\" guitar licks in with a surprisingly lengthy and emphatic, wah-drenched guitar solo (which carries a large portion of the track's second half). It all makes for a delightful little curveball on a Porcupine Tree release, and one that is certainly likely to stick onto the listener's brain after only one listen.<br /><br />\\"Deadwing\\" is not a flawless effort, as it could stand to be a touch or two heavier (a couple more big riff rockers never hurt anybody!).

B008XBCJ34|5.0|There is no better demonstration of Blue Ray/DVD quality than this wonderful story.  The pictures and sound make this a must for any A/V fan, as well as the story for generations.  You don't have to be a sci-fi or fantasy fan to have this in your collection.  You will play this over and over.  It just never gets old.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It will take you in and keep you think about this puzzle when you are not playing.  It moves right alone.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|An excellent recap and final episode of what should have been a 'long running' series.  Canceled in its infancy.  A must for the sci-fi fan.  Thank you Joss for a wonderful (and too short) ride.
B0060AY85C|4.0|This is a story of courage, accepting truths about oneself and carrying on.  Very easy to read...interesting and different. Life can be very hard.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|Being a cellist myself I loved this movie.  The premise sounds a little strange but it was very moving and well done.
B00APKIN1I|5.0|This has grown on me over time with repeated listens. I'm familiar with the performers from their respective bands and worried it might be a muddle when they came together. I'm pretty happy with my purchase and also appreciate the AutoRip thing amazon is doing now.
B00005YUNY|5.0|I got this DVD last week and have already watched it twice.  Although I already own Live at Tsongas, I bought this one for the epic songs and orchestral backing, which marry extremely well, especially Close to the Edge and Gates of Delirium, which are not on the other DVD.  I'm very glad I added it to my collection
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Attaches quickly. Easy setup. Easy connection to the network. My greatest joy is being able to control the device from my laptops and Android devices - it is so much easier to control than similar devices because it is easy to to use the full applications when searching and navigating vs using a remote control and typing one letter at-a-time, etc. Love it. Got one for every TV I own and take one with me when traveling.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I pre-ordered a Chromecast in mid July.  I received it around July 30th.  Easy setup.  Took me about 3 minutes.  Does everything I want it to with 1 exception.  It will not stream local content, meaning media files on your local networked computer, phone or tablet.  Yes, there is a workaround by opening your local content in a chrome browser tab.  Right now, it doesn't work well for my needs.<br /><br />Youtube, Netflix and Google Play stream effortlessly to my HD television with stunning success.  As others have said, when doing one of these online services (and the many to  come) are streamed directly from the internet to your router to the Chromecast.  This process will allow you to turn off the device used to engage the service once it is streaming to the Chromecast.  You can leave the device on and use it as a remote.  Leaving the device on uses less than 1% of my cpu on my Samsung GS3.  Not much, doesn't seem to run battery down.<br /><br />Streaming a tab from the Chrome browser on a desktop or laptop works very well for me.  I have very fast computers.  Both my laptop and desktop have 3rd generation i7 processors and have little problem casting the Chrome browser tab.  However, after reading reviews, I tried an older i3 laptop.  It was not able to handle the process of getting it to the Chromecast from the Chrome browser.  As the content in this scenario is streamed from the internet to your router, then to you computer where it is decoded, recoded and sent back to your router and finally to your Chromecast.  Lowering the video quality helped but did not eliminate the issue on my older laptop.  Google has recently added the ability to cast Netflix, Youtube and Google Play directly to the Chromecast when using the Chrome browser on a desktop or laptop.  This is now the same scenario as from a smartphone or tablet, when doing these services the Chrome browser simply engages the Chromecast to stream the data.  Almost any desktop or laptop would be able to do this, but only for the included services.  Important if you don't have a smart phone or tablet, you can still engage the Chromecast without taxing an older CPU.  Music services like Pandora and Spotify play well on almost any halfway decent PC using the Chrome browser.  I have one Chromecast plugged into my HDMI port on my Onkyo receiver and listen to Spotify and Pandora over my stereo without the TV being on.  Controlling with my laptop or desktop.  Sounds great, I love it.<br /><br />After a full day of use, I ordered 2 more Chromecasts for my other HD televisions.  I use one of my tablets, smartphones or computers to cast to any TV in my house.  I personally love the Chromecast, and like I said, it does it all for me.  I can stream anything I can find on the web to my HD televisions.  You may not be able to depending on your equipment.  It is a cheap way to add Netflix, Youtube and Google Play(many to come) to a HD TV that is currently without that capability.  I hope this review explains enough for you to decide if it is for you.  If you do not have a newer PC or Mac, you might find the Chromecast very limited right now.  If you do have a new computer, this is probably the best device for you to stream any online media to your HDMI device.  And eventually, I see this device adding most services for direct streaming of online content, supporting anything Roku and Apple's equivalent can, including streaming local content from your PC, tablet or smartphone.<br /><br />5 stars for me, but depending on what you want and what your existing equipment is, it may not be for you.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|A good time waster. You can redo over and over till you get it without having to wait for \\"turns\\" to recharge. My 4 year old daughter likes putting the objects the final stage of each level.<br /><br />Edit: you do run out of turns, and have to wait for recharge, but I rarely play long enough for that to happen.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I'm surprised that this book (the ending to the series) has an average of three stars because it's complete and utter crap.<br /><br />Sookie \\"settled\\" for Sam.  Any woman who settles for someone is divorced to him not long after.<br /><br />Who CARES if she used the wish on Sam instead of Eric.  It DOES make sense to use it to save a life, but the way she wrote it makes Sam not even happy about it and he \\"feels\\" different as well.  Gawd, she could have written a different way for Eric to get out of the arranged marriage.<br /><br />I'd never write an ending to a major popular series and piss off the fans because THEY ARE THE ONES PAYING YOUR SALARY.  My daughter read this before I had a chance to and unfortunately it's too late for a refund or I would have gotten our money back.<br /><br />Sookie belonged with Eric.  Period.
1781162646|5.0|The reviews for this book did not do it justice. It reminded me of his earlier work where things were a little off kilter and it kept you interested at all times.  The ending (as usual) was a shocker!
B005S9EJ14|1.0|I thought it was depressing.. I bought it to show to my widow friends, and it was not uplifting at all. Also, I did not like that the homosexual theme was brought in. I've always liked Judi Dench's English films that she's starred in. This was very disappointing.
0374531269|5.0|This was a mandatory Summer reading assignment for my sons' sophomore year.  Of course I found out about it just 2 weeks prior to school starting. I bought this used and labeled in 'good condition' for $2.95 US.  The seller was Bookywoman.  The only reason I could find for its rating was a not too bad crease lengthwise on the cover only.  The pages with in were practically pristine.  With the price being so little, I was able to afford to use the expidited shipping, to my sons' dismay.  It arrived just 4 days after I ordered.
B00866JL96|5.0|I like all of Nicholas Sparks books and movies, and I believe I own them all. So many take place in NC where I lived for a long time at places I know
B0054SMIH6|4.0|There are other more intriguing types of theses movies, they are a dime a dozen. Tastefully done however. There are many better movies to see out there that may even keep you more wide awake and riveted
B0017HEX76|5.0|I love Fantasia - what an imagination for that time - Walt Disney was so far ahead of his time
B0028IDXDS|5.0|OK.. everything is all right. All perfect, product is the same of the sale. Very beatiful and cool. I Recomend

B0032Y8XH8|5.0|they have a fresh identity  their lyrics are not heavy i could say  are very simple  but have a  great sounds and rhythm
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I tried a different brand first and there was a buzz mixed into the audio. This CableJive adapter thankfully lacks the buzz and allows my iPhone 4s to both play and charge with the built in iPod/iPhone plug in my 06 Scion xA. The phone can slide off if you're not careful, but you get used to handling it gingerly. This little thing extended the life my head unit by years so I have no complaints.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I play it everyday  in my way to work... i has a great evolution and get some motivation to start my day
B005P78VK4|5.0|One of the best mixes of the greatest entertainers music out there. Michael Jackson immortal tracks are done very tastefully
B0063GORYU|4.0|Helps to pass the time when going on trips. Fun to play and easy to down load, Look it over and se if you agree.
B002K0WBXW|4.0|Loved this movie.  It's a funny romance movie that kept my interest right to the end.  Great for both guys and girls.
B0085LMFAE|5.0|i bought a paul simon greatest hits album awhile ago. the first disc i knew all the songs but the second disc had new songs i never heard before. i figured they were all new and really good so i googled it and they were all graceland songs. i really love this album and the stories behind it. also check out the track afterlife from a more recent album.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I needed a resident calculator and this delivers.  The display is large and works well for keeping things straight.  Works great on the Kindle display

0679892478|4.0|I got this book to go along with our preschool curriculum and this was perfect!  It incorporates counting and goes along with my letter &#34;A&#34; theme.
B005T87QCI|1.0|This game makes it impossible to win a Free bot um never buying from these people again you suck developers I hate this app and y'all are Mo Fos forgetting to squeeze every cent you can get for yalls little sucky game
B005MMJ84K|5.0|The sequel was great. Very intense throughout the whole book. And the ending is such a cliffhanger! Loved this book it!
1449320104|5.0|If you code .Net, you have to have this one nearby. Not only clear and organized content, but deep .Net theory and great samples. I got my newspaper and this book with me all the time.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|A real nail biter to the end. And, the part I like best....actually learning something new and weird and TRUE. You can't go wrong with this one.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I have played many escape games and this one is one of the better.<br />Many different tricks from out of the box to traditional, all well ordered to keep you thinking and entertained. For its price it's well worth the entertainment, missed one star for being so short, wanted to play more.
0446547654|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is one of my favorite authors and this book is no different from his others. Easy read, you will not be able to put it down! Love that he describes all of his surroundings and I recognize the places he is referring to.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Decent clock/alarm app. Some nice settings and I like the weather inclusion. The alarm setting is easy to use. I like how it looks, too.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|It was challenging and fun. Not short and sweet like a lot of other games. I highly recommend this game!
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|I had this album on a continuous play for 5 days already. Great lyrics, excellent music very good sound quality. A style is different from regular JM style, but he definitely makes it work. I would definitely recommend it. It is a pleasure to listen to.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I love the music from this soundtrack! It is the kind of absolutely beautiful music that you can relax to or play in the background for a ladies tea. It<br />also bring back images of one of my favorite movies of all times.  I highly recommend it!
B0088W7VNG|5.0|A great series to watch along side or after Stargate SG-1. Atlantis correlates very well with SG-1 throughout the whole series. You can miss this if your a syfy freak like me.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I LOVE this game.  Its fantastic and super fun.  Its pretty too.  I only wish more gems were offered but that won't keep me from playing.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game!! been playing it for over a year now and even got my mom, sister and, niece playing it as well.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I recommend this series of DVD to anyone who likes English History.  The characters became very<br />interesting to the viewer and the lower level staff were so entwined with the upstairs characters.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|Locks up kindle forces reset. Can't cancel download, can't do anything else on system.  Steals memory and space. Do not waste your time on this app if you have a kindle.
0394720288|3.0|Some of the text in this paperback was blurry (read-able but not easy on the eyes). I guess that's what make a mass market book inexpensive.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This game is so fun and cute. Who wouldn't want to get some yummies to the cute lil' guy & hear his \\"happy noises\\"?
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Even better than the last Star a trek movie. Stays energized and fast moving, engaging to the end,  loved it!
B003V4AK8E|4.0|Feels nice in my big hands. Overall pretty responsive. I would reccommend this to whoever needs a realatively cheap controller
B000FC1HBY|4.0|More insight into the characters, more surprises, and a world view that's detailed and seemingly real. A world I 'm glad to read about, but not live in.
B009G41CG2|5.0|I really like this game and have had hours of playing. I like that there are different levels of difficulty and patterns.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I wish it did more.  Once Amazon streaming hops on board, I will be sold.  Don't be evil Google.  (Motto)
B006LSZECO|3.0|I had to read this book to see if it lived up to the hype. It started off reasonably well and then? Just when you think there's going to be this magnificent ending, you get shafted. This book left me saying \\"That was it?!\\"
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|Whenever I catch this on cable, I pop in the blu ray copy for the true experience.  It's that good.  This is Sparta.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I truly think this is a wonderful game.  It definitely keeps you on your toes.  Very good for brain activity.
B005DJREJS|4.0|Hilarious and addicting. The red head is the best character! Classic high school drama show but all the characters make it better than secret life of the American teenager and switched at birth.
B003HGKJH8|5.0|One of my favorite albums of the past few years. Saw these guys live in Columbus, Ohio, and was very impressed. This album is a little stronger in my opinion than the newer album (Lonerism). Kevin Parker hit a homerun with Innerspeaker.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|you've got to listen to this group or individuals in a solo.  They all have such great voices and you don't here the accent while they are singing
1849163863|5.0|I've not finished The Black House, but Amazon asked my opinion - and it is that I'm looking forward to reading the other two books of May's trilogy (as well as &#34;Hebrides,&#34; his newest book). If you've spent any time on Lewis and Harris, this is a trip home. And the mysteries at the heart of the book are well crafted, too.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|you'll love this group when they sing. perfect music for everyone without any kind of vulgar language. Guaranteed to become one of your favorite groups
B0068FYZIO|5.0|thank u! I never realized the ear and eye opener of this story until my purchased of this dvd. something to watch many times.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The story just did not draw me. Did not care for the main characters. Did not find them attractive. Guess it's not my type of book.
B004KKXMSI|5.0|I had the older DVD trilogy of Jurassic Park.  Then, when the 3D version of JP came out in April 2013, I toyed with the idea of rebuying it that way. I did a lot of research and found that, yes the 3D is nice for those who want that and insist on it...HOWEVER...the &#34;color timing&#34; (color balance, rendition) is not as good as the 2011 release 2D Blu-Ray Trilogy version.  To see what I'm talking about, go to YouTube and type in &#34;Jurassic Park Blu Ray Side by Side comparison 1080p&#34;  This was enough to make the decision to me.  MY EXACT VERSION: Since Amazon tends to lump a lot of movie reviews together, the version I purchased lists itself as:  Import All Regions USN widescreen DTS Surround.  UPC 5050582830767  Bookcase says: Universal 828 307 6 dot 11  Amazon: USIN B004KKXMSI   Package has absolutely NO mention of Dolby.  My Import 2D version has subtitles in English and 5 other languages. It has (if you want to use it) a separate dubbing track in Japanese.  I never saw an option for Dolby to choose in Setup.  In my case, it didn't matter as my receiver decodes DTS.  PICTURE:  Stunning (and I mean stunning).  Exceptional.  Color rendition is effortlessly spot-on.  You can't get it better than this.  Really.  When I see the helicopter flying to the island in the initial scene..it is so pristine and clear that I'm transfixed.  I lose myself in the story.  None of the technical stuff of the video or sound ever get in the way of the story. It's that way throughout all of the movie.  The only slightly weak stuff(technical integration onscreen)is when Sam O'Neill and Laura Dern (actors) first see the dinosaurs in the rolling hills and the scene with Sam O'Neill and the kids feeding the bracchiosaurus in the trees.  But those two exceptions even certainly weren't &#34;bad&#34; - and they were short lived parts of the overall film.  SOUND:  I played this using the English default DTS 7.1 surround.  The sound mix is * stunning and exceptional * even on my mid-quality 5.1 system.  Dialog was very clear, I did not have any desire to turn on subtitles.  Note: the other languages French, etc are in 5.1 mix.  Nerd / Techy stuff:  I have a 60&#34; LG Plasma HDTV fed and Sony BDP-S790 Blu-Ray player.  The nexus of all my components is a Pioneer VSX-1021 receiver.  Audio is output to Panasonic 5.1 speaker setup (Two 3ft towers, 2 smaller side channel -- inexpensive speakers from an older system) augmented with a Definitive Technology center channel (nice $300.00 dialog speaker I upgraded to).  My Panasonic subwoofer is frankly nothing to write home about.  The other &#34;Panny&#34; speakers are decent.  The movie still sounds awesome.  Side channel mix and spatial effect was quite immersing and remember I'm only using a 5.1 setup.  God knows how good it would be on a true 7.1 setup with a better subwoofer.  This here is your demonstration disc!  No matter, I enjoyed the movie greatly.  The source quality given is so good that it pushes through and makes my system shine.  I have the belief that this movie was transferred on a spare-no-expense budget as a labor of love by geeks with the best bleeding-edge equipment.  SUMMARY:  Take my review with this grain of salt:  3D is not a big deal to me.  Frankly it's an annoyance. I never use the 3D feature even though my TV supports it. What * IS * a big deal to me is good color rendition, audio clarity and a naturally sharp picture without artifacts.  THIS IS IT !!!!  If you go with purchasing the other, latest release, 3D version,.. realize that you will be gaining the 3D effect at the possible expense of having to put up with an overly tweaked color balance that is possibly inferior to this 2D version. (i.e. it may have an strong orange / teal cast).  To each his own, your call.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|Very happy with the design and functionality. Very clever themes. Would recommend it to future engineers. Great puzzles that are challenging to solve.
B000NI8F5G|5.0|Was very impressed with this movie!  I definitely need to start watching more classics!  Good clean fun, could watch it with the kids around (a scenes with someone smoking...just a bit of sexual dancing/innuendo etc., but otherwise pretty clean and not scary).
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I had to do my 1st ever cook review<br /> Must read<br />So well written<br />So real<br />So moving<br />I can relate because so far I have had cancer twice
B007ZXK08C|1.0|Started with high expectations struggled through till last chapter. Just words on paper characters superficial and one dimensional.<br />Not unlike watching a 3D movie with out the special glasses. How this book became a best seller is a mystery,more intriguing  than the novel.
B003L77TZI|5.0|Really love her music and this c.d. is no exception.  Lots of really great songs that have not been played on the radio or even shown on t.v. yet.
B009AY04A8|4.0|I really enjoyed the game itself.  Hidden object; find the differences; find the pairs.  Picture were good with good magnification ability.  Characters and story were so bad.  Focus on the playing and it will be fine.
B00CDCIQX6|5.0|Best movie! Multiple plot lines are confusing. Had to watch a few times. But I love all the topics tackled. Love the idea of past lives.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I liked reading about her life inside n how she got through it. The highs, lows, struggles everything. It was very interesting.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|Fun game.  I enjoy playing this as well as my children.  It is a fun and relaxing way to play.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Oh so good...exciting..enthralling..cannot get enough..cannot wait until the next book ..hope it comes out soon..cannot stand the suspense...5  star review!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I first started playing plague on my phone and got a few friends hooked. I then decided that I need to get it for my kindle. I can't wait to play on a bigger screen so I can see my plague spread in even more detail. I suggest everyone get this game.I can't stop playing it.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|After searching and searching, finally I found a game like Diablo for my phone. Needs to have an ingame way to get free diamonds but other than that GREAT game.
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|This is a fun game very addicting. So me levels are harder than others. Even my kids like.to play it
B00992CF6W|5.0|ME and my brother love this game.<br />We just like play every single day.<br />Most awesome blasting honking game ever<br />.
0345529057|5.0|Just an excellent saga for any fan of the genre as well as those new to the fantasy realm!!  Love the show and books equally.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|Really enjoying this one. Takes skill, however not to difficult. My toddlers can play the early levels. A little different than tetris or candy crush, but the matching is challenging at times.
0425252868|3.0|First, I must praise the industry and research that went into A Higher Call [[ASIN:0425252868 A Higher Call: An Incredible True Story of Combat and Chivalry in the War-Torn Skies of World War II]]and which provides an interesting and detailed texture of air combat from the German as well as an American perspective.  That said, the book is one of a number of volumes about World War II that attempts to sanitize the German military.  War is terrible, regardless of who conducts it. But the German war effort was permeated by Nazi ideology, and the crimes it committed have been well documented.  To paint the Luftwaffe fighter pilots as sort of \\"gentlemen warriors\\" is to overlook much evidence and a lot of history.<br /><br />Don't forget all of the major air \\"operations\\" by the Germans against civiian targets:  Guernica, Warsaw, Rotterdam, Coventry, London, for example.  What were the \\"gallant\\" fighter pilots thinking when the Luftwaffe was destroying defenseless towns or conducting mass raids against civilians?  Did they really believe that they were only defending Germany and that the evil leaders like Hitler and Goering had little to do with their actions? Before and during the war they went along with the Nazis, even if we buy their stories that they did not sympathize with them.  They may have hated the SS and the Gestapo, but was  that because of their power over the military rather than their contribution to the Final Solution? They hated Goering because of his decadence and bad judgment, not because he was one of the authors of the Holocaust.<br /><br />The Allies. too, committed war crimes, like the mass bombings the American heroes of the book participated in.<br /><br />Yes, the book is a good read--mostly, but whitewashes both war generally, and the German facilitators of Nazism.
B005544TRQ|5.0|We love this show and watched both seasons and are now watching the current season on TV.  It's one of our favorite shows.
B00001OH7V|3.0|Overrated to the extreme, &#34;Heroes&#34; is the weakest of David Bowie and Brian Eno's Berlin trilogy. The 1977 release certainly has its virtues: the classic title song, &#34;Beauty and the Beast,&#34; &#34;V-2 Schneider,&#34; &#34;Moss Garden&#34; and &#34;The Secret Life of Arabia.&#34; Unfortunately, the remaining tracks vanish in the experimental haze — not a Bowie album you want to revisit on a regular basis. Fans beg to differ, but &#34;Heroes&#34; never approaches the excellence of &#34;Low&#34; and &#34;Lodger.&#34;
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I liked it. It seems like a quite good game. I have enjoyed it so far, and hope to keep playing it some more.
B003G4W49C|3.0|This is too political for me. Or maybe I just don't understand the purpose of the book. I know it was well written and I read the whole thing, all the way to the end, and still did not understand it. But, then again, I read books - I almost never read novels. Novels are usually way too above my head for me to understand. So that means this book is a novel and I didn't get it. Sorry
B009AY04A8|4.0|I really like these games as the really make you think in order to find the objects. Plan to get more, thank you to the greatest of this game can't wait to get next one.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|Didn't work, didn't do anything. Would type in a search, wouldn't submit. Would type on an icon, wouldn't work. Etc.
B00AE2I4WK|5.0|This movie keeps your attention and keeps you on the edge of your chair guessing who's going to win the final showdown.
0143123173|4.0|So, I'm in this neat independent book store in  Red Lodge, MT  ( Red Lodge Books )and as always I purchase a regional author.  I see several by a Craig Johnson who I had not heard of. ( I don't get out enough apparently.  I didn't know that Longmire was a cable TV  series.)  I thought The Cold Dish was outstanding.  Great quirky characters.  Interesting plot.  Unexpected turns. Stong dose of the Native American life on the Rez. My only mild objection was that the author paid too much attention to the sheriff's love life.  That's the same problem I have with some of Raymond Parkeer's Spencer novels.  It helped to be reading it in Montana. wyomng, and South Dakota. The TV series is very good also.  I recommend  both.
B0019KWE6S|5.0|I have been listening to this album on an off for 5 years now. So damn good! It will definitely still be on rotation when I'm old and grey
B007REW8AC|5.0|Love listening to this!  Entire CD is great - she has such a unique voice.  I recommend for all that enjoy true music.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|I'm told that this film has the dubious distinction of being the least viewed of any film nominated for an academy award.  Too bad.  It's powerful storytelling.  Stays with you long after you've seen it.  Fabulous acting.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|A good movie overall, good action and special effects.  I thought it was entertaining and the acting was good and the story interesting.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|The acting in the movie was phenomenal. A very emotional and realistic movie. I watched this with my boyfriend and his mom and we all thought it was entertaining.
B0067AC5KA|4.0|It took awhile for me to understand the characters’ in the book.  But I really liked it.  I always try to read the book before seeing the movie.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The games are finally over and the Mockingjay and Peeta triumphed over every adversity.<br />This is my first Suzanne Collins but it won't be my last.
B00B9LNLTQ|5.0|I'm definitely a fan of The Strokes' past albums, no matter how different they are from each other, and this is another step in a different direction.
0385523394|5.0|How a very smart girl does dumb things and then grows up to being a woman. She has great support from her family and future husband and amazing insight of what is happening in prison and how to survive a very bad penal system.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|If you listen to the whole CD song after song one time, you'll be a bit thrown off. But once you give it a second chance and listen to it again, it really grows on you like all of Bowie's stuff. Listen to the lyrics and you'll find he tackles some controversial stuff. Love it.
B006M4F67A|5.0|This mahjong game is challenging yet extremely easy to play.  Color graphics are excellent.The variety of games to play is excellent as well.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|From chapter one I could not put this book down. It has an amazing plot with real characters that you'd love to hate. I loved Travis and I hated him. Abby was a girl would I would have shook some sense into, but she was a good girl. Loved this book!
B004K00NEO|1.0|I thought I was getting the full monty lossless tracks and extra's as well. What I got was a disc that had no extra's, a lossy and a lossy DTS track.
B00DU74U74|5.0|I liked this movie very much i like the book very much also it was very close to the book
0345529057|5.0|Have you seen the show? ... if No, then what are you waiting for watch the show!  It's better than the books on certain aspects.  Yes, then read the books if you want more details and clarity of what the show can't do.  Really the show is as good as the books.  And yes, the books are always better from a certain point of view.  Just do one or the other if you haven't any you are into the fantasy genre or for that matter if you aren't
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|AHS: Asylum is even creepier than season 1 and has more plot twists than I can count. What a great show!
1423151054|5.0|This set is definitely an investment, whether you're an animator or not.  I also can't believe how affordable it was.  It's a glimpse into why these legendary animators were so amazing in there craft.  The techniques they pioneered under the helm of Disney are still being used today to makememorable films, which is incredible.
B004S5C8WG|5.0|Just could not put this book down.  Would wake up in the middle of the night to read a bit more!!!!  Have read most of Jeffrey Archer's books and I feel this one has the &#34;edge&#34;.  Looking forward to Amazon notifying me of the publication of the fourth book in the Clifton Chronicles series. Thoroughly enjoyed &#34;Only time will tell&#34;, &#34;Sins of the Father&#34; and &#34;The best kept Secret&#34;.<br />Love my Kindle.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like this app. I use it a lot when I go to church instead of carrying my big Bible.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Can't wait for season 2.  Well acted.  Lots of twists and turns.  Is this the way it really is?  Probably.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Very addictive game and fun to play for all ages I love it ! U get so many choices in games to play my children are 4 and 6 and find the game very fun.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was hooked on Season 1, Episode 1 and the storyline and characters just kept growing and developing.<br />I can't wait to see what happens in Season 4.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Great game. Easy to play. Enjoying building my army and all of the quests to keep you busy. Farming seeds and such keeps you busy as well.
B007L6VR12|5.0|I had forgotten about Noye's Fludde, delightful music by Benjamin Britten. This movie was very well done & original. I bought it for my professional musician daughter, but her young teenagers enjoyed it more than she did.<br />Service was good.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|I love it but it doesn't show any writing on it for some reason. I can't read anything as the words are invisible. This is on my kindle fire.<br />From the Amazon market thingy
B00821OX98|4.0|Whats to say other than the fact that the effects and action are very good with a decent story line. It it tells a good yarn then I like it.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Fun, exciting, and challenging. I love hidden object games and this  one is among the best. Well worth the download.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It kept my interest & I had no clue as to what had really happened to his wife. Good reading
B005DF2QMC|3.0|The hardware (tape cassette player and USB cable) are fine<br /><br />The software is not well documented and in fact you have to go out on the web and download a .dll file in order for the cassette-to-MP3 comversion to work and the instructions requiring you to do this are not very clear.<br /><br />Also there is absolutely no user manual info on the various attributes of the program once installed.  OK if you're an audio engineer but not so good if you aren't
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The book held my interest from start to finish. I always find customs in the country he is writing about fascinating

B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I have played many &quot; find the clues games&quot; but this one has great graphics and is hours of fun!  Love it!
B006TF6WAM|5.0|Sometimes a book comes along that gives you a look in the mirror with characters reflecting our humanity. This is one such book with beautiful passages for example &#34;Beginnings could happen more than once, or in different ways.&#34;  Simply put, I loved reading The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry.
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|I dont know what people are talking about when they say this game is boring and has bad graphics. its a really entertaining game for when you are bored. it is very simple but still fun.
B004LWZWGA|2.0|Something has always bugged me about Christopher Nolan's Batman movies. Not their tightly plotted stories or gritty urban-realist design, which make the Burton/Schumacher films look dated and primitive. Nor the justification for vigilantism, which I couldn't criticize better than comics writer Alan Moore already has. But watching The Dark Knight Rises, I finally realized: Nolan has turned Batman into a fascist tract.<br /><br />Batman has long represented mighty justice, emerging from shadows to deal swift comeuppance to criminals. But unlike blindfolded, scales-bearing Themis, Batman makes no pretence of impartiality. He maintains hip-pocket alliances with cops, dispenses summary justice that any judge would discard, and openly disdains due process. He's every frazzled parent's ultimate Hail Mary pass: stay in line, or some black-clad bogeyman will serve physical comeuppance.<br /><br />This makes sense in the Depression-era milieu that first birthed Batman. In an age of rampant official corruption, seeing a rich socialite use his wealth for eleemosynary ends must have gratified countless teens. Even today, when sensational crime stories lead nightly newscasts, Batman seems like a bastion against tides of urban lawlessness. Christian Bale conveys this raspy-throated image of bootleg vengeance with understated elegance.<br /><br />But that description, which accurately embodies Nolan's first two Batman films, rings hollow here. Once decaying, Gotham has enjoyed eight years of peace, defined herein as \\"order.\\" Sharp-suited tycoons feel safe walking the streets. Where contract murder once ruled Gotham, the city has turned a skilled jewel thief into their local celebrity. Gotham has achieved a pre-9/11 state of decadent complacence.<br /><br />Note that the situation for common Gothamites hasn't improved. Selena Kyle and her partner live in squalor equal to any number of windows Batman peeped through during crime's heyday. But the \\"Dent Act\\" prevents bottom-feeders from threatening the hierarchy. After eight years, Gotham maintains the same mayor and police commissioner, suggesting that city governance is decided on high; elections occur to ratify decisions over which citizens have no power.<br /><br />Into this environment of bread and circuses--that is, parties and football--rides Tom Hardy as Bane, who begins as a mercenary but adopts the stylings of populism, repeatedly offering to return Gotham to \\"you, the people.\\" By this he doesn't mean Jeffersonian ideals of an informed, engaged citizenry; instead, Bane constructs an army of riff-raff to enforce his Maoist social design. His first act is to open the jails and establish a convict-run kangaroo court.<br /><br />Thus Nolan presents Gotham an unpalatable choice: either comply with the hierarchy, or give command of their city to its lowest members. Nolan lards the narrative with allusions to Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities. His inescapable moral: we choose which form of manifest social injustice to accept. Do we prefer peaceful subservience under the hierarchy, or chaotic Reign-of-Terror rule by the commune's foulest denizens?<br /><br />Batman, with his wealth and technology, could use this opportunity to reject both choices. But with his hovercraft, pulleys, and access to vantage points, he literally stands on high, fighting to restore the old order. It's like if, amid Cold War desperation, an avenging angel chose to reinvest feudal domains and divinely anointed kings. Batman chooses the tyranny of peaceful mediocrity over the tyranny of an uprising he cannot control.<br /><br />Importantly, when Batman dispenses justice from on high, he doesn't represent the Christian God. When Bane dynamites the prison gates, he says: \\"the powerful will be ripped from their decadent nests, and cast out into the cold world that we know and endure.\\" Compare the Virgin Mary's praise in Luke 1:52-53: God \\"has brought down rulers from their thrones, but has lifted up the humble. He has filled the hungry with good things, but has sent the rich away empty.\\"<br /><br />Like Nietzsche, Batman rejects Christian and Platonist ideals of justice, favoring something older and more savage. Forced to choose between Bane's Bolshevik militia and Batman leading a phalanx of uniformed cops, Gotham itself has no choice. The city's champion chooses for them, throwing his support and physical strength behind a legal superstructure which even Commissioner Gordon admits he built on a lie. Gotham's citizens have but one choice: to submit.<br /><br />Early in the film, Bane calls himself \\"necessary evil.\\" Commissioner Gordon might describe Batman as equally necessary. But social theorist Jacques Ellul wrote: \\"necessity never establishes legitimacy; the world of necessity is a world of weakness, a world that denies man.\\" If Batman simply embodies the form of injustice Gotham can accept, perhaps Ra's al Ghul was right. Time has come to burn it down and start over.
140006922X|2.0|This book is a pseudo intellectual attempt to trivialize the life of Jesus.  The book was written by a Muslim who became a Christian and then reconverted to Islam.  The book is filled with inaccuracies and speculation and attempts to mislead the reader into a distorted view of who Jesus was and what he stood for.  I am sure the author's Muslim brothers would not be as tolerant if he wrote a similar book about the life of Mohammed. The book should be retitled \\" A Muslim Zealot's View of the Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth\\".
B001AKTZOQ|5.0|I have difficulty listening to classic rock radio anymore. I've listened so long that the playlists, which change very little, have become familiar and tired. But I make one exception to that generalization: somehow, Creedence Clearwater Revival always sounds new. And this, their fifth album and the peak of their crazy output in 1969 and 1970, remains the benchmark against which so much later roots rock and white soul music gets judged.<br /><br />The compressed recording and touring schedule that propelled CCR through its very short life provided intense fuel for the creative fire. John Fogerty, the brains of the band, wrote with steam-engine vigor, personally crafting many songs that not only comprise the heart of this album, but remain cover-band staples two generations later. You can hardly visit a rock bar without hearing at least one rendition of \\"Who'll Stop the Rain\\" or \\"Up Around the Bend.\\"<br /><br />But this isn't just John and his sidemen. The intense unity created by the band's circumstances means the members knew each other incisively. Sometimes, as on \\"Ramble Tamble\\" or \\"Run Through the Jungle,\\" it sounds like more than just four members are playing. And I don't mean merely overdubbing; these men could read one another intently and, without a word, each contribute something so that the final product vastly exceeds John Fogerty's brainchild.<br /><br />This collection's well-known singles overshadow how completely this album creates an arc. Cover tracks like \\"Ooby Dooby\\" and \\"Before You Accuse Me,\\" originally by Roy Orbison and Bo Diddley respectively, seem initially like filler material. Only after you hear how thoroughly CCR reinvents \\"Heard It Through the Grapevine\\" do you realize, these aren't \\"mere\\" covers. CCR existed at a nexus of classic blues and pop rebellion against electric tyranny. And these songs, even the covers, exemplify that moment.<br /><br />The bonus tracks, added for the 40th Anniversary re-release, sadly don't add much to the original. The \\"remake\\" of \\"Travelin' Band,\\" which even the liner notes struggle to explain, feels hollow and hasty beside the original. And the live versions of \\"Up Around the Bend\\" and \\"Born On the Bayou,\\" presented here out of context, contribute little to our love for this album. The original closing track, \\"Long As I Can See the Light,\\" made an excellent conclusion. Now, the end just takes longer to arrive.<br /><br />Notwithstanding how the studio has needlessly fiddled with an otherwise stellar album, this remains one of rock music's high points. I think it doesn't stretch credibility to say it belongs in the same rarefied company as \\"Sergeant Pepper\\" or \\"Rumours,\\" as the surpassing culmination of a band's creative arc. While CCR would never surpass this moment (fissures were already opening in the band), they would never besmirch it either. Somehow, forty years on, this gem somehow still sounds new.ginal.

B00ARF93AQ|5.0|It is a good movie for those who like plenty of action with Dred giving it to the bad guys. However it is very violent and graphic special effects.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I have all the seasons and absolutely love this show. I just think they kill off too many characters to soon. Other than that I enjoy watching this show. Very entertaining. I can't wait until the next season..
B001FASVLE|3.0|Bought it for some songs and I listened to all the other songs that were on it. I did not enjoy it as much as I thought.

B0049P1VHS|5.0|This show is so great to watch. The story line is great. This is very entertaining. The only problem is they kill off to many leading people. The zombies are cool looking and I like how they use the digital with the killing like they are really killing them.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|It is very enjoyable and my kid loves it, even me lol. When he is not playing it, I am. It is worth downloading.
B001HN697M|4.0|If you like the vampire and werewolf world, you will like this movie. It is very entertaining and visual effects are good.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|Bought this DVD to replace a VHS tape version we've had for years; the movie is still great! Enough said.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This show is so great to watch. The story line is great. This is very entertaining. The only problem is they kill off to many leading people. The zombies are cool looking and I like how they use the digital with the killing like they are really killing them.
0783116934|5.0|Llevaba buscando esta película por mucho tiempo. El hecho de ser un caso de la vida real la hace espeluznante. Actuaciones impecables.
B002ZG98UA|5.0|This movie is great. It is filled with action. I like action movies that keep you on your toes. The length of the movie was good too not to long and not to short.
B00280LYIC|4.0|Great read for all ages. Also cute backstory it is nice to hear about the relationship between a boy and his mother.
B0058YPILY|5.0|I love criminal minds. I have all the seasons and will keep buying when they come out. This show keeps you thinking on certain shows and I like how they work together to solve the crimes. Great actors.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|For now I have only ended the first book, but it was really good, I can´t wait to begin with the second!!!
B00E193TM2|5.0|Just great! It's been long time since I've enjoyed this kind of music in 80's - 90's. This is it.
B004YCKJSS|5.0|I loved this movie way back when, and I still love it now. A must see 90's movie with a packed cast sure to hold your attention! 2 thumbs up!!
B00AZMFK3K|2.0|I have been a Star Trek fan since forever. And I just don't like the JJ Abrahms take on the series. Not that I don't like some of his work. Because I love Fringe for example. But mainly it's because the characters don't seem as believable as the other movies. The whole time I watched this I kept getting distracted by how bad the acting is. Also the characters don't make me feel anything. Keeping in mind that this is Science Fiction the other movies at least let you get to know the characters and let you feel that what they were going through was really happening. Not with these last two movies sadly. They probably should have made a movie about Star Trek Voyager instead. But oh well. I guess I'll have to wait for someone else to take the reigns of Star Trek.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|I think this book was probably one of the best of the trilogy. I loved the way it ended allowing you to decide where things would go. I also enjoyed learning more about some of the supporting characters and the twists to the plot.
B00E8B1358|5.0|Not normally my kind of movie.. but this was awesome!!! I would watch it again for sure. ..lots of action...
B009G78EE2|5.0|Macklemore & Ryan Lewis deliver a record truly independent of labels.  The lyrics of one song end in &#34;I would rather fail at being an artist than succeed at getting [screwed over].&#34;  Whether you love or hate this group, you've got to give them credit for achieving notoriety without the machine of modern music.<br /><br />The lyrics are impressive.  The writers work to say something more than &#34;you should get as rich as possible as fast as possible&#34;.  To do this and to be entertaining is rare.  I give the album 5 stars and recommend to everyone.  Listen, relax, enjoy and know that you are supporting guys who do this because they love making music.
B008AIGWVA|2.0|It doesn't give enough things to do for anyone I got bored with it. I don't think it's fun I think it is waste of time
B00DBSZJRM|2.0|I'll admit it... I love bad action movies.  For example, I love most anything with Jason Statham in it.  I also love Jeremy Renner.  Even when he played the easy to miss Hawkeye, I got a little excited.  I say all of this to say, Hansel and Gretel missed the boat!  I imagine if this version of the fairy tale were in a book, it would be interesting. However, the movie misses a lot.  The plot is inconsistent and does not draw the viewer into the fable.  The movie feels cheeky at best.  There are a lot of bad movies out there that I would recommend; Hansel and Gretel is not one of them!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Like the game but love horses anyways so I'm a bit biased.  Great graphics and fairly realistic movements and sounds. Good for when you're bored and stuck at home.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The ChromeCast definitely has a lot of promise.  Right now, it handles YouTube, Netflx and basic webpages (think Google + photos) really well.  It is not compatible with any other streaming service at this point.  If you try to stream from other websites, the ChromeCast downgrades the frames per second live which causes delay in streaming and pretty low quality.  Right now, we use the Roku as our primary streaming device.  The Roku definitely performs better at this point.  The ChromeCast is small, easy to install and works great for youtube to tv.  There is no doubt that Google will continue working on this device.  For tech nerds such as myself, it's worth the $35.  However, if you are not an early adopter, you'll easily see why the price is so low.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Beautifully written,tender, and exciting.  A joy to read, and hard to put down.  Highly recommended to all of my book loving friends.
B001ECQ4DA|5.0|love this show what more can you say.  it's so funny with the online download makes it great too I can watch it online
B00992CF6W|4.0|So it's good but it needs more things in it . Like dogs ,  and can get some mods. Like minecarft comes alive. The moon mod , ok it would get more people to get. Half the things in minecarft. Please do this if you do I WILL LOVE this app. And do oslots and f ish , and on options you can make your own skins. Autumn Raymond.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I think you should be able to go to the crystal empire like in equstria girls<br />And be able to change from pony to human
1451695195|3.0|The author's descriptions of his experience using terminology like earthworm, cell, and om was constantly used but at now time defined. Leaving this reading with unclear  issues concerning his whole NDE. I did not capture the whole picture due to this lack of clarity.
B00B89LZ4C|5.0|I'm a collector I thought this was a new and sealed package and it wasn't it had scotch tape around the bottom and side of it not something I want to save as a collector not happy with it
B00C81AVNU|5.0|I love the recording of this show.  It is unexpectedly exciting, interesting, and emotional music.  All of the performances are very strong.  In listening to this score, it is no surprise that Ms. Lauper won a Tony for her efforts.  I think this is one of the best new musical scores written in recent years.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is so much fun :) you'll love to play and learn just like your horse. Build and grow. Good luck
B009D0LBRO|5.0|What can I say this game is just awesome. It has lots of levels and good graphics. Tapping is the only control so it's easy on iPhones. It was worth the $2.99.
0062255657|4.0|A little predictable, and short, but a good read, typical of Gaiman. Read it in one sitting, so it must have maintained my interest.
B005K17RU0|3.0|This app worked a lot better before the upgrade.  It was much faster, up to date, now I have to wait for all the new features to load.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|There are too much blood sence in the movie and it seems have little positive impact to the reader.The whole story talks about drugs,i think is meaningless.
B00846WWVM|5.0|This game is great. Simple...yet challenging. Would recommend to anyone looking for a game to kill some down time. Enjoy!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|love the CD. all the songs are just simply amazing. pls put out more CDs to purchase online. thanks. good job
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This utility is incredible. It just knows what you want to say. I love the fact that you can give it access to your various writing venues to learn about your writing style. The Flow feature is every bit as good as any other &#34;Swype&#34; type feature if not a whole lot better. Get it!
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|love the CD. all the songs are just simply amazing. pls put out more CDs to purchase online. thanks. good job
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game is great. Simple...yet challenging. Would recommend to anyone looking for a game to kill some down time. Enjoy!
0800141806|5.0|Excellent story, but the acting was not up to standard.  For example, Alec Baldwin did sound, look or a Southerner.<br />Whoopi always looks like she's acting.
B00910Y1OQ|2.0|Too much talk and not enough action. The narrative gets old fast. The game is too simple,not challenging enough,quickly becomes tiresome.
B00C9PQ7I8|3.0|This music is smooth and easy to listen to but it is not what I was expecting. There has been a lot of publicity associated with this release that convinced me to buy the CD without knowing anything about Mavis Staples. I thought it would be more R&B/Blues in nature. It is a gospel record which is not a bad thing, but I was hoping for something else.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be reviewing - I mean, it's a classic, amazing story. Great job, Oscar W.! Amazon sent me the kindle version as expected, right after I ordered it.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Sometimes it was hard reading the language, but that made it more real. I would recommend this book to all young people. There was a lot to be learned from this book
B00454U1NS|3.0|I love some of PInks songs but there were too many that I didnt know. Would be a good cd for a die hard Pink fan :)
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|THE MOVIE WAS GREAT. THE STORY KEPT YOU VERY INTERESTED. YOU COULD FEEL THE HURT AND/OR LOVE. THE ACTION WAS RIGHT ON THE MONEY.  I WAS ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT FOR MOST OF IT.  I RECOMMENTED TO ANYONE. IF WITH KIDS. THERE IS SOME BAD LANGUAGE. ALL IN ALL, IT IS A GREAT MOVIE. ENJOY.
B009K2SLYG|3.0|My husband and I saw this movie when it was first released many years ago.  We had forgotten much of the content so we bought it to watch with our teenage sons.  They enjoyed it and loved seeing where the quotes that had integrated into our everyday lives had come from but were really confused (as was I) about the abrupt ending.  It is a low budget film that we enjoyed but I am not sure that we will spend money to buy the others.  The humor is a little too raw for my tastes.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is an amazing example of heroism!  This story gives you a taste of what our armed forces stand for and the amazing men and women that fight for our freedoms.  So proud  of the sacrifices made by all of them.  Read this book!
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Easy to play. I like the graphics and the levels. I like that you can earn points to buy things instead if paying money.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|This novel contained several different plots that in the beginning were hard to put together. I enjoyed the writing and the development of the characters, but it did require staying &#34;in the moment&#34; with each subplot for awhile. I did enjoy the book overall.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|It is hard to find a good collection of varied Hawaiian music. This is by far the best album I could find. I added it to my I tunes collection for refreshing variety.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Its a fun game but I don't like the energy bar and how its takes a little while to load before the game accually starts

0399162097|1.0|When I purchased this \\"novel,\\" I didn't realize it was a disguised, pro-ALF screed, with outbursts of the sort of generic, anti-government, hyperbolic, insinuative silliness that prevails in Santa Cruz, California (the author's hometown).  If I'd known I would never have wasted my time or money.  But the book was a disappointment for many more reasons than this.<br /><br />The chatty voice of first-person narrator Rosemary began to rankle before I was halfway through \\"We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves.\\"  The writing is uneven -- passages of excellent prose bracketed between the tiresome and self-pitying ramblings of Rosemary, and disorganized talking points that interrupt the narrative.  Fowler indulges is some annoying, very common, heavy-handed writing shortcuts.  I can forgive her her overly obvious use of foreshadowing, and the blatant teases, but when she spells out for the reader a too-cute allusion, analogy or metaphor (the equivalent of quoting yourself, or explaining your own joke after you've told it), it's more than I can bear.  Subtlety is difficult, in writing.  Hitting the reader over the head with a sledgehammer, when the brush of a feather would do, is lazy.  A novel in which a major theme is the reliability of memory has a narrator named Rosemary?  Please.  And Fowler felt she had to explain even that one to the reader!<br /><br />Somewhere in the middle of this book I realized Fowler was using Ruth Ozeki's \\"My Year of Meats\\" as a model, so it was no surprise to see Ms. Ozeki thanked for her help in the Acknowledgments. But Ms. Ozeki did a far better job with her \\"muckraking fiction.\\"  That may be because she (reportedly) didn't begin with a socio-political agenda, but happened upon one as she wrote.  In Fowler's writing, on the other hand, I recognize the Santa Cruz screech.  (Santa Cruz, by the way, was the site of the -- by all accounts -- ALF-backed firebombing of a university researcher's home a few years ago.)<br /><br />Even the main story arc of the book is faulty. Are we really to believe that the grown Rosemary hasn't figured out why Fern disappeeared from her life, when so many other \\"Ferns\\" had the same issues?  It's unsupportable.<br /><br />I am a supporter of PCRM, which was a major force behind the animal-rights cause (I don't want to be accused of dropping spoilers here) that the author promotes (albeit via protagonist/narrator Rosemary, though the barrier between character and author seems to disappear for a time at the end of the book), so this should have had me cheering and encouraging friends to read it.  Instead, I threw it into the Goodwill box.ry arc of the book is faulty.

B00475AYJQ|5.0|Trying to figure out what to say about the second installment of The Kingkiller Chronicle is actually difficult, especially given how strongly I praised the first one.  Kvothe gets the opportunity - well, I guess we can't really call it an opportunity since its a \\"suggestion\\" that he leave the University for a semester - to meet ever more interesting characters and stumble upon some incredible adventures within this book.<br /><br />Many of the same characters make consistent roles in the book; and my opinion of the majority of them stays the same.  I still don't like Bast, though my dislike definitely got stronger during this book.  I'm not a fan of Denna; in all truth, I don't think I'll ever truly like her. She's just a pain to me who takes far too much away from my personal favorite female character, Devi.  I love the argument that develops between Devi and Kvothe, because it shows how well she can stand up against him.  I can't help but laugh everytime Elodin shows up in the story, he's got some of the best lines in the entire book.  I'm sorry, the images of him setting fire to Hemme's quarters is just one of the most priceless scenes in the whole book.<br /><br />Anyway, the new characters are a lot of fun and add so much to Kvothe's overall experiences outside of the university.  Plotline wise, I believe my favorite was his time in Ademre because he grows so much as he learns the secrets of the Adem mercenaries.  He doesn't automatically pick any of it up; which is unusual for him and gives his pride a much needed blow because he actually has to work at learning the moves and the communication style.  I confess to celebrating, just a little, when he has a huge fight with Denna.  And as much as I enjoyed the story of Felurian and his time with her...I couldn't help but feel that it lasted entirely too long for my tastes.<br /><br />One of the only other negatives that really got to me in the book isn't technically a bad thing on the account of the book, but more of a positive for Rothfuss's writing style...I can't help but get so frustrated at not knowing the answers to all the questions that Kvothe's been asking since the first book. By the end of this one, I'm just as aggravated and confused as the main character...and making me feel the same emotions that Kvothe's feeling is definitely signs of an incredibly well-written book.  With as wonderful as the first two books are...I can't imagine how Rothfuss is going to trump them with the final installment, and my anticipation will only continue to rise until it's finally released.<br /><br />See the review at [...]re of a positive for Rothfuss's writing style...I can't help but get so frustrated at not knowing the answers to all the questions that Kvothe's been asking since the first book.

B00571F26Y|5.0|I'd like to see more evidence to back up some of Dr. Davis's claims and disagree with his suggestion to feign an allergy, but I otherwise liked the book. For years, I dealt with gastrointestinal issues (bad constipation mostly) and was diagnoses with a thyroid disorder. I gave up gluten a handful of times, only to go back to it. Finally, it got to the point where my throat itches and gets tight, I get hives on one leg, and I generally feel like I got hit by a bus. I get annoyed looks from servers when I ask for a gluten free menu (easier to ask for gluten free than wheat/barley/oat free) because of everyone else who fakes an allergy, so please don't. More than once, I've ended up with a reaction (watch for meat marinated in soy sauce). So for me, this book has been a motivator not to slip up at someone's birthday party. And I can attest to surviving and being gluten free. Just never go to the grocery store hungry!
0062515675|1.0|If you're looking for a super cheesy story with a title I may have come up with myself when I was 14, this is the book for you. The plagerized and well-worn sprinkles of 'wisdom' do little to redeem this poorly written new-age trash from under the crap heap in which it came.<br /><br />Anyone who reads a lot or knows a bit about writting will find plenty to cringe about on every page. To sum it up in one word... painful.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|perfect just what I needed to fix my kindle fire problems my kindle was not charging this fixed the problem
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|I saw the 50th Anniversary Tour live so bought this as a memory.  The Beach Boys were simply great, sounding just as they did 50 years ago.  The show went on for much longer than expected and the audience were up on their feet.  The new songs were a surprise and it's great to know Brain and Mike are working together once again.  I hope to be at the 60th Anniversary Tour.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|From beginning to end this book is packed with lots of issues to consider. What would I have done in this situtation?  Would I have done that?  Why did they do that?  Do you think he was guilty or innocent?  Byt he end of the book, did your opinions change?<br /><br />One of the best books I have ever read!  I would immediately recommend this book to anyone who asks for a suggestion for a great book.

B0031RS2HC|5.0|Loved this book. Watched the recent movie and really enjoyed it so thought I would see where it all started. Not at all disappointed. I love a good story and this is a great story and its so well told.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I was able to watch all 3 seasons free through Amazon Prime!  This is the best show I've watched in a long time, aside from Lark Rise to Candleford. I've become fascinated with European tv and I particularly love the early era.  It gives glimpse to the social elite and poor in such a personable light.  Highly recommended!!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|While this book is very well written and has a page turning story, it will only appeal to those  who are not bound to find realism in their story-line. If you like to fantincize a bit, you'll love it. If you're more of a history buff or like histroical fiction, you might find this book a bit out there.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great show.  My wife and I are addicted to it.  Excellent cast of characters, and the acting is top notch,
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like using this app. I am always checking the weather and this is usually pretty accurate. I like being able to have several towns saved.
B00EEXST2K|4.0|This movie is a well crafted documentary relating to the movie deep throat which shows how traditional rigid moral values can be twisted to support an immoral industry which grinds up young people searching for a door to the good life and future.  The title is important -- it evokes images of emotional wellbeing and soft beauty -- a target which is forfeited in the hands of non scrupulous human people seeking their own economic well being at the cost of emotional needy younger people.

B002SJIO5E|5.0|District 9 is an edge of your seat, suspenseful movie. It's really cool the way it's filmed as a documentary based on aliens living in a secluded section of South Africa. The acting is great and there's excitement all the way through, even though some of the scenes are kind of  gross. My advice is enjoy this movie WITHOUT popcorn. You definitely want to eat after it's over! Even so, I love this movie and highly recommend it.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Bruce is all that in this Action Comedy.  Each actor in this movie brings something exciting and fun to the whole adventure.  For the women a love story for the man lots of explosions.  A deceptive film worth a second glance.

B00DBSZJRM|4.0|I was actually sad it ended.  Too many times movies with &#34;beautiful people&#34; are now full of sex and nakedness.. This was a refreshing change, The action was riveting and the story funny.  worth a rent of a cheap buy.

B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great game with wonderful graphics. The only problem is the ads which absolutely do not make me want to buy anything.
B00005O3VD|4.0|Although the story about the romance between Fanny Brice and Mr. Arnstein is not so compelling to watch, the musical itself is a listening and visual feast. This film is one more example of Barbra Streisand's unique ability to mix the comic with the serious; she also can be shy and explosive at the same time. The roller-skating scene and her debut as a Zeigfeld girl (using a pillow to show her pregnant) are among the funniest scenes I've seen. I never get tired of listening People and Don't Rain on My Parade. This latter song is so memorable because she sings it using the Statue of Liberty and New York Harbor as a background. With Miss Liberty in the background she declared her own freedom from show biz and audiences. Personally, I don't care much about the Mr. Arnstein affair (it actually happened), but it doesn't matter. I can simply ignore this slight and enjoy this musical feast. I can never get enough of Barbra Streisand.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Very well written. Perfect amount of plot twists and events, each with a very well thought out explanation. I would recommend this to anyone, I cannot wait for the next one to come out.
B006O5YHUY|5.0|Totally awesome story line without the big budget, big name actors.  It truly tells natural conflicts between father and sons, and brothers.  I have watched this 4 times and I still never get tired of it.  This is one of my all time favorites.

140006922X|5.0|We live in a fortunate time during which popular books communicating Biblical scholarship to the layman are numerous and of the highest quality.  Whether you're a believer or not in the supernatural claims of the Bible, the era during which Jesus lived is a fascinating time of monumental political and religious change.  The culture in which Jesus lived may be in some respects alien to us, but what makes it fascinating are the similarities, the universals that remind us that humans don't fundamentally change.  Today, just as then, religion remains political and divisive, with many of the same issues and controversies.<br /><br />What distinguishes this book from many others is its thorough readability. It really is a page turner, just like a well-written novel.  Aslan can write like few academics can.  When you finish a chapter, you can't help but go on to the next, for the story alone.  As such, this is a wonderful book to begin with in understanding the state of modern scholarship about the historical Jesus, because it so well communicates the excitement of the subject matter rather than seeming dry.  It's unfortunate that the perception is that Aslan is presenting some sort of radical new theory about Jesus.  On the contrary, almost all his views are mainstream among Biblical scholars.  He's just stressing different things.<br /><br />What may be new to those who have read other books of Biblical scholarship is the story Aslan puts together from Acts, James, and the epistles of Paul, in addition to other traditions and sources, to reconstruct the early schism in the church between James' followers who saw Jesus' message as being quintessentially Jewish and based in the Torah and the views of Paul who saw Christianity as a completely new faith that had surpassed the laws of Moses and made them obsolete.  The confusion between these two points of view continues to this day.  The story is important to understanding the earliest church, and Aslan joins all the disparate pieces of the story together so well and gives it detail like no other author has.<br /><br />This is a brilliant book, which I'm sure will become a classic and be read for generations.te pieces of the story together so well and gives it detail like no other author has.<br /><br />This is a brilliant book, which I'm sure will become a classic and be read for generations.

B0000667RO|4.0|A very nice compilation of Bryan Adams songs.  I bought it for one particular song but I like having a hard copy so I bought the CD.  The seller sent the CD in good packaging within the specified time.  What else is there to say?

0470901071|2.0|I ordered this, started studying it, then when I went on Cisco's website, I found that this exam will no longer be given after September 30th, 2013. By the title of the book I assumed it would be up to date for the current CCNA Exam.<br /><br />I am not saying the information or format is not good, it is simply out of date.  From my perspective it was a waste of money. Not Amazon's fault as I should have researched it more.  That being said, unless you can buy this, study it and take the test by the end of September 2013, I would suggest buying the official Cisco press book for the new exam that is also available on Amazon.

This concert features songs from Rainbow's Stranger In Us All (their last) which I've always felt was one of their best.  Saw this tour when they stopped at the Key Club in Hollywood CA and this concert DVD really brings it all back.  Highly recommended!!

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Lovely glimpse into the world of a British landed gentleman's household, the family, servants and the society and history of that era.
B001H5X7JS|5.0|When I hear about how a movie is meant to satirize something, in case the movie industry and the people in it, I tend to get nervous as these films generally aren't the all-out entertaining masterpieces I usually enjoy.  But this film destroyed that stereotype by upholding all of the precieved stereotypes about Hollywood.  Each cast member perfectly portrays a typical type of acting style, from Robert Downey Jr. and his method acting to Jack Black and his fart jokes to Ben Stiller playing the big-screen action star...all of them and more getting involved in a big-budget war film that becomes very real when a frustrated director abandons them in the woods in the hopes of getting some good shots (note that said directer blew himself up with a land mine, beginning the series of problemetic events that would plague the colorful bunch of actors.)  So, have a seat, pull up some popcorn and perhaps a hot date, and enjoy this film about the making of films.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|Because of the multiple difficulty levels it can be as easy or as hard as you'd like.  Lots of fun.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|Sometimes I am just a sucker for a good love story.  And getting one set on such a historic vessell (brief as it's history may be)...well, who can beat that?  This film's $200,000,000 budget was worth every penny.  Not only could you find yourself rooting for these star-crossed lovers from minute #1, but the amazing set design and special effects showed us just how expansive the mighty ocean really was, even for a ship as grand as the Titanic.  This was especially prevalent when this mighty vessel met her ultimate and, if you know anything about history, inevitable fate on April 14, 1912 (if I just spoiled the movie for you, my apologies.)  Nevertheless, you find yourself rooting for these characters and their journey to America.  That can only be possible because of the 120% effort that was put into absolutely every aspect of this movie.  I don't even know how anyone could ever do a remake of this down the road (I'm not counting the 3-D version that came out last year.  I'm talking about someone doing this film all over again.)  I'd say that this is a must-have no matter what type of movies you normally enjoy.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Good game. Passes time easily, with little frustration. I always loved missile command growing  Updated graphics help the gameplay a lot.
B00009M6VJ|3.0|A decent flick but certainly not in the same ranks as other death penalty films like \\"The Green Mile\\" and \\"Dead Man Walking\\".  Kevin Spacey certainly comes off as a knowledgeable professor...but he's not the type normally found on Death Row.  Kate Winslet comes off as the strong-minded, determined reporter, but we've seen those before (cough..Lois...cough...Lane...cough.)  I would have liked to see more of Gabriel Mann...he was a fun intern (I'd have hired him.)  Overall, this film can be watched but there won't be anything that'll blow you away.  I'll leave the purchasing decision up to you.

B000B5XOXY|4.0|Okay, so this film has Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face (good.)  But this Two-Face doesn't stay true to his classic incarnation and comes of more like a Joker with facial scars and a coin (bad.)  The prime example of this straying is when Two-Face flips a coin over and over again until he gets the result he wants (bad) whereas the character was always known to always always rely on that coin and accept it's result no matter what.  Val Kilmer is a good Batman (good) and who wouldn't want Nicole Kidman's Dr. Chase Meridian on their arm (very good.)  Chris O'Donnell does a convincing job playing Dick Grayson/Robin (good) but I am still trying to figure out the punks he was fighting his first time out in the Batmobile (bad.)  For that matter, what was up with that damsel in distress he rescued from the punks?  I couldn't decide if she was scared or turned on when the \\"resue\\" happened, though I would think she should be the latter (bad.)  For that matter, when did Gotham City become Las Vegas?  The dark and grizzly scenes we came to know and love were covered in neon (bad.)  I definetly miss Tim Burton and Michael Keaton and I would have loved to see Robin Williams as the Riddler (he was being considered for the role.)  But I somehow cannot help but watch this film again...I can't explain it so I won't pursuade you as to whether or not to go out and buy this DVD...the price is certainly fair.  And Jim Carey isn't so bad as the Riddler and the riddles are good (note that Jimmy didn't write those himself.)  In the end, the purchasing decision is up to you...I'll just leave you with my thoughts.

B000B5XOY8|5.0|Before Mark Hamill and Heth Ledger got to put their notible marks on the history of the infamous Clown Prince of Crime, there was Jack Nickelson.  The man took a role he was perfect for, a mob goon, and incooperated the unpredictable insanity of probably the greatest comic book villain of all time, and he did it all so seamlessly that you'd think he was really born just for this one role.  Nickelson matches wits with Michael Keaton, a man whose background in comedic roles led everyone to believe he would not make a suitable Bruce Wayne/Batman.  Well, Mr. Keaton justly blew them all away and more than earned the right to wear that cape and cowl.  And let's applaude the man who brought them together...drumroll please...Director Tim Burton.  Mr. Burton put these sworn foes and set them down in the perfect grizzly setting, allowing The Joker to create the choas he craved while giving Batman all the right reasons to oppose him and any other piece of low-life scum that happened to be lurking around.  A superhero film for the ages...
1455526959|5.0|The latest installment in Michael Connelly's Detective Harry Bosch series is excellent. Harry's single minded determination to solve mysteries may make his superiors mad but the stories make for great reading. I recommend this book without hesitation.
B000B5XOSO|4.0|If I could, I'd have given it 4.8/5 stars or 4.9/5 stars, but alas, I cannot...just proves that we need a different rating system here.  This movie was excellent but just not as good as the first (I gave that one 5 stars...FYI.)  Michelle Fifer Danny Devito enter the stage of Gotham City as it's newest rogues and Michael Keaton puts the cape and cowl back on as though he had only been away for a weekend ski trip as opposed to the four-year gap between the films, again proving his worth in the role.  Adding to the fun is Christopher Walken as the nafairius Max Shrek, a new creation in the form of a greedy CEO.  Personally, I had actually viewed Mr. Walken as being funny, even when he was supposed to be menacing or otherwise evil.  So this situation mirrors the doubters about Michael Keaton becoming Batman in the first film...and the pleasant surprise is equivalent .  Mr. Walken comes off just as coniving and self-serving as any of Batman's classic rogues, but with a highrise office to do his plotting in.  And of course, Tim Burton returns to take us back to a dark and grizzly Gotham that proves it still needs a Batman despite the evil Joker being six feet under by now.  Let's face it...you just can't enjoy Christmas with crazy catladies running around and strange costumed men (besides those dressed as bats) terrorizing the good citizens who haven't left this dreary city.

B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Let me first say that I have owned this book for about five years. I bought it back around the time that I bought the Twilight books BEFORE they became over-hyped. I also READ it five years ago right after I read Twilight. Now, a lot has happened in my life in the five years its been since I read this book and I can definitely say with age comes new perspectives. I don't remember the book being like this and that isn't a bad thing. The only thing I do remember from reading this five years ago was that I kept thinking THIS BOOK would become a movie. Not Twilight. I wasn't entirely wrong. But I just strongly felt that this should have been a movie long before Twilight.<br /><br />Clary is one of those whiny characters that enrage me. She is that female heroin that everyone wants to smack and say STFU to but I also think she is what makes the book worth reading. Because without her whiny, damsel in distress personality I don't think Jace would have felt the need to always save her, thus, causing the romance between them to be pretty much non-existent. So I am grateful for that.<br /><br />Jace is also one of those characters you just want to smack. He seems to be messing with Clary's mind and it also seems like he doesn't know what he wants either. He is overly stubborn and thinks he can take on the world.<br /><br />Alec is a total butt wipe. I have other choice words for him but I want to keep this clean. He is too stuck up his own butt to care about anyone else but himself. He has a huge thing for Jace but being gay is apparently taboo in their \\"culture\\". Not that Jace would return the feelings...<br /><br />Isabelle is pretty kick-ass. She likes to use guys and then rip their hearts out. She is an awesome fighter and she cares deeply for her brother. She also doesn't seem stuck up and prissy like most \\"hot\\" girls in YA books.<br /><br />I really thought Hodge was a good guy. I never expected him to turn bad. I truly thought he loved the kids and wanted to help them.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the little bit of romance between Clary and Jace. It didn't seem rushed or anything. I actually didn't expect it to happen so it was definitely a good surprise. The references to \\"incest\\" that I have been hearing complaints about are completely pointless. I don't mind it at all. It helps build the story and its not like they grew up together knowing they were related.<br /><br />I'm not sure how I feel about Jocelyn lying to Clary her whole life and \\"erasing\\" her memory every two years. I understand Jocelyn thought she was helping her daughter but I think she should have told her to truth just as Valentine should have told Jace the truth.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed the book and the character building was pretty good. The relationships between characters didn't seem forced or rushed and everything seemed to fit together well. The action was spread throughout the book and not just bunched up at the end. I gave the book 4/5 stars.

Should be on everyone's reading list. Teachers should be teaching students how to work with the universal energy field.
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|This is the type of movie that will make you think.... maybe even try to put yourself in his shoes. And to know that it's based on actual events makes it all the more interesting. Some may think it is a little slow, almost like Castaway with Hanks, but I think it sucks you in and keeps you guessing as to what will happen next. Worth the watch.

B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I ordered this movie to watch along with my 16 year old grandson who had just finished reading the novel as a summer reading requirement by his school. I had read several chapters of the book as well but did not finish it.<br />The pace of the movie, as the book, started slowly but characters developed quickly.  My grandson fell asleep midway the movie. I, age 68, continued to watch and am so glad that I did. From the mid point  of the movie to the timeless  romantic ending, the title and the theme were  apparent.<br />We plan to watch it again & hopefully my grandson will stay awake long enough to get to &#34;the good parts&#34;.
B00005Y1UX|3.0|Spoiler alert:  This review reveals the ending<br /><br />I heard about the film when it came out--the famous indecent proposition.  It struck me as silly then and I didn't watch it.  But one rainy night when I had nothing better to do I watched it on Netflix.  I still thought the idea was ridiculous and shut it off before she made up her mind.  However Redford was so attractive that I went back the following night just to see what would happen and his charm kept me watching to the end.  I actually liked the whole cast.  Woody Harrelson is likable as the impulsive, idealistic, young guy.  Demi Moore does a good job as the pretty young wife.  And Redford, in his white suit looked like he just stepped out of Gatsby.  Who could resist him?<br /><br />The story is taken from a novel in which the millionaire is an Arab shiek which would be a whole different proposition. I haven't read it so I can't comment but it's interesting to speculate on how it played out there.  The film has a lot of logical holes in it.  First, someone as charming, good-looking, and ultimately nice, not to mention Rich, as the Redford character is, would not have to offer any money to any woman.  Secondly although Demi Moore looked good she's neither beautiful nor interesting enough to justify Redford looking for her. And one would wonder how, after RR she'd really want to back to Woody.  Because he paid a million dollars for a hippo?<br /><br />Finally where the film fails is that it sets up the moral premise--that love is more important than money and that love cannot be bought.  It sets up the Woody character as representing Love and the Redford character as representing Money.  That's all very good but the story doesn't unfold that way.  The Redford character seems to be as genuinely in love with the woman  as Woody  -- even more so, given his heroic act at the end.  The scenes in which he is pursuing her---in the classroom and in his home, are the most genuinely touching of the whole film. Their dance on the patio of his home is much more romantic than all of the scenes with Woody and Demi in the sheets.  It is possible that Woody is the better man for her but the film doesn't show that.<br /><br />And probably most importantly, which Redford pointed out was that he would not have let his wife be sold as Woody did.  So the film doesn't prove its own stated premise.  However it's Hollywood and if you can suspend your own judgement and just sit back and look at the pretty people, you might like this film.

B005LAIGPA|4.0|2012 saw the release of possibly the two biggest superhero movies to date, &#34;The Avengers&#34; and &#34;The Dark Knight Rises.&#34; In my opinion, those two movies don't hold a candle to this lean 80 minute sleeper. &#34;Chronicle&#34; intelligently ponders what would happen if teenagers actually acquired super powers. Their experiences are some times thrilling and terrifying. The climax feels incredibly powerful because we feel an emotional connection with the characters, and because, unlike larger superhero movies, there is actually something at stake. Did I mention this is all accomplished in under 90 min? What a breathe of fresh air.

0321934318|5.0|As night follows day, so a Scott Kelby publication follows the release of another version of Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 5 (LR5). I have previously reviewed several Lightroom books by Kelby and right up front I have to tell you that this version just seemed to me to have more meat on the bones than any of its predecessors. I am not sure if it is because Lightroom itself has become a more robust program (which it is) or whether the author felt the urge to go into more depth. As evidence of this, I must note that this book is almost fifty pages longer than the previous version (LR4). So let's get into the guts of this version.<br /><br />First the hard facts. It is a soft covered tome of 533 pages measuring 8 inches wide by 10 inches long (hmmm - 8 X 10, a popular printed photo size, coincidental?). As of the writing of this review, it was available on Amazon.com for $36.55 for the paper version and $23.99 for the Kindle version. This book follows the same format as previous versions in that the text flows side-by-side down the page with the illustration referring to that text. I find it the most convenient arrangement because the reader is not forced to look back or ahead for the illustration to which the text is referring. Also, the size and structure of the book makes it easy to keep it open to a specific page while referencing a subject without having to weigh it down with another book. The book is rated at an intermediate to advanced user level.<br /><br />Also up front I will put in my pet peeve with Kelby's books. The author prides himself on his ability to produce \\"jump in anywhere\\" books. Yes, he advises the new Lightroom user to follow the flow of the book because it is laid out in the order that the reader will probably use the program. However if you are a veteran of Lightroom, you probably would like to quickly look at the sections on any new Lightroom features or improvements in this version. But how do you know what they are so that you can \\"jump\\" to them? I, for one, would appreciate a page or two in the beginning of the book that let's the seasoned user know what's new and where it is. As now constructed, the veteran Lightroom user must gather that knowledge from other sources or skim through the book looking for new Lightroom features.<br /><br />Let's move on from that slightly negative aspect to a feeling of the book's worth. First, because of his constant contact with photographers via his training programs and his long association with anything that begins with `Adobe', he is well qualified to know what these folks want to know about a program. And that knowledge shows up in the text and illustrations. Most of the photo-type illustrations are available for downloading so that the reader can follow along on his or her computer if that makes learning easier. A web site is provided to get the photos. The illustrations that show screen shots of LR5, or a portion thereof, are usually very clear. In short, it is a well illustrated book. Kelby also provides two other information sources; one concerning the Lightroom Web module which he explains has not been revised in the last three versions and the web site of a bonus video on creating identity plate graphics with transparency.<br /><br />As stated previously, the chapter layout follows a typical Lightroom workflow. It, of course, starts with getting the photos from your camera into Lightroom. It continues with an in depth description of the Library module and how to organize your photos. Now Kelby looks at customizing your way of working with Lightroom. The next several chapters get deep into the Develop module where all of the image adjustments are done. Having adjusted images, the reader is then instructed on ways of exporting the images including getting them over to and back from Photoshop.<br /><br />After all of the image tweaking is done, Kelby leads the Lightroom user in ways to creatively use those images such as in photo books and slideshows. Other chapters include working on movies taken with a DLSR camera and printing your photos (including some very sophisticated print layouts). As an added bonus, Kelby provides a web site where the reader can download 24 presets that can be used in the Develop module of LR5. These presets can save considerable time and give the LR5 user a number of development options that may not occur to the user. The book ends with a section wherein Kelby describes his step-by-step process from shooting to printing a portrait; in other words, his portrait workflow. At the end of each chapter, the author provides a page or two of Lightroom Killer Tips, short blurbs that refer to the previous material but which may save effort or furnish a short cut in the use of the program<br /><br />The style of the book is informal. As with his other books of this type, it is very task oriented. By that I mean the reader can have a specific task in mind for LR5 such as sharpening photos. A perusal of the Table of Contents shows a section on that specific topic. The reader can then go to the pages indicated and find a five page dissertation on exactly how to accomplish sharpening in LR5. That will be the only subject in those five pages with text and illustrations to aid the reader. Each part of the book is built on that concept of task orientation relieving the reader of the chore of trying to remember previous lessons leading up to this point in the book. The Table of Contents is a very useful tool in and of itself. When using this book as a reference volume, the TOC makes it easy to get to a specific subject.<br /><br />As I stated at the beginning of this review, I think that this book on LR5 represents Scott Kelby's best effort in this series. Each chapter and section is chock full of useful information. The flow of the book is reasonable in that it follows a normal Lightroom workflow thus keeping things in a logical perspective. I would recommend this book to the new Lightroom user as well as the veteran who has several versions of Lightroom in his or her past. Because of my pet peeve stated previously, I would give this book 4.5 stars out of 5.

B000O8OTNC|4.0|It works!  A very nice pocket sharpener. The hone is best. The sharpening notches adequate. A nice small tool for polishing the cutting edge of any device. Remember, however, a world-class sharpening tool it is not!  But as a small convenience, it is hard to beat at the price.  Would I buy it again at the same price? Yes

B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is alot of fun, keeps the gamer entertained for a long time. Neat missions and different ways to play.
B00CO4KGYA|2.0|Firstly, if you give me an aiming line and I can aim that line at something then my shot should go where I aim. That doesn't happen in this game a LOT. You'll aim a can of exploding soda exactly where you want it to, your aim line is in clear air and.... you hit an obstruction!<br /><br />Secondly, the game suffers from 'Aren't We Clever' syndrome. Without hints you're expected to figure out exactly the right sequence of shots, aren't we so clever, to hit every target on the screen. Except with the bad aiming system this often becomes ridiculous.<br /><br />Thirdly, No, just NO. If I pass all the levels in a section that should be enough to unlock the next section. Do not make or expect me to go back and replay level after level trying to earn enough 'extra balls' to unlock an area it already told me was available but isn't because I wasn't clever enough... I hit all the targets with the ammunition given to me. THAT should be enough.<br /><br />Finally, if you're not clever enough to come up with more than a handful of taunts don't put taunts in the game. Getting the same, lame taunts over and over as you start a new level is just stupid.<br /><br />Uninstalled and deleted from my cloud. Wasted of time but not in an enjoyable way.<br />At least it was free. If I'd paid for this I'd be irate.

The mere fact that you've been in the field of neourology as a surgeon over 25 yrs...and your describing in precise terms about the inability to experience without the function of the neocortex,and yet this amazing creation of our consciousness remains when every other natural ability was inactive. Your  visit to the Heavens was a genuine delight. More studies indeed should be done in the field of consciousness. Quite frankly I believe the love in our hearts and our consciousness are our souls.

B006LSZECO|5.0|A page turner, it keeps you on your toes. An outrageous story that gets all the details right, from the inner dialogue of a marriage crumbling to the constantly connected, always &#34;on&#34; world we live in to day. A psychological thriller that feels connected to this time and it's setting. Gaslight for the 21st century.
0060920084|1.0|Less of a travel book and more of a lengthy diatribe badmouthing America, Americans, non-Liberals, and everyone and everything Bryson doesn't like. There are only a handful of places in the book where he says anything nice about anyone or anything. He is also occasionally downright dishonest. He is also obsessed with his own negrophilia, to the point where he repeatedly lies outright or omits facts to the point of dishonesty. Think of the nastiest most negative most snarky and smarmy person you know. Then imagine that person as an eloquent Leftist author, and you get the feel of this book. His badmouthing is especially directed at rural Southerners, whom he repeatedly ridicules and flatly describes as \\"stupid\\" and \\"slow.\\" This book is far less about travel than about his own self-admiring ability to be clever and turn a witty and insulting phrase.<br /><br />It's obvious why Bryson put on a show of being a decent human being during his travels. If he spoke in person like he writes, he'd have had a bloody nose at the least.<br /><br />There is very occasional honesty in the book. Perhaps the most striking bit of honesty is when Bryson describes himself as a \\"flinty jerk-off.\\" A discerning reader, or any decent person, would have used stronger language.<br /><br />Although this book purports to be about travel and the USA it is actually just an excuse for Bryson to aim his venom at those not in a position to respond. The intelligent reader will take away one main point: Bryson is a skillful writer and an unadulturated a..hole.

B00CMQX84A|5.0|My fourteen year old daughter went wild for this movie.  I watched a good portion of it with her.  It is mildly entertaining with some fun musical portions in it.  The actors are cute and the story is nice.  It is not blockbuster quality, but it makes for a nice summer diversion.  She took it with her when babysitting the ten year old crowd a few times.  Those girls were equally in love with the movie.  I would consider it appropriate for probably ten and up.  I am pretty conservative about viewing ages.  I would not let my eight year old watch this movie.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|What a touching story. I can see myself reading this book over and over whether I need a cry or a smile.
B00AEFXV3E|5.0|I saw this movie many years ago and just purchased it. It made me feel so sad for the real man portrayed, I think John Hurt is a brilliant actor and I have just purchased another of his films from the past, The Naked Civil Servant, another true story about the life of Quentin Crisp. Anthony Hopkins, another brilliant actor is superb in the Elephant Man too. I definitely would recommend it to everyone!

B00CL6GAD2|2.0|Plot is slow, boring, and contrived.  Everything feels forced, including the acting.  A cover-up and real estate scam doesn't make for the most exciting plot to begin with, but revealing the cover up through undeveloped characters only makes you less interested in it being exposed.<br /><br />Don't waste your money.

B00E6Z0THE|5.0|Really loved this game. Not as frustrating as some other games like this, but still tough enough to not get bored. Hoping for a sequel like the ending leads you to believe.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is drop dead amazing. It has it all: love, humor, action, tragedy. It leads you down one path before shoving you down another. It captures a love story, never before chronicled.  I know it's shallow, but I have never cried so much and so hard as I did reading this. The characters are so well written they seem alive. The Mona Lisa of book's; right here in your hands.
1469984202|1.0|The book had an okay (but already overused) premise: people are forced to live underground because the earth has become uninhabitable. A well worn premise, but if he can bring something NEW to the idea via technology or character interaction, then it has the potential to be a great book. Unfortunately the author has very little understanding of human psychology or how crowds work or how society organizes itself. So instead of getting authentic/realistic human interactions driving the plot forward, we get &#34;fake&#34; people acting in illogical or nonsensical ways which creates a &#34;drama&#34; that can't be easily solved because all the other characters are acting irrationally. Example: main chapter X discovers &#34;dark secret&#34; and then &#34;goes insane&#34; and, of course, tells no one the &#34;dark secret&#34; thus creating a &#34;mystery&#34; for everyone to solve on their own. This is not rational or psychologically authentic human behavior and thus its an example of poor, hackneyed writing. And yet everyone seems to think this amateurishly written novel is better than Shakespeare! Huh???

0765325950|2.0|I just finished reading this. The only good thing about this book is that it finally ended the story I've been reading for years. But I was very disappointed. To be honest, this book would have been much better if it had been edited down to HALF of what the final result was. Because basically most of it is battle, battle plans, descriptions of people, places & what they're thinking, just rambling on and on. By halfway through I was sick & tired of battle/plans. But it just kept going on. I guess the good part about that is it let me scan through page after page of a lot of the book without actually having to read in detail.<br />The most disappointing part though was the ending that didn't end. We don't find out (spoiler alert) what happened to Rand, the 3 women who love him, if Elayne ever found out her mother was still alive, the babies whether they were boys/girls & if they had any powers, etc.<br />I felt that the final chapter was completely missing and had somehow been left off of the manuscript. After I read the last page I just wanted to scream \\"So what happened?!?!?!?\\". The book ended but the story didn't and it felt like they were leaving it open for another book. I hope so because after being involved with all these characters for so long it just isn't fair to leave us hanging without knowing that happened to them.<br />If you have read the rest of the series up to this point you have to read the finale but be warned it is totally unsatisfying.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Intrigue; great scripts; superb acting!  This is a series not to be missed.  It draws you in like a magnet!

B0014QABX0|3.0|This album is ok..  It is definitely not my favorite Black Keys CD.  I'm looking forward to getting to know more of their music.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I could not put this book down. Sweet, sad, .........<br />Definitely a heart wrenching novel that was well-written. Enjoy it
B0018CVQFM|5.0|Graham's songs have always lifted my spirits.  These have different arrangements than the original recordings so even if I have the original disc in my library, I don't have exact duplicate songs!
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|I downloaded this to entertain my two-year old granddaughter. She liked the cat and it got her to talk more just so she could hear Tom repeat her words.
B000002VCQ|5.0|Another great Singer gone but not forgotten She was and will always be a great songbird. No one can compare.
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|Good, solid British detective television series, but a bit slow-moving. The characters are well-developed, and the scenery is lushly beautiful.  However, I find it difficult to identify very strongly with anyone in this series.
B005URRCUY|5.0|I like to listen to this CD while I'm driving on my car.  The best part is to watch my 6 year old dancing in the back seat;  I guess he likes it too ;)
B005FSI1IK|5.0|Great story and plot..  As usual, it was hard to put the book down. Miles adventures and those of his &#34;friends&#34; are well written.

B00CO4KGYA|4.0|I enjoyed it. I almost hesitated because of the reviews, I'm really glad I didn't. I'm killing scummy corporate thugs right now. Just finished with the evil scientists. Fun stuff!
