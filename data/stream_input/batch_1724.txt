B005G5PPGS|5.0|An incredible insight into baseball. Although I know nothing about the game, this story shows most of the scouts, writers, general managers and executives in baseball to be insane per Einstein‘s definition, as they continue to do the same thing time and time again and expect different results. It must have been marvellous to work in such an inefficient market.
B007OWRBJK|4.0|I have read many books about the Who as a long time fan. After the deaths of John and Keith and the long hiatus before Endless Wire I was still hoping Pete might produce new material relevant to the aging fan base. Having read this book, I can say I enjoyed his recounting of his life but felt let down by the lack of details of his activities after John's death. The book gets side railed in this child porn controversy in the end then just kinda ends with passing reference to his life with Rachel Fuller. What about the tours with Zak Starkey and Roger lately? What is he doing now. It felt a bit unfinished at the end, but otherwise was a decent read. Just one man's opinion.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|A touching movie and represents the real Japan.  It is no wonder it won best foreign film!  In my permanent collection of great movies to watch over & over.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|Anyone who loves Aerosmith will love this CD. It is absolutely brilliant. It is a true classic in the making - and time will once again prove it. In 50 years this CD will be seen to be a classic masterpiece I beleive.  Every song  - perfect. No duds.  I have been an Aerosmith hardcore fan since 1974. I own every CD they ever did. They are the best rock band America has ever produced. Sure, it's not a 1970's old school classic like Toys or Get your Wings. But this album is just killer. The production is better than Just Push Play (more old school than that brilliant CD) and the playing is truly exceptional. These Boston Boys just won't quit. Tyler is on fire and not a HINT of deterioration in his voice. He is still in strong top-notch form vocally and it's truly amazing. This CD will go down in history as one their finest moments. Great mix of rockers and ballads. Jack Douglas - brilliant job my friend - great final mix.

159420411X|5.0|Excellent book!!!  People looking for a \\"how to predict\\" silver bullet will (like some reviewers here) be disappointed, mainly because Silver is too honest to pretend that such a thing exists.  The anecdotes and exposition are fantastic, and I wish we could make this book required reading for, say, everyone in the country.<br /><br />During election season, everyone with a newspaper column or TV show feels entitled to make (transparently partisan) predictions about the consequences of each candidate's election to unemployment/crime/abortion/etc.  This kind of pundit chatter, as Silver notes, tends to be insanely inaccurate.  But there are also some amazing success stories in the prediction business.  I list some chapter-by-chapter takeaways below (though there's obviously a lot depth more to the book than I can fit into a list like this):<br /><br />1. People have puzzled over prediction and uncertainty for centuries.<br /><br />2. TV pundits make terrible predictions, no better than random guesses.  They are rewarded for being entertaining, and not really penalized for being wrong.<br /><br />3. Statistics has revolutionized baseball. But computer geeks have not replaced talent scouts altogether.  They're working together in more interesting ways now.<br /><br />4. Weather prediction has gotten lots better over the last fifty years, due to highly sophisticated, large-scale supercomputer modeling.<br /><br />5. We have almost no ability to predict earthquakes.  But we know that some regions are more earthquake prone, and that in a given region an earthquake of magnitude n happens about ten times as often as an earthquake of magnitude (n+1).<br /><br />6. Economists are terrible at predicting quantities such as next year's GDP.  Predictions are only very slightly correlated with reality.  They also tend to be overconfident, drastically underestimating the margin of error in their guesses.  Politically motivated predictions (such as those released by White House, historically) are even worse.<br /><br />7. The spread of a disease like the flu is hard to predict.  Sometimes we overreact because risk of under-reacting seems greater.<br /><br />8. A few professional sports gamblers are able to make make a living by spotting meaningful patterns before others do, and being right slightly more than half the time.<br /><br />9. Kasparov thought he could beat Deep Blue.  Couldn't.  Interesting tale of humans/computers trying to outguess each other.<br /><br />10. Nate Silver made a living playing online poker for a few years.  When the government tightened the rules, the less savvy players (\\"fish\\") stopped playing, and he found he couldn't make money any more.  So he started FiveThirtyEight.<br /><br />11. Efficient market hypothesis: market seems very efficient, but not perfectly so.  Possible source of error: most investment is done by institutions, and individuals at these institutions are rewarded based on short term profits.  Rational employees may have less career risk when they \\"bet with the consensus\\" than when they buck a trend: this may increase herding effects and makes bubbles worse.  Note: Nate pointedly does not claim that one can make money on Intrade by betting based on FiveThirtyEight probabilities.  But he stresses that Intrade prices are themselves probably heavily informed by poll-based models like the ones on FiveThirtyEight.<br /><br />12. Climate prediction: prima facie case for anthropic warming is very strong (greenhouse gas up, temperature up, good theoretical reason for former causing latter).  But lots of good reason to doubt accuracy of specific elaborate computer models, and most scientists admit uncertainty about details.<br /><br />13. We failed to predict both Pearl Harbor and September 11.  Unknown unknowns got us.

0062183591|5.0|In his latest book, Dan Ariely describes the recent studies on psychology and economics of cheating. The experiments are so cool, and the book is so well-written, that I literally could not put it down. The research offers practical methods to decrease cheating. The new theory proposed by Ariely contradicts the currently prevalent rational model of crime, based on cost-benefit analysis, which is used to set our current policy.<br />One of the many different methods to measure dishonesty involves an experiment where volunteer subjects (typically, college students) were asked to quickly solve as many math problems as possible. The subjects were then paid 1 dollar (the amount varied) for each of the problems they solved, or rather claimed to have solved. In the \\"no cheating\\" condition, the subjects submitted the sheet with the solved problems to the experimenter, who checked the results and paid the subjects. In the \\"cheating possible\\" condition, the subjects were asked to shred the sheet with the problems after they were done, and then tell the experimenter how many they had solved (without him checking). The subjects did not know that the shredder was rigged and shredded only the sides of the sheet, allowing the researchers to check later how many problems the subjects actually had solved. Below are some of the surprising findings.<br />Very few people cheated by a lot. Most people cheated by a small amount. In the \\"no cheating\\" condition, they solved on average 4 out of 20 problems, and in the \\"cheating possible\\" condition, they claimed to have \\"solved\\" 6 problems. Thus, they cheated by claiming an extra 2 problems. Most of the money \\"lost\\" due to cheating was due to many people cheating by a small amount, rather than a few \\"bad apples\\". Out of 30,000 people tested, there were 12 big cheaters who, combined, stole $150. But there were also 18,000 little cheaters who, combined, stole $36,000!<br />Dan Ariely proposes a new \\"fudge factor\\" theory of dishonesty: \\"On onehand, we want to view ourselves as honest, honorable people. On the other hand, we want to benefit from cheating and get as much money as possible. Thanks to [cognitive flexibility], as long as we cheat by only a little bit, we can benefit from cheating and still view ourselves as marvelous human beings.\\"<br />According to Ariely, here is the summary of forces that shape dishonesty:<br /><br />* Increase dishonesty:<br /><br />** Ability to rationalize. If the subjects are paid, instead of real $1 bills, in tokens, which they can change into $1 bills almost immediately, they increase cheating by 2-fold. According to the theory, they rationalize cheating because it's not money that they are stealing, but tokens. Think about implications of this for our increasingly cashless economy, or compensation based on stock options vs. cash. In another experiment, people who were annoyed by the experimenter, cheated almost twice as much as those who were not (to annoy the subjects, the experimenter picked up his cell phone in the middle of explaining the task to them). Here, the subjects might have rationalized cheating as justice. Ability to rationalize is the most general factor increasing dishonesty, and partly overlaps with other more specific factors below, such as creativity, one immoral act, etc.<br />** Conflicts of interest. In an experiment designed to resemble a relationship between financial advisers and their clients, the \\"advisers\\" cheated the clients by inflating the \\"values\\" of items by 25%. Amazingly, adding disclosure only increased their cheating by another 25%, while the clients did not discount this increased level of cheating nearly enough. In other words, disclosure under these conditions was actually harmful to the \\"clients\\", who were being cheated.<br />** Creativity. Subjects who engaged in creative activities (such as writing, painting, etc) more frequently, viewed themselves as more creative, or chose a greater number of creative adjectives (such asinsightful, inventive, etc) in a word selection task, also cheated more often. Interestingly, intelligence was not correlated with dishonesty.<br />** One immoral act. Subjects were asked to wear sunglasses before the experiment. The group that was told they were wearing fake Chloé sunglasses cheated twice as often as the group that was told they were wearing authentic sunglasses. (Actually, the sunglasses were authentic in both groups.)<br />** Being depleted. If the subjects' willpower (self-control) was depleted, for example by getting them tired before the experiment, they cheated 3-fold more. Compare this with other large and systemic effects of depletion in [[ASIN:0143122231 Willpower: Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength]].<br />** Others benefiting from our dishonesty. When the payoff from cheating was shared 50-50 with another subject, people cheated 60% more than they do alone. The cheating increased even more when they cheated altruistically, that is, when they knew that 100% of the payoff would go to another subject.<br />** Watching other behaving dishonestly. Culture that gives examples of dishonesty. The subjects were college students solving math problems as described above. When another \\"subject\\" (actually, a paid actor who was wearing the sweatshirt of the same university) stood up after one minute and said that he had \\"solved\\" all 20 problems (an obvious lie), the rest of the subjects increased their cheating by 60%. Interestingly, if the cheating \\"subject\\" belonged to a rival group (wearing a rival university sweatshirt), the cheating decreased by 60%, relative to the regular \\"cheating possible\\" condition!<br /><br />* No effect:<br /><br />** Amount of money to be gained. The amount of cheating did not change between the groups of subjects who were offered either 0.5, 1, 2, 5 or 10 dollars per each of the math problems solved.<br />** Probability of being caught. The amount of cheating did not change between the groups of subjects who wereasked to either (a) shred the entire sheet, (b) shred half the sheet, or (c) shred the entire sheet and pay themselves from a jar with cash.<br />** Concerns about standing out. The amount of cheating did not change between the groups of subjects who were told in advance that an average subject in the past solved 4 (which was true) or 8 problems.<br /><br />* Decrease dishonesty:<br /><br />** Pledges and moral reminders in advance. Subjects who were asked before the experiment to recall the Ten Commandments did not cheat at all. This was independent on the level of religious belief, and on the number of the Commandments that the subject could recall. In fact, none of the 450 subjects, all UCLA students, could recall all 10. Amazingly, the results held true for atheists as well. Swearing on a Bible (for atheists!) also resulted in no cheating. MIT and Yale students who were asked to sign the pledge \\"I understand that this experiment falls under the guidelines of the MIT/Yale honor code\\" before the experiment, also showed no cheating. This is despite the fact that neither university has an honor code!<br />** Signatures in advance. Subjects who were asked to sign the form with the math problems at the top (before solving the problems) cheated 4-fold less than those who were asked to sign at the bottom (after solving the problems). Note that we are typically asked to sign most forms, such as tax forms and insurance claims, at the bottom - precisely where they have less effect.<br />** Supervision. Being closely supervised (all actions watched over) by another unfamiliar subject resulted in no cheating. However, if those who watch and those who are being watched were asked to talk to each other and get to know each other before the supervised task, the cheating was much higher.<br /><br />SEE ALSO:<br /><br />* \\"K svetu\\" blog has links to some of my favorite podcasts about \\"The Honest Truth about Dishonesty\\". I recommend them as a starter, or as a summary of the book.Dan Ariely is also a very engaging speaker, in addition to being a fantastic scientist and fascinating author.<br />* Dan Ariely wrote other books, for example this great book about the biases of our everyday thinking: [[ASIN:0061353248 Predictably Irrational, Revised and Expanded Edition: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions]]
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|This movie was a real sleeper at the box office.  However, it is probably my favorite movie of all time!  Very tense and somewhat on the dark side.  Not for everyone.  Ryan Gosling's acting is superb in this film!
B002SRQ214|4.0|This AMD 965 CPU has been around for a long time and is still better that just about anything AMD has produced. Read all the comparisons between this and the dissapointing FX bulldozer/piledriver series, and it even compares well against the AM2 trinity series.<br /><br />This is my testbed processor for all my AMD motherboards (I also have an FX 4170) and is durable and reliable.<br /><br />Currently is blown away by the 2nd and 3rd generation i5 or higher Intel processors but for budget builds or AMD fanatics this is the one to buy.

B005LAIIPS|4.0|This one was not as plot driven as the original trilogy, but it was so exciting that I didn't even notice.  The cat and mouse chase gets you on the edge of your seat the whole time.  I loved the quick thinking and great strategy that the characters used.  I thought the acting was great for both of the leads and I really liked their subtle, natural romance and the way they supported each other.  It has different strengths and weaknesses for the original trilogy, but is definitely worth watching!

1612680011|4.0|This book is an EXCELLENT read for anyone who wants to better their financial future. This book has changed my mindset not only about money, but life in general as well. Robert Kiyosaki teaches readers to question their current mindset. He states, rather than saying \\"I can't afford that\\", you should ask yourself, \\"How can I afford that?\\". I've applied this concept to many areas of my life, not just money, and have seen a huge difference. This book is mostly philsophy based and as other readers mentioned, does not provide advice in terms of what to invest in, business structure, tax advice, etc. Robert Kiyosaki is not an accountant or attorney, therefore, cannot provide legal or tax advice to readers. This books purpose to get you to the correct mindset to be able to eventually become financially literate. His teaching helps break basic conditioning, which is VITAL before taking any further steps. Since reading Rich Dad Poor Dad, I have purchased other Robert Kiyosaki books, such as the Cashflow Quadrant and the Guide to Investing. These books include more information and give you an idea of how investing works but are also philsophy based as well. If you are looking strictly for advice on whether to incorporate your business, legalities of real estate, you will need to sit down with an attorney or accountant. These books help steer you in the right direction mentally and provide you with a basic understanding of how to go about becoming financially free. As Robert states, your mindset is your greatest asset. If you want to be rich, you need to think like the rich. Robert's books help you to interpret financial statements, cashflow, and use logic when investing. I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who is interested in investing or beginning their own business.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I bought these a week ago, despite some skepticism from a number of reviews. Despite what those had to say, I'm immensely satisfied.<br /><br />Pros<br />Excellent sound quality. Yes the 7.1 is software emulated, but it makes even Youtube quality sound better. The cans are incredibly clear, voices sound like they are in the room, and I really cannot tell that these are headphones. I usually think that they are speakers when I'm not thinking about it. The surprise I got the first time I paused music was incredible - it was like the music had been in the room with me, and suddenly it wasn't anymore. That's vague I know, but it was actually disorienting. The battery life seems great - after the first charge I used them on wireless mode for at least 7 hours with no change in sound quality or volume. That's another thing. These are actually quite loud. I usually keep them around 50-60% of full volume.<br /><br />Cons<br />Yes the software is troublesome. There isn't any way to make the G-Keys function as a regular key, so you can't write custom hotkeys for them very easily. I've seen some custom plugins (for instance, one to integrate with VLC) but this seems to be out of the realm of typical consumers. I have also had the problem where the volume wheel does not work immediately after unplugging the charge cable - you have to restart the headset for it to work. The sound, as I said above, is really excellent with the exception of bass. Sometimes it gets incredibly waffled, especially when the volume is over 90%. I haven't carefully checked if this is because of the 7.1 software or if it's actually just the cans, but it can be frustrating. The last minor gripe I have with this headset so far is the pad on the headband seems a little thin. Maybe I haven't worn it in yet, but the first couple days wearing it, I've been feeling like it puts a bit too much pressure across my head. It's not too much, but definitely noticeable after wearing them for a while.<br /><br />Things Ican't speak to (lack of experience from limited ownership)<br />Range: It seems like the range is fine for me. I expected very little range outside of my room, because I live in a dormitory with cinder block walls and a lot of wireless repeaters, so it does fade well within 40 feet. I know that I got at least 20 feet out into the hall, and that was after three walls between me and my computer. I'll try this out when I'm somewhere else to get a better idea of what home quality is like. The set works great within my room though, which is where I intend to use it, so no complaints.<br />Microphone quality: I just haven't done any tests. I asked my roommate if he could hear me fine when gaming using voice chat, and he said that I was kind of quiet at first (before I had turned the mike up), but that it was conveying my voice a lot more accurately than my old headset.<br />Interference: I live in a building with a lot of wireless routers/repeaters, as I said, but I've had no trouble with interference.<br /><br />EDIT: The sound does cut out when you detach the charging cable, but it's a matter of 2-3 seconds before it comes back, so this is not a problem for me. Fading and interference seems to be directly related to how close to a wireless router I am, so I guess the wavelength could be changed to make it less susceptible to interference.<br /><br />Overall though, these are incredible headphones. They had just dropped to under $100 when I bought that, and even if I only get one year of use out of them, I would buy them again. Everyone that I've let try them has just sat there as music built, and slowly just starts smiling. They all want some now. I guess the last thing is that these do block out a good deal of ambient noise, so sometimes it can be hard to tell how loud you are talking into the mike, but I don't see that as a bad thing really.<br /><br />TL:DR They're great, with a few minor quips which seem irrelevant to me. Highly recommend.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|just gave this CD to my office mgr - she went nuts!  She was<br />so happy.

They have a TV to link them to the outside world.  What makes this story unique is that it is told from the viewpoint of the son who when 5 years old was told that there was a whole world outside.
B008MEM24S|5.0|i just loved this hame so much, its the only app out of 5 apps i play, so, WORTH THE GREEN I SAY!
B005LAIGPA|5.0|Action/adventure, huh?  More like suspense/horror with elements of drama!  Chronicle is one of the craziest films I've seen in a while.  It's about three teenage boys who happen to stumble across telekinesis powers hidden deep in the ground that was apparently brought to earth by aliens (though it was never actually stated but we can only assume since all logic points to alien creatures).  When the teens leaves the hole... let's just say, they'll never be the same again!  The movie takes the familiar theme of having one of the characters walk around holding a home video camera, which reminds me of the Blair Witch Project but a *thousand* times more exciting and suspenseful.<br /><br />Some of these segments will truly blow your mind.  Everything from money being ejected from a cash register, to a bus way up high in the air flying through a building, to the teenagers learning they have the ability to fly, to windows exploding and police officers and cars flying backwards... everything that makes special effects entertaining is right here.  These powers are also used to trick people such as a lady who comes out of a grocery store and discovers that her vehicle had been parked in another spot, lol.  The boys also use these powers in a negative way such as pushing an impatient driver off the road and over a guardrail.  Not to mention they find out the hard way what happens when they exploit these special powers and believe they're unstoppable.  Let's just say, the consequences will HAVE to be taken into consideration then.<br /><br />The one thing that sort of bugs me is that the teen whose mother was lying hopelessly sick in bed... shouldn't he have at least *tried* to use his special powers to save her life?  Anyway this same boy has a father (or stepfather) who's an absolute jerk and doesn't mind smacking his son around, and the telekinesis powers are most rewarding during this segment.  Whereas the first 10 minutes are really boring and lousy, the final 20 minutes that show the ultimate confrontation on the streets of Seattle are enough to elevate the overall rating to 5 solid stars.  Really strange movie.  I'll have nightmares tonight!  Recommended to everyone!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book its hard for me to get hooked on books but this one had me from the start... i recommend it to everyone

B003INBOEM|5.0|I never write reviews but this movie is my new favorite movie. I love everything about it the story, characters, and the fighting is amazing.  The story is told in a way that you feel everything he is going through, I don't want to say much else as to not give out the story but this is one of the best kung fu movies I have seen and Donnie Yen is spectacular in his performance.
B00712Y28Q|5.0|Look at Samus.  Look at how she presents herself.  Tall, proud, obedient and radiant.  Someone who can gloat about the many victories that she's had to overcome throughout the years.  Someone who had one challenge after another stand in her way and yet prevailed with confidence and determination.  Someone who's seen more planetary exploration than many of us could ever dream of.  Stepping out of her spaceship and onto your bedroom nightstand, Samus has remained a Nintendo favorite for over 25 years.  Yes Samus, the protector of the galaxies.  Your presence is felt strongly in a cost effective action figure physique.  You shall be purchased by thousands of Metroid fans.
B009LZDGSI|3.0|Elementary is entertaining. I recommend it for the primary reason it is keeping one of literatures great characters alive one hundred and twenty some odd years after he was created. Now that is a viable character; and there aren't that many to begin with. Plus, Sherlock Holmes the character something to teach about observation. The programme itself is Ok in my opinion. Don't expect to be electrified, though those new to the character might be electrified by the mental acuity of Holmes.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I saw the movie in the theater more than once and I knew I wanted the DVD as soon as it was available. I recommend it any one who is interested in history and specifically the events of WWII. The cast of the movie portrays the Royal Family of the 1940's as accurately as presently possible, and definitely is a keeper for any DVD library.

The vivid characters, the effortless way the story moved, and the overall ease she had with painting a picture you could almost touch... The Casual Vacancy is the polar opposite of that. I was so excited to see a new novel but Rowling, but that excitement was quickly squashed. Honestly, you could have told me that anyone wrote this book and I would've believed it. It's much harder to swallow that this is written by the author that created such incredible images with her writing in any other novel that she did, an author that had me glued to each page of her book(s) from the very first sentence. If I didn't know better, I would think that someone was lying about the author of this book.<br /><br />The story by itself may have been okay, but the writing is borderline torturous to read. The overly abundant characters are severely underdeveloped which makes following this difficult story even more painful. On top of that, there is such an onslaught of unnecessarily vulgar remarks, almost seeming like Rowling randomly threw in the obscene comments without regard to if they made sense or not. Perhaps that's what Rowling thought was needed to be considered an adult writer, but it only seemed forced and useless. Between the awkward situations happening with the barely-there characters and the entirely meaningless focus on body parts, Rowling severely missed the mark with this novel.<br /><br />If you're looking for great read, keep looking! In general, The Casual Vacancy was the biggest literary disappointment and will have J.K. Rowling fans everywhere crying in outrage.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|The movie was great. Everything from the storyline and actors to the set and costumes were great. We watched it twice in a row. I would tell everyone (not children) to buy the DVD.
B009POCFTG|4.0|This is a brutal film, not because of the violence but the fact how messed-up these people really are. Emile Hirsch acted so well I almost felt bad for his chararcter. The ending is one of the most intense scenes I've ever seen. This is it, a story well told and a cast makes it believable, nothing fancy and it's the way films are supposed to be.
B003QCCS3Q|5.0|Some may be wondering what I don't like about the CD.  Certainly not the content.  The CD's sound is far too harsh, brittle and aggressive for an acoustic roots album.  I am listening to the 2LP 180g gatefold release, and it sounds beautiful.  The instruments are so nicely separated but still so unified.  Greg Liesz' steel swirls but is not distorted because of the peak limiting.  The difference in acoustic guitar is so remarkable compared to the CD, the bass & drums are deep but not overpowering, the cymbals don't sizzle. My vinyl is heavy and quite silent.
1439156816|5.0|Not only was this book helpful; it was great reading.  This is one of the best books I have read and will take a special place in my library; perhaps with one of my own someday.  I'm glad you wrote this Mr. King.  Thanks!
B00A11AN6O|1.0|The website claims that the app works with all androids... WRONG! It doesn't. Now Amazon is giving me the run around in order to get a refund! They say I have to call in order to explain the \\"issue\\". The issue is that your product doesn't work as advertised and I want a refund! If your android runs Google Play you are better off getting Google Drive for it works and their rates are cheaper.
B0000025C0|5.0|Boston was a true supergroup with alot of powerful songs. This one was the hit followup to their first release. It's not as powerful but it's close to the first ones power. Unfortunately this band wouldn't release a new cd for way to many years after this which was unfortunate. ANd now with the death of the leasd singer the band seems to have been lost forever. Still, This is party rock, and it's damn good party melodic metal party rock at that.  This was a monster hit because Boston made  a good followup to a masterpiece of rock. Why they waited 8 years to put out another release is beyond me However they did put out 'orion the hunter' a spin off group during that time. If you like classic rock then this one is for you. There isn't a bad song on here.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I love that the color of the cable is white. I lost my black one and this one is much easier to keep track of because the white really stands out.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I just did not enjoy reading this novel as much as John Grisham's other works. The narrative bounced around too much and lacked credibility.<br />Hopefully, Mr. Grisham's next work will be more interesting.
B001UREJWM|5.0|What can you say? Musician's at the top of their game, playing the genre they created. Every song pure gold. PLAY LOUD.
B0077ZNCE2|4.0|Was easy to order and watch on my ps3 but not compatible with my Wii? Would of liked to watch on Wii as well so the kids can easily order in my living room!
B00855B27C|1.0|hi, i bought the testaemnt dark roots of earth like in the photo, but you sent me the normal edition and argentinan edition
B008AK8FHM|1.0|This is NOT a Christian book...sounds more like this man went to hell, was deceived, and came back. Christ is not mentioned.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|The book started slow but got there in the end. It certainly had me guessing right up to the last page!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I rarely say that you \\"have to\\" read a book since tastes and genres run the whole gamut, but I'm saying that you \\"have to\\" read this book. This book left me quaking with sadness, even though there are moments of lightness. In the ten days it took me to read this novel, I couldn't wait to get stuff out of the way so that I could curl up with THE FAULT IN OUR STARS in the evening. I delved into a world of cancer, frailty, strength, humor, the meaning of life, and the legacy people leave behind when they pass on. With other books I find the focus may be on a few things or a singular theme, but this book seems to encompass so much more. It's as if John Green held up his arms to life itself to encapsulate its pith and put it in this book with two characters, Augustus and Hazel, who will capture your heart and won't let go.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Well written, and a wonderful alternate reality in which to invest my mind. Can't wait to read the next book!
B008Z9YLV2|1.0|All the buzz was for nothing. I'm a huge fan of action and quest movies. But this one was such a disappointment.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Ken Burns sets a new standard for historical documentaries that has influenced the genre to match his craft.  The use of professional actors to provide voice to the actual letters written by participants brings to life poingancy of the war that still shapes our nation.  His artristic movement of the camera over still photos brings realism to a war without th benefit of motion photography footage.  The research for the presentation is exhaustive and comprehensive.  This documentary should be required viewing for everyone wanting an understanding of the scope and magnitude of this civil war that was in no way civil in preserving the4 United States.  I recommend it for anyone whether middle school student, ordinaary citizen, or academic scholar.
0811729117|4.0|One of the best I've read on this subject. And to say he (the author) was lucky would be an understatement.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Someone told me the other day that I should read 50 shades of grey because it's so romantic. I told them I think their version of romance is stupid. Reacher knows how to do romance. When a girl gets shot in the head, Reacher goes about killing everyone within a mile radius. It doesn't get any more romantic than that!!
B001ANSS5K|5.0|Quentin is a clean-cut kid, until one night his neighbor, long-term friend, and crush, Margo, takes him on an all night-early into the morning prank spree, getting back at all the friends and classmates who've hurt them. After an amazing, exciting night Margo disappears. This isn't the first time Margo has run away. Also, she always leaves a trail of hard-to-decipher clues. Quentin and his friends go about finding these clues with the goal to reach her. This is a thoughtful and hilarious novel; there's plenty of depth behind the quirky and funny characters and scenes. Out of all the Green books I've read, the cast of characters in this one is my favorite.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|It's fun to play.  The game kind of sucks you in then is slow to regenerate coins unless of course you are willing to purchase extra coins.
0736092269|5.0|I'm a massage therapist but also training to be a personal trainer, and found this book to be very helpful for both so far. I really enjoy the detailed guide to the various workouts, showing which muscles are used, which are primary, secondary, how to avoid certain injuries.Its like watching someone work out with a xray machine, fantastic!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I have purchased each book by Rick Riordan not only in this series but all three series.  Even though these are written for young people, they are interesting for me as well.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This is a well written and extremely clever story. But I didn't like the main characters Amy and Nick. I could not identify with them, maybe because I'm not married. I felt Part 1 was tedious and this was where I began to hate and grow bored of both characters. As clever as the premise for the plot was, the ending was disappointing and terrible.
1449410243|5.0|A delightful collection of comics illustrating the tribulations, joys and pitfalls of owning a potentially murderous and / or deranged cat.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|Following the lives of the characters keeps a good pace. Didn't want to put it down but sleep beckoned goodnight
B007I2BYX0|4.0|This was a good EP for The Pretty Reckless, I had been waiting for it to come out ever since I first found out about it. It still contains the hard rock TPR is known for, which is raw and full of heart, especially in a live setting. Now we just need their second full album to come out and we'll be all set!
B001H1SVO8|4.0|Okay, so I've been in college since I was in kindergarten, or at least that's how it feels. Now that I've graduated my friends have taken turns dropping their jaws at my pop culture ignorance. Every week one of them exclaims, \\"How have you not seen that?\\" Which is how I ended up viewing this movie. I won't deny it's a little odd, but oh so quotable and one really can't beat Edward Norton. In my book he's a better actor than Brad Pitt, and he's no slouch either. If you're into psychology at all or beautifully unpredictable movies, you'll love this one.
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|The book really is better. I am a huge fan of the TV series and recently started reading the book series and in under a couple of weeks, I am on the 5th novel. Totally hooked.
044024630X|2.0|I've read them all. This one is curiously uninvolving, dare I say boring. I scanned quickly or flipped over a lot of pages waiting for something to happen. The story is set back in time and it even feels like it was written back in '97, a would-be author's first stab at setting up his lead character. No excitement and a lot of plodding description of Carter Crossing. Very disappointing.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|I couldn't put this book down. As a piece of literature I found the language rather stilted. Whether that's because it's a translation or intentional I don't know. In many places it goes to extremes to make sure you understand - in contrast to many books where you are kept guessing. This can also be considered a pro or a con. In any case, it was great fun.
B007RTAR64|5.0|was surprised how nice this doll was.very good likeness of doll and nice bow and arrow.very well put together,and cute outfit.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|Carly's hit was the theme to my Summer, it is a great catchy song and it was nice to have it available for a good price.
B002O1TMI4|5.0|This band brings together all of my favorite musical characteristics, introspective prose, dynamic lyricism, innovative compositions. Somewhat reminiscent of Queen, but with an identity all their own.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|will not open. avid angry bird fan. please fix using Android tablet. all my kids would love it on their tablet too. thank you
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game has a lot of cute dragons that you can mixbreed &amp; evolve.  Very fun and addictive.  I recommend it highly.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I found this book very well written and informative. I am a believer in the afterlife and interested in other experiences, having had some interesting experiences of my own. His narrative is from the heart and easy to follow and also the clinical perspective brings in a very unique element. I would recommend this book to others.
B000AYEIZY|5.0|2005:  London's Royal Albert Hall hosting one of the 60's greatest Rock Supergroups, CREAM....all three well in to their 50's; gone is the long scraggly hair, wild beards and bellbottomed pants yet their mystic musical magic continues.....Jack Bruce, the years of hard partying and drugs had taken a toll onto his body yet his voice still held on to its soulful vibrato and pitch-perfect harmonies-his vintage Gibson bass still capable of delivering a forceful accompaniment to Eric Clapton's signature Fender Strat. Ginger Baker, the once erratic and manical drummer whose hammer-like assaults on his drums looking quite subdued, still keeping perfect time on his trademark dual bass drums. And of course, Eric Clapton (reigning as one of the all-time GREAT<br />axemen in the history of Guitar playing) delivering another of his remarkable performances with almost perfect vocalizations of their timeless hits.....Adoring fans filled this historic theater and were treated to a remarkable exhibition featuring thirty five years of Rock and Roll history!<br />  I realize critics will lambaste the acoustics, lighting, songlist, etc, in attempt to dissect, define and delineate this trio's final joyful and memorable exit as one of the 1960's induring icons....as a fledgling musician during that time (weren't we all?) I struggled to replicate Ginger Baker's driving beats as Cream's Hits were so much a part of everyone's playlist....I still feel my pulse quicken whenever I hear Sunshine of Your Love, Jack and Eric's bluesy melodies, searing riffs and Ginger's wild beats....hard to comprehend so MUCH music and incredible songs from THREE MUSICIANS!!!!!<br />  Now, my favorite tunes and a few personal thoughts on each:<br />  \\"Outside Woman Blues\\"  as subtle and seductive as it was 35 years earlier!  What an incredible melding of blues and rock!<br />  \\"Sleepy Time Time\\"  vintage Jack Bruce still savory harmonies and arrangement (I cannot listen to this cut once, I keep hitting replay.....)<br />  \\"Politician\\"  the message is as appropo today as it was over 40 years ago; one of their BEST!<br />  \\"Stormy Monday\\"  still gives me goosebumps-a stirring tribute to the great T-Bone Walker; Clapton so eloquent and heartfelt with the voice of a<br />  Baptist Minister delivering the Sunday Sermon!  Listen to the Allman Brother's version (live at the Fillmore) and behold the gift of American Blues<br />  lovingly handed down to future artists....<br />  \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\" timeless and tasty<br />  \\"Sitting on top of the World\\" Jack Bruce CAN play harmonica!<br />  \\"White Room\\" vibrant and driving as it was almost 40 years ago<br />  \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\" a once and forever rock anthem; Cream's trademark song!  Who will ever forget Ginger Baker's pulsating percussions, Eric and<br />  Jack's perfect harmony as well as another Clapton riff all which are emulated by today's guitar enthusiasts and Rock and Roll hopefuls!<br /><br />  As individuals, Cream will be the victims of their earlier excesses however their MUSIC will endure....long live Rock and Roll!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|What a wonderful story. Its always been so easy to get caught up in the Sparks books. Another great one.
B002CNST10|5.0|So it's official, I'm in love. A friend of mine turned me onto this band and earned his stripes as my friend. His assessment was that I would either instantly love them or wonder what on earth he was thinking recommending them. It's the former, definitely the former. One of the songs was on the first Twilight soundtrack and it was the best song on that soundtrack. I also love having the entire album on my phone. Eat your heart out iTunes. Android finally has an app that not only matches iTunes for content but also surpasses them for price economy. Yay AmazonMP3
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I only read the first book and found it to be so repulsive and disturbing I just could not go on to any other books. I didn't want to finish the book but I had hoped it would have gotten better and unfortunately.....so needless to say I did not like this book AT ALL.  Sure wish I could get a refund on my Kindle!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Well, if you havent read it yet, you should.  Very gripping, page turner, and educational.  Alot of new words I didnt know before.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I really like the graphics and its a good time waster. You actually get a lot of the gems, just have to use them right.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Nothing much to say other than it was a good deal, and the blu rays worked just how they are supposed to without any problems
B009G8GRX6|5.0|This was my introduction to Muse. Amazing band and I love being able to listen to the tracks on my phone. I am so in love with the Amazon mp3 app and the albums are cheaper than the apple apps.
0374203032|5.0|The world has changed significantly over the last three decades, including the incredible expansion of markets and market values into areas that had previously been viewed as inappropriate for or inaccessible to such.  During the era of market triumphalism this expansion was viewed by most as a natural progression; now, after the significant economic failures and shifts, it is essential that people begin to critique prior assumptions with a willingness to challenge assumptions about the role of and proper boundaries for markets.  The economic perspective that commodification does not impact the nature of a good, service or relationship must be understood as outdated.  With the increasing reliance on incentives in many areas --  healthcare, education, and immigration to name a few -- the notion of economics as independent from morality must be dismissed.  As money is able to buy more and more things, people from differing socioeconomic groups lead increasingly separate lives affording fewer and fewer opportunities to interact with those outside one's own group.  Charting a different course forward requires a willingness to \\"deliberate openly and publicly about the meaning of the goods and social practices we prize\\" within a framework that allows for contributions of \\"moral and spiritual substance\\" (p.202)
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Great storyline, acting, and the cinematography is amazing.  Another classic Wes Anderson film.  This would be one of my top 5 movies for the year.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I got my cd and love it play it every day. I fnally got it cause I didnt put the right address down but now I fixed that and all is right with the world.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I really enjoyed it. loved how hidden object and the mystery game were put together. cant wait for #2 tons of fun.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I could sit there for hours playing this game trying to figure it all out. its a wonderful game and I recommended it to anyone who likes a challenge
B009329ZF2|5.0|Battleship was a bit disjointed at the beginning of the movie.  The timeline of events occurring was noticeable or even distracting.  This soon faded,  and the storyline took off with great action scenes.  The movie was filled with great imagination,  and lots of fun.
B009PU2SX8|5.0|A friend of mine at work told me about Gary and all I can say is WOW!  Blak and Blue is a veritable cornucopia of musical goodness.  The diversity across each track just makes this a stellar album to have.  It has everything from a Jimi Hendrix psychedelic rock vibe to blues to R&B.  In today's world of cookie-cutter sounds, Gary is a true artist.
B009K0P10K|5.0|This series keeps getting better and better.  Great intrigue!  very good story line and definitely holds my interest.  Nothing else out there like it.
B008NABUU8|5.0|bonjohnny<br /><br />Man this game is great I had so much fun with it you have to really think on your feet in building these bridges
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Was excellent story well told even more important than the sex is how the people interact in the story.a beautiful love and adventure story
B00005NKK8|5.0|What can I say? Great movie,great soundtrack.This album contains full length versions of all the songs in the movie in the order in which they were featured in a scene from the movie.These songs will bring back a lot of memories from the movie and for yourself if you're old enough to remember historic events from the movie.Great collection and has bonus tracks.Sound quality is very good.
B002TLSSXO|4.0|The tools work will with my new pots and pans and do not leave scratches and show no signs of melting when using the spatulas for a stir fry or something at higher heat.
B004TTHLBE|5.0|Gaiman at his best! Myths, ghost, and American landmarks all tied up in an epic tale.  Shadow is a great unexpected hero.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Sooooooooo good. Couldn't put it down! Tears, laughs, thrills, and excitement. Sparks makes,everything he writes believable and really creates such a beautiful picture of love and call that love carries along.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I loved this 2nd part of the trilogy. It was definitely an anxious-so consumed-page turner for me. I could not put it down. I spent 2 work days reading this on my phones kindle app in discretion because I could not resist what was coming next.<br /><br />It was definitely a bit repetitive at times, closely mirroring the dialogue in the first, but I can get past that. I loved the growth, the new and renewed (for Mr. Grey, lol) strength, love, and passion in the characters individually and together.<br /><br />Overall, it was  very exciting and I can't wait to start the last of this trilogy later in the week - I'm trying to wait to start reading it on a day when I preferably don't have to work!
B008O69SZ0|4.0|I've loved Mott the Hoople and Ian Hunter for a long time. Lucky to have seen Ian with Mick Ronson at Rainbow Music Hall in Denver.(long time ago)This is another strong release from Ian.While not as great as \\" Man Overboard\\" or \\"Shrunken Heads\\", this is another great set of songs and the band is hot!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|The graphic novels are awesome. The movie doesn't follow the  books but is well done. It is a very enjoyable series.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I had to buy this on DVD, because at the time, that's the only way it was accessible (without a cable connection).  I also wound up buying it on Amazon Instant Video, so I can watch it on the go or share it with friends who would appreciate the plot twists and character development.  Homeland is fabulous!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is a fave computer game, so I was very happy to have a portable version for my kindle since I have a<br />very simple phone.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I must say that I disagree with many reviewers of this book. Looking past the not so well written dialogue, I loved the story. Maybe it is because I am just 23, so the heroine characters age is close to mines, idk. I feel that the author really took into account the age and inexperience of Anastasia and mastered sexy Mr. Grey (lol). Repetitive it was, but overall, I loved it and was eager to see what happened next in the 2nd of the trilogy.<br /><br />It all boils down to personal opinion and preference.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I am really enjoying this app.  Clean, simple, colorful design.  Lots of levels.  I recommend the game to others.  It is addictive and a nice way to pass the time.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|This was a GREAT book! the writer has done a lot of research on animals and i learnt a great deal reading the book!<br />It was a riveting read!
B0053O89KG|5.0|I am of course a fan of Castle and many others along this line. In the beginning I could take or leave the show but now I'm hooked so I hope very much that it continues and I thank Amazon for their prompt deliveries and quality of their products.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|The game is easier to play on a tablet than on a phone or bulky laptop. I just have not had much time to get very<br />good at the gsme yet.
0307730697|5.0|This book is a must read if you are into military readings.<br />I I I I I I I I
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Clear and unbiased. Also not lingering on some particular areas for too long unnecessarily. Nicely incorporate many people's viewpoint into one to recreate the story and timeline.
0812992784|5.0|This memoir reveals how Rushdie lived, loved, wrote and maintained his dignity during the ten years he lived under the Fatwa death decree.  Though he was burned in effigy, castigated by the British media and politicians, assailed by critics, as well as daily enduring death threats, he continued to write and publish.  The book reveals much about the creative process, the restrictions the artist faces when publishers, agents and governments show cowardice in the face of threats from Iran.  Rushdie also reveals with great candor his familial relationships, and his plethora of friends and enemies throughout the world. Instead of hunkering down, almost from the first days of the Fatwa, Rushdie struggled to be free of the forces protecting him. He loved the freedom he found in America.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I've purchased >15 of these headsets because they are such a fantastic value and make great gifts for family & friends.  I use these headsets at the gym, in my office, & when I'm traveling.  They have a real decent sound and are durable.  The price point for this Sony product is < $10.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|If you are watching a movie, the standing case serves its purpose. But there is no way to<br />prop it open in order to read. Books do not &#34;turn&#34; on the kindle, so there is no way around<br />having to hold the case. I do wish in future tweaks that  there could be a slot or pocket for the<br />stylus. At present, you have to clip it to the elastic strap.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Very good puzzle game. Makes kids think and solve problems. Would recommend for all ages. Great characters with Perry the Platypus
B000002MZ6|5.0|I just happened to hear a song off of this album recently - and instantly loved it. It was \\"The Chamber.\\" Recently, a good animal friend of mine passed on to the other side - and I was missing her dearly and something about this song was eerily comforting. I must have listened to it over and over again about 12 times before listening to any other songs off of this album.<br /><br />It's one of those albums, much like Enigma's Le Roi est Mort, Vive le roi, that flows seamlessly from beginning till the end. As if each song were each a different piece of the entire song, which is the album.<br /><br />I've been listening to this album every day now for the last 2 weeks or so after hearing it for the first time. I can't stop playing it over and over again!
1936608898|5.0|ISWF is an amazing plan with full explanation of all the science behind it to make you restart your health.  The book clears up misconceptions about food and certain food groups and sets you up with a fool proof plan to carry out w/out being too scary or overwhelming. I recommend this book and this lifestyle change to anyone who will listen!
B008OOYALE|5.0|at first only joined to get free gems in another game but its strangely addictive...  can breed dragons of different colors to make new breeds.  hint : acquire neighbors so you can gift eachother gold...  so far ive not had to make any ingame purchases... just need to be patient...slow progress game
B005K0HDGE|3.0|I started this book, then put it aside to wait for my new Kindle. I then immediately ordered the kindle version.<br />His books are classics, I own most of them, and prefer to own a &#34;hard&#34; copy rather than just an e-book.<br />I am currently involved with volume 5 of &#34;Harry Potter,&#34; having never read through the series. I am anxious<br />to start reading it on the kindle soon.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|Can't stop watching.  We're staying up way past bedtime!  So many twists and turns.  Top notch performances by all characters!
B008XG1X18|5.0|So much easier to navigate than the mobile site! Laid out very nicely, and I hardly ever experience glitches in this app.
B000A59PMO|5.0|Great story line along the lines of Nancy Drew in the 50's.  Veronica is very funny yet caring in her portrayal of senior high student whose father has been discredited and left position as chief of police to open a private eye agency..  Great series!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Maybe I'm getting old, maybe I'm just impatient, but some of the more simple aspects of fb on the<br />computer are harder on a tablet. There is way too much reading involved to be order to upload pics. It' easier just<br />to get on the laptop for doing pics. Otherwise, it's great for checking messages,etc.
B004WGIXX4|3.0|This was a cute movie, but I don't feel the R rating given was strong enough.  It needed a bit more plot and a lot less porn scenes.
B008K7WCJM|5.0|Attention is the natural prayer of the soul.<br /><br />Nicolas Malebranche said that.  The Seer does not beg for your attention.  If you are reluctant to pay attention, go away, before Michael Gira kills the lights and locks the exits.  The band Swans seeks to offend you, and how you happen to receive their offense is your responsibility.  Giving into the thick washes of sound tends to give me the best listening experience, but really how you perceive the album, just as how you perceive any thing, is up to you--this album, more than any former Swans album, just happens to underline that subjectivity.<br /><br />Subtle sonic queues direct my attention in this way and that, for instance the very brief moment of relatively prominent floor toms at 5 minutes and 54 seconds into \\"The Seer Returns,\\" this moment indicating the presence of toms in most of the track, as compelling me in future encounters to focus on that particular sound amid the imposing wall of similar timbres, a tight sonic knot of jangly percussion and strums, and croaking drones.  Sonic knots such as these are among the most important in Gira's current arsenal.  Before even attempting to loosen these knots, losing myself in them is necessary--only when I have sufficiently lost myself in the music do I try to isolate individual threads, whence the meditative state this album elicits from me.  There is the stark hum appearing in relative isolation at 6 minutes and 32 seconds into \\"A Piece of the Sky.\\"  I continue to hear this hum far into the swell of some twenty dulcimers ringing stridently like bells at the gates of heaven.  Listening intently for this hum allows me to hear incidentally how harmonizes the similar sounds surrounding it.  You begin thus to hear melodies and then even harmonies within what seems at first just a constant drone.  What constitute these subterranean melodies and harmonies . . . I am not sure, but I suppose that they are the dulcimers, resounding and interacting, each of whichGira detuned uniquely.  The breaths of prominence and isolation on this album often serve to lure me into the music, which then casually and suddenly bombards me and which in a sense has since beginning tried only to trap me.<br /><br />Previous Swans albums have not hereto been this lovingly elaborate in engaging us, they have not hereto been this smartly unpredictable.  The closest in terms of length and scope is Soundtracks for the Blind, but that album is like the disassembly of an album--notice how often the music on each disc mimics chronologically the music on the other--Gira devotes certain tracks to a handful of samples or drones, which you hear in tracks which appear to be variations of their sequential correlates, and which you hear in even the \\"conventional\\" songs--and notice how even track titles reference and counter-reference themselves across the albums as if describing a single track which is itself absent.  Soundtracks for the Blind is the bisection and notes of one full album.  A beautiful premise for an album.  This is a massive album whose deliberate arsenal of tools works as one to make one great illusion/illustration of a world.  It seduces you and then demands you to examine its colossal cryptograms, with little in the way of guidance.  Alone as I am for most of the album, I am uncertain, but I am experiencing it more personally than I would be if didacticism took precedence.  Throw a boy into a lake and if he learns to swim he learns faster than the boy who takes lessons.  Likewise I have learned mostly by myself how it is to take pleasure from this music.  It is a testament to learning to find beauty in a world where no one is really there to realize it for you but you--it is up to you to be receptive.  The sound of the air conditioning eerily turning on in the middle of \\"The Wolf\\" informs the hard cut between this song and \\"The Seer.\\"  That apparently trivial sound, only apparently separate from the music, becomes an important compositional tool.  In this way The Seer is at once an authoritative text and non-hierarchical force.  Where the sound comes from is unimportant--the sound itself matters, no matter the form--melodies, harmonies, samples, and drones all have equal footing and standing.  Swans simulates a universe where there is no difference between sense and nonsense and where familiarity is an illusion.<br /><br />The album continues to perplex me.  I have yet to unravel it as long as I listen to it.  How many encounters it took for me to discern the accordion in \\"Song for a Warrior,\\" or the mouth harp in \\"The Seer Returns\\"--or how I have yet to tell myself that that wailing in the latter half of \\"The Seer\\" is really a harmonica, that the long somber sighs accenting the unearthly trio at the end of \\"Lunacy\\" are really just a cello--or that the horns in \\"93 Ave. B Blues\\" are not the collective shrieks of some strange species in its final moments on Earth.  But I know of course that these machinations are senseless and that no one shares them with me.  Subjectivity stems from an unconventional purity of instrumental sounds serving a wide variety of singular purposes.  The album simply tells you to devote at least your attention to it or just to walk away if you cannot consign yourself to it even if you try.  And that command I respect.<br /><br />As I have said, The Seer underlines subjectivity, but even though I (mis)understand the album as no one else does, the album is alien to me.  To immerse me in this music Gira uses what tools I have described.  He has for music an ear like Brian Wilson's, and like Wilson he has the uncanny ability of bringing me to interesting soundscapes.  Albums like Pet Sounds urge me to return again and again to hear exceptional music which would simply not exist if not for the artist who made it.  I have listened to that album on many occasions and still I am unpacking how it affects me.  Music whose priority it is not to be devotional to one particular tradition.Music which has no place in any scene.  Music which has no ego.  \\"The pleasure of recognition and promise of meaning\\" are less common than the pleasure of discovery, which requires more effort but which reaps more rewards.  Here I do not hear drums, bass, guitars, vocals, and the myriad instruments whose place Gira zealously deliberated, the master arranger he is.  Here I hear an utterly new world, an utterly new dimension.  The sounds seem to lack signification--they strive to be only what they appear to be, no more, no less, and they strive to be by and in themselves, their sonic attributes being the one thing which matters.  This little album--yes little at even two hours--contains an infinitely expanding universe, much like how, as Gira sings in a new song they have been playing live of late--\\"To Be Kind\\"--\\"there are millions of stars in your eyes.\\"<br /><br />These sounds strive to comment on only themselves, and they are as words wanting referent.  Swans strives here to do to music what Beckett strove to do to language--question it by producing potential references and negating them at the same time.<br /><br />I say \\"strive\\" for it is impossible to make new universes from old, and to try to is to fail to, but the effort is magnificent, and few albums come as close as this to creating unique places and times to which I devote my attention and self.  What I make of the album is not what you make of it, thus its brilliance.  To enjoy these compositions I have to work, but I work willingly, just as I work willingly to try (and fail) to grasp concepts new to me, as from special works of literature, film, etc.  The Seer is itself as a rich concept I have to strain my ears even to acknowledge, and at the risk of sounding sensational I honestly feel as if learning to hear in a unique place and time, and Swans is teaching me, so I pay attention.<br /><br />And I notice additional patterns and patterns of patterns whenever I listen. I have noticed that the beginningof \\"Song for a Warrior,\\" the first song on the second half of the album, is responsible for resolving four tracks of dissonance and atonality, at 45.4 minutes, and thereon the music is frequently resolving, for three tracks, at 31.9 minutes, till \\"The Apostate.\\"  The first half of that track is a very continuous but bizarrely transitioning suite of percussive musical textures, and the second half an acrobatic hymn whose tones and rhythms are vaguely reminiscent of those in \\"Halleluwah\\" on Can's Tago Mago.  I have noticed that \\"A Piece of the Sky,\\" across five movements (or six if you consider the natural and synthetic fire sounds their own discrete movements), becomes steadily unnatural as the track goes on, it becomes steadily very deliberate, insofar as including verbal language, an additional layer, of intentional verbosity, from whose late appearance we draw additional meaning.  The lyrics across the album seem to be aware of each other, frequent variations of particular words, recurring words, and even recurring phrases, namely \\"on a ladder to god,\\" in the final two tracks.  The album has a title track, the longest track, in which Gira repeats as if unconsciously, \\"I see it all,\\" as indicating there to be a character, \\"The Seer,\\" worthy of inhabiting three tracks (\\"The Wolf,\\" \\"The Seer,\\" and \\"The Seer Returns\\") and the title of an album.  That Gira has devoted so much of the album to this character leads me to want a narrative, and the music invites that.  The album generates its own mythology as Swans does as an entity.<br /><br />These I have not even finished considering--it is just a one-off paragraph before I conclude the review in saying that if you choose to submit to the album by devoting yourself to it, you are in for a significant haul.

0316228532|1.0|I hate to give Ms Rowling a bad review because I loved the Harry Potter series but I simply could not get into this book.  I saw an interview where Ms Rowling said by the time one gets to the end, if one is not crying, one is not human (or something to that effect).  I tried really hard but could not get past the first few chapters.  I did not care about any of these characters and I got the impression that Ms Rowling's idea of an adult book is one full of expletives and characters who  have serious psychological problems.

0143122010|3.0|I've only read 2 of Steven Pinker's books -- \\"The Blank Slate\\" and \\"Better Angels\\" -- but if his other books are anything like these, I can safely say that Pinker embodies the age-old adage: \\"A jack of all trades is a master of none.\\" From what I've gathered, Steven Pinker is an absolute savant when it comes to memorizing ideas, statistics and research papers, but he is capable of little more than compiling the works of others into a very cursory narrative that lacks depth and originality. His tone is sweeping and dismissive, and almost all of his arguments are aimed at strawmen. He wastes pages and pages on setting up old ideas and debunked hypotheses as if they're still widely accepted by his fellow intellectuals, and then pages and pages more summarizing the reasons why they aren't. One gets the sense that Pinker is involved in little research of his own, and only publishes books to prove to his colleagues that he understands what they've all been arguing about for the past months and years.<br /><br />That said, his books are well-written and full of interesting information. I enjoy reading them because I enjoy learning, and because his voice is erudite and impressive. If you have a scant understanding of anthropology, psychology, sociology and other fields, you'll love his books -- this one included. But if you're already knowledgeable and educated, don't expect your mind to be challenged by critical analyses and new ideas. You'll quickly grow bored with his tendency to summarize.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|It worked beautifully until I downloaded the update.  After that it would not so much as open.  I can't figure out how to delete the damned thing so it just sits there.  Like a peice of unattended trash in a sims game.  I think pretty soon the flys will start swarming it.
B008XNZMOU|1.0|True country music fans will see RED but not this type of red.  This is a perfect example of why there is almost no country music anymore.  It's also a good example of why this marketing approach has contributed to the progession of digital format so fans can get the one good song (if they can find even one) and ditch the rest of the album.  Real country music is hanging on by a thread, and about all that's keeping it alive is Dwight Yoakam standing by the side of the road holding a sign that says, \\"Anywhere But Nashville\\".

1416972242|5.0|Clary and the gang are back in this second installment of the beloved Mortal Instrument series. As if it wasn't bad enough that Clary and Jace found out they were brother and sister, they have to deal with the fact that their father is still running a muck and trying to destroy life as they know it. Add the recent deaths of downworlder children and what else could go wrong? And the answer to that is PLENTY. Every time they turn around, something else seems to happen that keeps Clary, Jace, Simon, Isabelle and Alec on their toes. Will they ever catch a break?<br /><br />The plot thickens, new characters are introduced (and again, it's hard to hate anyone in this series) and things are getting even more out of this world, literally. More secrets are revealed and even better, Simon becomes bigger and badder than I ever expected of him. I love Simon. I can't express that enough. Clare has come back with full force and made yet another great story come to life in this series. I loved every second of it and I can't wait to continue my journey with the rest of the Shadowhunter loves around the world. These books are simply addicting.
B001TODO54|2.0|Based on other reader's reviews, I bought this book in anticipation of a good, escapist read with interesting characters and plot.  Instead, I found it disturbing and upsetting.  Is it really necessary to make the Bad Guy so repugnant and twisted?  Honestly, do we need to introduce Young Adults to a pedophile who maims, tortures, and slowly kills young children and animals?  Wouldn't the story have been enough if the evil king was simply power-hungry and violent?  Yuck!  The other objection I have is in labeling the main female character as \\"strong\\" simply because she can fight and kill and survive.  There are other, more noble kinds of strength that actually build character.  Katsa is angry, immature, and seems to be the victim of her hormones.  This is not a female character I would want to offer as a role model for any young girl.  There are plenty of other authors whose work is inspiring, uplifting, and satisfying.  This is not one of them.

1416955070|5.0|At first this book was merely \\"okay\\" to me. I wasn't overly impressed but it did the job well enough for me to continue reading the series. Now that I've read every book in the series so far, I realize that this one was vital to beginning the story of these amazing characters. Cassandra Clare has put together the most unique world that I have yet to read in any book. Her imagination must be so much fun to have. She pays such close attention to detail that absolutely nothing is left out. This book set the stage for the entire series which has become one of my favorites.<br /><br />Clary Fray is just another teenager going to the club with her best friend Simon. While there, she seems something strange and horrifying that she was never meant to see. Enter Jace. When he realizes that Clary has witnessed the incident at the club, he has to know why. Mundanes are not supposed to be able to see Shadowhunters. How can this random human girl see behind the curtain? Then Clary's mother disappears, and everything she thought she knew is taken away from her. What exactly is going on? Could this other world possibly be real? And why was Clary thrown right smack in the middle of what seems like a war between creatures she never knew existed?<br /><br />This book is captivating. It sucks you in and takes you for such a thrilling ride that you never want it to end. Clary is such a strong character and you can't help but love her. Jace is a bad ass with a bad attitude but he's so funny and charismatic that you have to like him. There isn't a character in this book that I didn't like except of course the villain, but even he had his strong points. In the end, I sided with team Simon, but everyone would have my vote in an awesome contest. I'm really glad I listened to a good friend of mine and started reading this book. It has opened my eyes to a new genre of books that I hadn't come across otherwise. I am now a huge fan of Cassandra Clare and I encourage any and every one out there to at least try this series out. I haven't met anyone who didn't like it. That should say something!to at least try this series out. I haven't met anyone who didn't like it. That should say something!
B007REV4T8|5.0|I haven't seen a James Bond film in years (decades?).  I'm glad I decided to check in again.  The long opening chase scene followed by the creative credits and Adele's great title song left me satisfied that I already had my money's worth.  The acting was top notch.  Craig has the rough and tough body needed for Bond, a sense of decency about him, and he cleans up nice.  Judy Dench is spectacular and plays a major role this time.  Javier Bardem creates a totally different villain that is a perfect foil for Bond.  Albert Finney is his usual great in a small but significant role.  Kudos for the script and directing.  Overall, what delighted me most was how the folks in this \\"business\\" make their split second life and death decisions, quickly weighing up the values and the circumstances, and without apology or self-recrimination, simply go on to the next challenge.  Invigorating!
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Very creative movie and one that I would watch again. Characters do a great job keeping you entertained.<br /><br />If you are looking for a fun, light hearted movie on a Friday night The Lorax is the way to go!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The ending to this fantastic trilogy was certainly a surprise. Well executed book, but after the first 2 folios in this series, I was hoping for something that matched their punch, but Mockingjay didn't quite deliver.
1416972250|5.0|This was one of my favorite books in the Mortal Instrument series. There was a lot going on and it wasn't able to lag because of everything you had to take in. With each book things get more intense for everyone involved. By the end of this one, I was really happy with where the story was going. When there's a lot of books in a series you get to know each and every character more intimately, which I love. By this time you're literally involved in their lives and you want to see what unfolds with all of them. That's why I loved this one. I now felt like I was a part of this wonderful group of people and what was happening to them was now happening to me as well. Clare is an excellent story teller in that sense.<br /><br />Valentine is at it again and everyone has just about had it. This time he is planning the ultimate attack on the Shadowhunters and it's very possible that he could succeed. New characters come into play and others tend to fade away. I have to admit that I really liked Sebastian coming into the mix. I love characters that bring something new to the story and his tale was definitely an intriguing one. The situation between Clary and Jace also made this one of my favorite thus far. Things never seem to go right for these two but they finally catch a break and all is well in the Shadowhunter world. Except of course for Valentine and his evil plan. Will it ever end?
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Starts out kind of slow as far as \\"action\\" goes, but it's extremely interesting while getting started, and then, all of a sudden, you're not wanting to put the book down. I've always liked the way Grisham tells a story, and this is no different.  Anybody who enjoys Grisham will definitely enjoy The Racketeer.

B000SGGUWS|3.0|Pretty Little Liars as about 4 (old) best friends: Spencer, Aria, Emily & Hanna.  3 years before the fifth member of their group, Alison went missing and has yet to be found.  Once Alison went missing the girls went their separate ways and no longer hang out together but each girl is now receiving suspicious messages from \\"A\\".  The secrets that are being exposed are only things that Alison knew about the girls.<br /><br />I went into this book with high, very high expectations. That is probably my own fault as I should have known it's not going to be the same as the TV Show.  Let me just say that Pretty Little Liars(the TV show) is one of my favorite shows right now. The book was a lot different from the show.  The way the girls look is also very different so I found it so hard to try re-envision them as the way they were described in the books.<br /><br />The story was really hard to concentrate on.  I expected it to be really fast-moving and easy to read but it actually took me quite a while to get through.  I also found the characters somewhat annoying! Hanna really irritated me which is odd because in the show she is my favorite.  I also thought it was so weird that Aria's parents wanted her to call them by their real names.<br /><br />All in all I did like this book but I don't think I will be purchasing the rest. I really wish that I had read this before I watched the show because I think I would have enjoyed it a lot more.  I will continue the series as I heard later on quite a few things are different from the show but I think I'll be borrowing them from the library instead.
B0051CSI0G|3.0|No matter how you slice it (pun intended), there's nothing wrong with a good monster apocalypse. Since you've shown up here, you're probably following The Walking Dead in their zombified cruise through the southland, and have watched the 28 Days and Months series.  Stake Land gives vampires equal time, in a worldwide cataclysm that brings down governments and makes life miserable for those who are still living and breathing humans. Filmed in a bleak Pennsylvania during the winter of 2009-2010, it follows young Martin and his badass mentor as they escape the ravages of some unexplained bloodsucker invasion. Along the way they run into all manner of ne'er-do-wells, and some try-to-do-gooders in the form of a woman-of-the-cloth, and a young pregnant survivor. Their ride is a hulking old 1969 Mercury Marquis, which can (and does) manage to make a pancake of anything in its path (Spoiler Alert: the Mercury does die, succumbing to battery problems. This forces out troupe to walk for awhile, which is a convenient plot device).<br /><br />So far so good. The problem, as I see it, is that all of this just doesn't quite add up to the sum of its parts, much less more than that sum.  It's not so much that we've seen some of the plot devices before, it's that they are not used as effectively as they could be. For example, our coterie tunes into radio broadcasts as they cruise the barren countryside in their Merc. But unlike 28 Days Later, nothing comes of them, as if the voices on the radio were solely entertainment for a moment. The problem is not that the vamps resemble the tattered zombies from Walking Dead, but it's the blank slate regarding their origin that is never really explained. In 28 Days Later, we learn how the plague is spread from monster to human. Here, that's never made clear. How do humans get covered in vampire blood (as these characters do) and not get Turned Into One of Them? I suppose we need a good chomping bite. Yes, we saw those, but in those cases the humans died rather than being transformed into wandering evil beings.<br /><br />The acting is adequate and occasionally rises above average, as with the pregnant Danielle Harris. Writer Nick Damici doubles as the acting badass who is showing Connor Paolo's young Martin the ropes, but never adds much depth to his characterization. Paolo is an enthusiastic young disciple, but aspects of his portrayal are pallid, including narration that has just a bit too much of a 'Jeremiah' folksiness to it (this was a short-lived series from the creators of Babylon 5, focusing on migrating post-apocalyptic humans, without the gore).<br /><br />The Blu-ray disc impressively handles the dark tones of the film, and the two commentaries (one with actors, one with production and film techs) are a generous and informative bonus. Coming in with a separate Making Of and a Video Diary of the production, no one can accuse this package of being skimpy. It's just that I wish the main feature had a certain sparkle that made a more lasting impression. If by any chance you're a zombie apocalypse newbie, watch 28 Days Later instead, and consider starting on The Walking Dead series on AMC. If that's not enough world decimation for one year, you can check out Stake Land.

1118232658|5.0|4 years ago, there were almost zero strategic books on achieving business objectives via social media. Erik wrote Socialnomics, one of the first, and probably THE first with an accompanying short film.  He's one of the few constulant/author/practicioners in the space that understands enterprise AND SMB-level business objectives.<br /><br />His writing eschews flavor-of-the-week tactics and pleasant-yet-incomplete homilies for high-level strategic vision and straight-up business cases. If you need to be in charge of a bullsh*t-free social media business objective at your company, skip this book at your peril. It contains informed, up-to-date stats, and legit, clear business cases.<br /><br />It was so good I read it on PDF, okay?!
B0002IQNAG|4.0|I'm a fan of Dawn and I prefer the extended cut because the extra footage really shows a world that begins in chaos and ends in desolation.  However....on my 16&#34;x9&#34; HDTV the film is formatted incorrectly - it appears &#34;zoomed in&#34; so part of the picture is lost.  Similar to pan & scan, only not just the sides.  And I know how the film should look because I compared the DVD to my VHS extended cut that I bought back in the 90's.  Still, it's a good price for the only DVD release of the extended cut.

B007UXSPK2|4.0|Fast paced, non-stop action--just as expected. Short on believable relationships between the characters, but that isn't why you watch MI. My 11 year-old son loved it. I enjoyed it--pure entertainment and Hollywood blockbuster excitement. Yet I kept seeing Tom Cruise's character as Roy from that spy movie with Cameron Diaz--Knight and Day--so much so that I was jarred for a second when she didn't show up as his wife....I actually enjoyed the self-reflexive mockery and irony of the other role more. That's probably just me....still, by now you know what to expect from this franchise, and this installment will not disappoint you!

B001RE9HF2|5.0|This production of Handel's Giulio Cesare was recorded at Glyndebourne in 2005 and delivers a sparkling production by David McVicar and `authentic' styled performances from the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment under the knowledgeable and expert guidance of William Christie who allows himself some latitude to match the production. The cast are suitably inspired to give a memorable performance of tremendous character which resulted in rave press notices. This recorded performance fully justifies those notices to my mind.<br /><br />The production is typical of David McVicar in so far as it is lively and challenging. As such it demands a flexible approach from the viewer in terms of authenticity but probably no more than Handel himself requires in terms of his portrayal of the personal relationships and historical considerations. It is probably best to approach this as an extravagant and fun entertainment based very loosely on historical considerations but translated into some fictitious modern world of no identifiable period. On those terms it is very successful. To enlarge on this:<br /><br />In this production we witness a very free-wheeling Cleopatra portrayed with verve by Danielle de Niese. Apart from lively singing and acting she also delivers comes some highly entertaining and equally free-wheeling dance choreography. An equally spoiled, very dangerous and thoroughly `camp' Nireno, is played with enormous relish by Rachid Abdeslam. A straightforward example of total power is delivered by Sarah Connolly with a virtuoso vocal display coupled with a commanding stage presence that carries all before. There is a strong physical dimension to the production which can be summarised with Christopher Maltman's backward somersault which may be stretching authenticity a little far in terms of Achilla's real character. Needless to say there is the same licence taken with the stage backdrops which are inconsistent with any fixed historical period to say the least.<br /><br />No more examples need be made about the type of production. To criticise it for historical inaccuracy is surely to miss the point though. In this case the point is to deliver an entertainment and certainly this is entertaining as the Glyndebourne audience clearly shows. As a matter of assurance though, free-wheeling though the production most obviously is, there is nevertheless no trace of bad taste or the type of issue that is often referred to as Eurotrash.<br /><br />Musically the whole cast including the orchestra deliver faultlessly and to a uniformly high standard. The same can be said of their acting. The booklet is detailed and the disc comes with a range of extra features including an illustrated synopsis which is probably vital. There are also various image galleries and an extended 50 minute documentary which explores the notion of entertainment in the light of this opera and production.<br /><br />The actual recording is excellent with crisp and detailed imaging of good colour rendition. The sound is clear and well-balanced and is presented in PCM 5.0 and stereo options. The playing length has required the use of two discs but still provides good value.<br /><br />This has been a very entertaining and successful production at Glyndebourne and has received a great deal of press praise. The audience was equally enthusiastic and obviously felt truly entertained. The discs capture all of this to perfection so, as long as any purchaser is flexible enough to appreciate David McVicar's production on its own idiosyncratic terms, it is very likely that they will thoroughly enjoy the experience.<br /><br />I would therefore suggest that this is a performance with both high musical and entertainment values but also one that will require some flexibility on the part of viewers. Purists may not find it to their personal taste, but there will be plenty of others who will enjoy this enormously<br /><br />............................................<br /><br />Some dialogue from the comments section that may offer further help:<br /><br />Thank you so much. I would never have purchased this DVD without your review, which is beyond fabulous. I had been longing to SEE this opera. (previous upload of this U.S. review)nk you so much.

B00280LYIM|5.0|This was so good. I loved it!!!! I can't wait to get the 5th. I got it on my Kindle so the chapters seemed to take forever but when my friend lent it to me it went by so quick.
B008JFUTT0|3.0|I sprinted to the nearest movie theater immediately after reading this line from the good soldier of cinema, Mr. Roger Ebert: \\"I hope you're able to see this film... and yes, it exists because we need for it to.\\"<br /><br />It hurts to give this movie less than 5 stars because it delivered precious rewards. It introduced me to some of the greatest music to come out of possibly the greatest music-producing city. And it introduced me to the extraordinary human being who is Sixto Diaz Rodriguez.  I applaud and bow to this movie for both of those things. I am richer for it.<br /><br />I was impressed that this film was directed and edited by a first-time filmmaker because the cinematography in parts lifted the hair on my skin. He made Detroit, in its decay, look beautiful! There was such attention to detail and such aesthetic awareness in every inch of the camera's frame that parts of this movie were less like a documentary and more like an oil painting.<br /><br />Can you see my praise? It's glowing.<br /><br />Okay, now for the non-glowing stuff.<br /><br />Outside the cinematography, this movie has the scent trails of a first-time filmmaker, one who didn't know his own weaknesses. The hardest and most important element of filmmaking is editing, and that's where this movie falls short. Certain interviews hang limply from the main thread. Certain details are overcooked. Attention is given to interviewees' faces at times when our attention was supposed to have been on the music.<br /><br />Those are nitpicky criticisms, but I'm not done yet. This movie falls flat in one serious and unforgivable way.<br /><br />Rodriguez's story is so important because of (1) the extraordinary music and (2) the extraordinary man. But the focus of this movie is on neither of those things. Instead, the focus is on his huge but unknown-to-him success in South Africa, and then several South Africans' attempts to find out whatever happened to him. It's undeniably an interesting and bizarre series of events, one that provides some nice twists and crime-solving and climaxes that audiences like, but it is not a series of events that tells us about the far more compelling story: Rodriguez and his music. There are about 5 minutes devoted to how/why the music was created and about another 5 minutes devoted to how/why he has been living since the record label dropped him, and the remaining 76 minutes are devoted to the South African events.<br /><br />What makes the South African emphasis especially troubling is that its story treats external accomplishments of fame and recognition and finances and screaming audiences as the climax and resolution. These things, the movie tells us, are what Rodriguez has been spiritually lacking all his life. But one listen to \\"Like Janis\\" or \\"Cause\\" or \\"Sandrevan Lullaby\\" and the premise collapses. The message from the movie is that there's a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, but the message from Rodriguez's life is almost precisely the opposite: There is nobility in hard work and sacrifice, regardless of whether anyone notices. This movie wants us to remember Rodriguez as the poor prophet who was resurrected as a stadium-rocker playing to sold-out, raucous audiences. I'd rather remember Rodriguez as the anonymous drifter sitting next to the little furnace in his apartment, warming the walls with his music.<br /><br />***<br /><br />P.S. - Over and over again, this movie kept reminding me of [[ASIN:B005MMY7GO Bill Cunningham New York]].ries of events, one that provides some nice twists and crime-solving and climaxes that audiences like, but it is not a series of events that tells us about the far more compelling story: Rodriguez and his music.

0679746048|5.0|Read more:[...]  I swear, someday Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher will stop coming up in reviews. Probably when I stop reading books about mental illness. So, never. Anyhoo. Girl, Interrupted is where all those hard-hitting  teen issues books began.  It's not necessarily for teens, but older teens especially will find it accessible.  Written in out-of-order vignettes about Susanna's day-to-day life in the hospital, and her final release, it breathes the material it seeks to describe.  Like the author's mental state at the time, this book is fragmented. It's full of missing time and unconnected pieces.  The language is at times chillingly beautiful, at times blunt and raw.  I'll admit--I didn't even glance at the author's name when I opened it, so I didn't realize until the end the hugely important autobiographical nature of it.  And I liked that.  Because it allowed me to read it as a story, and then to re-experience it in a sudden rush as reality.  It makes you think a lot about where reality ends and story begins, and it inspired me to write again.  I hope it inspires you.    plot . 5/5  If you have a hard time following stories that aren't in chronological order, this one will drive you crazy.  Ha.  Ha.  Okay, I'm sorry, that was terrible.  Seriously, though, it confuses and annoys at some points, because it makes it hard to follow a linear narrative.  But you enjoy it, because you realize that that's the point.  Story isn't linear!  Minds aren't linear!  Susanna's life is anything but linear.  She forms connections in impressions, not in time points that happen one after one.  It becomes a sort of diary-like series of random events, a collage of vignettes that ends in one final, beautiful impression.  What struck me most was how little was described about treatment, or \\"being crazy.\\"  It was daily life.  It was being bored.  It was philosophy.  It was avoiding nurses.  It was the sanity that people don't see because they're focused on the diagnosis.  Loved it.concept . 5/5  It's a brave and wonderful thing to write a book like this.  People will revile you for it, or love you, and you can't tell which off the bat.  It's also something that somehow feels timeless.  It's very embedded in the 60s, but we know it's old-fashioned.  We know it's this author's past.  Somehow, I don't know how, but somehow it makes it feel like it could exist in any time and any place.  The idea of just focusing on hospital years isn't new--Kesey did it, etc.--but the way it's structured with the non-linear narrative makes it a perfect representation of mental illness about mental illness.  Form fits function.    characters . 5/5  These are all real people.  Even the ones you hear little about feel like fully-fledged humans.  You don't get nearly all of their stories, but you feel like you know these girls.  They're clever.  They're funny.  They're irritating and moronic in the most interesting of ways.  Susanna herself is often a quiet observer, adding little to the action, but you come to know her through every word.  Her voice takes over.  I really wanted to know these girls--even the ones who scared me.    style . 5/5  A painting in words.  Seriously.  It's not flowery or overly ornate at all.  It's just beautiful.  Susanna sees the world in such a different way.  Her worldview takes over everything she talks about and makes even the most commonplace activities new.  I read the last page almost ten times, the last two paragraphs, because they were so perfect.  Every word exactly where it needed to be.  A collage of images.  I could gush about this forever.  It was just beautiful.  Atmospheric.  Dark.  Humorous.  Amazing.    mechanics . 5/5  The inclusion of scanned medical documents was a great touch.  It makes you realize how differently these papers and the doctors see Susanna's world, compared to how she sees it.    take home message  A must-read for anyone interested in mental health, or the human condition.  A beautiful example of prose.

B000002MFE|5.0|Eric at his best,shining his blues roots on acoustic-a must have for any E.C. fans.Whether you loved him with Cream or Solo projects,this collection shows his true love and ability to be a bonafide BLUES MAN.
B00007G1ZC|5.0|The general sentiment about this movie is that it is visually beautiful but lacking a coherent story. It's pointless, some say. I profoundly disagree.<br /><br />There are movies that are purely escapist pleasure (\\"pointless\\"), there are movies that try to cram an overt \\"point\\" down your throat, and there are the precious few movies that neither try to please you nor make a \\"point\\" but rather put themselves at the service of images. This is one of those precious few movies. In it, Kurosawa puts himself at the service of 8 of his most compelling dreams, bringing them to cinematic life. He doesn't know what they mean, but he knows they're meaningful. As all art should be.<br /><br />I saw this movie 4 years ago and it remains the movie I would least like to un-see. As a kid who was raised on 1990's American TV and movie culture, I had never seen anything like it. It lifted me into a land of subconscious images that is deeper and truer than anything you will find in a coherently-structured plot.<br /><br />(If you're looking for something like it, try [[ASIN:B000059PPP Fata Morgana]]. Almost all of Werner Herzog's movies are like Dreams, but especially Fata Morgana.)

B0055EAJ7A|5.0|Great movie, I've been waiting for something like this!! I am looking forward to a sequel. The actors were great!!
1439152802|5.0|The book started a bit slow for me.  (Although, that has been the case with all of Kate Morton's books.)  Somehow though, (as with her other books) as I continued to read, the story slowly reached out and grabbed me.  I loved the intricacy of the story.  All the tiny pieces that come together over time.  This is a book to ponder long after you have read it.  I'm already looking forward to Morton's next book.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really enjoy this game and all of the different options they give you to choose from. Highly suggest to others to play.
B008VNIBFO|5.0|This film seems to be held in quite high regard amongst classic older films, it deserves it. It's a captivating story and in many ways mirrors Gloria Swanson's actual life... I'm glad I bought this. The film is kind of faded in certain scenes which is always unfortunate, but it doesn't detract from the film experience. Great acting, great story decent extra content.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I got this as a gift for someone, but they seemed to like it so there ya go. I should have bought it for myself though...
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  THere is a point towards the end that the author makes about marriage that is brilliant.  Worth the read for sure.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|&#34;Fringe&#34; science is fascinating & keeps my interest by evolving the story as it continues. I highly recommend it to those of you who love good science fiction as much as I do.
B0063IH60K|4.0|this is a great game, plays well on my kindle, it also has a play by play option to teach u each u dont know how to play.Plus it was free u can't beat that :))))))))))
B001ECQ75A|5.0|But then I saw this movie in theaters and was blown away. It's funny, yes, but so much more than that. There are many things about this film that I appreciate, such as the fact that all characters in the movie are endemic Chinese species, that the music is delightfully correlated to the film's visuals, and that watching Po's struggle, and more importantly, the struggle of a weathered but wise Master Shifu, was on a psychological level very interesting. I felt that the pace of their turnarounds were realistic, and it all came together in the end. Po may be fat, but it makes sense that a thick-skinned panda would be required to defeat Tai Lung because apparently the layers of adipose protect him from the villain's famed nerve attacks.<br /><br />All around this is a great flick, not for its humor alone, but also its visuals, poignant music, and heartwarming story.
030759565X|5.0|This is a fabulous book!  The recipes are ALL delicious looking and simple to do.  She keeps it real and understands what it's like for a real home cook with maybe not a lot of space, a lot of tools, or a lot of time.  Simple, delicious, and something for everyone!!
B002E2QHBS|5.0|Loved the movie.  I was stationed in Karamursel Turkey while in the Air Force then.  When the movie came to base I think I saw it 6 times while it was there.  I like the movie better than the CD.  I highty recommend this to anyone that love the music from that era.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|This was a really fun game, and also my first Big Fish game.  I tried another game after this and it didnt even compare! Great graphics and steady gameplay.  I am looking forward to part 2.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|Best movie in the whole darn world. I never get tired of watching it. I saw it 7 times in theaters and countless more times at home.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The story pulls you in right away, I can't wait to read the next two books, I've just got to know how it all comes out.
B001NXDSLG|5.0|I love this movie/film and the music in it.  The original movie didn't show all the perfomers that were.  I finally got to see Janis Joplin perform at Woodstock.  I can't tell you how many times I've seen this movie.  It never grows old.  I recommend it for anyone that was old enough to remember that great event.  It will never happen like that again.
B0086700CM|4.0|I do not regret purchasing this game! The controls are simple, I love the realistic tilting and movement. The pace is fast enough to keep the game intense and even addictive but not too fast that someone who is not a hard core gamer like myself would get frustrated.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|played on facebook and liked it..love it even better on my kindle...my 5 yr oldlikes it too..just run out of energy to fast!!!
B000AM6OQ2|4.0|Antonio Bay is celebrating its 100th anniversary. It should be a great day, but it's gonna suck! A dense fog rolls through the bay and into the town. Not being able to see is bad enough, but this fog also harbors an evil that will consume everything that it touches. The spirits of murdered sailors rampage across the village taking revenge on the inhabitants. The townsfolk must solve the crime and rectify the mistake or suffer a terrible death.<br /><br />This is a great horror movie. I wouldn't really call it scary, but it is a bit creepy. I love the atmosphere this movie creates. Many old films provide a dark and haunting backdrop that is lost in most modern horror movies. The Fog is a classic that should be watched by every fan of the genre.
B009CGGHL4|4.0|Not a serous Zombie movie, but still plenty of blood and guts. Shaun may even be a metaphor for dead end jobs and walking through life like a mindless zombie, but who cares. The movie is fun, the jokes work, and they beat a zombie to \\"death\\" it time to a Queen song
B004H1YH66|5.0|No composer has ever achieved the epic heights of Basil Poledouris' M-A-S-S-I-V-E score to Conan the Barbarian. This is a score so masculine it will increase your sperm count just by playing a random track. Trouble impregnating the wife? Pop on the thunderous, breathtaking sounds of 'Anvil of Crom' and she'll be carrying your twins by the end of the night. Just be careful you don't keep it playing during intercourse, you might break her.<br /><br />But the beauty of this score isn't just in it's powerful, awe-inspiring tracks. One of the best moments in the film, and in Poledouris' career is the grand, operatic 'The Orgy'. It's not just the highlight of highlights in Conan the Barbarian, it's probably one of the greatest pieces of music ever written. I'm not kidding, it's right up there with Moonlight Sonata by Beethoven, or Symphony No. 9, or Vivaldi's Four Seasons. It's such a beautiful, graceful, balletic piece. Whenever I hear it just don't want it to end.<br /><br />When recording for the actual movie Poledouris was limited by time and budget constraints and was not happy with the sound quality or orchestrations for the score used in the movie. All previous issues on CD were taken from these recordings. This CD features a brand new re-recording by the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Nic Raine with the full orchestration as originally intended by Poledouris. It's a shame he never lived to see it happen.<br /><br />I have no idea what CD the negative reviews here are on about. The sound quality of this CD is far, far, far superior to anything released by MCA or Milan in the past. For a fan of Conan, the movie, the score, of Poledouris, or of music in general, this 114-minute 2-disc release from Prometheus Records is an absolute must have.
B0060D3BWK|5.0|we have seen this movie several times and finally bought it for the kids.  The twins (3 years old) were a bit scared of it during the first part, but by the time the movie arrived at modern times everyone (including the 8 year old boy) thought it was great.  We are glad to have our own version of it now.d
B00005ATQD|4.0|Dr. Harford is thrown into a dark sex obsessed world that threatens to ruin his rocky marriage, and could cost him his life.<br />I know that sounds like a vague synopsis, but that's what this movie is about. It's almost like a documentary about a theoretical cult. I don't doubt that something like this movie actually takes place, and that makes it even more impacting. The movie is very tense. It does have bright colors and a few satirical overtones, that may make it seem a bit over the top, but it's also a very realistic and believable story. I've only seen a few films that made me more uncomfortable and doubtful than Eyes Wide Shut. That's how Kubrick's movies are though. If you don't mind the perversion and strangeness then this movie may entertain you.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Ultimately, the best way to use Facebook is on a laptop, PC, etc. This app is horrible. If you want to use FB on an Android device, use the free version of Friendcaster, it's not perfect but way better than this app. How can a company &quot;worth&quot; a billion dollars not be able to create a functioning app for its own website?
B008MU8ZOI|3.0|By 2001 the resurgence of slasher movies had fortunately died down and audiences were in the mood for something new. Jeepers Creepers is a return to the old-fashioned monster movies in the style of classic Universal. Those were movies built on suspense and atmosphere rather than gore and multiple kills.<br /><br />Justin Long and Gina Philips play Darry and Trish, a pair of argumentative siblings who are traveling home through the Florida backwaters for spring break. Along the way they are terrorized by an unseen figure driving a ugly truck. Darry sees the figure dumping what appears to be dead bodies into a pipe by an abandoned church. In a moment of agonizing plot contrivance Darry turns around and heads back to find out what's really going on, unawares that he'll give the villain a taste of his fear, thus making him a marked man.<br /><br />Victor Salva layers the movie with homosexual and incestuous subtext, while keeping the monster in the dark for the most part, building fear and mystery about him. The Creeper is a great villain and Salva builds an intriguing mythology about him.<br /><br />The swift running time (the credits roll at the 85 minute mark) prevents things from getting deep or expansive but the sequel builds upon this world and is actually a better movie despite the hate. On its own Jeepers Creepers is an effective but superficial. Plenty of points for being original however.<br /><br />The Blu-ray is in 1.85:1 1080p and it is an improvement on the DVD, however there are just a few too many scenes shot in soft focus which don't give it much of a pop. The black levels are impressive though. It sounds better in DTS HD-MA, and all the extras from the DVD have been ported over.
B009AJDDQU|1.0|My wife was the smart one and slept through most of it.<br /><br />There are so many memorably dumb things in this movie. The characters spend at least 45 minutes of the running time walking through the same 3 tunnels looking at stuff. A lady scientist cuts her belly all the way across, including her uterus, pulls out a huge alien, then gets stapled together and walks around like she hasn't just had major surgery. Another scientist plays with a threatening snake alien like it's a squirrel, then is completely shocked when it eats his face off. And, to top it all off, there's a young actor inexplicably made up in the worst old man makeup I've seen since Ed Wood was alive. Instead of using an actual older actor, the director made up his nephew or something to play the part.<br /><br />It's not the dollar and a half I wasted renting it that drove me to Amazon to post a review, it was the 2 hours of my life I will never get to live over.
B00005R23Z|5.0|Anton is a man that is sure to rise to the top. The problem is he isn't who they think he is. In a world controlled by genetics only the elite can succeed. One man decides he will achieve his dreams even if he has to lie to do it. He meets a woman who is in a similar situation. The fall in love, but have they fallen in love with a lie. Will the achieve their dreams together, or will they be cast out of society and never find happiness.<br /><br />This movie is an amazing amazing drama. Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, and Jude Law play amazing roles. This is a very tense, emotional, and touching movie. It is one of those that really inspires you to do your best. The production quality is great, the story is original, the dialogue, is incredible, and the emotions overflow. Gattaca is an unforgettable movie. You can't miss it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely love Pinterest. I think the Android app works way better than the PC version. Other apps are updating &amp; becoming more integrated with Pinterest, like ChefTap...touch a pin you want to repin, touch share and then choose ChefTap and Viola! The recipe is now in your ChefTap recipe box. Also, now it is simply one tap and you can save the picture in the pin to your device, no need to open a browser and go to the original source. New feature: you can create up to 3 secret boards that only you can see...as the app states, one idea for this is to save pins for possible gift ideas but you followers cannot see this board and so you can keep your gift ideas secret. I just have so much fun with this app.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I would recommend this novel to anyone who has a time issue in everyday life. I think the ending was perfect!!
B000IZ4R1U|2.0|Not a bad movie but not very good either. The accents are bad and the plot worse. If you want to see plenty of bouncing breast then you won't be disappointed. But if you expect more from a movie then watch something else.
B00005R87Q|2.0|This movie is about an FBI agent that goes undercover to expose a street racing gang for stealing electronics. They use the stolen electronics to get money enough to trick out their cars. That's pretty much the plot.<br /><br />I don't like this movie for 2 major reasons. Firstly, the film itself is bad. The acting and plot are poorly done, the saving grace of this film is the intense action. This movie also created a new counter culture of guys that drive like maniacs in their economy cars. These people are everywhere in their Civics painted ridiculous colors and raising hell sounding like weed eaters on steroids. These things added together make this a bad film. It's poor acting and plot, along with its negative impact on society, in my opinion make this a crappy movie. I know that movies are usually rated on their cinematic quality. This film had descent action and some good special effects, but that's it. The coolest things about this movie were the Dodge Charger and the Toyota Supra. Those 2 cars were awesome. As for the tricks they perfomed, most of them are impossible. As an automotive technician I found myelf laughing at some of the things they portrayed the cars doing. All in all this movie was really thin. It's not worth owning.
030758836X|1.0|Maybe it was creative, maybe it represents something about the darker nature of humanity.  Thank goodness no one I know.  I didn't find it very compelling, just repellant.  Skipped over huge amounts to read the ending. Also a disappointment.
B005ZKYXZI|5.0|this movie is not just for kids!  truly inspiring, moving, and exciting movie.  bravo<br /><br />think rocky, but updated.  watch this movie!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Enjoyable game to pass the time. Works perfectly with absolutely no issues on the kindle fire. I needed a game I could pick up or drop quickly without feeling like I was missing something and this is just that kind of game.
B0002DKCMQ|4.0|Eurotrip is a tasteless and ridiculous comedy. It is about a group of 4 friends that go on a trip across Europe in order to find Scotty Thomas' pen pal girlfriend. The foursome goes through all kinds of crazy stuff and causes lots of trouble all the way from France to Amsterdam. The movie is raunchy, perverted, and stupid; but I really liked it. It made me laugh like a maniac, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you've seen any other National Lampoons films then you know what you're gonna get. Pure silliness, and enjoyment.
B000AYEL6U|4.0|A little darker than Jane Austen, but very enjoyable.  Shades of pride and Prejudice, but shows that not all rich were landed gentry.  Great job with the sets.  Loved the casting.
B008L1VZS6|5.0|I have been listening to the 1974 Philips recording of this neglected Verdi opera for many years now. I love the music and I always wondered why it was such a fiasco at the time it was first performed. The chance to finally see (as well as hear) Un Giorno Di Regno in this splendid production has given me new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of this early gem of Verdiana.<br /><br />In Un Giorno Di Regno, the young Verdi writes at full throttle with a passion that only he can muster. Unfortunately, the libretto of this opera buffa by the superb Felice Romani can hardly contain the excitement. Music of this sort works wonderfully well in Verdi's next opera, Nabucco, which is full of biblical superdrama. And it carries early Verdi operas such as I Lombardi and Ernani because of their melodramatic intensity. But poor Un Giorno Di Regno, a comic opera in spite of its description \\"melodramma giocoso in due atti,\\" collapses under the weight of the young Verdi's furious composition.<br /><br />Still, I give this production 5 stars. Why? Because it makes the very best of an unfortunate situation--an opera whose effervescent melodies are exciting, imaginative and yet fundamentally unsuited to its lighthearted subject matter.<br /><br />Bravos to Maestro Renzetti and to the Orchestra and Chorus of the Teatro Regio Di Parmi. The staging, set and costumes are exactly right. And the principals sing with the kind of passion and professionalism that the young Verdi would have approved of wholeheartedly.<br /><br />Now that I have seen Un Giorno Di Regno, I love it even more. But I understand why it is not the opera Verdi hoped it would be. Many years would pass before Verdi learned how to handle comedy -- in La Forza del Destino, for example, and, of course, in his comic masterpiece Falstaff.
B002PMPTIO|1.0|I am a huge Star Trek fan but I can't even stomach these actors. Makes me sick even thinking about it. An orgiginal movie with all new characters or a movie based on one of the television shows no named The Next Generation would have been awesome..
B000JM645E|4.0|Emily Rose is a normal teenager. She was possessed by a demon, and nearly killed. In an attempt to clear the priest that helped Emily, a woman researches the subject and is awakened to the terrifying truth that demons exist and are not a good thing.<br /><br />This movie has a pretty good cast with some familiar faces. The movie itself is about the court case surrounding the circumstances of Emily's exorcism. The priest is being sued for negligence, and he is clearly innocent. We all know that the justice system functions poorly, and sometimes injustice is rendered. This is one such example. The film is very powerful. It has some graphic and frightening situations. The box says that is as scary as The Exorcist. That isn't true....it's not even close. But don't let that turn you off of it. This movie stands by itself and is a very good watch. I think it's a good choice for a person that can handle the subject matter. If you don't mind films about this sort of thing then you will probably enjoy this movie.
B0098VYKSA|1.0|This movie was horrible. The acting was horrible. The story was horrible. The ending was horrible. It was like they gave 30% effort into making this movie. The \\"actress\\" that plays Snow White has no emotions except blah. Yes I know her name, but typing it makes me angry at this movie. Charlize Theron who is a great actress must have been quite drunk/drugged when she agreed to help make this steam pile.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|Can someone tell me if the SB700 works for nikon D3200...I completely love that camera and that speedlight, but I don't see any information about the question I asked...would somebody help me with this?
B0055SWM08|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It's simple, challenging, and well-designed. It doesn't hang or force quit on my Samsung Galaxy S. Well done.
B0000524CY|5.0|If you have seen this movie in the past, then you have probably lost sleep because of it. What makes this movie so terrifying is that it's a true story. A medical student at George Washington stumbled across the records of a male who had apparently been possessed by a demon. The entire movie isn't all fact, but some of the supernatural and inexplicable things that happened; like the room  being freezing cold and furniture floating and flying across the room, were actually documented in a patients medical records. This may seem irrelevant, but I think knowing this makes the film and the novel exponentially more frightening.<br /><br />Now that I've said that I have to say that this version of the movie is definitely different from the original. Some scenes are added for shock factor and suspense. The score seems to have been redone, and there are some added scene. The movie is definitely scarier and more powerful than the 1973 release. If you don't have this film and are considering buying it, this is a good version to have.
B006G2ZEV6|5.0|LOVE IT LOVE IT AWSOME GREAT CAMPAIGN STORY LINE IS GREAT 11BIT DID A AMZING JOB ON THIS ONE OVER ALL GREAT APP
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|Great movie, great amazon service, very affordable too!  Love the stream quality and will rent many movies again.  Highly suggest this service to others.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This is just brilliant!!!!  Love the backstory youtube video of the cantina scene; Pickles heehee. Game play is great not as frustrating as seasons. Love all of the characters.  They outdid themselves this time maybe a lord of the rings will be next?
B0009RCPY8|5.0|When I was a child my 4 favorite things were MOM and Dad, Ninja Turtles, and The Ghostbusters. These 2 movies had a huge impact on many young people in my age group and beyond. This is a very good DVD set. It contains both full length movies, commentary, deleted scenes, a movie scrapbook, and 2 animated episodes. This is a very comprehensive set with 2 movies that defined my generation, and made millions of people laugh till their sides hurt. If you like Ghostbusters this is a must have collection.
B009YQJ322|5.0|When I first heard of this film I was not excited. But then I watched it, and WOW it was amazing. It has everything an action movie should have plenty of blood, good one liners, Amazing fight scenes, and most importantly great acting and a storyline you can easily follow. This film is what Judge Dredd is, not that cheap dumb ass film that Sylvester Stallone was in. But sadly we will never see a sequel because not many people went and watched it. I blame it on the original and Lionsgate. Anyways I highly recommend this film.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Riviting!  Couldn't put it down. Can't wait for the next one to be released! Reflected was well worth the wait.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I read this book in September at my daughter's home in Virginia and loved it. When I got home, I downloaded the kindle version of Winter of the World, the second book of the Century Trilogy. So that I could own both books, I downloaded Fall of Giants on kindle and I am in the process of re reading it. The book is beautifully written and the characters are very real.
B000NA28I4|4.0|In an industry filled with half-baked Sci-fi movies, Eragon is a breath of fresh air. It is the tale of a boy who finds a dragon egg. When the egg hatches he finds a wonderful friend in Saphira. The kingdom is ruled by a tyrannical dragon rider. The king murdered all the known dragons and riders so that he could not be challenged. When he learns that a new dragon and rider have appeared he sends his evil sorcerer to kill them, but Eragon and Saphira make it to a fortress controlled by the only remaining people who dare to fight for their freedom. A terrible battle soon begins.<br /><br />This movie is very good. It has good actors, special effects, soundtrack, and a well done screenplay. I think that the weakest part of this movie is the ending. The ending pretty much states that there will be a sequel, without just flat out saying it verbally. At the time I'm writing this review the film is almost 7 years old. That's a long time to leave fans hanging. I know that there are several books that go beyond the material in the movie. I hope they actually make another Eragon movie. I'm sorry I rambled. I'm trying to say that this movie is really good, deserves a chance. It's a pretty mild movie as far as objectionable content is concerned, so you can watch it with the kids. It's a perfect movie for family night.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This is the story of Bruce Wayne. This is the story of BATMAN.<br /><br />THE DARK KNIGHT RISES is not just a triumphant film, but the the third part of an epic odyssey. The themes of fear, chaos, and pain as embodied by Ra's al Ghul, the Joker, and now Bane, are the catalysts that turn tragedy into the ultimate victory and redemption of one man who chooses to fight crime and corruption dressed as a bat. Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale once again take us on a journey that is both thrilling and thought provoking. As always, the acting is top tier, and the level of respect shown to the Batman mythology is something to be admired. Drawing inspiration from the comics, graphic novels, and even classic literature, this is a Batman film the likes of which will probably never be seen again. Dark and adult in nature, expect WB to go a more \\"family friendly\\" route with their next Bat-series.<br /><br />So sit back and enjoy the magnificent conclusion to the greatest trilogy in film history (sorry Frodo.)
B0083SBMBM|5.0|As I have told friends, I don't watch a lot of movies.  I've never been one to hang on the edge of my seat for what new movie hollywood will put out next.  This movie, however, has captured top ranking in my personal opinion.<br /><br />The characters are well rounded, and the interactions betwen them are both logical and essential to the story itself.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to anyone, whether they are a fan of Marvel Comics or not; it is simple a great movie.
0425263916|4.0|Started out kind of slow and thought I wasn't going to like it but it ended up being a great book!!  Can't wait until the 3rd one comes out!!
B00003CXA6|5.0|I'm not a Braves fan, I don't watch CNN, and I never liked the WCW, but I would like to thank Ted Turner for this masterpiece. This is a film that chronicles the events surrounding the bloodiest battle in American history. This movie has a boatload of incredible actors, amazing drama, and a legendary soundtrack. This film is too amazing for words. It's simply breathtaking. The tragedy and the eternal impact on the most powerful nation on Earth are undeniable. This film gives a lot of insight into what motivated the men that fought for our future at Gettysburg Pennsylvania. It was filmed on sight at the actual locations of the series of battles at Gettysburg. This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It clocks in at 254 minutes. This gives it a very epic feel. It is a very impactful film. If there is anyone out there who hasn't seen Gettysburg. You need to buy it and watch it as soon as possible.<br /><br />I thought that I might add a little comedic tidbit to an otherwise serious film. Every time I see Jeff Daniels I can't get the image of him getting his tongue stuck on the frozen ski lift in Dumb and Dumber out of my head. When I see him give his amazing monologue I am almost moved to tears... that is until I recall that hilarious image.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Racketeer definitely held my interest, I could hardly put it down. It has a surprising ending and also a creative plot.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|I felt as though this movie should have been done in 3D to begin with.I felt that in the begining of the movie the 3D effects are pretty good (not as great as you might think)but because the movie itself is so immersive on its own that you sometimes overlook the fact that they were kinda cheap/stingy with the 3D effects in the middle of the movie as well as the end. Overall,<br />any 3D effect that is done to a movie like this (no matter how little) is always going to enhance the experience....
0425263908|2.0|I didn't really like this book.  Started out way too much like Fifty Shades of Grey. The only reason I went on to read the 2nd one was because I had pre-ordered it but I liked that one better.
B002NXSRVG|4.0|When I was a kid I spent a lot of my time playing with and watching G.I. Joe. I am so glad that they made a live action movie. This film is everything I expected it to be. It has pretty good acting, amazing special effects, and tons of action. Although this is one of those guilty pleasures films, it's also quite memorable. At least memorable enough to warrant a sequel. This is the beginning of a legendary fighting force that inspired and entertained millions of people. G.I. Joe is what one would call a masterpiece, but it's definitely an unforgettable movie.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|The Lorax is my family's movie, so I was very glad to see it on here. The quality was good and there were no glitches. Definitely recommend it :)
B009NQKPUW|3.0|I am not a fan of Charlize but if you are, it's more of a cameo appearance. There are very few movies I would pay to see in the theaters. This one really should only be seen if it is free. More recycled storylines with mediocre acting.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Nothing I have read or viewed has come even close to the \\"proof\\" that the author of this book portrays.  \\"Proof Of Heaven\\" truly is PROOF that Heaven exists.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The book is well written. It keeps you coming back to see what is happening next. The trilogy is very good.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|ONCE, AGAIN NELSON DE MILLE HAS WRITTEN AN INTERESTING NOVEL THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF WHAT WE ARE FACING TODAY AS A NATION. IT RELATES TO OUR CURRENT EVENTS.  INTRIUGUE, HUMOR AND MYSTERY ARE THE KEY INGREDIENTS FOR \\"THIS HARD TO PUT DOWN\\" NOVEL. ONCE I STARTED READING I DIDN'T WANT TO STOP.  I LOVED THE CHARACTERS. THE STORY IS ONE THAT ENLIGHTENS THE READER AS TO WHAT OUR INTELLIGIENCE COMMUNITY IS FACED WITH.  THERE'S NO DOUBT, IT IS A CHALLENGE FOR THE CHARACTERS TO FULFILL THEIR COMMITTMENT TO THEIR CHOSEN PROFESSION AND MISSION JUST AS OUR REAL DEDICATED SECURITY PEOPLE ARE.
B004TI5N38|3.0|Enjoyed the book, was left uncertain as to the ending; what happened? It felt unfinished. I really was left wondering if he was dead or alive or what the heck just happened? Where's the last page?
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I didn't think I would enjoy this one, but I was very wrong! Flow Free keeps my attention for way too long!!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|It was awesome and worth every penny, I stayed up all night playing it. It was so awesome and I LOVEDit!
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved it cannot wait for the next one. It is going to be hard to wait.  The characters are addicting
B0076DCT2G|3.0|This is not his best book. If he left out all of John's wisecracks, it would be only half as long. The story is good, however, just not one of his better books.
B008PE9GSA|5.0|Been a very long time ZZ Top fan. Disappointed in the recording of this CD. The recording level was past distortion on a couple of the songs. I thought it was the CD I received and got a replacement from Amazon. Second one was the same. Playing on my IPod thru bluetooth headphones those songs are tolerable but thru a car or home stereo system they are rough. Their music has that gravel quality I enjoy but a couple of the songs are way past that. Still recommend for the true fans.
B008GFI418|5.0|I have been studying the work of George Martin most of my life ...this film truly filled me in on the life of a true wizard.....Thank You for creating this excellently produced profile.
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|What is there not to like about Edinburgh's famously grumpy, contrary, IPA guzzling detective? The best thing is that he is back. This book is a good read and something of a page turner. On the other hand, isn't the dialogue a little less sparkling and Rebus a little older and a little softer round the edges? And reduced to nicking staplers? Most Rebus stories are so strong in dialogue and repartee that they had me chuckling away. Not this one - only a couple of chuckles to be honest. If you are new to Ian Rankin's fiction, begin with the first Rebus books and try to get then in sequence as the back story evolves. You definitely don't want to miss this latest installment but it does not quite rank up there with Ian Rankin's greatest.
B003XRELGQ|5.0|This book, with the possible exception of Slaughterhouse Five, is Vonnegut's masterpiece. Vonnegut was deeply disturbed by the fire-bombing of Dresden during the second world war (he was there as a POW) and by the atom bombing of Hiroshima/Nagasaki.To him God died in the fireball and the mushroom cloud. What disturbed him even more than the incidents themselves, terrible though they were, was the general apathy which prevailed among so may people at the time and subsequently. This book is therefore a satire on both science gone mad and deep religious belief. Written in his inimitable flippant style, the story is apparently ridiculous but on a deeper level it hits home with the force of a sledgehammer. Short chapters, some of only a few pages,and masterful writing keep the pages turning. To me it is five stars, or six if possible, but if you are a believer in the fundamental goodness of man or of any religious conviction do NOT read Cat's Cradle.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I just downloaded it last night and then I couldn't stop playing it.  Super addictive!!!!  It also gets harder as you go through it.
B009CGYO0K|3.0|I really did enjoy this humorous book.  It is a nice collection of comics, though it is not really a good format for the Kindle Fire.  I read it on my Kindle for PC so that the images were large enough to see and appreciate.
0891419063|5.0|It is not often I have to put down a book momentarily because I am overcome with emotion. This story of our Marines giving their all for each other and their country, told with openness, honesty, and without bombast, has affected me in that way not once but a number of times. E. B. Sledge came through the fierce fighting against the Japanese on the Pacific islands of Peleliu and Okinawa, without being wounded although not without the deeper scars only troops who have been in combat can attest to. The book is more a tribute to his comrades and the Marine Corps than it is a history of the war. Sledge tells us that \\"war is brutish, inglorious, and a horrible waste\\". This book is the basis of the HBO miniseries, The Pacific.
B002ZG974M|5.0|I have shown this video to various classes (global studies, human development, etc.) and it has been a great tool for students to gain insights into conditions/cultures around the world.  Also great to see how human development is so similar across cultures, despite the cultural differences. Student feedback has always been very positive and the video sparks great discussion.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Proof of Heaven was interesting but not what I expected. I was somewhat disappointed in the book as it had a lot of technical information. Not a bad book but I found it rather dull.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I hope you find this as fascinating as I did! Very much worth the read -- this can be a life changer! Not like other books on the subject. Really enjoyed this.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great book.  Good characters.  It is suspenseful to the end.  I read it in two days.  I would recommend this book to all.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great Value!  DVD, Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D and Digital Copy!!! What else could you ask for!  The 3D was amazing!  Not the in-your-face kind of 3D. Very well done.
B001QWBM62|3.0|The software people were very responsive when I contacted them and immediately sent me an activation number so I can get on with trying the software with the unit.  After I use both software and unit I will update this review once more.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|This show is so addictive you just can't hardly wait for the next episode, I am truly hooked....I love it.
B001VZY4M8|5.0|I didn't own a record player but loved music and bought this album in 1971 (from Richard Branson's first record shop where I had gone to get a bootleg or two, they had one from Crazy Horse). NME had listed Goldrush as one of their albums of the year, and on listening to it in the shop I agreed.<br /><br />It IS a wonderful album and I have never fallen out of love with it. It had some tracks which were dangerously melancholy for a teenager, including one of my favourites, the under-celbrated beautiful \\"I Believe In You\\".
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|you run out of energy, then you either have to wait for it to give more energy or you have to buy it, which in this case is really retarded, and glitches out on you, but if it didn't have those problems it would be really fun!
B009WO7NQO|1.0|I erased this cause it was lagging and the extra levels for 1.99, making me have to buy it again!! what the crape.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I REALLY ENJOYED THIS ALBUM . THIS ARTIST IS GREAT , HE HAS GREAT LYRICS AND GREAT RHYTHM IN HIS SONGS . I AM GLAD TO BE ABLE TO HEAR A NEW VOICE WHO IS REALLY TIMELESS . GET THIS MAN'S WORK AND ENJOY LISTENING TO SOME PHENOMENAL MUSIC !
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|Love this game because it keeps your mind working with fun action. If you like numbers, strategy, and action, you will not be disappointed.
0307346617|5.0|Its easy to love a book that is already popular, because so many other people have already vetted it for you, though I think that WWZ stands above the pack because even if it was a small press offering I think it would still have exploded. Its that good. I loved the multitude of perspectives used in the approach to a global zombie apocalypse, which made WWZ and fantastic complementary text to the author's first book (The Zombie Survival Guide) which of course had the cut & dry textbook style. I believe that this is a unique approach to zombie fiction that clearly establishes his works as foundations for the ever-expanding zombie fiction genre. While many other stories/novels will center on a small group of characters (or just one) and take them through adventure after adventure, trial after trail, and while I love those books also, WWZ (and the survival guide) have a subtext of realism that sets them apart. It truly does feel more like journalism and textbook writing than fiction, regardless of the fact that we all know we are reading fiction. With a healthy suspension of disbelief on the part of the reader these books (esp WWZ) carry an undertone of real-world terror that so many other works of fiction simply cannot convey because they are indeed written as fiction. Yes I know I'm getting all 'meta' with this review, but that is the chief strongpoint of the work (in addition to just being a great book) and the reason for me giving it 5 stars.
B008OOYALE|5.0|this is the best game i have played in a very very long time and thank you for the great game
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is really handy to have.  I use it to calculate everything from my nursing formulas to my budget.  It is also useful when I need to calculate percentages.
B000IQIXOG|5.0|For one album this is packed full of great songs. It is a Musical Masterpiece! Greatest Hit albums are Okey, but I prefer to listen to the Albums that the Hits came from. You will find a lot of great songs never included on those Greatest hit records. This is one of those albums that is so good it just stands alone. and taken as a whole rather than being cut up into a greatest hit album. Jeff Lynne is one of the most talented people in the music industry of all time. He not only is a former but has help produce many great albums, His performaces in &#34;The Concert for George&#34; A tribute to George Harrison was awesome! He also recorded and ferfomed with The Taveling Wilberys. I first heard this album back in the late 70s. All my friends had the 8 track version and we listened to it all the time. I also got the record album and then when the CD became available , I had to get it too! After all these years I still prefer to listen the the record and have now began to rebuy other records. I just think the records have a richer sound. and CDs just don't carry the depth of tones the a record produces.
B00962341U|5.0|Leona only gets better with time! All of the songs on this album are awesome...her voice is top-notch! This album will definitely bring her back to the mainstream! God bless you Leona ...keep being you: beautiful and awesome! Strongly recommend this album!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book, well written and very entertaining to read.  It gave a first hand account of a very important event in our country's history.  I would definitely read more by this first time author.
B006LSZECO|5.0|By the end of the book I didn't know which character I disliked more. I wanted to like the husband but he seemed so indecisive and when the &#34;real&#34; wife showed up ( though anticipated) she was totally manipulative and completely nasty. So nasty you almost admired her. Almost.
B007OWRBJK|2.0|I believe that Pete Townsend if one of the most brilliant Songwriters, Composers and Writers in our time. Here he wrestles with his childhood and the aftermath of those experiences throughout his whole life. An interesting glimpse to be sure. But honestly, not one that this fan gave a dang about. Purchase at your own risk. Too much whine, not enough cheese.
B009PJAC5K|5.0|I have seen and owned all the episodes of TBBT on Amazon. This one is most hilarious episode in TBBT to this day. Worth buying it. Period
B00243FQFA|5.0|So its no surprise that I should like Stargate Atlantis.  If you like Stargate Atlantis, then you'll like the way this season runs.  It picks up exactly where season 4 left off.  Oddly enough, season 5 has my favorite episode &#34;Las Vegas&#34;.  I say &#34;oddly enough&#34;, because that episode supposedly takes place in a parallel universe, so after 5 years of Stargate Atlantis, I end up liking the show that has the least to do with Atlantis.  Its a great show though, and if you're a Joe Flanagan fan, then you'll really like the Las Vegas episode!  In fact, after I finish this review, I'm going to go watch it!  :)
B008O9V4C2|5.0|This is Donald's best solo work for sure. The grooves are great, the writing is superb. The horn arrangements (my favorite is Miss Marlene) are really good. Just a great album, highly recommended.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|Kiss once again prove why they have been around for 40 years.<br /> Classic Kiss sound that rocks from the opening note to the last!<br />A must have for a Kiss fan, a must have for a rock fan, And a must have for a music fan!
B008LP8QE8|5.0|Full text of reference book.  This is one of the most complete reference books for the internist.  Excellent reference book
B00015HVI8|5.0|There is a reason why this was the longest running sci-fi show in TV history.  Its a great show, its actually the only show that I own on DVD.  Season 6 is the one without Daniel Jackson.
0345803485|5.0|I can't wait to read the second book. Once you get further into the the book it will have you wanting to be a part of the story!!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I like this author. The first book I read of hers was Gone Girl.  I thought it was great and decided to buy her other books like this one and Dark Places.  This book touches in things in our childhood days we all would rather forget.  Kids can be cruel.
B008XFAT7S|5.0|If you're looking for a martial arts, action, blood bath, kick-ass-athone, then look no further. The Raid: Redemption is just such a movie with some of the best choreographed action sequences I've ever seen. If you enjoyed Ip Man and the like then be sure to check this one out. Some will criticize this movies storyline, and though it may not blow you away as much as the fight scenes will, there's still enough there to keep you interested and engaged. I would highly recommend this.
B000RW3YYA|5.0|Stargate is one of my favorite shows, and even though this is still in the &#34;stargate&#34; franchise, its nothing like SG-1 for those who have not watched Atlantis.
B0086700CM|5.0|i love the game it's very fun to bad hey don't have a lego temple run so it's fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!but i don't have 10000 coins
0345803493|5.0|I really enjoyed the second book to this series. It literally has a little bit of every emotion you could imagine. Could not put this book down for a second. Overall its an amazing book!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|great app. let's me schedule whether to take a charger for kindle fire hd based on what I'm doing. tells you how long you can use media, Internet etc. a bit like a car trip/range computer. thanks
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Like most other Firefly fans, I wish they made more.  Though if you do read (including e-readers), there are many books about this crew and this great ship!  :D
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I love Rod, but not enough to usually buy his albums, however this one is fantastic!  His voice reminds me of Louis Armstrong and the rat pack, so I bought this to add to my Christmas collection.  I know it's only mid-November, but we played it at work as soon as it came.  I was surprised by some of the collaborations, but it all seems to work.  The arrangements are pretty mellow and soothing (think coffee house or bank) and not obnoxious (unlike Destiny's Child's cover of the Carol of the Bells). This album will be on heavy rotation during the holiday season!
B0063IH60K|1.0|At the start of a new game, an ad pops up that cannot be exited. Had to close application, reopen and then continue game. Uninstalled
B009VB97EY|2.0|I thought the movie was immature and corny.  Dancing segments were okay, but otherwise the movie drags.  Would not recommend.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|A lot of people complain that they don't like or understand this movie....it is simply a standalone movie that begins to explain some of the mythology of the preceding &#34;Alien&#34; movies. I say &#34;begins&#34; because it does leave a ton of unanswered questions that Ridley Scott hopefully addresses in the &#34;Prometheus&#34; sequel wich they are already working on...awesome production values...seamless special effects...plotline a little thin on occasion, but remember, it is just a movie!
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I love this game and its super super fun and its only 99 cents and I play it every day all day
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is a pretty cool game I enjoy it a lot its always fun make things your own change them around and provide for it to grow up!
B004EPYZUI|5.0|The movie itself is great. I'd heard a lot of poor reviews before I saw it. That's why I don't pay much attention to the critics. The packaging was fine-not too much, not too little. Easy to open and the price-WOW! $7.00 when I got it-for Blu-ray.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Unfortunately, I heard quite a few comments about The Avengers prior to watching it so I went into it expecting more than the film actually delivered.  Don't get me wrong; it was a very entertaining movie and featured some good performances all around.  The standout in this regard, in my opinion, was, as usual, Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man.  Downey is a master at this kind of glib humor and almost always brings his characters to a very enjoyable, memorable level.  I would definitely watch this movie again and again.  However, because of the over-hyping from a variety of acquaintances who recommended it to me with comments like \\"It's the best comic book adaptation yet!\\" and so forth, I expected something greater than what I got.  The Avengers still does not, in my opinion, measure up to The Dark Knight, which is, again in my opinion, still the best comic book flick yet.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a great and addicting app. Once you get up to about level 10 (which doesn't take too long about a day or so) then it flies really fast. And you don't have to buy coins either. They regenerate. Great app.
B000W4HJ44|3.0|I order two of them...a present, but unluckily I had to open one of them to fix the loose DVD....otherwise the order was in time.....

0547995660|5.0|this book is so original and a good story that shows us how it would be is we were in such a controlled environment, teaches us a lesson for the future but such a good story I would recommend this to anyone
B008O9V4C2|4.0|Didn't even know this album was coming out until I saw it on the internet, his first in six years and only his second solo album since 1993's Kamakiriad. This is one of those albums that grows on you, at first listen it didn't really wow me especially the first couple of songs but as the album went on it got better. The whole album has a very warm feel to it, the production is of course pristine but doesn't sound quite as digital as Kamakiriad did and that's a good thing. I see some people even comparing it to Steely Dan's Aja disc, sorry folks but this new disc doesn't come close, Aja is dam near a perfect album, the thing is an absolute jaw dropping affair period, Fagen's new disc is good and there nothings wrong with that but lets not get carried away. It seems Fagen is finally on the right track, hopefully it wont be another 6 years until he releases another disc, also more than 9 songs would be great for a change, lol.

B008QTVNUI|5.0|I did not think that a tv show could captivate the moods of a bi-polar hero and make it believable.  I am amazed.  The portrayal is so complex that I have to psychoanalyse myself to understand what she brings out of my own psyche. That is a phenomenal feat!  Everyone interested in action , drama, thrillers, and romance should watch \\"Homeland\\".

B006LSZECO|5.0|Well, our modern day Nancy Grace and tv whodunits inspire this interesting and off the wall story of when a wife disappeared. Can't say more without plot spoiling-read and you will not be disappointed.
1451695195|5.0|I've always been interested in NDEs, but I am a skeptic.  I've read a few books on the subject, but find myself questioning the true motives of the authors.  Any creative person can make up a story and write a book.  And this particular subject is likely to sell lots of books.  This book caught my interest because the author is a scientist, and his background does not lead me to believe he has any kind of religious or financial motives.  The book is also well written.  I believe his story.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Great price!!!! bought season 1-3 then got this season 4!!! Will purchase<br /> season 5 when it's available. I recommend this to anyone who likes<br />an action/drama w/comedic overtones at times. The writers/producers of<br />this show are sometimes &#34;twisted&#34;. Keeps you guessing what's happening<br />to whom next!!!  I Love it!!!

0451232852|5.0|I knew nothing about WW1 when I started the book - the mix of history and fictional characters was very well done.  Others said that it was improbable the way these characters met up with each other along the way - but remember this is a fictional story.  I LOVED it!  can't wait to get to book 2.

B007NU54H4|5.0|I got this movie for my daughters fourth birthday. She absolutely adores this flick. She owns the previous three tinkerbell movies and has for a long time. Her interest has waned over the past two years and I can't even remember the last time she asked me to put on a tinkerbell movie for her but since she got this movie it is what she wants to watch everyday. IMO it is the best of the four tinkerbell movies so far.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|remember...this is a full blown 40+ hour game.  that is why you pay retail game price.  this is not an app or a simple game.  worth the money every time.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|I really wanted to see this movie.  Even after hearing about the scandal that rocked production.<br /><br />I have to say KSTEW, is the most attractive pouter, that I have ever seen.  But after a while, you have to ask, does this girl know how to smile?  Or does she even know what a smile is?  She just depresses the film to the point where you start to think that you need therapy.<br /><br />Visually, it is a stunning movie, with tons of effects and eye-popping visuals.  Which is a hallmark of Rupert Sanders commercial and short-film work.  But the plot consists of a ton of events that aren't connected in any way.  Which is shocking, since Rupert, is a master at telling a story in his early work.  He is also a master of getting you to feel the emotion that his characters are going through.  All you feel in this movie is depression.  Perhaps, this is a due to the guilt he and KSTEW were feeling due to their on set affair.<br /><br />I really was looking for so more from this film.
0060555661|5.0|this book should be required reading for anyone interested in investing for any reason...even if you do this as a profession

B006E4QCXU|4.0|This app is addictive and relaxing. Only issue is that the menu is glitchy. At times, only the color menu is available. At others, the main settings menu is available, but freezes. Sometimes the main menu opens, but the color option isn't on it. It's a minor issue though, because there's. no real point to the game anyway. It's just a relaxing way to kill time, and it does that regardless of the specific mode it's in.
B009682E6A|3.0|I just bougth NEUROSIS Honor Found In Decay Limited Edition CD.<br /><br />Limited Edition:<br />I did expect slightly more from this limited edition. It simply consists of a paperboard box with two cases, one holds the booklet, the other one keeps the CD. No extras. This means, the CD is not stored properly, every time you pull the CD out, or slip it in, the optical surface of the CD is polished or even sanded. I have seen paperboard boxes with plastic CD clips before. Thus, there is no reason to buy the Limited Edition.<br /><br />Album:<br />Dont get me wrong, i really like it!<br />However, the album does, in my opinion, not come up with the states griven pre-release, it was \\"the most dynamic album to date\\" or \\"the most adult\\" one. Isn't dynamic the opposite of monotonic? The live performance of some songs, given on the European Tour in 2011, appeared much more raw and sick. The studio versions appear more reluctant, more subliminal, but also more monotonic and mantric. There are silent, sung passages, and yelling walls of sound, but the transition between both is rather abrupt. But for example \\"The Eye Of Every Storm\\" was much more dynamic, and not less mature at all. Neurosis can be dynamic, but \\"Honor Found In Decay\\" does come up more like a mantra, straightforward, unisono, without a lot of frills.<br /><br />However, \\"Honor Found In Decay\\" again is great, its different, to my knowledge unique, and i will also purchase the LP.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Fifty shades is a bit slow but I enjoyed all three books for some light entertainment. Waiting,hoping for a fourth!
B0060AY6FO|1.0|Whenever asked about my favorite novel, my immediate response is Pride and Prejudice.  The BBC miniseries was wonderful and I always imagine Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle when re-reading this classic.  That said, I was excited about Death Comes to Pemberley.  I am a mystery lover so to have that genre combined with my favorite literary characters seemed too great a pleasure.  Maybe my expectations were too high.  When I read a mystery, I expect to feel a part of the story constantly reworking the clues in my mind.  It's the intrigue of what will happen next.  You know, that feeling that you can't put it down!  Death Comes to Pemberley was so dry and flat.  It was tough enough to read the re-hash of what happened in Pride and Prejudice.  When the author finally got to her story, she ran through all of the events with so little finesse that it left little to the imagination.  I found myself skimming over many pages in hopes that I might get to that \\"AHA!\\" moment of satisfaction when the whole story comes together, but I never did.  This is the only P.D James novel I have read.  I know she is world-famous and has received many awards and honors, but I doubt I will read any of her other work.
B0080CL0HM|5.0|I can't say enough about the acting in this movie, I love this movie with Rob, his acting is superb, it shows his abilities to confirm to other projects other than The Twilight Series.
B000000WGL|5.0|It's like Keith said in his autobiography,\\" LIFE\\"; he had some great friends and they made great music together! However, I agree with Keith,as concerns the story of, 'The Stones':  it was not right, as Jagger attempted, to make something 'eternal' outside of that two guitar attack of, 'The Stones!' Nothing has ever been better in the history of 'Rock'!  It's the only music that will live with me forever; mostly, in my soul, because of Keith!
B003K15IF8|4.0|Beautifully written story about the ordinary life of an ordinary man.  The story reveals how 'unordinary' real people are.  I loved the insights into the thoughts of a man in a time when men didn't commonly examine their feelings let alone examine their motivations.  I only gave it four stars because I reserve 5 stars for those books I know I will read again.  This was a lovely story.
B008AX1HD8|3.0|Not the best I've read by nesbo. Doesn't have the suspense factor of his other Harry hole books. However, still worth the read.

B005LW5J9O|5.0|I want to see humanity move away from mysticism-based decisions toward reason-based decisions, and therefore \\"The Swerve\\" is an uplifting book for me.<br /><br />The book is well-written with an enjoyable, flowing style.  I never found it boring or tedious at any point.<br /><br />My biggest criticism of the author's logic is the emphasis on the brilliance of Roman people contrasted with the stupidity of Germanic people.<br /><br />I regard it as a popular myth that the Germanic \\"Dark Ages\\" were more backward than the preceding Roman era.  Most people had violent loyalty to make-believe religious dogma in both eras.<br /><br />John Christmas, author of \\"Democracy Society\\"

0618918248|5.0|I could write my own book on this subject and how I was initially lead to this brilliant man, Richard Dawkins and especially his masterpiece \\"The God Delusion\\".  I have so much to say about Richard Dawkins and this incredible book \\"The God Delusion right now I don't know where to begin except EVERYONE MUST READ THIS!!<br /><br />It's much easier to read than \\"The Blind Watchmaker\\" or \\"The Selfish Gene\\", although I LOVE them too, \\"The God Delusion\\" is absolutely ground breaking and is easy to be read by the lay person.<br /><br />A monumental WEALTH of information, well cited by the \\"great masters of the world\\", not to mention the countless resources included.<br /><br />**THERE'S AN ENTIRE EDUCATION IN THIS BOOK ->EVERYONE MUST READ THIS; I CAN'T STRESS THIS ENOUGH!!<br /><br />And not only to see that the world is so much BIGGER than you realize but I can not express how critical this is to opening the minds of your children by seeing how easy they are trapped into indoctrinated religions, particularly of those with \\"the 3 major sky gods\\": Innocent unquestioning Muslim children who learn nothing but why to become martyrs, killing themselves and others without questioning so they may enter into the perfect, (and painless), afterlife as they fly into our NYC Twin Towers to please their Allah of the Islamic Quran, (Koran), Cruel Yahweh of the Bible's Old Testament - and any Bible reader knows the sadistic story of Abraham making a sacrifice of his beloved son, Issac until \\"God\\" changed his mind in the brink of time sparing Issac, \\"Suffer the little children for I am a CRUEL GOD\\" along (?? Is that right??  Who cares!!), even Lott was a freakin profile of a pedophile with his 2 daughters if you read the whole story, with countless other Bible passages that also make tons of sense & then there's the Trinity of the New Testament featuring \\"Gentle Jesus making good\\" and the blindness of Christianity.<br /><br />And creation vs. evolution??  It's called the common sense ofscientific evidence.  How can teaching evolution to kids schools possibly be disputed unless you are stupid or something??<br /><br />At least when Queen Elizabeth broke from the Catholic church for good she could not have said it better when she proclaimed she'd rule with COMMON SENSE.  Many should follow this fine example as Richard Dawkins has.  The Church of England is better than most but it's full of Christians.  I could go on and on...I've read so many books starting at a very young age, talked to ministers, pagans, seers, you name it, - all because I was raised as a Catholic, married in the Catholic church at a very young age, about to be divorced at 21 and going to burn in hell for eternity for it.<br /><br />Even my own priest who married me to soon to be ex-hub assured me I was NOT going to hell and to stop worrying about it, telling me I was a \\"good girl\\" while he embraced me... ->which made me very NERVOUS, BTW!!.<br /><br />I was finally lead to The First Spiritualist Church of Onset Bay where they finally spoke my language, (or could \\"read\\" you).  They have been closed for years but are once again on the brink of opening and I can't wait!!<br /><br />I've had the pleasure and privilege of meeting with Laurie Cabot, Highest Priestess of Salem, MA who I was lead to when I really need her help.  That was an AMAZING experience ~ **WOW** ~ only reinforcing in me there is an awesome wealth of energy on this Earth and in the elements: the Earth, the Wind, the Fire & the Water as most Wiccans believe.<br /><br />Atheism is greatly clarified in that it's not the disbelief in some powerful mystical ENERGY type force out there that can also be known as a \\"God\\" to some but that Dawkins is taking issue with RELIGION.<br /><br />Have you ever known of any war other than a \\"HOLY WAR\\"??<br /><br />And it doesn't bother or phase me when people say \\"God\\" for lack of a better word or \\"he\\"; I don't find that a big deal...the BIG deal is how WRONG religion is and/or kidsbeing denied the right to choose for themselves what is right for them because their parents keep doing it for them down the generations.<br /><br />Written by a former soul searching Catholic, (the WORST TWISTED religion in the world, TRUST ME, with the OMG powers that be at the almighty Vatican!!), now a proud Evolutionist who believes their is great power in nature and in the elements whom I sometimes refer to as my \\"gods\\" or \\"God\\".<br /><br />And \\"The God Delusion\\" most definitely needs much more exposure and many more people NEED to be reading it.<br />I don't know what I'd do without Richard Dawkins, but ->Thank God<- for this brilliant man!! ;)<br /><br />(*I'll likely add more to this; there's so much to say!!)

B007SGLZP8|3.0|This is a good read, as Grisham's books always are, but this one won't be the one that makes you say, \\"That was the best book he's ever written!\\"  The characters are well written, but the plot line is stretched thin.  There were too many areas that seemed implausible; a very far-fetched story.  Still, totally worth the read, just not up to his usual standard.
B009329ZF2|4.0|An entertaining sci-fi action flick, light fare, heavy on special effects, competently acted, with an unexpected plot twist toward the end, and a greatly deserved tip-of-the-hat to real heroes of a bygone age. This movie will not trouble you with vexing moral conundrums or social issues; it's strictly entertainment, and it does its job fairly well. (NOTE: I'd call this a \\"guy\\" flick. Don't be surprised if your girlfriend gets fidgety halfway through.)<br /><br />All in all I enjoyed it.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Visually, this was a great film.  Ridley Scott always delivers on this.<br /><br />I had two beefs with the dvd version. It was in such a narrow letter box display, that it took away from the viewing.  Also, I was bummed that there were so few special features in the dvd version after I had heard there were supposed to be a lot of extras. They saved themm for the blue-ray edition, which stinks.<br /><br />I would have given it 5 starts if the dvd version hadn't been short-changed on the specials.

193413712X|5.0|I usually don't take book recommendations from people. It's not that I am arrogant about my book choices (OK, maybe I am a little!); rather, it's because I always have too many books that I've already have picked out vying for my attention. Adding in book suggestions just get in the way. And, if I held to this, I would have missed out on one of my favorite books of the year, Tinkers by Paul Harding.<br /><br />Over dinner at The Harbor, my friend Melissa told me about this book, and her brief overview of the plot sounded interesting: quiet prose, generational storyline, clock maker. Something about that hooked me, and I bought it the next day. I read it while being trapped inside for the weekend that Typhoon Jelawat visiting Okinawa, and this book was the perfect antithesis to the stormy, angry wind outside.<br /><br />Tinkers begins with George Washington Crosby on his deathbed with this compelling sentence: \\"George Washington Crosby began to hallucinate eight days before he died.\\" These hallucinations take us through his life in herky-jerky starts and stops, and we as readers must piece together the fragments of snapshots that we see. The narrative crisscrosses between George as an old man, and George as a small boy, focusing on George and then on his father, Howard, a peddler-tinker trying to scrap together a living for his family. Howard is unable to stay due to medical issues. George tells us \\"he leaked out of the world slowly.\\"<br /><br />The story is a sweet portrait of family hardships, of leaving and staying together, of love and work, and of fathers and sons. Simple and slow (but not in the dull meaning of the word), Tinkers gives us a tender picture of the Crosby family. But the best part of the novel is not the story; it is the way the story is told. Harding is a gifted writer who captures the family with his tender constructions. The fragmented timeline is propped up by the beautifully crafted sentences. This inner working of the prose adds to the motif of George's career as a watchmaker. All this works together to create this memorable book. Melissa was right about the quiet prose.<br /><br />Tinkers end with one of the most aching scenes I've read in a novel: it was a meeting between a young George and his new family and his estranged father. I won't give anything away here, but we are told that this scene was \\"the last thing George Washington Crosby remembered as he died.\\" After I finished it, I thought of my own father and two sons. I put down the book, listened to the wind howling outside, and waited for the boys to wake from their naps. I had something that I really wanted to tell them.of George's career as a watchmaker. All this works together to create this memorable book. Melissa was right about the quiet prose.<br /><br />Tinkers end with one of the most aching scenes I've read in a novel: it was a meeting between a young George and his new family and his estranged father.

B0087ITC56|4.0|Let's begin with the obvious... you probably won't find this film on the list of choices for in-flight movies the next time you \\"fly the friendly skies\\".<br /><br />We've come to expect great performances from Denzel Washington and his flawed character in \\"Flight\\" does not disappoint. His portrayal of \\"Whip\\" Whitaker, a skilled veteran pilot battling his demons via booze and blow, is believable and near brilliant. From the first scene it is obvious he has issues. And as the film progresses, layer after layer is of his chaotic life is exposed. After painting himself into a corner, Washington's character must make a life altering decision. And it is this journey that's the subject of the film. It's a movie about choices, and how one man finds redemption, if not peace, by shelving his denial and taking personal responsibility, but not without great sacrifice.<br /><br />As is abundantly clear in most of his roles, Denzel Washington as Whip Whitaker has the gift of cool. Even as all hell is breaking loose at 20,000 feet, he has the skill to do the impossible and at the same time displays the forethought to tell crew member Tamara Tunie's character: \\"...Tell your son that you love him. Remember the black box. Tell him how much you love him\\". He does all this without a wink's worth of sleep the night before, assisted only by a rookie first officer, a couple of lines of coke and an in-flight vodka screwdriver. And all without breaking a sweat.<br /><br />Anyone who has dealt with issues related to substance abuse should be able to identify with Washington's character. The at-times feelings of invincibility and highs that often result in the lowest of lows. Capable in the face of disaster, Whip's impairment plays a role in his greatest triumph and is responsible for his personal destruction. He eventually redeems himself at great personal loss and it is this transformation from denial to acceptance that makes his performance so compelling. Denzel Washington has never looked more human than he does in \\"Flight\\".<br /><br />Not to be overlooked, director Robert Zemeckis returned from his 12 year hiatus without missing a beat. His vision of the roller coaster that is Whitaker's life is well planned and transferred to the screen with the skill of an artisan. As is the case with Washington, Zemeckis can be counted on to deliver the goods whenever his name is on the marquee.<br /><br />Good supporting performances by John Goodman, Bruce Greenwood, Kelly Reilly, Don Cheadle, and Tamara Tunie.<br /><br />\\"Flight\\" is worth the price of a ticket.more human than he does in \\"Flight\\".<br /><br />Not to be overlooked, director Robert Zemeckis returned from his 12 year hiatus without missing a beat.

B0002NRQTS|3.0|But this one ultimately kinda deserves it. By far their worst work to date. It just lacks the spark that made so many of their previous efforts great. It has some moments that shine, including the number one album rock hit \\"Show Don't Tell,\\" as well as other radio singles \\"The Pass\\" and \\"Superconductor.\\" Tracks such as \\"Scars,\\" \\"Chain Lightning,\\" and \\"Red Tide\\" are also okay. But the band would eventually need to rethink things and get out of this case of apparent working man's boredom. Thankfully they would redeem themselves on their mixed bag of three 1990s efforts. If you're just getting into Rush, I wouldn't start with this one.

6305127646|4.0|This movie shares a cinematic heritage with many other movies about international intrigue and characters who are masters of disguise or espionage. This one is interesting because it comes from a unique time when there were a lot of changes going on in the world. The setting is in post-communist Russia and involves energy tycoons engaging in shady behavior. There is also a story line involving cold fusion that can only be viewed as somewhat silly in retrospect. In any case, the setting and details are not necessarily all that important for a movie like this. The main character, played by Val Kilmer, is an orphan who has mastered the art of disguises and trickery and works as a sort of freelance espionage specialist. His eventual romantic interest and side kick is played by Elizabeth Shue who is as charming as ever, albeit completely unbelievable as a renown scientist. Kilmer and Shue seem to develop some chemistry in the film and Kilmer turns in another unique and engaging performance. The action sequences are just low-key enough to be somewhat different than many of these types of movies but still fast-paced enough keep the viewer interested. There is something about this movie that makes it memorable. Perhaps it is the fact that the main character is more of a one-man-show and his main supporting cast is not a team of gadget-laden colleagues, but a helpless woman who becomes a love interest. In any case, even though the setting and scientific premise seems a bit quaint and dated, the movie still delivers.
B008S80OU2|4.0|Just got this from Amazon.ca - delivered the very next day for about CDN$115 including tax - that's 17 discs! Obviously the best parts of this collection are the remastered gems including 'On Your Feet' and the post-'Spectres' releases. The video 'Some Other Enchanting Evening' (previously released) is wonderful to look at but the sound could/should have been better... The DVD is probably my biggest gripe as it is obviously only a partial concert, not even including 'Reaper' or 'Godzilla' - odd. The liner notes leave a bit to be desired - the author of the essay seems to want to use big words that leave the reader more confused than not... I have been a fan forever and indeed I have most of the 'live' (read bootlegs) stuff included in this set. But there are some cool things that are included like the rejected 'Teachers' songs and live tracks like 'The Vigil', 'The Great Sun Jester' and a cover of the Beatles 'I Want You (She's So Heavy)'. The download site DOES work - I just downloaded the four concerts (that I already had). There was, however, a track missing - (Don't Fear) The Reaper - from the Old Waldorf in 1980. I've contacted the site about getting it again - don't know where that'll go... All in all, very pleased with this set - great value for the price. Enjoy!
B009AY04A8|5.0|having so much fun so far. have completed first two levels. looking forward to the next. the dialog does not bother me like some people have complained about. the random clicks when you shrink or enlarge aren't penalized unless there are a certain amount.
B009329ZF2|5.0|Excellent movie to watch suspencful action filled and just an overall joy to watch will definitely spread the word about this movie doesn't get much better
B003OFVIXG|5.0|It's been a while since I've bought a really good CD. One, that when you listen to it, you're able to think and concentrate better on the unusual things you encounter with. The track list is sharp, and it's able to create the right song order that'll make you feel the rhythm. It talks to you straight to the point, makes you hear what you want to hear. Simply extraordinary.
B0098VXBIA|4.0|Great movie kept me in stiches the entire time will definitely reccomend this movie to others to enjoy 2 thumbs up
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Favorite show! Love it, love it, love it. I finally have some extra money to start buying it. My husband and I watch it together.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|Not sure WHY I purchased this book.  It was trite and childish and unreal.  Wish I had not spent $7.99 for it!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Enjoyed the upfront info on this . IT was quite the operation, almost a debockle. Anyhow, I enjoyed reading about it.
B005UDD1R6|4.0|This product allows me to watch my downloaded videos. I now have a season or two of How I Met Your Mother. I got it for my Kindle Fire. Very helpful.
B009HV2JT8|2.0|Yes, I am reviewing this movie based on the fact that I read the book. I don't know if my opinion would have been different if I hadn't read the book, but my husband DIDN'T read it and didn't care for this film. (And both he and I are fans of this movie genre.)<br /><br />I was expecting more historical facts intermingled within the fiction. In the book, there are a lot more historical characters that Abe comes in contact with, who tie in to the whole \\"vampire\\" theme.<br /><br />I didn't feel there was enough character development at all. Again, referring to the book, I missed learning more about Abe's childhood and how that played a role in what he was to become. (a vampire hunter)<br /><br />As is sadly the case with most films made for 3D, it felt like the whole movie was shot to showcase the stunts/action scenes and NOT the story.<br /><br />I know films are never quite as good as the books, but they can be done SO much better than this.
B004AKCME8|4.0|The kids love this movie. The visuals are stunning. The voices are show that acting in animation make a difference. I am not familiar with the books, so I can't comment on that part. I liked the message and that good triumphs over evil. I wasn't bothered by the fact that it is \\"dark.\\" Life is dark and I was right there when the kids were watching it, so any questions they had were answered.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|So good to read a novel of this quality.  Engaging and carefully crafted,  this novel offers a riveting mystery and a satisfying ending.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book was throughly engrossing from beginning to end.  John Grisham had many surprising twists and turns in the plot.  The story was unpredictable from beginning to end.  I enjoyed it.
1847879071|5.0|By \\"Best. Thing. Ever\\" I clearly mean the best thing if you're looking to make sense of the world of confusing statistics using SPSS.  I must admit I didn't really believe the reviews about how amazing this book was.  I mean, it's statistics, a subject that seems the straddle the worlds of foreign language and magic.  Andy Field does a great job of providing easy to understand and hilarious explanations and examples of the various statistical tests and takes you step by step through how to perform these tests in SPSS AND how to make sense of the pages of output that threatens to bury you alive.  I hadn't taken a statistics class in years so I was basically starting over, and this book does a great job of explaining even the most basic concepts that most other texts just assume you know.  And what statistics book, well any textbook for that matter, make you actually laugh out loud when you're reading it.  I highly recommend this book for anybody wanting not to feel like a big dumb idiot when trying to figure out stats.
B002ZG977Y|3.0|For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  I just want to give a few thoughts on this movie...<br /><br />This Clash Of The Titans (2010) movie is a remake of the original version that came out in 1981.  Yes, of course if you're on your toes in this day and age you can predict that there's bound to be a remake of a movie once a movie gets to be 25-30 years old, or perhaps 50 years old.  Clash Of The Titans is no exception.  I have mixed feelings about this remake.  On the one hand, it's good visually.  On the other hand, it ISN'T good visually because the CGI looks so fake.  The movie, especially the action scenes, looks like a video game, so much that it got to the point that it was distracting.  If CGI is going to be used, it should look as real and believable as possible.  This is not the case here.  There have been other movies in recent years that have good to great CGI, such as the remake of The Wolfman (just off the top of my head).  When it comes to the actors, I liked the actors in the original Clash Of The Titans better.  You know - Burgess Meredith, Claire Bloom, Laurence Olivier, on and on.<br /><br />There is a certain purity that is missing here that the original had.  Maybe it's the stop motion animation of the original, which obviously looks fake, but low tech effects always look fake, so one can't really expect much in the way of realism.  Maybe it's the sets vs. a lot of green screen.  All I know is that there's something missing and everything seems so artificial.<br /><br />If you want to see the better of the two movies (in my opinion), see the original with its stop motion animation, better story, and better cast.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|I was quite disappointed with this book.  It seems like Grisham's later works are not nearly as exciting or compelling as his earlier ones.  Save your money.
B00A202A3I|5.0|the acting is phenomenal and the plot is gripping! I don't know how i ever survived without this show! simply amazing!
0307474259|5.0|In very plain language Gary Taubes lays out some excellent advice on fat, what causes it and how we can deal with it.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this app is very fun, and just when you think that you beat it there are more exciting puzzles for you to solve. I enjoy this app and I think you will to.
B0083UWX04|5.0|This is a wonderful video of Argerich playing two fantastic piano concertos. Of the two, her Prokofiev is the outstanding performance.... Just brilliant. The audio quality and video quality are both completely fine, so I am not sure why some people are complaining about that. There is a good balance of camera work on her hands and her face, although at some points one wishes the camera angles were better since in one performance her hair masks her face quite a bit. But that is a small quibble. I have watched it through three times, and it is really great. Highly recommended!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|i use this on both my kindle fire and my zte x500. very nice, compact screens, easy to use, does what it says.
B009WO7NQO|2.0|Buying it is not enough. After you finish the first level you have to pay again for the next level. Not very fair.
B0020M99LC|5.0|If ever a franchise needed rebooting and retooling, it was the James Bond series! Daniel Craig is the perfect Double O (and my current favorite of all actors to portray the role)! The story is enthralling, the action intense and the woman stunning!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Extremely fun and easy to use, boards and pins are organized extremely well, and there is such a variety as to what is on the site. I am absolutely addicted to Pinterest at this point
B009WO7NQO|5.0|this app is awesome my brothers and I all love it :) &hearts;&hearts;&hearts;&hearts; I really love it. and wish that it was free :(
B000SEGUDE|5.0|An amazing collage of the human condition, with a subtle but powerful thread connecting, and collecting, all of it's vignettes through the use of some very artful prose.  An epic tour de force, the likes of which have not been seen since Homer's Odyssey.
B0067EMFLA|5.0|FANTASTIC album, every song is amazing. Ariel's voice is simply beautiful, and all of the instruments are great as well. The songs talk about some serious topics that are very real.  Simply flawless.
B008G8SFGO|4.0|First off, I am a life-long KISS fan, since the Alive years, 1975 or so. Have every recording except for Gene's A.H. solo LP. I have loved all things KISS for almost 40 years.  I have spent a small fortune on them (you are welcome Gene).  This CD is is not as solid or well written as Sonic Boom.  Sonic Boom was great, not as great as early, edgy KISS, but good, catchy singable songs.  This LP took about 10 spins around for me to like it.  Of course, I had heard the lead song, Hell or Hallulya many times since the summer.  But, I really liked Eric Singer's song, All for the Love of Rock and Roll. Gene's \\"Wall of Sound\\" is pretty decent.  Of course there is no denying Tommy's song is an Ace copy. All and all, it is not bad, much better than the new Aerosmith LP (not good). The lyrics on this LP sound as if a 4th grader, just discovering the opposite sex wrote them, very juvenile, and and kind of creepy coming from grandfather types (guys who are obviously bald, gray, and eligible for the AARP, and senior discounts at Denny's).  Paul and the guys look and act much younger than their age, I respect that, but man, work a little on more intelligent lyrics.  I know it is all about the rhyme, but some of the words are just silly.  I have no problems with the current line up.  I saw their 'Disney' production (concert) this summer and enjoyed it.  No spontaneity, but fun none the less. Tommy and Eric are employees of Gene Co., I get that.  I wish Gene would wake up and let the guys develop their own personas. I think it would go a long way in giving them even more street cred.  Eric's drumming, unfortunately has been tamped down.  Eric is a superb drummer, no one disputes that, he should be allowed to display it (much as Eric Carr did).  Tommy's guitar playing is just average, nothing special, again trying too hard to be Ace.  Paul's voice is much harsher than in the past, not such a bad thing, just different than past recordings.  This should probably be their last LP. I still love the idea of KISS, but their best days are indeed in their rear view mirror.

B0069GRIHW|5.0|Generally, I am disappointed with re-re-rereleased albums. This is the exception. The main album sounds great but I think the last remastered version was just as good. The gem here is the bonus disc. The working versions Love Her Madly, Changeling and LA Woman (all of the others are good too) alone are worth the price of admission. You will not go wrong here. I especially enjoyed hearing a little of the studio chatter.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun and works great on my Kindle Fire!!! No bugs and I love the autocomplete function! Can't seem to put it down...

B003VANOFY|4.0|Well, Ive had this headset for a couple months now. I must say, I really like the headset, its not super heavy, and it fits decently well on my head. I love the fact that its wireless as well. the sound is pretty good and it certainly made my gaming experience much better.<br /><br />however, if it was only the headset, I would have given it 5/5 stars as the price is great for such a headset... the thing that really kills it is the fact that the software you use to control everything about the headset is a steaming pile of crap. the software that comes on the CD in the package is not even worth installing, instead go to the official website and get the most up to date drivers and controller, that would solve the majority of your headaches, but thats just switching from something that both doesnt work and gets in your way, to something that doesnt work; at least then it wont get in your way... as much...<br /><br />the ability to customize the programmable buttons depending on what game you are playing is useless, as it either does not work, or it actually resets. I cant tell you how many times the software says that my headset is fully charged, I unplug it, and get only half an hour of battery life... then combined with the number of times that my programmable buttons were just plain not working. I think Ive just come to accept that the volume wheel just doesnt work, even if it worked perfectly fine the first week I had the headset. the software is inaccurate at measuring battery life, and incapable of properly assigning functions to the programmable keys.<br /><br />one problem I kept on running into was the fact that my headset would start buzzing, it starts off barely noticeable, and then it just grows till it feels like its stabbing itself into your skull, shortly after, the headset will just die. apparently its a problem with the battery/software. as the software is incapable of properly detecting the battery level of your headset half the time, normally, it would beep when there is approximately one hour left of battery, then automatically shut off when the charge gets too low. unfortunately it doesnt always catch the low battery charge. I think the buzzing is caused by the low voltage the battery gives right before its not enough to properly function. so, when it starts buzzing, immediately turn it off, doesnt matter if its plugged in or not, TURN THE HEADSET OFF, which you can do by having it unplugged, and holding the power button down for about 5 seconds, when you let go, it should turn off. after that, plug (or replug) the headset in and keep it off for a minute or two to let the battery get enough charge to properly function, then when you turn it back on, the buzzing should be gone.<br /><br />so, in the end, great headset, light, comfy, and good sound; ruined by the steaming pile of crap software that they claim will help you control your headset.uld beep when there is approximately one hour left of battery, then automatically shut off when the charge gets too low. unfortunately it doesnt always catch the low battery charge.

B002ZG98C8|1.0|Machete is, without exception, the single worst movie that I have ever had the misfortune of loading into my DVD player.  The only good thing about it is that a friend of mine gave it to me.  After realizing that he was just trying to get rid of his garbage, I gave it back.  I suppose that I could have regifted it as a mean spirited joke.  Save your money for something worth watching.
B009CPGHDI|5.0|The movie was actually pretty good.  It was an interesting insight on what it takes to be a pop star.  Also insightful how one's personal life and the people that work with her.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book was well written, easy to read and is a good story. I read the book at the recommendation of a friend and I would recommend it to anyone of legal age.
B004WGIXX4|5.0|I am very fussy about my movies, so I don't often give good reviews.  I was attracted to it by the actors.  It really was engaging, funny and different. The acting, the story, and everything else was done well.  I really felt the emotions of the characters. I understood their needs and their conflicts. The romantic situations with the father and son, and the lady who was afraid of relationships -- I was surprised, but it all worked.  The movie had some funny parts, but its major value was the way in which the NEEDS of each character was developed and satisfied.  It's a great movie for liberal people that have had enjoyable sex lives.

B008O9V4C2|4.0|Despite the music being generic Steely Danishness, I feel like Donald Fagen just reached a little too far with this one. The three previous records, Nightfly, Kamakiriad, and Morph the Cat, were all more consistent, and didn't sound like an old man trying to appeal to a slightly younger generation. I don't know. It's pretty good, if you liked the other three, but just not quite as good, like the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull to the other three Indiana Jones movies. I appreciated the packaging, and hey, it's Donald Fagen, so I'd say the price is worth it. I mean, if you like Donald Fagen. If you don't, I really don't know what to say.

B004LP3AYI|4.0|The errors in this kindle book are ridiculous. Its a shame that the great writing its partially ruined by terrible editting. I can't speak for the printed version but this ebook has so many errors, at points, its hard to read. One common example is using the word \\"that\\" instead of \\"than\\". This seems trivial but after a while, you have to study every instance of the word to figure out which he meant. As the book progresses the errors come more and more often. I just hate that I loved this book so much and every time I got some momentum while reading, I would be dragged to a halt and pulled from the world by these errors. Aside from GRRM's stuff, this is one of the more expensive ebooks I've bought. It would be nice, with the ton of money I'm sure they've made on this book, if they could find someone to properly edit this.<br /><br />That being said, I loved this book. It gets moving more slowly that wizard's first rule, but it is also more than double the size. Some of the stuff going on felt like it wasn't really needed but by the end, everything tied together nicely. At one point, I was convinced that there was no way this book would wrap up what was going on. It seemed to be dragging its feet but at about the 2/3 mark, this thing just takes off. As another reviewer said, the last 300 pages demand to be read. I thought after this book I might take a break and read some other stuff but I have got to know what happens to Richard, Zedd, Kahlan and the rest.<br /><br />All in all, this book is amazing. I couldn't give it 5 stars because of the constant annoyance from all the errors but there's no way I would recommend not reading this if you liked the first book.<br /><br />On a side note, another reviewer complains about a section of the book being moved to the end. I'm not sure this is an error. I believe it was intentional in its placement. The passage at the end doesn't take away from the story but in fact, gives you a \\"holy $#!+\\" moment when you realize what's being said. Again, I think this is intentional and even if it wasn't, I think the book is better read like this.
B00005V0X5|5.0|MEGADETH[s debut is such a GREAT FANTASTIC THRASH PIECE!!!!!!! i really like all the songs like LOVED TO DEATH, SKULL BENEATH THE SKIN, RATTLEHEAD, CHOSEN ONES and LOOKING DOWN THE CROSS!!!!!

B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I loved this book. This book has everything for someone who enjoys good writing and great characters. I am not one to cry in books - but this was very moving. I am now on to another book by John Green, called Looking for Alaska, which I am also thoroughly enjoying.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is really fun and I like it I recommend getting this game.  the game is a puzzle where u connect the dots to the same color.
B0092C2X7U|4.0|It takes a bit of time to get the timing down but once you get it the game is actually quite fun and challenging. Plus it gets better as you unlock the new moves.<br /><br />I knocked it down a peg though because I enabled scoreloop to check it out and wasn't a fan of it taking the time to send my score every time I played. And there doesn't seem to be a way to disable it again. Without scoreloop this would have been a five.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I am not going to recap the story, being over a thousand reviews before me, there is not more I can say. I just wanted to add my count to the reviews. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I loved Harkness's take on witches and vampires. She didn't succumb to the stereo typical description that we have come to believe about these creatures. Instead she brought them to life in a way that you can truly find yourself attached to them. I loved the chapters that let us find Matthew's heart, showing him in a&#34;human&#34; light. I also enjoyed how D.H entwined chapters of calm with chapters of full blown chaos as it came and went in Diana and Mathew's lives. When I began this book, I was unaware that it was a trilogy. Once I found out, I immediately order the second book, &#34;Shadow of the Night&#34;. I am in the middle of the second and loving every page!
B005S9ELM6|5.0|Six years ago, I never would've imagined I would utter \\"I'm really looking forward to the new Ben Affleck film\\". But after directing \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" and \\"The Town\\", I found myself uttering those very words after watching the trailer for \\"Argo\\", his newest film. Each of these films demonstrates his skill and craftsmanship in creating films that are emotional and intensely watchable. The side benefit is that he has also acted in two of these films, turning in some of his best work as an actor as well. It almost seems as thought each is making the other side of his talents better.<br /><br />In 1979, just as the Iranian protesters storm the gates at the American Embassy, six American workers manage to escape and they find refuge at the Canadian Ambassador's residence. The CIA quickly learns of the escape and tries to come up with a plan to get them out of the hostile country. Jack O'Donnell (Bryan Cranston) calls in Tony Mendez (Affleck) to help them out and throw some ideas around. Tony stares at the group incredulously as someone suggests they send in bikes and maps, another suggests they pose as child aid workers and shows a picture of a starving child in Africa. Tony comes up with the idea to have them pose as a Canadian film crew scouting sights for a new sci-fi film. He gets the greenlight to go ahead and contacts John Chambers (John Goodman), a make-up artist who has helped the CIA in the past. He takes Tony to Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), a producer who is trying to stay relevant in a younger Hollywood. The fake movie they will make is called \\"Argo\\".<br /><br />Based on a true story, \\"Argo\\" is a nifty piece of filmmaking. If someone had just come up with this idea, you probably wouldn't last ten minutes in the film because the story would seem too implausible. But because it is 'based on a true story', your interest is heightened and the incredulity of the events carries you along. This only works to a certain extent. The film has to be well-made in order for it to work for two hours. And \\"Argo\\" is very well-made.<br /><br />Affleck has accomplished a fairly remarkable feat as an actor. Considered a joke for a while, and appearing in one bomb after the other, he started to do really good work in really good films. \\"Hollywoodland\\" heralded the beginning of a renaissance of sorts for the actor. A few years later, he directed his first film \\"Gone Baby Gone\\".  It seems like he turned on a switch and suddenly became a good actor and a good director in one fell swoop. I think his ability to use his talents as a director also helped him to mature as an actor. He is now doing some of his best work as both. Sure, he still seems drawn to the big-budget Hollywood blockbuster, iffy projects that could just as easily be bad, but these seem to be the exception to the norm.<br /><br />In \\"Argo\\", Affleck's major accomplishment is that he shows restraint. The story is so far out of left field, it naturally captures your attention and Affleck tells it in a straight forward way, eschewing weird and unusual camera angles of filmmaking tricks, both of which might hamper a less-talented filmmaker's efforts. As the film draws to its suspenseful climax, he doesn't need to add any cinematic flourishes because we are already on the edge of our seats.<br /><br />He has assembled a fine collection of actors to bring the story to life. John Goodman and Alan Arkin are the standouts as two grizzled Hollywood veterans who wholeheartedly agree to help and make the fake film. Their characters also serve as comic relief, offering many memorable zingers about Hollywood and the people who make films for a living. They also help to keep us clued in to how ludicrous the plan is. If it works, it will be a miracle.<br /><br />Bryan Cranston is good as O'Donnell, the CIA official who brings Tony into the fold. If Goodman and Arkin are the comic relief, Cranston is around to provide the gravitas. When the plan experiences hiccups, he stares at the camera with a pained expression. This may sound like a rudimentary, even unnecessary addition to the film. But Cranston's performance does two things; it provides a nice counterpoint to Goodman and Arkin and helps us stay focused on the seriousness of the situation.<br /><br />Tate Donavan, Clea Duvall and Victor Garber play some of the people, Americans and Canadians, stuck in Iran. It is interesting to watch their characters as they deal with the always present threat of danger. Throughout the film, the narrative shifts back to them to give us a sort of update, showing us how they are dealing with the isolation of their situation. These moments also help us get to know them, which is particularly important in the final moments, as we find ourselves rooting for them, hoping they will escape to safety.<br /><br />Affleck's performance as Tony Gomez, the brains behind the plan to rescue these six individuals, is understated. He plays the character without a lot of emotion and there are a lot of shots of Affleck listening to and watching other things happen. This makes him our conduit to the story. And this concept works really well.<br /><br />Normally, we might see one of the six workers as our guide into this story, allowing us to feel what the prisoners are feeling, making us feel their pain, their imprisonment, feel everything they are experiencing. It might seem odd for Affleck's character to serve this purpose, but because he does, it seems to intensify the feelings the individual characters are experiencing. We spend some time with them, watching them deal with everything. But when Gomez arrives, there is a marked change. They feel some hope and because of this, the stakes have also gone up exponentially. This also explains why Gomez is rather stoic throughout. If he shows any emotion, the six people he is trying to save will instantly pick up on this and amplify it ten-fold causing all sorts of problems.<br /><br />Both Affleck the actor and Affleck the director recognize the best way to tell this incredibly gripping story is to let it unfold naturally. This is the first sign of the actor and director's maturity. So many others would try to fool around, add flourishes, dramatic touches, etc. Because he doesn't, Affleck reveals the natural drama and excitement in the story.<br /><br />It is a remarkably accomplished film all around.ined expression.

B009YG2ND8|5.0|This is an amazing port of FFIII. I won't say it's perfect, but it's pretty close. The only complaint I have so far is that if you touchstone close to the edge of the screen the movement pad messes up a bit, its easy to adjust to though. I have to admit, $15 made me a bit apprehensive to purchase it, but I am glad I did. I would easily pay it again, and you should too. Support the developers. It isn't often you get huge games like this as an app. I wouldn't mind a couple more FF ports. A couple Mario ports wouldn't hurt either.  XD
B0029QRA1U|3.0|I recently purchased this to replace my dual cs 130 turntable, which is a model from the 1980's. If they still made it I would get another one but sadly they do not. This one has good quality but only at low volumes. if I want to play anything loudly the quality deteriorates and the needle jumps. I would recommend this for a fan of folk music, but not for someone who enjoys louder styles such as punk rock, rock and roll, or metal.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl Strayed writes a poignant, witty memoir about family and adventure. Her telling of the adventure of hiking the Pacific Coast Trail makes me want to dig out my gear and start walking. Thoroughly entertaining.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great read. Exciting and so good I've started reading the second and third book in the trilogy. Purchased the kindle editions.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Well written, entertaining read. Interesting point of view from a devoted and beloved dog's point of view. Highly recommended for dog lovers especially.
0307352145|5.0|As an introvert with a sensitive nervous system, I enjoyed reading this book tremendously.  It has helped me to understand my social tendencies and preferences better and to let go of some of the shame I have carried through life for being different.  Indeed I can perform well as an extrovert for short periods of time in my work and in social contexts, but it takes a toll on me emotionally and physically.  For a time I pushed myself much too hard to act out of character in my job and suffered some debilitating health consequences as a result; at least after reading \\"Quiet\\" I have a better understanding of what happened to me and how to avoid repeating similar mistakes in the future.  I wish I had been able to have this information at my fingertips many years ago -- that might have helped me to make better and healthier choices in matching my lifestyle and career to my temperament.  I think this book is a must read for the introverted, shy and reserved -- and especially for parents who have children with those traits.  Thank you so much Susan Cain for writing this fabulous book!<br /><br />Tim
B00338QENI|5.0|A must read. Informative and tragic is the story of Henrietta Lacks. If you are reading this, you owe her a gesture of thanks.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Daniel Craig knocked this out of the park. Unbelievable. This is definitely a must-see film. After the disappointment that was Quantum of Solace, Skyfall brings the Bond series back with a vengeance. This is definitely a must-see, a well-told story, with beautiful cinematography.
B008JEJP5A|5.0|Nocturne is a fantastic, dream pop masterpiece. A perfect blend of moody dreamy music, smart catchy lyrics and spot on production. Wild Nothing's first album (Gemini) is, in parts, brilliant. Nocturne is a more complex and complete musical effort, nicely expanding the luscious melodic structures of the songs &#34;Chinatown&#34; and &#34;Bored Games&#34; (from Gemini) into a superb sophomore LP. Great music, not to be missed!
B0021AEIUU|3.0|I was required to read this book for class but i actually ended up enjoying reading this quick, easy read.
B006K2WXOI|2.0|I have to say as much as I love this story, the Kindle edition is extremely disappointing.  As an e-book for children it is very overpriced.  For the money, you simply get the text and illustrations.  There is no read-aloud function or interaction.  The illustrations are beautiful, of course, and it is nice that the text can be enlarged (although it then interferes with the illustrations).  It would be much nicer if instead the illustrations could be enlarged and explored.  All in all, this is a beautiful book that is better owned as a traditional book.  As an e-book for children, it leaves a lot to be desired.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I started with Fall of Giants and went right into Winter of the World. I love to read historical novels and this series so far has liveed up to Folletts standard. Can't wait for the final book of the series for the complete story. Recommend this book because it covers all sides of the wars that it has encounter so far.

145162445X|2.0|I had so much hope from this book. I am not a physicist but wanted to read more about our universe and its origin. The author was on Bill Maher one day and I decided to get the book. As I read through the pages, it was clear that the author had no writing skills. Assuming he was aiming to educate the non-cosmologists with this book, his writing was jumpy and hard to follow. Many a times I had to under line words or statements the author made and then went to google to find simplified versions of the explanations.<br />Eventually, I just stopped reading this book half way in. Now I will look for a better written book about the subject.
B000001EUR|5.0|I'm a huge Scorps fan, and wanted to get a copy of a disc that would have a good grouping of their tunes to replace an old, lost Scorps CD.<br /><br />I chose this offering by them as it has a nice all-around choice of songs.<br />It has some of the biggies, plus a few I love that don't often get the playtime and kudos that their others do.  Songs like \\"Coming Home\\" and \\"I'm leaving You\\" are greatly underrated in my humble opinion.<br /><br />Question:  At $6, how can a fan of this band go wrong with this CD?<br />Answer:  You can't...  buy it!<br /><br />\m/<br /><br />5*

B0091THDOM|5.0|I dont like cases for my iPhones, I prefer pouches to transport them and keep them form major dings and scratches in my pocket. Ive owned a few, and this one ranks high up there with some of the others that I 've had. Great fit, build quality and easy to get the phone and in out. I would strongly recommend this product.
B006UTJ6DM|5.0|This CD was worth every penny. It's almost as if it was meant for me. I love the score, classical music, and music from the 1910-1940s. It's so enjoyable to listen to. It also comes with some Titanic stickers that I adore because I am obsessed with the movie and the history of the Titanic.
B009YU9J0E|5.0|Loved their first batch of songs, but I was personally disappointed with their previous \\"Crystal Castles ii\\" album.<br /><br />Initially, I set my hopes pretty low for this album \\"iii\\", but their occasional leaks & teasers via their Facebook page like \\"Plague\\" & \\"Wrath of God\\" got me excited.<br /><br />I ended up liking this album much more than \\"ii\\".<br /><br />I think these songs are more in touch with Crystal Castles' roots, & what I believed they were all about.<br /><br />There's more of that retro-video game background music sound & feel, with the eerie lyrics that make you do a double-listen your first few times around.<br /><br />For me, these tracks have everything that the 2nd album lacked.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. This is the first of Stephen King's books that I've read, not being a fan_ of the horror genre, but it won't be the last. I loved his style, tone, sensitivity to each@character. His writing is so richly developed you feel you are there. The characters, people, you've known for years. LOVED IT.

1583334386|5.0|I love this book. This book helped me to deal with my most cumbersome habits. I started with Change Anything (which deals with both internal and external issues when making a life change). I then read the Power of Habit (to address the stubborn habits preventing progress). I am now using this book to &#34;seal the deal&#34;. These books, along with The Power of Now, are my current reference books for making sustained life changes.

B001UV4XUG|4.0|i found the movie to be very good and enteraning..and would buy again ,and would recomend as a good adition to any colocten
030788743X|5.0|Really fun and fast-paced book, had a blast reading it!  I really enjoyed how it continually referenced 80's pop culture and video gaming in general, throughout the book.  You can pretty much find out all you need to know about the book, before reading, by simply reading the plot summary.  Don't give in to spoilers and just jump in & enjoy the book.  Even though I know the outcome, I will read this book again in the future... maybe a couple more times!
B000FBJFSC|5.0|This was definately one of my favorites on this semester´s course lituature list. Frank McCourt´s ability to find humor in the midst of despair and misery is  truly admirable.
B000002N2P|5.0|They are never going to top the run of three albums from Dookie, Insomniac, and Nimrod in the power punk genre. Something in this has that innocent, youthful feeling of unrest and losing hope we have all felt at some point in your lives. They would never come back to this sound after Nimrod and if you ask me it was a slow, fun ride downhill because of overexposure with their 'operas' and tamer sound.<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong I don't really think of these guys as pure punk; this has always been pop power punk and that is fine with me. I know where the borderline lies. This album in particular still contains a lot of rebellious musings and pent up feelings from being cast out of the scene by their peers. They succeed with their ambition to not give a ****. A modern day classic with very few rivals in the genre. I'd rather listen to this at times more than Ramones, Black Flag, Clash, or Dead Kennedys. It's definitely not hardcore stuff like the Kennedys, but then who the hell was expecting that in the first place? This is more a personal record than anything else. And the lyrics, music, and drums all come together with excellent taste.<br /><br />What Insomniac brings to the table is a melodic edge and energy that was definitely on Kerplunk and Dookie, but not as harsh or supremely cynical. Insomniac is even more relevant and natural a punk album than any other that they made. You can hear these guys coming into their own style and personality. They had nothing to prove but to prove themselves capable of running alone without the home crowd. And the album does not miss a beat. To me there is not really a bad song on here. Panic Song might be the best thing they ever did. It makes the stuff they are doing now almost seem archaic. I have no idea why they mellowed out so much, but I guess the record was a negative reflection on their state of mind, and these feelings are not with them in this way anymore. Which is strange because this record has better taste than the newer ones. With physical maturity their sound has gotten too sweet, too sappy, and I rarely can stand more than a few songs. I probably should not say strange, as it seems a lot of musicians in general become a lot worse as bands after their heyday. Only a few seem to keep going with the same relevance. I know Green Day is relevant to younger kids, but to me their newer albums are just random pop punk records with saccharine lyrics.<br /><br />Insomniac however remains a classic.
1451638450|5.0|At the prodding of an ImpSec agent, Ivan \\"You Idiot\\" Vorpatril, cousin, sometime boss, sidekick, and victim of Miles Vorkosigan, rescues a pair of ladies in distress - who turn out to be \\"nobility\\" (mafia princesses?) from the lawless world of Jackson's Whole.<br /><br />His homeworld, Barrayar, subsequently invaded by their Adams-like family looking to \\"save\\" their daughters and round up some loot.  Naturally, they engage in a contest with Ivan's family and friends to see who is more wily, underhanded, and casually bloodthirsty.  Poor Ivan, who is not an idiot, is caught in between.<br /><br />It is a great read - very funny, no one dies on-stage, and yet stuff STILL manages blow up!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A page turner for sure! I can not wait to read the next book Catching Fire. Much better then the movie!
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|This will give you the answers as to where the Alien originated and why it has some humanoid features.  You will get a much better view of the ship, too, and will enjoy watching the actors interact and clash over how to proceed.  There are also some nice touches that take you back to the first movie.
0441013597|1.0|I have read this book many times. Story is great, but I won't pay this much for an e-book of it.  Based on other comments a poor quality e-book as well.
0756697875|5.0|A great book for young Lego fans. My boys enjoy checking out the sets, saving up for the ones they like and in the meantime they can recreate them with their current pieces. They also enjoy gettin the exclusive mini figures with the books.
B00005JM02|2.0|Had problems playing this in DVD and blu ray players that normally don't have problems.  After the first 10 minutes the freeze-framing seems to have stopped, and it could play.<br /><br />The story is overall OK, although it's definitely a kid's movie.<br /><br />But I was really surprised that Pixar included a scene that trivializes aboriginal culture (aboriginal in this case pacific islander).  There's an 'initiation' scene that is right out of a tacky B&W comedy.  I can only imagine what a child might infer from it, and it diminishes the overall message of the story.
B000I9WW4A|5.0|Depp does an amazing acting role once again in this movie! Includes a lot of famous stars young in their careers. awesome plot and easily one of my favorite movies of ALL time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! In fact the trilogy is one of my all time favorites. My fifteen year old granddaughter read these before me and loved them. Some things transcend age, these books certainly do!
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|I missed this one at the movies, and was delighted to see at at Amazon, and for such a great price.  Everything about it is right, a true sequel, while being excellent in its own right..............enjoyed it very much, hope more is to come?
B007SGM084|2.0|I found the first book somewhat interesting, beyond that, I can't imagine what all the fuss is about. I read all three only because I am somewhat frugal and I had paid a pretty good price for them. I hate to admit this<br /> but, I bought them without really knowing what they were about...... fell for marketing!!!!! Took me back to seventh,eighth grade when we all read books that we had to keep hidden from our parents.

B009186E3O|5.0|The packaging on this super deluxe version is a complete pain in the ass so be prepared to buy some empty jewel cases to house the discs.  That being said this is the best version of the film available and the bonus live CD and LP are AWESOME sound quality.  The live bonus audio deserves a release on it's own; some of the best sound quality Brian Jones era live Stones material I have heard...I only wish there was more.  Brian really tears up the slide on \\"Little Red Rooster\\".  As a long time Stones fan this is truly a treasure.

B002RKSZS0|2.0|Not one of Jane Austin's best works. Feels rushed, lack of story. It builds and builds and then just deflates, a little abruptly. Left me wondering where the other half of the story is.
B00003CY0V|5.0|To paraphrase Travolta's character, the problem with most community reviews is that they're common. Unexceptional, average and mundane.  Take Swordfish, for example.  Perhaps not a masterpiece of cinema, but certainly true to the genre, fun cinematography and easy-to-follow editing and script, good direction and high production values.  But,...and here's the tricky part...most LCD reviewers (lowest common denominator) lack the attention, imagination, intellect and real-world experience and knowledge of government BS (bureaucratic stupidity, or byzantine systems) burdened by the shortsightedness and populist pandering of politicians, that would enable them to suspend their disbelief to a breadth, depth and term sufficient to actually envision a reality that inevitably exists behind the stale and tainted curtain of their day-to-day somnambulant existence.  That said, watch it, update it in your imagination, then plug the possibility in, behind the recent RSS feeds, tweets and sure....even newspaper headlines.  It's not really so difficult to imagine.  Some of us have lived it, and are living it even now.  Just effin' with you, Stan.  Or not.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely loved the dynamics in this book!! It kept me wanting to read just a bit more. Can't wait to start the next book!!

B007THA4FI|2.0|Harry Potter catapulted Ms Rowling to top as youth oriented writer. That is her genre! This book has disappointed me. I did not find the characters endearing to me. The story line takes forever to develop and is without the excitement that was the hallmark of \\"Potter\\". I look forward to getting back to what she does best - teenage fantasy.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This book can change your life. I would prefer less notices about Vibram FiveFingers. Otherwise it brings some suspicion about the sincerity and objectivity of authors text.

0393343405|5.0|Written at a time when managers and accountants are using economic arguments to slash libraries, is it possible to disentangle 'The Swerve' from the current international debate on the fate of libraries, old books and, perhaps, humanities faculties?<br /><br />Beyond the immediate story of Poggio Bracciolini finding a lost classical poem in a remote German library, Stephen Greenblatt uses his latest book to demonstrate that dynamic societies embrace books and learning (and the imagination), whereas societies which devalue or even forbid them are on the path to stagnation and collapse.<br /><br />It is a carefully, and very cleverly constructed argument based on history, with small snippets of valuable information dropped here and there as the reader follows the narrative being delivered.<br /><br />By the end of the first chapter the framework for his argument is in place. It runs like this: Medieval society was rigidly hierarchical, Europe being tightly controlled by the church, which was able to rule due to a closed world-view. And this closed world-view mirrored (a) that very few people could read, (b) that access to books was near impossible, 'public' libraries having been closed/destroyed centuries earlier, (c) that few non-Christian texts were available (some were deemed sinful and banned; most classical works had been destroyed). This left Europe stagnating in an appalling state of insularity and ignorance.<br /><br />The rest of Greenblatt's book shows that by firing the imagination of the individual reader, things like books, libraries and learning, especially in the humanities, will fuel dynamic societies.<br /><br />My own feelings are that this is a marvellous book precisely because it so strongly shows the necessity for reading imaginative literature, for keeping libraries running, for holding on to old books, and for studying the humanities. I'll leave it up to other readers to get fired up about the exact details of Greenblatt's story.
B001QE9WEO|4.0|The Movie: Return of the Living Dead Part II is another example of how great the horror boom of the 80's was! There were hundreds of awful awful horror movies being made as well the greats we love today. This one is among the greats. Filled with great scares, hilarious gags, and homages to Evil Dead, Thriller, and other zombie spectacles, this movie is a worthy sequel!<br /><br />The Dvd: The transfer is decent. The picture quality is very good! Sound is adequate too. Extras include what I call the essentials, Director Commentary and theatrical trailer. Sadly nothing else though but at least it has the essentials.<br /><br />Final Word: For Zombie fans this film is a must! The best sequel in the franchise easily. For anyone wanting a good time this movie delivers! If you don't believe me, consult the Zombie Film Guide book!

B0083P1QUM|2.0|I wish Ms. Cornwell would go back to telling the story in the first person and maybe move the gang back to Richmond.  I was again disappointed with another Scarpetta novel.  It was anticlimatic, dull, and predictable.  I want more Marion and Lucy/less Benton, and maybe some new characters that stick to your ribs in the books.  I also noted many, many missing lines in my Kindle version of the book and wondered what happened to the proofreader.  The words at the bottom of many, many pages were missing, so the story didn't make any sense throughout, and I found myself going back and forth from page to page to see if I'd missed something.  I didn't.  And if I hadn't read the book, I'd still have not missed anything.  Ms. Cornwell use to be my favorite author, but there are just too many other authors writing these types of stories with a whole lot more meat.

B002XTBE6K|4.0|I recently read Jane Austen's Emma, so I wanted to see a TV adaption. I found the 2009 BBC series on YouTube. In total, there are four episodes, so it's about four hours (compared to Pride and Prejudice 1995's six.)    All in all, I think Emma was very inferior to Pride and Prejudice (referring to the TV series here). I did enjoy it, but it wasn't nearly as good. Or maybe that's because the original Jane Austen novel wasn't as good. Anyway, I wasn't as taken with Emma.    Still, I think it was an interesting miniseries. I have a few observations about it. It's much darker than Pride and Prejudice, in both senses of the word. I think it's less light and merry in terms of feel, and also all of the rooms are much less well lit. It's probably more realistic for the time period than Pride and Prejudice; I seriously doubt candle-light would create the light rooms there. And it was also more sad. I actually was tearing up in the opening minutes, when the British narrator guy talks about the three children: Emma, Jane Fairfax and Frank Churchill. So a much darker take, I think.    The casting was pretty well done. Mr. Knightley wasn't that handsome, but I grew to like him a lot throughou tthe 4 hours. (But then again, Emma wasn't that pretty either.) I liked all of the characters except for Harriet Smith; she was so ugly at times. I think she should have been a bit prettier. One other thing that I liked was at the ball, the dancers all applauded the musicians. I don't know if that would have actually happened, but it was a nice touch.    Emma is a nice adaption of the novel and if you enjoy Austen TV/movies or Emma specifically, I would highly recommend it. You can find all of it online.    All of my book and movie reviews can be read at my blog [...]
B0098VXBIA|2.0|Poor dialogue predictable jokes. Given the cast I would have expected a much better show but they can only say what is written for them. I only watched it because nothing else was on.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|I very much enjoyed the Racketeer.  It is a quick read with twists and turns.  Very creative.  I would recommend the book.  But then I really like Grisham and his style.
0385344333|1.0|I agree with all of the negative comments on this Reacher Novel.  It is a major Zzzz.  Let me give you a brief synopsis:  Jack Reacher hitchhikes a ride from a group of bad guys (perhaps)...then, he hooks up with an attractive F.B.I. agent, but instead of seducing her in his typical modus operandi, he decides instead to have a two-cheeseburger value meal with her at a McDonald's restaurant.  Apparently, Reacher has decided that eating junk food is better than sex. Hmmm....  Several other mentions of the fast food franchise occur in the boredom of the middle 300 pages.  Finally, at the \\"climax\\" of the novel, Reacher's team discovers the lair of the bad guys by sorting through their discarded garbage bags from two McDonald's restaurants. Go figure!<br /><br />Quick question Mr. Child: how much of a kick-back bonus did McDonald's give you for mentioning their crap food in this crap novel?  Just curious...
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|Simply Put without all the jargon...... I cannot fathom how anyone could give this movie less than ( ok I will be generous ) 3 1/2 Stars. The Acting was Great. The Cinema Photography was brillant along with the Atmosphere of the story....ETC......
B000003CUJ|3.0|If you have a family member or friend who is considering doing The Ring, but is dismayed that the price of a full ticket is about the same as the price for a small island in the Caribbean, you may wish to get this for them as an introduction and way to determine if The Ring is right for them.  While it is not exactly all the highlights as I would select, it is a good sense of what to expect across 4 evenings of Ringing & Ringing.  Some reviewers have written in surprise and indignation that this CD is \\"just\\" music, but if you look closely at the title, The Ring without Words, you will find a strong suggestion of that and won't be surprised at all.  Admittedly, the pacing is often swifter than I would like, but again, as an intro it does a very good job of helping newbies assess interest and identify leitmotifs that can be recognized during the real thing, giving a sense of familiarity that can be comforting in such a long production.
1594135851|3.0|I enjoyed the book for the most part. I feel like some parts are a little far fetched & some parts had too much detail and others too little. Still a decent read tho.
B008I3QZKU|1.0|I have not read any of the other reviews. I like only one song: Flesh and Bone. The rest will bore you to your grave. Some one tell me how an artist that put out a great album like Hot Fuss, released such a boring album? I've listed to it several times hoping I was wrong, but the result is the same - boring. Its so boring that I went back and listened to Hot Fuss again, thinking that maybe my taste in music had changed. No! Hot Fuss is great. Lastly, some one promise me that this album is not labeled \\"Alternative.\\"

B0031RAOVY|5.0|I vaguely remembered this story from reading about it years ago. This movie was fairly brief, easy to digest, and conveyed a wonderful, simple message. My two dogs were sitting next to me during my watching, which enhanced the experience for me! Well done.

B005WUHAX8|5.0|I've had this on my phone for awhile.  I've had a few liquid spills, and the phone was completely protected.  But the biggest protection happened last week.  I was walking into our church sanctuary and heading down a flight of about 20 steps.  On the second step, I lost my grip on the phone.  It tumbled down a couple of steps and over the side.  It fell all the way down to the floor next to the steps.  I immediately thought it was a goner!  Got down the stairs and picked up the phone, and it was absolutely fine!  If the area had been concrete and not carpet, I can't say that it would have survived, but for the distance it fell, I was pretty impressed that it wasn't damaged.
B0090X4GJE|5.0|Halcyon is my first Ellie Goulding album. I bought it after hearing the first single \\"Anything Could Happen\\". That is one of those songs that I could not get out of my head. It was that compelling. I liked her first album Lights but the album didn't make me want to go out and buy it like Halcyon did. I am glad that I bought Halcyon.It is a very catchy pop album. I enjoy Ellie's distinctive and unique style of singing. I don't know if it was necessary to add the single version of \\"Lights\\" as one of the two bonus tracks otherwise I enjoyed the entire album from start to finish.

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I rated this cable not only for its ability to charge my Kindle, but because Amazon stood up and said:  hey, we have a defective piece of equipment and we need to replace this with no charge for our customers.  I was shocked when my original cable disintegrated in front of my eyes.  I check for a replacement on Amazon, found others who had been through the same experience, and found the information to replace the cable at no charge.  Thank you, Amazon, for taking personal responsiblity for this item.  I will always be a loyal customer because of your actions.

B0037VNX44|5.0|I know I am late to the Hardy party, but this performance is astounding.<br />Fearless, vulnerable, charming, violent, arch and theatrical this actor is more than just dextorous.<br />Not a fawning victim portrayal and neither an impossible caricature,  Hardy blows up the screen with his crackling energy. And he makes you laugh.<br /><br />Refn uses music to great advantage from Delibes' Flower duet and the Pet Shop Boys to the slave chorus from Nabucco combined with great long sweeping passes with the camera to illustrate (to me) that art is as essential as breathing. Even if you are caged.<br />I am glad I didn't read anything before having seen this, but perhaps this will lead to you a gem.

B007THA4FI|2.0|Like Rowland's previous work, there are some wonderful phrases and clever writing.  However, the story meanders and fades into boredom, never seems to go anywhere and cannot sustain interest.  A disappointment when so many have looked forward to a new book by this author.

B005LCYR7Y|4.0|I do so love Stephen King and as usual he did not disappoint me. I actually forget that he is the author when I read his non-horror titles. This has got to be up there with [[ASIN:B003BKZW7W Dolores Claiborne]] as one of my very favourite stories.<br />I love the conspiracies surrounding JFK and the Kennedy family and this makes you think, 'Hey what would I do if this were me?'<br />If I had to have a negative though, it would be that, as a thirty-six year old, I found it hard to think of Jake/George, as a thirty-five year old. I think him being a forty-five year old would have made it more believable, just because he seemed a little older.<br />King is so descriptive and imaginative. Love, love, love...

B00979CS50|5.0|I've almost given up on Neil putting out an lp of this caliber. Since the mid 90's his work has been spotty to downright frustrating. After a fantastic slew of records; Freedom, Ragged Glory, Harvest Moon, Sleeps With Angels, and the underrated Mirror, Neil has released nearly a dozen dull to decent lps. Nothing has come close to the force and magnitude of Psychedelic Pill. When I heard the first song was going to be a 27 minute epic I laughed with amusement and bewilderment...here he goes again. No, the song sets the stage for his best lp since Harvest Moon.  The four long songs are the highlights. Driftin' Back, Ramada Inn, She's Always Dancing, and Walk Like A Giant are as fantastic as anything Neil has ever done. If you're a Crazy Horse fan I would be downright confused if you didn't love this lp. Neil is back...at least for now.

030758836X|5.0|I purchased this on my way to the train station in Chicago, en route to Kansas City....while on the train, i started reading. When I got home, I exchanged chit chat, dinner with my wife and two children, and then made my way to my chair and picked up the book again (around 10 p.m.). At 2.30 a.m., I finally put it down and agreed with no one else who was awake, that it was easily the best genre book I had read all year. Nick and Amy are married five years and they, like so many couples, are still finding their way. Unfortunately, for Nick, he lacks self-awareness and Amy, well, she does not lack awareness of any kind. And so what unfolds is not unlike Jennifer Egan's A Visit from the Goon Squad in memorable, textured, and compelling characters who are set up to collide (not intersect or relate, no these people crash in to each other) and scar one another (not change, scar)....Am a huge convert to Gillian Flynn's work.
B004JMY312|4.0|Hocus Pocus is a delightfully charming older Halloween movie. It is perfect for the younger ages although it does have a few scenes that could be a bit scary for very young ones or those who frighten very easily. I do believe there are a few words that I would not want a 4 year old to repeat but I am pretty strict about what any of my children are allowed to say. Over all a great Holiday movie for the younger set.
B007PP2J9I|4.0|I liked the novel for being most of the time technically correct and treating technical subjects without going into imaginary plane.<br /><br />However the plot has often been kind of predictable and definitely less twists to story. Author could have made it more interesting by putting some negative shades (or hidden secrets !) on protagonists.<br /><br />But all in all, I enjoyed reading it and am quite sure any nerdy guy will like it.

B004W4N55C|3.0|I was about to give ot a five star rating, because I loved it on my galaxy nexus, but then I tried to install it on my kindle and was immensely disappointed. It is not compatible with the kindle fire and therefore you have to REPURCHASE the app you already paid for! I would have gladly purchased it because it is an amazing tool, but I don't think it is fair to have to purchase the same app if you have it already on one device! Every other app I have purchased works between platforms, why not the one I really needed on my kindle? Its hard to read the chords on my nexus, ans having it available on a larger screen was going to be how I practice. But now...I cant. I'll change my rating when it becomes compatible with my kindle.

After reading the description I immediately added the season to my Watchlist and just finished it.  A fantastic show, with great plots and characters.

0425221806|5.0|If you are wanting to read a Dean Koontz book for the first time, look no further than WATCHERS! This is one of the best books I have ever read! If you are a dog/animal lover who enjoys horror, science fiction, government conspiracy, and suspense this book is for you. Amazingly well written, with a wonderful plot and story line. This book is a true page turner. I couldn't put it down for a minute which in turn caused me to have a few sleepless nights. The character development in this book is phenomenal. You feel like you could be best friends with the protagonists. Normally when I read a suspense/thriller/horror book the author always allows me enough \\"space\\" to try to guess what is going to happen next. I was so enthralled with this novel that I didn't have time to think about anything other than what was going on at that moment in the story. Absolutely fantastic! Buy this book - you won't regret it! If you still like Koontz after reading this book and want to dive right into another of his novels, then try PHANTOMS next.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I read this book quite some time ago, way before there were talks of a movie. I loved this book, the world building, the concept of the tournament, and the characters. It was so cool and different from other books I read. I usually am all about the romance aspect in a novel, but in this book, I didn't actually mind that is was pretty non-existence. This is a great book for teens and adults. And yes, the book was much better!
B005HS00NW|3.0|Like many people, I heard them on the radio, and liked them enough to buy the album. I will say this: listen to the album first, as what you've already heard in the black sheep of the album. It's not bad music, but it's an entirely different kind of music.
B0013F1D02|5.0|Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />I wanted to see this film when it was in theaters, but I never got the chance. Anyway, I just saw the film via XFinity On Demand, and it's really good. Though it has the classic elements of a fairy tale, this one is not your usual fairy tale...trust me. The acting is first-rate, especially from the seasoned veterans in the cast (which includes a brief appearance by Lawrence Of Arabia himself). Two or three cast members were entirely unrecognizable, at least to me, and this speaks to the ingenuity of the Make-Up Department. Very well-done, indeed. The score is also beautiul and action-packed. MILD SPOILER!!! The scene where Captain Shakespeare is dancing in women's clothes could have either been done differently (ie. not having him in women's clothes at all; just having him dance with a mannequin or with a dress in his hand would have been enough) or just cut from the film, though the sequence where he's dancing & the swordfight is going on while the Can-Can from Orpheus In The Underworld by Jacques Offenbach is playing is hilarious. MILD SPOILER OVER!!!<br /><br />The only slightly off-putting element in the film was Academy Award winner Robert DeNiro's American accent in a cast full of English-speaking actors (Michelle Phieffer did a spot-on British accent, as did Claire Danes). That detracted a bit from my enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />A bit too intense for younger viewers, this film is nonetheless an enchanting fairy tale which the whole family with children 8 years old and up can enjoy.<br /><br />Rated PG-13 (some scary images & frightening moments).

B000FC2ROU|5.0|The scene is Japan, Tokyo, the Inland Sea, and places in between.  The main character is a fifteen year old boy who runs away from his angry father who blames his son for the desertion of his wife and daughter years earlier.<br /><br />The young teen barely remembers his mother and has no idea why she left with his sister. As the father's rage grows, he shouts out an Oedipal curse on his son, which convinces the boy to step up his plans to get out.  He is encouraged by an inner voice, Crow, who is certain he has the strength to succeed.  Knowing that his father will have him tracked as an underage runaway, he gives himself a new first name, Kafka.  As a reader he knows the significance: a metaphor for deep feelings and disarray.<br /><br />Without an idea of where to go, but hoping he will recognize a way, Kafka's journey takes him into the depths of good and evil, the supernatural and the living dead.  Is he destined to follow the ancient curse?  This book is a masterpiece of storytelling.

B008MZPVP4|4.0|Five whole years have passed since Down kicked out some new material, as they delivered their third-full-length effort, \\"Down III: Over The Under,\\" in 2007. In that time, the side-project supergroup -- which is comprised of Pantera's frontman Phil Anselmo, Corrosion Of Conformity's guitarist Pepper Keenan, Crowbar/Kingdom Of Sorrow axeman Kirk Windstein, Goatwhore bassist Patrick Bruders, and Eyehategod/Crowbar drummer Jimmy Bower -- have made plans for releasing four E.P.'s. And they have written and recorded the first of these four, 2012's \\"The Purple E.P.\\" But anybody wondering if that five-year anticipation leading up to this release has made the songs on this six-track short-player sound over-polished/produced and slick-sounding was sorely mistaken. Indeed, Down are still as brutal and gritty-sounding now as they were when they debuted in 1995.<br /><br />Sure, \\"Purple\\" does take some adventurous strides, as it is the first ever E.P. to bear Down's name, features some epic track playing times (including three that clock in past the five-minute mark), and it also has the odd keyboard flourish from guest musician Ross Karpelman. So, as a result, it is not this NOLA-based quintet's most experimental offering to date -- as 2002's \\"Down II: A Bustle In The Hedgerow\\" takes that honor - but it is the second most experimental. Still, it is still packed to the brim with the usual Down goodies: Like godly -- and brutally heavy -- riffs, for one. As such, in the end, \\"Purple\\" sounds like the perfect follow-up to \\"Over The Under.\\"<br /><br />The short-player kicks off with \\"Levitation,\\" which is fueled by pounding, crunching, churning, bottom-heavy, Crowbar-style pure doom riffage and densely booming rhythms. Phil's vocals don't even enter the begin until about the two-minute mark, after which he is heard howling is head off -- in that distinctly Phil-esque tone that only he can replicate -- for the remainder of the song's five-minute playing time. Some really tasty and fairly wailing guitar soloing also enters the mix later on. \\"Witchtripper\\" begins on an experimental note, with a splash of colorful flamenco guitar plucking. This, however, is of course before the massive walls of booming electric guitars come storming in. From there, the track pounds out piles of both abrasively serrated and grinding and hefty, fat, densely chugging licks. Add plenty of steady, grumbling bass lines and Phil's trademark howling wail -- including some simple, yet really memorable choruses -- to the mix and the end result is one of the coolest cuts found on \\"The Purple E.P.\\" \\"Open Coffins,\\" however, gives it a run for its money, with its excellent riffing and ominously thunderous rhythms. And this track is especially of note for its bluesy lead runs.<br /><br />\\"The Curse\\" is an expansive, six-minute-long epic that ranges from a pretty lengthy and extended harmonic guitar intro to brooding, forebodingly mid-tempo sludge to shredding and fairly wailing guitar soloing. It is a bass-heavy song, too, in that it is long on very heavy, grumbling bass lines. \\"This Work Is Timeless\\" is a rambunctious, raucously rocking number with a sludgy bass bottom. It is also highlighted by an unusual melodic breakdown, where some unorthodoxly harmonic guitar leads loom overhead. This brief melodic break is soon answered, though, by thunderously heavy, pounding, and deeply grooving guitar licks in the outro. Lastly, \\"Misfortune Teller\\" is a whopper of a set closer, clocking in at an epic nine-minutes in length. It has the band's usual abundance of heavy, Black Sabbath-derived licks, and Phil's famously constipated grunting and mean, low growls. But \\"M.T.\\" differs from the rest of the songs because it also boasts a bit of whiney guitar feedback (in its intro), as well as a deeply bullying, rollicking, Southern sludge-filled main groove, and another bout of ripping, winding -- and perfectly harmonized -- guitar soloing.<br /><br />Granted, it probably should not have taken five years to produce, but \\"Down IV Part 1 - The Purple E.P.\\" should definitely satisfy all fans of the band and sludge/doom metal. As previously stated, this is the first in a series of E.P.'s released by Down; and if this E.P. is any indication, the other three (which are yet to come) will all be exceptional, rock-solid releases, as well. Hopefully they will drop sometime sooner than fifteen-years from now.ive years to produce, but \\"Down IV Part 1 - The Purple E.P.\\" should definitely satisfy all fans of the band and sludge/doom metal.

B009HV2JT8|3.0|The movie was okay, but didn't follow the book very well.  Took away from the effect and the story.  The movie never fully developed any of the characters or wove the history in and out as well as the book.  Good special effects in the movie.  Overall, just read the book instead.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I love this game. If you like farmville or building and sims games you'll love this.

It's a progressive game, building into higher levels and opening new in game availabilities.
B008NEVP1S|4.0|The last we heard from Aimee Mann was her great 2008 \\"Smilers\\" album, and now after a long 4 year wait, we finally get Aimee's new album, her 9th solo album.<br /><br />\\"Charmer\\" (11 tracks; 38 min.) kicks off with the up-tempo title track, and immediately this album feels like finding an old friend back, thoroughly familiar even after the 4 year absense. \\"Disappeared\\" continues the good vibes. It is followed by \\"Labrador\\" (1st single), another up-beat track, with great pop hooks. Yes, that is the dirty little secret behind the album, as it sounds more radio-friendly than ever (never mind that mainstream commercial radio is crap today, and will never play any of these songs). \\"Soon Enough\\" (2nd single) equally shines (and check out the great video for it on YouTube). The first half of the album ends with \\"Living a Lie\\", a great duet with James Mercer of the Shins (more on that later). The second half of the album starts with the beautiful ballad \\"Slip and Roll\\", and then goes back to overdrive with tracks like \\"Gumby\\" and \\"Gamma Ray\\". The album closes with the pensive \\"Red Flag Driver\\".<br /><br />What an album! Just great from start to finish, with hardly a weak moment on it. I had the good fortune of seeing Aimee in concert again this past weekend here in Cincinnati, where she and her backing band (including her long-time producer Paul Bryan on bass) brought a bunch of this album's songs live, to great effect (and also bringing some older tracks of course). At one point Aimee explained to the audience that \\"Living a Lie\\" was a test case (writing for 2 different characters and singers) for a musical she is thinking of making based on her \\"Forgotten Arm\\" album. She was warm, likeable and engaged with the audience throughout the night, in fact quite the \\"charmer\\" she sings about on the new album. What a great evening of music that was. Meanwhile, \\"Charmer\\" is sure to make my \\"best of\\" albums of the year list that I will post here on Amazon in December. \\"Charmer\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!IGHLY RECOMMENDED!

The saddest part is that this book is still better then the next one. At least it follows some story line, albeit a boring one.
B005PWPUW6|4.0|When I bought my new LED TV to replace my 10-year-old CRT TV that began to fail, I was disappointed to see that it didn't have any RCA audio outputs as my stereo receiver that I used with my old tv doesn't have digital audio inputs.  So, I found this and decided to give it a try. Well, it works in converting the signals for my receiver except that the input level must be fairly low as I have to turn the volume up about twice as high as on my old tv to get the same output from my stereo system. It would've been nice if it had an adjustable output level.

0812984412|3.0|I honestly cannot see (1) why this book is such a phenomenon and (2) how anyone could make it into an understandable (or profitable!) motion picture.  Let me say that the prose itself is excellent; Mitchell is a skillfull wordsmith, especially when writing with a contemporary wit, but the structure of the book is awkward and the thread between the disparate stories is tenuous.  It's supposed to be about death and rebirth--or rather that death is but a recurring transitional phase between multiple frames of a never ending life, but that tantalizing theory is left orphaned in the story but for a few recurring material objects that show up in these changing frames.  Normally I love these kinds of topics for books, and far be it for me to argue with Mitchell's success in tapping into some kind of cerebral attraction to his method, but I was left at the end of the book with only one response: What's the big deal?

B009HQ9UHC|3.0|Was totally loving this game and would h ave given it five stars until the last update where it now force loads an intrusive advertisement between every stage.  I realize it is the 'free' edition, but every single stage??  There are other free games that show the adverts once at the beginning and that's it.  Still, it is a good time killer, just do yourself a favor and play somewhere with no wi-fi access.

1421550644|5.0|The Viz's \\"Nausica&auml; Of The Valley Of The Wind Box Set\\" is just about perfect and everything that a manga edition should aspire to be. I've decided to upload a series of photos so you can appreciate for yourself what a treat this edition is. The package consists of 2 large hardcovers books inside a beutiful and strong slipcase, including a small color poster. Nausica&auml; was previously published in 7 softcover volumes and is now collected in full in this 2 HC books. So for all of that, the $60 price tag (much less with Amazon discount), is an unbeatable value.<br /><br />Both story and art is by Hayao Miyazaki, that's right, HAYAO MIYAZAKI: the man who co-founded the internationally acclaimed Studio Ghibli, one of the greatest genius of animation this world have ever seen. The art is simply amazing, the storytelling is brilliant, the pages are full of life and detail and magic.<br /><br />* * * * * These are the highlights of the edition * * * * *<br /><br />- The format is over-sized (like Akira's volumes), with a trim-size much larger than the one we are used to for mangas: the books are 10,4 by 7,3 inches. This gives you a much better appreciation of the art, and that's exactly what you want, being Miyazaki's pages so full of detail and wonder.<br /><br />- Book I is 568 pages long and Book II is 552 pages long, adding up to 1120 pages worth of Miyazaki's art!<br /><br />- Both books are hardcovers with sewn-binding, which allows for a very comfortable reading experience. It's a real pleasure to be able to enjoy a manga in HC format, as opossed as softcovers, it feels like a real luxury.<br /><br />- The printing quality is excellent, with sharp line-art and a delicate sepia tone ink.<br /><br />- The paper quality is beautiful and very apt for the reproduction of art. The paper stock is NOT glossy; it's traditional manga paper stock, but it isn't flimsy or cheap at all. It's really nice and proper for the edition.<br /><br />- Each volume includes 8 pages in color at the beginning of the book. This pages are printed in glossy paper stock and the art reproduction is beautiful, with vivid colors and outstanding detail.<br /><br />- The slipcase is very solid and well-build, and the books fit perfectly inside of it.<br /><br />- The box set also includes a small two-sided color poster (16,5 x 11,7 inches), which is a very nice adition to the package.<br /><br />- The reading order is from right to left, respecting the original page layout.<br /><br />In conclusion, the Nausica&auml; deluxe box set is the best edition of a manga I've ever seen. I really hope Viz and other publishers release critically acclaimed titles like Akira or Vagabond in deluxe editions just like this one.in color at the beginning of the book.

0316228532|3.0|I have read all the Harry Potter books and enjoyed them all.<br />This book has been promoted and advertised as JK Rowlings book for adults.  I have to say that I found this book to be a tedious read,  yes it was about adults but more about the adult's affect on their children.  It did expose a lot of classism and racism which helps us all deal/think about similar situations but I wish there was more done with the abusive parents and better relationships developed between the parents and their children.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I loved this film, for the excellent cast, the very human idea of always trying to find a better life and the quirky yet realistic story line.  It was funny and poignant and I would watch it again.

031618201X|5.0|The Soulless manga is one that I would recommend to anyone.  If you've read Gail Carriger's novels, the manga is an excellent adaptation.  If you haven't, then this book is an excellent introduction to the series and will likely make you want to pick up the books and tear through them. The artist, Rem, has a wonderful style that brings the characters and the world to life.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|I was intrigued by the title of this book and when I heard others talk about it, I downloaded immediately on my smartphone kindle.  A terrific book and beautifully written.  How the author combines his knowledge of neurology and his experience beyond is quite an amazing blend.  Believers and non-believers alike will find this book truly interesting.  I ,for one, find his experience and observations very reassuring.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Great case for a good price. I especially like the use of the elastic strap instead of embedded magnets to close the cover. Obviously magnets are no good for electronic components - too many manufactures use them. The cover is sturdy so it protects the Kindle HD from damage. In addition to this cover, one should purchase a screen protector.

B0028DRGDQ|4.0|Better than the English speaking remake. It's subtitles for you guys who where too lazy to pay attention in Spanish class. Bet you guys feel real dumb now with all the Mexicans coming into the country. Is it too much to ask for people to culture themselves a bit in this country?
B008E374PO|3.0|First off let me inform everyone that takes the time to read this review; I'm a big fan of Owl City (Adam Young's) work. I have been following his music even before the Ocean Eyes album. What he brought to the table was different and a pleasure to listen to. Sadly I must say I was not impressed with this album; if he keeps this up he will be no different then your average pop star. He is steering away from what made him unique. The tracks on this album weren't bad but it didn't feel or sound like what I've come expect from him. Overall if you have never heard his previous work don't start here and if you are a follower of his music you can easily skip this one. I look forward to his next album and hope he returns to his own style of music.<br /><br />Thank you for your time
B001BPJJ82|5.0|This is seriously the best movie ever. It is more like a piece of art than just a movie. I recommend this movie to everyone.
B0011Z76RS|4.0|...but not all. there are some outstanding songs on this album, like one step closer, runaway, crawling, by meself, in the end, forgotten, and pushing me away, but some of the other songs fall flat. still, a great band and album!
B004KKXMSI|5.0|As any Jurassic Park fan will tell you, this trilogy ROCKS.  You cant get enough of the heart-pounding action, the incredible dinosaurs, or the beautiful scenery.  And on Blu-ray it looks tons better.  Very highly recommended.

B00785P2QC|5.0|awesome! totally addicting. stuff is more expensive to buy but you dont feel like your working for nothing and have to start again on the next city like the other game.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|I actually liked this movie for the most part. I was impressed it didn't turn into a movie where the climax was a drawn out action sequence full of gunfire and explosions. It was a simple thriller (not without its issues) with a simple, yet effective thrilling climax. And then...<br /><br />Spoiler Alert!!!<br /><br />Little back story to remind those what happened. They find out their Creators ultimately decided humans weren't all that good and wanted to kill them all. Elizabeth Shaw and crew go into the caves to wake the remaining blue Creator. Elizabeth tries to ask why they wanted to kill humans. Blue man's response: kills everyone in the room (Elizabeth escapes). Now cut to the ending. Elizabeth decides to hi-jack a ship, not to return home, but to find their Creators actual planet to ask them... sigh... \\"Why do you want to kill us?\\"<br /><br />Because it worked SO WELL the first time, right? So you land onto their planet, an entire planet who wants to kill you. What do you think will happen? A warm welcome and a polite discussion on morals? Um, no, they'll probably kill you on sight. Also, you just alerted to them that Earth is still full of humans. GREAT JOB!!! Now they'll start their project all over again.<br /><br />No, I'm not over-thinking the ending. I was barely thinking and I immediately notice how stupid the last five minutes were. You don't need a brain to realize she's on a suicide mission where she will most likely not find an answer before they smash her head in.<br /><br />And no, I haven't seen the Alien movies so I don't know what actually happens, if anything from Alien follows Prometheus except for the iconic aliens, that is. But whether or not I've watched them doesn't matter. The ending was just stupid. I would have given this four stars maybe, but the most idiotic of endings dropped this to one.
B007WKEM8C|5.0|I've followed and loved Deb's recipes for quite a while, but the recipes in this book WOW.  It is making meal planning easy as it is all I have cooked from since the day it arrived in the mail.  The recipes are perfection.
B000G759LW|5.0|Long before the drama of the Bionic era, Christina was a well-respected female artist with a lot going for her. #1 her voice was sounding better than ever #2 She had a classy new image #3 she had a husband #4 she had a stable career, which was more than you could've said for Britney at the time...Back to Basics was a huge success as well. It debuted at #1, got certified platinum, and sold 4 million copies worldwide. And it contains two of her biggest hits: Hurt and Ain't No Other Man. That being said, although I rated this album 5 stars, it is not flawless...the concept was brilliant but she didn't use it to its full potential.<br /><br />[track by track review]<br />1. B2B intro: a nice introduction 5/5<br />2. Makes Me Wanna Pray: AWESOME! Reminds me of some of Aretha's upbeat classics. My favorite song on the album 5/5<br />3. Back In The Day: A nice tribute to Xtina's influences. I prefer the live version though. The album version gets kinda long and boring :/ 4/5<br />4. Ain't No Other Man: Biggest hit off the album. Need I say more? 5/5<br />5. Understand: Love this! She samples a Betty Harris song called \\"Nearer to You\\". Her voice and Betty's voice blend together nicely. 5/5<br />6. Slow Down Baby: it's decent...I only listen to it for the high notes towards the end. It kinda sounds like something you'd hear on Beyoncé's Dangerously In Love and B'Day albums 3/5<br />7. Oh Mother: Beautiful and very personal story of the abuse she and her mother suffered from her father and thanking her mother for leaving that situation before it was too late <3 brings tears to my eyes depending on what mood I'm in. 5/5<br />8. FUSS Interlude: Cleverly titled but very catty. This is Xtina bitching out songwriter Scott Storch(who apparently wrote some of the best songs on \\"Stripped\\") for ditching her to write songs for Paris Hilton. I am confused as to why a songwriter of Scott's caliber would want to dumb his material down for a lame like Paris but Xtina should've taken the high road. The album did just fine without him :) 1/5<br />9. On Our Way: too long and boring. it might have been a little easier to get into without that long a** piano intro 3/5<br />10. Without You: Beautiful lyrics. I love hearing Xtina's sensitive side. 4/5<br />11. Still Dirrty: A message to all the butthurt haters who criticized her for being too sexual during the Stripped era! She read those haters for the heavens and shaded them DOWN!  The bridge is my favorite part!  I get so much life from this song 5/5<br />12. Here to Stay: great message and vocals but it has the same flaws as Slow Down Baby. The music reminds me way too much of than tacky mid-2000s hip-hop sound >___> 3.5/5<br />13. Thank You: this song seems a bit self-indulgent to me. Nothing wrong with thanking your fans but I could've lived without her playing those voice messages praising her for 5 mins 2/5<br />14. Enter the Circus: nothing really to say about his. It was interesting tho<br />15. Welcome: Talks about the pressures and struggles of staying relevant in the music business. Almost a foreshadowing of where Xtina's career is now :( 4/5<br />16. Candyman: LOVE! That long note she sustains at the end >>>>>>>>> your fav's existence 5/5<br />17. Nasty Naughty Boy: Don't act like you don't feel this song in your private parts! 5/5<br />18. I Got Trouble: the most vintage-sounding track on this album. More songs like this and Candyman would've made B2B a much better album. This is where Xtina shows the most vocal control. The vocal runs were precise and actually fit in with the music and she didn't overdo anything 5/5<br />19. Hurt: a heartbreaking tearjerker reminding us to always cherish our loved ones while they're with us. You never know what'll happen to them tomorrow... 5/5<br />20. Mercy On Me: Xtina confessing all the sins she committed during the Stripped era :P jk lol it's a great song though 5/5<br />21. Save Me From Myself: This is Xtina at her most vulnerable. Not that I mind heroversinging and vocal acrobatics but it is nice to hear her tone it down once in a while :) if you liked Blessed and Too Beautiful For Words, you'll love this song! 5/5<br />22. The Right Man: kk...great lyrics and vocals...but the song is just too long and repetitive. it just drones on and on and on... I just stop the album here most of the time 2.5/5<br /><br />Overall, B2B is a solid album. I just wish the album was as old-fashioned as Xtina made it out to be. I get that it was supposed to be vintage jazz/blues with a modern twist but the bulk of the tracks ended uo sounding like 70s funk blended with 90s hip-hop. Think of Beyoncé's first two albums and you'll know what I mean. This is not her best album by a long shot (Stripped, Christina Aguilera, and Mi Reflejo are far superior) but it's still better than Bionic and it slays like 99% of other 2000s music<br /><br />What I really love about this album is that it brings back memories of her best era. She was taken seriously as an artist, singing the kind of music she wanted to sing, and she was getting attention for her talent, her music, and her success instead of her weight problems and those fake feuds with her fellow judges on The Voice *rolls eyes*<br /><br />I'm not holding my breath for a comeback either. Your Body was supposed to be her comeback single (even the haters loved it) but for whatever reason she chose not to promote it so it flopped. To make matters worse, Lady Gaga is releasing a new album soon so it seems that Xtina will be in her shadow once again *sigh* Lotus is getting even less promotion than Bionic did, which leads me to believe that Xtina doesn't even care about her career anymore. Sad... Oh well I'm still buying the album ^_^ 2 MORE DAYS! Judging from the 5 tracks she released on VEVO, i have a feeling Lotus will be amazing! It might even be up there with Stripped.  I wasn't a fan of \\"Make the World Move(feat Cee-Lo)\\" or Blank Page but Just A Fool(feat. Blake Shelton), Army of Me, and Let There Be Love are awesome songs and they sound single-worthy.  Hopefully Xtina will promote them accordingly.  Idk how many flops it's gonna take for her to realize the importance of promotion but...I'll just keep my fingers crossed. It's not likely that this album will be a number 1 but if it at least out-sells Britney's Phlegm Fatale album, I'll be satisfied. #BUYLOTUS
B002PEP4SC|4.0|&#34;Heat Wave&#34; is a novel that is often referenced in the TV show &#34;Castle.&#34;  On the TV series novelist Richard Castle has finished off his series of books about agent Derrick Storm and in seeking a new protagonist for his next series of books, calls in favors from the mayor to be allowed to shadow homicide detective Kate Beckett.  She is far from overjoyed about the situation.  After following her through a number of cases he writes the first book in his new series.  He renames Kate:  Nikki Heat and thus is born the novel Heat Wave in which Detective Heat is shadowed by a magazine writer named Jamie Rook (chess players have to love it.)  There are definite differences between Rook and Castle.  Rook never seems to listen to Heat's directions and often puts everyone's lives in danger as a result.  The relationship between the writer and detective moves much more quickly toward a physical one in the book than it does in the TV show (and even this fact was referenced on the TV show.)<br /><br />Still I think if you enjoyed the TV series and other shows of the past like &#34;Moonlighting,&#34; that you will enjoy  this book as well.  By the way, the author (the fictional Richard Castle) also has out other Nikki Heat novels and even a couple short read Derrick Storm books as well.  The concept of using a fictional character to write books is cute, but hardly new, Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. created the character of Kilgore Trout who then wrote the real soft core sci-fi book, &#34;Venus on the Half-Shell,&#34; and others have done the same.<br /><br />Still I recommend this book for those who seek a light-hearted police procedural populated by interesting characters.
0307951529|5.0|Well written in steps that follow logically through the thought process of thinking about a business to getting it up and running. It gives you not only how to's but what other places you can go to get information. The book also does a great job of moving you from the thought process to moving quickly to get started right away. It is alot more than just the $100 bucks but also a do it now book.

0446580848|4.0|Mr. DeMille, good and great writer that he is, needed an editor on this one, an editor with a sharp eye for excess.<br /><br />Good book, as all DeMille reads are, but it took far, far too long to get to the \\"good stuff,\\" about 500 pages too long. That's too much to wade through before getting to the classic DeMille.  Laborious reading...a story that could have been, and should have been, told in 400 or so pages. At times it felt like a travel log of Yemen, rather than a Nelson DeMille thriller.<br /><br />Just tell the story, Mr. DeMille. Just tell the story.  Even John Corey's wisecracks seem to tire after awhile.  It's almost as if Mr. DeMille was getting paid by the page rather than by the story he was telling.<br /><br />Good book, but far, far too long.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really enjoyed all three books.  I started out thinking - \\"you've got to be kidding me\\" - but then I kept reading and got hooked.  Buy all three books together, you are not going to want to wait to start the next one!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John is back.  One of his best in a while.  I loved the plot and his way he made every page intersting.
B007P6PLDI|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday because he is a huge smashing pumpkins fan, and it was a perfect gift. It was exactly what I would have gotten straight fom the smashing pumpkins website, but $10 cheaper and with free shipping. Take that, Billy Corgan!
B0007GAEGC|5.0|this cd is wonderful. beautiful music and it makes it easy to see why these girls keep making great music.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I just love this series its the best. It keeps getting better and better haven't finished this third season but so far I love it

1451627297|4.0|THE PREMISE<br />11/22/63 is a story about a time traveler who attempts to prevent the assassination of JFK. Jake Epping happens upon a portal that allows him to go back in time to 1958. He can return to his own time but each time he uses the portal any previous changes he's made to the past are reset. In effect, as the book puts it, each trip back is the first trip. This creates a Groundhogs Day like effect that allows Jake to go back in time, make changes, return to the future to check on the results, and have to option to go back in time again with a clean slate if he's not happy with the results.<br /><br />THE GOOD<br />The story is really well written. I was born in 1977 so the barrier to 1958 for me is more than one of memory. But the verisimilitude is so tangible it pops right out of the book and automatically causes my mind to create associations with dozens of references in my head from that time period from the music to the types of cars to the way that people dressed and spoke.<br /><br />Time travel has been done to death but this story is just different enough that I didn't mind the cliché. Besides, the story itself isn't about time travel. It's almost more of an excuse for the author to go back to a time in his life and explore the consequences of making choices there. The characters in the story are so vivid and powerful that I found myself missing them, as is common with really good fiction, after I finished the story.<br /><br />THE BAD<br />Although the story was written by someone who grew up in the 60's the main character is of my generation and I felt like there were too many cultural and technological differences that were too easily accepted by Jake. Minorities using different bathrooms from Caucasians and it being improper for a man to stay the night at a woman's house if they weren't married are two examples. It's not that these things aren't addressed it's that Jake accepts them too easily and too readily. My mind had a lot of trouble glossing over the differences so quickly though it is entirely possible not everyone from my generation, or even the majority, would have so much trouble accepting and adapting to these differences.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />11/22/63 is a great story that flew by on my Kindle to the point where I was sad when the ride was finally over and didn't even notice that it was twice the length of a normal novel. The only thing that keeps it at four out of five stars is that I found the main character's assimilation to the past a little too smooth and the book didn't completely satisfy my appetite for all the possibilities that could come from changing history.<br /><br />Roky John Louie
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is awesome. I use it on all my android devices and it always works great. It is the first app I download on a new device. Get it, you will love it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved reading this book!  I usually don't read much but this book I had to read it was as great as everybody said!
B007HGPBRC|5.0|Reading in one sitting is not difficult because apart from another wonderfully written book by Christopher it's too short, as sadly was his life. Both the book, and his life seemed to finish un-expectantly even though Mr. Hitchens knew of his cancer for 18 months, his loss still came as a shock. Plenty of wonderful debates and interviews on YouTube. I finished up buying more copies for friends and remember starting it again as soon as I had finished the first reading.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The movie was very close to the book.  I was hoping there would be more context to the 'world', that was<br />not explained in the Movie.
B0053O89XI|5.0|One of the best shows on the air these days.  These discs are great quality.  We have no complaints whatsoever.

B001P9EQH8|1.0|This item is worthless. It distorts the sound to the point that it sounds like its being played under water.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|All who love the series will love this new novel. It is great to catch-up on the characters, find their new adventures and and unravel a mystery to boot!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I recently downloaded this app for my Kindle, and am thoroughly enjoying it!  It includes every Bible translation I can think of, and many Bible reading plans.  Right now, I am doing the 14-day reading of Battlefield of the Mind by Joyce Meyer.  I thoroughly recommend this app!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|SO the premise is very different....a crew sets out to find out human origins.  Then cue the scenes from Alien.  There is a strong female lead, a robot that looks like a human, and things that grow inside you.  Although there are some similarities to Scott's Alien, the rest of the film is an interesting take on the creation myth.  Without giving too much away it was an interesting film that may take a viewing or two to get the complete story.  Wouldn't you want to find out how we got here and meet the beings that engineered us and what if it all went horribly wrong?
B001QKSWOE|4.0|Evanovich is one of the few authors that can make me laugh out loud and still keep me guessing where the story line is heading. Love her characters! Who else could come up with a guy who fart's fire and make it somehow believable? And, did I mention hilarious? Enjoy the read!
B000H6H81Q|5.0|This is a high-quality realistic model.  You can't tell from just looking at the picture, but it's not your standard lightweight cheapo plastic toy.  My six year old and three year old boys love this addition to their \\"dinosaur\\" collection.  Just be careful - it's heavy enough it hurts if you drop it on your foot.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|, i trh to.<br />press the buttons but i end up having to press the buttons  like an inch left and up from where they really are. needs work. buttons are messed up
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I really liked the twists in this book! I couldn't put it down! I enjoy books that are on the dark side!
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Jack Reacher does it again, there is nothing he can.t do? I enjoy his character very much, and the situations he gets himself in and out of are very very great reading. I hope Lee Child keeps this character for a long time it is very good reading and fully recommended.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|The theology in this book is very much \\"new age\\".  It bears little resemblance to Christian teachings on these matters. It was interesting and I especially enjoyed the medical descriptions of his condition.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|the cars in this game stink I hate them the ones in gangster Miami are awesome these stink bad I mean really bad
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is the science fiction which started from the question of 'what if' and the adaptation of human in a closed multi-floored structure called a silo.<br /><br />The characters were nicely developed. The narration felt like looking from the main character's point of views trying to make sense of what was happening while the mystery was unfolded intriguing readers to continue reading. The author did a very nice job telling enough details to give readers the big picture of the scenes and environments but leave space in details and the gaps in the story enough for the imagination to fill.<br /><br />Consider the first volume, [[ASIN:B005FC52L0 Wool]], as prologue. If you love the storytelling and would like to explore more, you will love the whole series.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|it wont download for me its annoying I'm mad now thanks rizio hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi
B0013816GK|1.0|Giulini left a number of great recordings of this work but this is not one of them because of inadequate soloists. Sharon Sweet had anything BUT a sweet voice (usually strident) while Vinson Cole might have done well in Mozart was badly over-parted here. Simon Estes never had a good voice, certainly nothing to complete with Siepi, Ghiaurov, Vinco, or Tozzi. Florence Quivar sings ok but contributes nothing special. Anyone who gives this 5 stars - unless specifically for Giuini and the Berlin - need to use ear cleaner. If you want Giulini, look to any of his earlier performances especially the Edinburgh 1960 on Myto. Now THERE is a 5-star performance, not this lacklustre travesty.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|The replacement has a much more substancial connector than the one that came with unit. This makes it much easier to use.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Even though I know this book was written way before the movie, it has taken me nearly 23 years to read this book.  I saw The Wizard of Oz when I was 5 years old and have been in love with it ever since.  This is a great example of how the book is always better than the movie.  It is very hard for me to find a book that i can stay interested in, and i read this book in 3 days.  I would recommend this book  to anyone.  Plus, you can't beat the price of FREE!!!!
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Rear product coming from Hollywood. Throwback to the stories from fifties and sixties. Great actors tell story rarely seen coming from American cinematographers. Worm family comedy that looks like fantasy but can relate to almost any family.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is fun and challenging.  It seemed easy at first but eventually as more squares were added to the grid and more flows were added it became more complicated.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|First, I love the graphics.  The sound is good. The red bird with the lightsaber is fantastic.  He has a lot of power for a tiny bird.  However, I have complaints with the game.  I don't mind the $2.99 to buy the app, but I resent having to pay again for another level in the game.  If they want to charge again, they should call it a new game.  Rovio did this in Angry Birds Space with the last &quot;free update.&quot;  There was 1 level and you had to pay extra for the rest of the levels in the supposedly free update.<br /><br />Another complaint I have with Star Wars is that I have found two golden eggs but no way to get them.  I have used 6 Millennium Falcons to get the one on the ledge in 1.13 and can't even get it with that.  I may be aiming it wrong, but without written instructions explaining how to use it, I'm lost.  Pictures don't help me.<br /><br />That brings up another complaint I have about this game.  We were not warned that there are in game purchases to get us to spend even more money.  Yes, you can earn the power ups, but not all children will understand that and spend money they shouldn't.  Even so, once I buy a game for an agreed upon price, I resent being charged more to play it.<br /><br />I love the way the game plays and I believe developers should be paid for their work.  However, I also believe they should be honest about what they are charging for the full game.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game will offer hours and hours of good clean fun!  there are a wide variety of choices of food to choose from and you can freely choose how to decorate your restaurant.
B007FGQ4DE|5.0|This is one of the best live albums ever recorded. This is my favorite Lou Reed album. The extended guitar intros and the total vibe of this record make you feel as though you are at the show. This is a Desert Island Disc without question! A must for Lou Reed fans and all Rock 'N' Rollers!!
B0091REZMW|3.0|so far its ok. it runs a little slow. not sure yet if I will keep it or delete it. graphics are reasonably good though.

B003568FR6|5.0|Absolutely kicks your butt. My boyfriend is a state champion cyclist (blah blah..I'm just trying to convey that he is in GOOD shape - I am not!) and he started doing this with me. We both finish  absolutely exhausted. I start being able to complete each level without cheating around day 6 or 7, then it's on to the next level. I started at 5'4\\" 140lbs and got down to 138 doing the first two levels (averaging 5 or 6 days a week). 2 lbs isn't that impressive, but my clothes fit so much better and I can tell a huge difference in the shape of my body. My boyfriend and I are both huge fans, and will be trying her other videos next!
B005LAIGZU|5.0|This is like a chore that i have to review this. I am active duty, an officer and have worked in operations and intelligence.  I am up to the 69th minute in the movie so far and everything is legit. I have seen reviewers just paint the web with opinions. If you are not educated on the subject dont review it. I dont critique Dali or Monet, Im not an artist. So please if you think this is boring dont join the military and dont knock what happens to be very accurate.  Anyone who thinks michael bay and shia lebouf should have been in this needs to just stick with their garbage entertainment and stay out of the military reference library.  (For adults only)
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I have trouble putting the book down. DeMille's sense of humor is marvelous! He mixes history, actuality, and fiction so perfectly. Already, I am awaiting his next novel.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great way to interact with others and share a variety of hobbies, interests, and likes. Thanks for including Kindle Fire users. The app is sooo much simpler and makes sharing fun!
B007X4ECMI|3.0|I decided to watch this on Netflix Streaming (available as of 11/12/12), and expected a dud due to critic and audience reactions; I was pleasantly surprised. Lockout follows Snow as he is convicted of a crime he did not commit and is offered freedom if he rescues the President's daughter from the maximum security space prison MS One, which the prisoners have taken control of. It is a mindless yet enjoyable action film, which may only be enjoyable if you try to turn off your mind for an hour and a half.<br /><br />First, I enjoy the concept of a space prison and having to conduct a rescue mission. But, the characters and story generally feel formulaic and bland. Snow is a smart alec with plenty of witty responses, but sometimes his lines were cliché and boring, and what is supposed to be funny feels forced; he does have some humorous lines and scenes, though. Also, the story is mostly predictable, including the generic ending; you can see it coming from a mile away, cause most blockbuster action films end this way. It really doesn't try anything new, and it doesn't try to separate itself from the horde of other blockbuster action films that release constantly. And, if you think about it, the story only progresses because the characters make stupid decisions over and over. However, if you can get past these flaws, the film does have action from beginning to end; it has edge of your seat chases, and thrilling shootouts. The special effects are mostly great and effective in creating the SciFi-like atmosphere. The acting was good, not bad but not stunning or spectacular either.<br /><br />Overall, if you can get past the many minor/significant flaws (depending of the type of moviegoer you are), Lockout is a fun, action-packed movie. Recommend for fans of blockbuster action movies.<br /><br />Lockout has strong violence and blood, no sex or nudity.
0756688701|5.0|I work with pre-schoolers who love the Cars movies.  We have been playing with all the various cars.  Sometimes we don't know the name of the the specific car. We look in this book.  It's a great souce of information for the pre-schooler or older child or adult who collects these toys.<br /><br />Its for a child to learn the names of the various cars.  They will  never  get tired of looking through thius book.  It was well worth the price. The pictures and information are a great source of information and delight.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book.
B004J4WN0I|4.0|Nice urban legend, using a cast from a mythology I had seldom had heard from, a Celtic pantheon.  The writing was good with a great plot.  Enjoyable read.
B008OOYALE|5.0|The first game I have played that gives gold for quest/other games the developer creates. Amazing game and loving every moment that I play it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have a son in heaven and sometimes a get little miracles to remind me he's happy and not really that far but every once I have doubts and I get scared. Thus I need proof of heaven to go on. This book reaffirmed what josh has already told me. Thank you Dr. Even Alexander for having the courage to share the gift that God has given you. I celebrate my sons life! Every day because I know that he is happy!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|this is by far the best hidden object game I have ever played, and there have been many! totally held my interest.  waiting for the sequel and hope it will available soon. thanks.
B00338QENI|4.0|this was an unusual book for me to read.  I can see that our society will have plenty of questions to ask about medical discoveries and genetics.  I hope this family finds some peace withit someday.
1878424777|4.0|very good, opened my mind.  once you get past someof the passages and start to hear what is said it is good
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I have found these novels interesting.  I can follow the families through their lives and learn about history as it unfolds.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Same feel as The Royal Tanenbaums.  Same writers and directors.  This is possibly a movie for a depressed viewer.  I enjoyed this better than the last few flicks made by the brothers.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The title of this review is an oxymoron because I felt it was deep enough to at least come close to accurately representing this book.<br /><br />Let me start by saying this book is a tear jerker but meaning full and definitely a good one.<br /><br />Its more challenging then most things I've read (I'm 14) but I really enjoyed it. It challenges you enough to make you really think, about life, death, everything in between, and if there really is much in between...or if it even matters.<br /><br />The main characters are unusual and peculiar but they make you laugh. Not cheap humour but pure unadulterated comedy. Yet it still manages to portray serious topics in a way that makes you really care.<br /><br />The book has a spectacular plot. Unique and extremely creative! Rich with love and honestly creating a characters life that makes you marvel at the depth of some peoples (John Greens)imagination.<br /><br />To put it simply I loved it but I cannot describe it accurately . It wouldn't sound right. You must simply read it and form your own opinion !!
B008NB0SQO|4.0|This Christmas treasure is restored to a brilliant, colorful Christmas gleam. The Blu-Ray is well worth buying if only to see the beautifully crafted sets and muppetry. Those who have seen the original theatrical release may remember a musical number sung by Bell on the Christmas Eve that she and Ebeneezer part. It is unfortunate that Disney chose not to include this number in this special anniversary edition, just as it was not included in the previous DVD release.
B004I744AS|5.0|I like to look at the main page each day.  It has all kinds of facts, quotes, word games and even Hangman.  My grandchildren love doing that with me and learning something new as well.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I love the first season and I am trying to get into the second season but I love the shows!
B0058VW36U|5.0|i totally recomend this game to anyone who is willing to buy it. i love  this game but i got stuck on some of the levels. i guess its a good thing that you can skip the levels you are stuck on and come back to them another time. hope you think my review is helpful
B005K17RU0|1.0|Precipitation totals are a good feature of this app.  However, the app is cumbersome to use and is slow.  The Weather Channel app is superior.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Really a page turner, grabs you and hangs on. What I have come to expect from such a fine writer. Looking forward to her upcoming movie!
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Unlike most hidden word games, this one actually has a story line and a variety of scenes to play through.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It was an great read.  For it to be perfect, it would have been nice for it to end with his conversation with Victor Westlake.  His threat to go to the New York Times, writer, Mr. Bell, \\"......If you don't investigate, I'm sure Mr. Bell would love to.  Front page and all that.  FBI Cover-up.\\"  Westlake says, \\"Don't do it.  Please give us some time.\\"  Max's reply, \\"You've got 30 days.\\"  Westlake, \\"You're just getting revenge, aren't you, Max?  One last shot at the government.\\"  \\"Who says it's my last?\\", Max says over his shoulder as he walks away.  (Amazon)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is a very good game. I try playing it on my phone but the screen is kinda small so I was very happy to see it in the appetite. my cousin got me hooked on it so now I play it like all day!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|It is one of best shows on tv. Sherlock and Watson make the series of the modern day Sherlock Holmes amazing to watch. I can't wait to see how the show keeps amazing me with there ability to make the show better with every episode. I know it will be a big success. Keep up the good work on the series :)
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I really like the graphics in this game and it's got so many pretty ones. It takes some thinking at times but it's very easy to play and time just flies by.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|FUN AND EASY FOR ALL AGES. I enjoy this game. So do my kids and grandkids. Its simple and fun.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|I am enjoying Angry Birds Rio and Seasons much more. I have been stuck on the last game in what I hope is the 1st set of games since I ordered it on November 8th.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|Guys, don't was time watching this series. I literally watched the entire first season in 5 days, it is that good! The tension and drama are just so well drafted you'll fall in love in an instant. Even from the first episode they managed to make you care about the cast. BUY IT!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Lots more nauseating sex scenes, but at least a bit of a story to keep you interested. I'm a sucker though...I will be reading the third.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|Imported a few videos for trip and it has worked great ! recognized all video types, easy to set up. Remembering playback position is sometimes an issue, but other than that I think I've found an app I will use a lot!
B00914JWSW|5.0|I have been listening to Barbra Streisand for at least 35 years and she is still amazing. Great song choices and her voice is still as pure and glorious as ever!
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|If you are expecting the all out, in-your-face, terror of the Alien movies, or the subsequent Predator vs. Alien spinoffs -- which should all crash together one day -- this is a much lower key affair.  Some have criticized the over-emphasis on character development, but I would say it's about time given the fact that special effects are now more important than plot or actors in most sci fi...  And Mr. Scott does nothing to diminish the involvement of top quality special effects to tell this story.  Yes, you do get the usual, \\"idiot about to die\\" alerts that are consistent with Grade B movies -- the two geologists who get lost trying to get out of the dome for example...  But the dazzling Noomi Rapace, as always on key Charlize Theron, eerily brilliant Michael Fassbender, a great job by Idris Elba and Guy Pearce, in a very clever role, cleverly blend the tech with the plot to produce a very slick film.  Ridley Scott has grown up and I've grown up along with him -- and this is a great movie.  I will admit that I had to watch it several times before it really struck home, but there was something compelling from the get go to make me want to watch it until I absorbed it all.
B008F5YDRI|4.0|Enjoyable, although it requires  a bit of tolerance from experienced salmon fishermen.  An example of tradition-bound peoples resistance to change.
B003VR5PPY|2.0|This game punishes experimentation by wasting a lot of time slowly displaying the text that tells you that the action you were trying doesn't work.  I finally got so sick of it on one puzzle that I quit and sold the game.  I wasn't too far in... It was just way too annoying.
B008QTVNUI|4.0|We enjoyed the first Season so much, that we have ordered the second Season sessions. It can also be seen through a subscription to Showtime.
B009RX8MQ0|2.0|While we are still fans of this series, the 2nd season is not up to the first one. Too many story lines , ridiculous twists in storylines, and not enough of Emily getting REVENGE like in season 1. And to add to disappointment, it seems as if another season with NO BLU-RAY. Watch it in HD but can't get the dvd's that way. Mind -boggling, ridiculous.

While thier is a far more expensive alternative, I chose to buy the Opteka version.  It will allow me to tour hands free.  For the few opprotunities I have a need for a camera carrier, this will do the job.  It is well made and serves my needs.  I recommend it fort anyone loooking for this alternative.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|We had so much fun watching this movie with our kids.  The music brings you back to the eighties!  There were some cheeky parts but that just added to the fun of the movie.
B0095P341S|1.0|If you paid the $80 for Prime, be aware that you aren't allowed to watch movies in HD unless you're on an Xbox, iPad, etc.  No HD for PCs, at least for movies (or at least for this movie), it seems.  Hence, the low score.
B008FSCNTK|3.0|The material selected for the CD was not what I was use to hearing from Diana. Its hard to differentiate her singing from the material if it is not your bag. Having said that, there are cuts which are excellent and were worth the price of the CD. It does take a listen or two to warm up to the material.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My kids get so frustrated playing but they are so excited to solve the puzzles.  Great getting those little brains solving.

B0087HT36U|5.0|I first played Siege Hero on my iPod Touch and almost bought an iPad just to play it on a bigger screen.  Fortunately, it was released for Android so I now have it on my phone as well as my Asus Transformer.  I read several of the negative reviews and I have to say I simply disagree with all of them.  This game is very entertaining, easy to understand but challenging to master and, IMHO, head and shoulders above Angry Birds.  And just in case anyone thinks this is a \\"fake\\" review, I hereby confess that I'm 67 years old and therefore don't have the time or incentive to fake reviews!  I have spent hours playing this game and have reset it (zeroing out scores and forcing me to start over) on all my devices more than once.  Take my word for it, you do not have to use the Blockbuster Bombs if you take time to understand every aspect of the more difficult levels.<br /><br />Get it, play it, love it!
B008KE3960|5.0|This game will have you frantically shooting at tanks with your air squadron.  The free version has a few hours of unique play, for $2 you can unlock all levels for days of frantic finger tracing.  Works well on my HP Touchpad running ICS, unsure how well it would play on a smaller phone screen.  Highly recommended.

1421550644|5.0|Just as I point newcomers to \\"Grave of the Fireflies\\" as a seminal example of good anime (as opposed to the stereotypes between Pokemon and Dragonball), I would say Nausicaa is the one manga any newcomer to the medium should read. Well, or just anyone who appreciates imagery and text. This series contains great textual content as well as highly detailed drawing; there's nothing cartoonish or comic about it.<br /><br />Make no mistake: The story of Nausicaa has an epic scope. It's highly complex and not appropriate for children unless they can grasp the finer points and are able to comprehend its darker tones, since this is a complete story from beginning to end that requires good memory.<br /><br />It features several major cultures involved with their own civil unrest and break-off groups, ruthless war and its effects on civilians, life and death, military maneuvering, political intrigue, enemies who are not merely enemies, religious oppression, post-apocalypse, a bit of science fiction, and at the core--one of Miyazaki's favorite topics--environmentalism. All of this is given life and meshed together into a grimy mess of opposing yet sympathetic human characterizations.<br /><br />While the series does feature one of my less favorite tropes (\\"the chosen one\\" hero), it's spun in that our main character is a girl capable of many things from the very onset. For a series written in the '80s to early '90s, that's rather interesting. She's no Disney princess.<br /><br />In terms of art, the air battles and action scenes are convincing with great perspective, and the entire setting (backgrounds, from ground cover to smoky skies) is tremendously detailed to add depth and a solidly immersive look. Much of the sketchy detailing has to do with Miyazaki using pencil instead of pen inking. The world of Nausicaa is quite alive on the pages.<br /><br />I wish I could say something about the quality of translation, which can be hit or miss in so much imported media, but I'm not fluent in Japanese to make an assessment. It does read well, though (\\"There's not much difference between being at the mercy of desire and being a prisoner of hate\\"). The cast is strong, both male and female of different ages, and spans vast geographical territories, so this should appeal to many readers.<br /><br />I wouldn't say it's perfect, but if there was only one manga (series) I could make people read, it would be Nausicaa.<br /><br />P.S.: Anyone who has seen Studio Ghibli's other works will recognize quite a few elements.
B0098VXE50|1.0|I can't rate this because I have never seen this movie, and I bought it as a Christmas gift for my adult son.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|You will not be disappointed in this movie. It was very well done and the scenery was depictive. The characters were likeable both young and old. It is not a picture solely about old people as I thought it was before I saw it. I thought it might be creepy but it was delightful.
B004GXAZL6|4.0|Though it has a lot of things going on, it does keep you engrossed especially in the second half. Enjoy
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like that its old fashioned fun and games.  granted there's no blowing up or gaming skills. its just simple and fun.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Rowling digs deep into the dark underbelly of the mind and of the ego itself. Her characters are self centered and often nasty people but they are also very human. As someone who works in Social Work I felt her description of drug and poverty addiction was very accurate. I was never a fan of the 'Harry Potter' books because I am not interested in Fantasy and Wizards but I can see now that Rowling is a major talent.
B008S80OU2|4.0|The link for the free concert downloads works now.  It is somewhat of a pain that you have to download them track by track but the downloads are super fast and in 320 KBPS quality.  The quality of the shows and the overall performances are fantastic! The only thing I noticed is that the song tag information for track one of The Santa Monica Civic Center show is wrong. It will display as \\"Stairway To The Stars\\" but is really supposed to be \\"R.U. Ready 2 Rock\\". Easy to just re-edit the track properties and properly tag.<br /><br />I have never been a fan of cardboard slipcases but the trade off for great quality sounding CD's and a low price point makes this box set well worth the purchase.  This box set was originally supposed to sell between $140 and $160 and is now $112.61!  You are getting sixteen CDS (including two discs of un-released and rare stuff), a DVD and a link to download four albums worth of live concerts. Do the math!<br /><br />The liner notes are short and kind of ramble on .  One can always go to Wikipedia to get a good reading on the history of BOC.<br /><br />I also wish the DVD was a complete show as two of BOC's biggest hits (Godzilla and Don't Fear The Reaper) are oddly left off of the performance!<br /><br />So aside from a few minor gripes, the CD sound quality and amount of music you get for your \\"$BOC\\" makes this box set well worth the purchase!
0385344333|5.0|Great book. I have read the whole series which features Jack Reacher, ex-military cop who just wants to live life as it comes only somehow he always finds trouble even though he never goes looking for it. Always action packed and a mystery to unravel. Can't wait for the next book to come out.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This Kindle Fire has been a lifesaver.  My husband stays mostly in bed and spends a lot of time looking up information and playing games on his kindle.  For a person that thought he would never learn how to operate a computer, he has mastered it and continues to learn more everyday.  Easy to learn and lots to do with this Kindle.
B0053O89WY|5.0|This show is absolutely hilarious...At least once an episode I laugh out loud.  When you buy these, be sure to watch the blooper reels.  They're always super funny.  =)
B008OOYALE|4.0|Love the game! Any fantasy fan will enjoy these dragons. Along with everyone else! The designs are original &amp; setting out your dragon island is challenging.
B003MC5N28|5.0|This is a great read for all ages. I reread this book every time a new one came out in this series and I was excited to see \\"Son\\" come out that tied into this first of the series. I came across 'The Giver' in a middle school reading program - I always wondered what happened after the end of the book and was excited when the series continued. I'm in my 70's now and this book has been one I've passed down to my children and grandchildren as a must read.
B0053O89KG|5.0|I had missed a good portion of season 4 due to work. It was great to get to catch up on the complete season and BOY am I glad that I did!! I had missed some of the best moments of the season.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Good movie to watch on a cold, rainy Saturday afternoon. Even though the main actors were over 35, it was refreshing to see that they still had it---a vitality and joy for life.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|Plot was a little ridiculous and used to much cg. And it seemed like it moved to quickly but it was good for killing time.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Helpful little app to keep track of anything you need to remember.  Love the organizational options, allows you to separate by function and not just have one long, rambling list or set of notes.  Works well for task listings, project memos, to do lists, etc.  The drawing function is also great for \\"napkin\\" type notes.
B008FPOIT6|2.0|Bought the e version of the book because The Economist gave it a good review. Disappointing. Infantile & derivative. All about secret codes & secret societies. Plodding, no suspense.  Definitely for juveniles: cannot understand why The Economist reviewed it, except for travelers to doze over while on long distance flights.
B002612RQ6|5.0|It was a great movie. Just like I bought it at a store. The only thing was it took a while to get it in the mail.

B008OOYALE|5.0|This is a lot of fun, always trying to get new dragons added to your stables. The going is kinda slow at first but starts to pick up later on. Also if you can get a small group of frkends and send gold every day it helps immensely.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Got this as the AOTD and it has been great. Easy to start with and it gets more challenging. Cool power ups and fun to play every time.
0345803507|2.0|I wasn't really a fan of this book. I got it because so many people were raving about it. I don't like to judge things based on other people's opinions, but I won't ignor a billion people saying how good it is, so I got the series and decided to see for myself. I don't like the writer's style at all. She or he, I don't know likes to pick words, or phrases and reuse them over AND OVER again within the same few pages or chapters. THat's just a personal pet peeve of mine. I find it really lazy and uncreative. THe story like doesn't do it for me either. I think Christian Gray is a creep and I think Ana is super annoying. I don't know if people like it mainly for the sex scenes, but those are boring too, unless you like reading the same thing over and over again. I got all three books waiting for the series to get better, but it never did. I didn't like it, but obviously a lot of other people did. If you're curious though I'd say just do what I did and read them to judge for yourself. The only thing I'd recomend is that if you think you wasted your money on the 1st book, don't try to push through the rest like I did. They are very much similar.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Perceus Jackson *SPOILERS* finally  faced the prophecy and maanaged to get a kiss from anabeth/a girlfriend and a new special power invincibility
B007SGLZP8|5.0|At first I thought it was a little slow, but now it seems to be<br />another John Grisham must read.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Definitely keeps you reading. Fast-paced and surprising. You will want to continue the series. Great heroine that is not at all flat or stereotypical.
0553801473|5.0|I'm about 100 pages from the end of this book.  This book is fortunately just as good as the other four and the quality and depth of the story and characters has not become superficial or predictable, which is what happens when deadlines and money overrule quality and imagination.  Words may be wind but in this book they are hurricanes!!!  Another terrific book for our American Tolkien!!
B004LFO0ME|4.0|i brought cd yesterday on the 10th of this month it wasnt too bad my best track is 4 roll up thats my sh**t right there but i the whole album is ok this my first wiz album im looking forward to buy the next album n december. I was sleeping on this cat
B0053O89WY|5.0|We have loved Big Bang Theory since the beginning.  We watched the whole season 5 in one sitting.  Would definitely watch again.  Bazinga!
B008S80OU2|5.0|This box set is cheap, especially considering its size.<br /><br />Cons: Downloads don't work (yet)<br />no liner notes and tiny booklet<br />cd slipcases are flimsy
B000QCQ9O8|1.0|I attempted reading this book twice and just could not get into it. I found the characters rather difficult to fathom. Lots of long winded descriptions of characters and scenes. I saw so many 5 star reviews and thought that this would be a worthwhile book to read. It was boring and uninteresting. There were petty incidents that were banal. I just gave up quarter way through after having felt that I had an overdose of descriptive writing that somehow led nowhere. This book is a disappointing read.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love this version of angry birds. Rio is the best one yet. Wish they had angry Birds Rio 2. Great for kids & Adults as well.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I am a huge Star Wars fan, and love playing the Angry Birds series. Now to have the two of them together is awesome!! Now if they would do Angry Birds and Indiana Jones, life would be whole and just!!
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|i thought it was really cool, but you only get like thirty seconds until it forces you to buy the complete one. most games let you play entirely, but with less stuff. not this one. 30 SECONDS! come on. not worth getting.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I liked it very much.  Am waiting for the last two movies. Glad the hero's got to live and raise a family.
1936608898|5.0|Excellent book for those wanting to change their life!! Easy to read and great to give as gifts for those who are open to a change but don't know how to start.
B007EECSFA|5.0|As a fan of historical novels, I have enjoyed every one of Kate Morton's books as they seem to encompass periods from history along with the present time period. The Secret Keeper is well-researched and her character development really brings them to life.  Some novels that jump back and forth between time periods can be confusing but this one has enough clarity to prevent any confusion of who the characters are.  I also like the bit of mystery that keeps you involved with the story right to the very end.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|My favorite of the  series was Catching Fire, but this one seals the story. A different type of action with the Capital playing mental games with Katniss. Great finish to a series.
B009329ZF2|5.0|I hesitated renting this movie after all the \\" so so \\" reviews. I totally dissagree. I thought this movie was excellent. The special effects were awsome. The story action packed all the way through. I give it a two thumbs up....
B00555X8OA|2.0|Just repeat and repeat the same points by all chapters, bored and lost intention to read till the end .
B0098VYCCE|5.0|I recommend this movie. I thought it would be some boring twist on the old story - \\"Wrong\\". It was a captivating story with some pretty cool special effects. I would rent it over again, it's that good !
B003KGBIRU|2.0|Other reviewers will give you the gist of the storyline, so let me just tell you that I didn't care for this much at all. I have mostly liked Wes Anderson's previous films, though I have found many of the characters or attitudes seemingly promoted in them rather repulsive. It's much the same here, except that this time there was nothing I found truly positive or endearing, as was the case in, say, Rushmore or in particular The Royal Tenenbaums -- or more recently, Moonrise Kingdom. In Darjeeling Limited, in fact, I found none of the major characters endearing at all, and only a few of the supporting ones. What don't I like about these people? Their apparent self-absorption and narcissism, their irresponsible attitudes and -- to be prudish -- their addiction to smoking. (In passing, I have to say that it's one of the major irritants to watching a Wes Anderson film: His apparent desire to glamorize a silly, stupid and destructive addiction that some people indulge in seemingly for the pretentious reason that it makes them feel creative and rebellious. What adolescent crap. But I digress....) There is some gorgeous photography, nice editing, and snippets of smart writing, but it's all too self-conscious and conceited for my tastes. I grant that Anderson touches upon meaningful issues of family and loss and belonging, but by now he now seems to do it in a repetitive, formulaic and quirky manner rather than with a varied, novel and thoughtful approach. What we get here are weaker and weaker echoes of prevous films. Maybe it's for you, but it's definitely not for me.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|A very good triller. Reacher is back. Action throughout the whole book.I have read all the Reacher novels and this one is as good as the best ones I have read.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Patricia Cornwall has been one of my favorite authors for years now.  I have to say that with this book, she has exceeded her normal writing.  This book kept my attention from the time I began it through to the end.  The twists and turns throughout the plot keep the reader wondering where she is going next and how the book will end.  I was definitely not disappointed in this book.  For those that have read her for years, this is one of her best.  Enjoy!
B000REQT86|5.0|The first time I bought Nosferatu, it was on VHS. The music score was brilliant. Subsequent versions, not so much. Where can I get a dvd with that score?
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I hate disagreeing with fellow readers but I have now read ALL of Patricia Cornwell's books and love the last 3 just as much as I did the first 3 that got me hooked on her series! Kay, Benton, Lucy and Marino are just as real to me as people I see and speak with every day. I sincerely hope she continues with the series fir several years to come!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My 7 year old grandson loves this game!  He will play it until the Kindle needs recharging!  Very few things can you get for free now days that keep a child entertained this well.
0812984412|2.0|I found this one of the most grueling books I have ever waded through, and I'm not opposed to reading confusing and trying content.  I suppose I'm just not sophisticated enough, but I couldn't wait to get to the last page and delete it off my Kindle.  The story line was somewhat interesting, but not overly so.  The entire book, to me, was just a lead up to the final \\"moral\\" the author wanted to get across.  Hope the movie is more enjoyable.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|An amazing trip. Just as catching as the first two. I didn't want to read it too fast but I couldn't put it down.
B001HC8516|5.0|I got this book on my kindle and enjoyed it so much, I ended up reading it over the phone to my sil in a different state. We both laughed a lot and learned a little. Sadly we are both now single but just a little more fabulous.
0345803485|1.0|Horrible.. I cannot believe how much recognition this book is getting.. it is written for teens .... so much better books out there
B000YMDQQ4|5.0|I've always enjoyed Neil Gaiman, and his short stories are perfect little slices of reading entertainment. The stories are interesting and just long enough to finish during the kid's practises.  If you love Neil Gaiman, check out \\"Good Omens\\" - the funniest book I've ever read!
B0053O89WY|5.0|I bought this for my daughter for Christmas to enjoy whenever she wants to watch. I was so excited at how quickly this came in. Less than 2 weeks.

B000Q8QHK8|5.0|This is a great movie with a great cast and the picture quality on the Blu-Ray is great a few grainy scenes but they just enhance the experience. Pick it up it's worth the price especially this Digibook it's a Collector's dream!.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is a great read. I honestly enjoyed the story line of all three books.It is a very complicated and interesting story. You should check it out~
1451662432|5.0|I was skeptical when I first picked up this book, but was pleasantly surprised at how well-written it is. It shows Arnold's personality and what has made him successful (his drive and attitude). I found myself wanting to keep reading... The stories are very good, and nostalgic for me, because I grew up in the era when he was very popular for both bodybuilding and acting. I also learned more about the Kennedy/Shriver family that I didn't know before, as well as political issues that he dealt with as governor. I would definitely recommend this book if you like Arnold. I believe he was very honest in writing this book and I found it entertaining.
B003VBNN7C|4.0|One of my all time favorite movies.  Quality of viewing was very poor, but Amazon was extremely helpful and refunded my price.  Would try to rent again!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a very well-written book, but the twists and turns were INSANE! For me, this is a one-time-only read.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This book kept my interest.  Never trust anybody!  The good or the bad.  Judges, FB I agents, attorneys, or drug dealers.
B00913P6G0|5.0|It's been years since I've heard a rap album of this caliber. It's uplifting and fun at the same time.  Introspection, misogynistic bravado, smooth beats, straight up great rhymes, this albums has it all.  You get your money's worth, there is not one bad song on the entire album.  Support good music, buy it, listen to it on MOG, just don't pirate it.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I always enjoy reading John Grisham's books, and this book is no exception.  Grisham has the ability to create flawed characters--sometimes badly flawed--who are nevertheless compelling, interesting, and likable.  It also seems to me that every time the lawyer Grisham gets something up his craw about the law that seriously bothers him, the writer Grisham goes to work.  The same is true in this novel, I think.  I figured that the good--but flawed--main character was going to win in the end--Grisham's good guys do--but the ending is even more complex and compelling than I had anticipated.  The Racketeer is a good read--and a quick read.
B0086700CM|3.0|Fun when first played but instructions are inadequate. What's with the money for coins, etc.?<br />Goals and long range plays seem undefined.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Someone has broken into the most secret files of MI6 and stolen a very important list which, if released, would compromise a great many agents--a list of agents who have infiltrated and are spying on certain terrorist groups around the world. Bond must get that list, or else. But when he finds himself grappling with the thief on top of a train that is about to enter a tunnel, an order from M to a field agent on the ground below sends Bond plummeting to what appears to be certain death in the waters below.<br /><br />Assuming Bond is dead, M has problems of her own, starting with new boss Gareth Mallory (Ralph Fiennes), who gives her two months to tie things up and take her well-deserved retirement. Out with the old, in with the new. And the fact that someone has hacked into her private files is most disturbing, someone who keeps asking if she's ready to atone for her sins. Perhaps someone from her past?<br /><br />Bond returns (of course he's not dead, what kind of Bond film would that be?) after learning of a terrorist assault on MI6. One that was not calculated to kill M, but to be a message to her. Their relationship is rocky--he can't forget the sound of her voice saying, \\"Take the shot.\\" Although he does find it in his heart to forgive the lovely agent who made the shot. James' physical condition is of concern as well, as he learns when he is forced to re-test in order to be let back out into the field, and his shooting skills suck, and his stamina isn't what it used to be.<br /><br />When M releases Bond for duty, he is sent to Shanghai, after the man who stole the list. His pursuit leads him to a casino in Macau, and a frightened woman who wants the mastermind of the plot to die--if James can survive to do it. They both end up as hostages of Silva (a blond Javier Bardem), a former agent from M's days in Hong Kong.<br /><br />And then, of course, the plot thickens.<br /><br />I loved every minute of this film. I didn't even realize it was almost 2 ½ hours long until after I left the theater, riveted on the screen and unmindful of the passage of time. There is no doubt in my mind (if there ever was any, which I don't think there was) that Daniel Craig is the best Bond and this is the best Bond film ever.<br /><br />One of the things that makes Craig the best is his performance. He makes James real, not just another pretty face (although he is that too). He gives him depth and fleshes him out in a way that no one else ever has (sorry, Sean Connery, you're my second favorite Bond, though).<br /><br />In Skyfall, we're dealing with issues and themes that are never really touched on in the other films, such as the fact that James is getting older (as is, of course, M). In the other films, it's like they want to pretend that he's ageless, when we know better, so it's refreshing to see it mentioned, and see that James is not invincible--he's just damn good at what he does. The inevitable changing of the guard comes into play too, which is what generally happens when new management comes in, and even M is not immune to being taken out of the picture.<br /><br />The new Q is young and computer savvy, and he's also afraid of flying, a great foil against the older, more mature Bond, who looks at him at their first meeting like, are you kidding me? I hope to see more of this Q in future, and I suspect we will. It was also great to see Albert Finney, as an old acquaintance of Bond's.<br /><br />What can I say about Javier Bardem? Most awesome, sexiest villain ever. And for those of you enjoy such things (for example me) there is a scene with the most deliciously homo-erotic content between Silva and Bond. And some of the best lines.<br /><br />Bond to Silva after an exchange filled with innuendo and double entendres: \\"What makes you think it's my first time?\\"<br /><br />Priceless, I tell you, priceless!<br /><br />Plenty of action, hot men, beautiful women, intrigue... you name it, Skyfall's got it. Including a glimpse into Mr. Bond's mysterious past, and questions that are answered. The movie starts with the obligatory chase scene that is a hallmark of the series. Twists and turns you won't see coming, and things I won't give away.<br /><br />I loved every minute of this film, and can't wait to see it again! Daniel Craig is James Bond. I can't wait for the next installment, and it can't come too soon for me!
B00633W614|3.0|This is my first Jeffrey Archer book. The writing style is a strain to read, but the story is engaging. His writing could use some strong editing for sentence structure. At times, I felt I was reading some adolescent Gothic pulp. Descriptions and characters are thin, but, yes, a great story nonetheless.
0316228532|3.0|The book was ok but I had a hard time keeping interest in it. I was glad when I finished it.

B009GYSQV6|4.0|There has a lot been made of Crystal Castles decision to record their third album using analogue equipment and that somehow the duo were going to become tamer and lose their bass heavy signature sound that they had perfected on their last two albums, well any fears that was going to happen are put to rest on album opener \\"Plague\\" which will opens with a siren almost to warn the listener what is coming next and that is nearly 5 minutes of bass pounding music just the type Crystal Castles do so well.<br /><br />In fact the whole album doesn't stray too far from Crystal Castles signature sound of their first two albums. \\"Pale Flesh\\" features a Beastie Boys style beat throughout the track as Alice Glass alternates between shrieking and singing. \\"Sad Eyes\\" has a big disco beat that is meant to be played loud. The track \\"Insulin\\" which at less than two minutes long is the shortest track on the album and sounds like it has been mixed in a blender and then played backwards; if it were anybody but Crystal castles it would sound strange. There's even the beauty of Alice's vocals on album closer \\"Child I will Hurt You\\".<br /><br />If you are familiar with Crystal castles first two albums then you will know what to expect from their third album which is a lot of big pounding beats, lots of noise and some shrieking vocals. So it's business as usual from one of the most exciting electronic bands out there at the moment. At band that really have to be seen live to truly appreciate.
B004HD61KE|5.0|Okay I like the characters that make me want to see them suceed, or fail.<br />I like traveling all over with this book in my minds eye. I like this page turner that I could hardly wait for lunch or my break.

B0053O89KG|5.0|This show keeps on getting better. Season 4 was a little darker than the previous seasons, but it allowed the writers and actors to show their true talent. Perfect!
B000VDDWDS|5.0|Qué poder decir sobre una película grandiosa, bien filmada y actuada... Ya la tenía en DVD y la compré ahora por actualizarme al Bluray. La nueva edición presenta una notoria mejora en la calidad de imagen y contiene material adicional que no es desperdicio. Una buena compra y a excelente precio. Yo soy de Chile y el envío fue rápido y sin queja. El precio final definitivamente conveniente.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|i think this game is an good game it is fun and funny and me and my friends have a compition on how far we get on its it fun.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|I thought that the movie was really good.  My friend and I watched it and we loved it! I definately give Dark Shadows a 5 star rating! Its a funny movie that also has creepy parts to it too! I recommend that you watch this movie.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|After some missteps on the second season it seems like the show is going back to the quality of the first one. Great episodes so far.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|I think this is a wonderful album. It is melodic, lyrically captivating, and unique. The songs stand alone, but make for a great album ear to ear. Favorite songs are ms, something good, and Matilda. I love the vocals.<br /><br />I really think this album is something special.
B0091REZMW|5.0|this game is cool it is a good game for the family and I recommend you get it. also its free
B0096HIEE2|4.0|Sweet eye candy.....HOT HOT HOT~!  Mindless entertainment; wish the storyline had been more developed between Mike & Brooke....but overall a good movie~!!  ;0)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love this book! Even if I had already seen the movie, the book was so much more detailed, and explained a lot of things about the characters and the society of that world... Is written in such a way that I definitely couldn't put it down! I totally recommend it!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Pros: It's fast! I was replacing a system that used an Intel i7 960 LGA 1366 processor and really didn't expect to see much in the way of performance increase with the 3570K. Both the old system and new system were o/c to 4.2 GHz. After several weeks of use the 3570K is slightly faster in real world performance. Not a huge amount faster but noticeable.<br /><br />Cons: It runs hot!<br /><br />Other Thoughts: A good performance choice if you're upgrading from an older system to the Z77 chipset. At $199 delivered, it's a good value as well.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Is Skyfall better than Casino Royale? Too close to call, but after the below average Quantum of Solace, I can say that Bond is back in top form. Great action (best opening sequence ever...you know the one involving the train bit shown in all the trailers), story and acting. Daniel Craig turns in his best performance yet and truly has become a first rate James Bond. Javier Bardem plays a very weird and creepy villain here. Almost polar opposite in style (other than the bad hair) of his turn in No Country for Old Men. Judi Dench plays M brilliantly for the seventh time and gets more screen time in Skyfall than all the others combined. The two Bond girls are good. One plays a major role as Bond's \\"partner\\" and has a famous last name revealed at the end. The other is pure eye candy. 007 fans are sure to appreciate all the little gags from previous films in the series. We even get a young Q.<br /><br />So any flaws? It's maybe a little too long with some slow moving segments, but overall I loved almost every second.<br /><br />My Top 5 Bond Films (no order)<br />Skyfall<br />Casino Royale<br />Goldfinger<br />Goldeneye<br />The Spy Who Loved Me

B004DLPXAO|3.0|I read my Kindle books via my tablet computers and smartphone. The Kindle reading app is therefore the only way I access my library.<br /><br />For the most part, the Kindle reading app gives me the essentials for which I've given it 3 stars:<br />- Download and list my Kindle library.<br />- Read books.<br />- Change font size.<br />- Bookmark and notes.<br /><br />However, I have some suggestions that might really make it stand out.<br /><br />SUGGESTIONS<br /><br />- Give us the ability to choose any background and any text color. The app provides only 3 color options: white on black, black on sepia, black on white. Why limit the options? I mostly read at night while my wife sleeps, so I'm limited to white on black. Sepia and black on white are WAY too bright. Yet, white on black is still very high contrast, and my tablet casts a good amount of light around the room. Furthermore, it still fatigues my eyes, and my wife refuses to give up her e-ink Kindle reader for this very purpose. If I could select any background and text color, I could pick a black background and a neutral or dark gray for the text, or a middle to dark blue for the text. It would be so much easier on my eyes, cast less light in the room, and I might even be able to talk my wife into a tablet computer.<br /><br />- Give me a way to rename my books. If I'm reading a massive 10 book series, the Kindle titles are all over the charts. If I could give the books my own names (or \\"nicknames\\"), I could ensure they would list easily in the Kindle app browser in the proper alpha-numeric order. This would also be a great thing to do in the Kindle library itself (outside the app). Let me rename or nickname my books and sort by the nickname.<br /><br />- Give me a much better way of organizing my Kindle library. Currently I have a massive list and can search it. Let me place certain titles into subfolders and then be able to restrict access to the folders (either by visibility or password protection). My wife and I share titles on our account now, but we have some more adult-oriented selections in the list. When the kids get older and start reading, we can't let them access our library. This is more of a suggestion for the general Kindle library than the app specifically, but an important one I think.<br /><br />The Kindle app should be mature enough to allow for some options like this. Tap into the power of smartphone or tablet functionality, and give us some of these 5 star abilities.fe and I share titles on our account now, but we have some more adult-oriented selections in the list.

B0055Q5F36|4.0|While not offering as much protection as the defender series, this is a nice cover with adequate protection. It protects from dropping, and some water. I would not advise dropping it in water, but it does help keep your phone safe, and when you add a screen save it is very good at stopping damage to your phone.<br /><br />Pros: Easy to use, dual protection,<br />Cons: One color, large, no screensaver
B009WO7NQO|1.0|I paid my 3 bucks but it refuses to let me download the game. whenever I click &quot;install&quot; it tells me it experienced an error and wants me to try again.
B000L212HC|3.0|The item I had purchase came in excellent condition, on time, and as described. Recommend this seller. As quality of this movie - big stars in an average movie. The &#34;Illusionist&#34; is way much better to compare with. I personally will NOT recommend this movie to be in your collection.
B00367XA1K|5.0|I love this movie.  Great story.  Great performances. Beatty and Keaton are terrific together.  And Jack Nicholson plays a wonderful Eugene O'Neill.  Made me cry and laugh- the true test of a great film!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book got more and more interesting as I read it. At first, it just seemed like a little love story but then started to feel more like an Alfred Hitchcock script.  I don't want to say much more and spoil it for someone who wants to buy it, but I'd say it's a good read.

B004U8VWLE|1.0|This movie is a dark waste of time.  Don't bother to enter into such tragedy.  There was nothing redeeming about this movie at all.  Keep your minds and hearts on good things, not this movie.

B000FCKGPC|5.0|I don't care what folks say about the diminishing quality in later books of  the ASoIaF series - this was as good or better than the others in my opinion. While it didn't contain the action of the previous books, nor the interesting storyline of Jon Snow at the wall, I found the shift in focus from Starks & Co. to Southern kingdom dealings very refreshing.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I watched Jane Austen different novels and movies. This one the is best movie (TV) of all. Not only actors had good performace and also very close the novel Jane Austen to describe.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Minecraft Pocket Edition for Kindle is a fun, time consuming game. However, it definitely lacks some important characteristics found in the computer version, such as the ability to carry water in buckets and the absence of lava and redstone. TNT is ignitable only in survival mode, and there is no way to spawn animals. If these are not important to you, it's worth it.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This dictionary is so easy to use.  The sentences demonstrating the use of the word are relevant, and the synonym/antonym feature is especially helpful.  I can't believe we used to use 10-lb. books for all these functions!

I love that we can change the movies available when we must download because we are away from our home network.  That plus streaming video give me great flexibility when entertaining my grandchildren and I know exactly what they are watching.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I found the original quell when I first bought my kindle fire, and loved it so much that buying this sequel was a no-brainer.  It maintains the zen-like charm and gorgeous graphics of the original while adding some additional challenges...this game will soothe you and keep you thinking, all at the very same time.  The best buck you'll ever spend!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing book! Well written and grasps your attention throughout the whole book. Hard to put down. If you've read the first book you'll definitely want to follow the story line till the end.

B003YOMNCM|5.0|First of all, Jennifer Higdon's violin concerto -- of which this is the world premiere recording, played by its dedicatee -- is much the more interesting piece on this disc, and Hahn and Petrenko, with the Liverpool orchestra, give it a great workout here.  The variety of the orchestral textures, and the ways in which, in all three movements, these are put into conversation with the solo violin (and at times other solo instruments from the orchestra) is constantly engaging to the ear.  Hahn plays with great security throughout, and the DG recording captures her and the orchestra faithfully.  The long first movement starts arrestingly and even playfully, and undergoes a variety of developments throughout its 19 minutes, ending with sounds reminiscent of the opening, but now seeming eerie or haunting.  I should say that the musical language is resolutely tonal and accessible -- this isn't trivial music, but it isn't \\"difficult\\" either.  For me, the opening of the slow movement is a highlight of the piece -- even before the soloist enters it seems one of the most gorgeous pieces of orchestral writing I've heard in a long time.  The movement builds to two arrestingly distinct climaxes, from which the solo violin emerges hauntingly, and throughout the movement the writing for flute, cor anglais (or oboe?), and cello is beautiful.  The solo violin in this movement is more part of the texture than in the other movements, and the overall effect is very impressive.  The final movement is a short moto perpetuo, well carried off by soloist and orchestra, but not quite as engaging as the previous movements.<br /><br />The Tchaikovsky coupling is securely played and sounds good -- but it's dull, and not just in comparison to Higdon.  Hahn plays it very straight, and comparisons with Grumiaux (with Krenz, 1972) and Heifetz (with Reiner, 1957) find the older virtuosos having much more fun with their parts -- more rubato, more dynamic variation -- and a generally more forward pulse, with which they redeem the thematic material, which in Hahn's hands all sounds a bit alike.  But it's a handsome sounding account nonetheless, and I wouldn't let it deter you from buying this disc for the Higdon., with which they redeem the thematic material, which in Hahn's hands all sounds a bit alike.  But it's a handsome sounding account nonetheless, and I wouldn't let it deter you from buying this disc for the Higdon.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Over all nice little app for determining your remaining battery life verses you activities.  Only thing it dosn't seem to do is report your wifi video watching.
B003Y5H5BA|1.0|In the same vein as the recent movies that seems to cater a teen crowd : Ted, Project X...<br /><br />Watch scenes where the characters get stoned on drugs and smoke pot give you the laughs.<br /><br />Junk.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The movie was not great at all.  The book gives so much detail.  Also the reason why the games were invented.  Not that it was right.  But it shows how something can and does get out of hand.  I do hope our society doen't end up like that.
B003Y5H4YI|5.0|Being a rabid fan of Helen Mirren, I saw this film when it first came out, couldn't wait to buy it because it's the type of film I'll watch about once a year.<br />Besides Mirren's bravo performance, the film contains a riviting turn by both Jessica Chastain, and Tom Wilkinson as the story reaches back and forth from the 60's to present day.  Each shifting is seamless and necessary to build the characters as they mature from young idealists to the elder residue of their lives and actions.<br />The complexity of the story line is augmented by the cinematographer so that the ambience of every scene adds to the mystery as it unfolds.  The brilliant casting is perfect.<br />The bonus features are very satisfying and appropriate for so many questions this film congers up while watching.<br />The ending is gripping and just vague enough to make you think of this film for days after viewing.<br />As usual, Amazon comes through with a great price and fast shipping.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I love this case.  It makes my Kindle seem like a small book.  I carry it everywhere and I don't have to worry about damage to my Kindle. I also got the sheets to put over the screen of my Kindle for protection and they are great also!
B007REV4T8|5.0|Skyfall is hands down the best movie of 2012. If you want to see a non-stop action packed movie; with a little humor, then this is the movie to see. In fact, this may very well be the best James Bond movie to date. In Skyfall we finally get a glimple into 007's background which makes the character even more intriguing. Daniel Craig is awesome as James Bond. He brings a sense of humor to the Bond character that makes this action packed movie very entertaining on all levels. Not to be a spoiler, but there is a part in the movie in which Bond must undergo numerous tests to prove that he is fit for duty. The \\"psych evaluation\\" scene has got to be one of the funniest that I have seen on film. As always, Judy Dench was great as M and the head of MI6, but Ralph Fiennes (Mallory), Ben Whishaw(Q), and Naomie Harris (Moneypenny) are great additions to the James Bond franchise. Do yourself a favor and see Skyfall in IMAX; you will be sitting on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.
B0096HID5M|5.0|Rock of Ages is a great movie. The music keeps you moving the whole show. The cast is great, and it is everything you want from a movie; entertainment, exciting, funny, and good.<br />It isn't a must see for everyone, if you do not like musicals, don't watch it!
0553288105|5.0|Isaac Asimov was often better at short story length, but here he shows himself to be a master of the novel.<br />A wonderful tale of an alien species, in a different dimension, and its interactions with our own.<br />Thoroughly deserved the awards it won.<br />Loved it!<br />P.S.  Deserves five stars for the title alone ;)
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|This CD was recommended to me by Amazon everytime I logged in.  I had heard one or two songs on the radio and enjoyed them.  I pulled the trigger and  downloaded the album and really enjoy it as a whole.  There is definitely a hipster college folkie vibe to it with guitars and headbobbing beats.  It is a CD I can throw on and listen to without needing to skip any tracks.  Thanks to Amazon for making a great recommendation.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is super addictive and super fun. I love the challenge of this unique brain teased. You won't be disappointed.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Spielberg's Lincoln is a marvel to behold. He captures the time as well as the attitudes of that time. We meet the real Lincoln, a grieving but loving father, a man with a sick wife who has been scarred by death and the breakup of her family and still recovering from the carriage accident that almost killed her. Sally Field performance makes you feel her great pain. But also Daniel Day-lewis' performance is one of the best I've ever seen. We meet a moral man who sees what is right and will fight for it; yet knows he will not get all he wants.<br />Tommy Lee Jones plays Thadius Stevens, a politican who must trim his own sails to get the 13th ammendment passed is wonderful to watch.<br />The acting alone is also worth the movie, but also the way it is filmed and directed. the sets are perfect and gives real authentic feeling to the time.<br />Most of the words are Lincoln's and still stirr the heart.

0307949486|5.0|Okay, I admit that this book is not perfect.  It breaks a lot of rules.  There are too many characters.  The mystery plot is intriguing but not all that unusual or different.  Sometimes there are passages that go into too much detail, too much back story and they go on too long.  But the character of Lisbeth Salander is so appealing.  You just end up rooting for her even though she is a difficult character to understand.  In real life you would probably hate Lisbeth (and she would probably hate you too), but her story is so compelling and her character does things I think we all wish we could do sometimes.  She speaks her mind and doesn't give a you-know-what about what anyone thinks.  A very original and addictive character - I'm reading the next book right now and can't wait to read the third one.  I recommend this book to anyone who likes edgy crime thrillers.
B009KKLQKO|1.0|I too, am like many on here reviewing this product before it is released, which probably would be ridiculous under most circumstances, however, it is appalling that this historic 50th Anniversary tour is whittled down to half the songs and (no offense AZ) from only one concert venue? Hello? Hollywood Bowl in their own hometown would have been appropriate, if picking just one venue. (Yeah, okay, I'm from LA.....lol)  BB fans deserve better and \\"they\\" (the powers that be) know we spend money on anything that preserves the BB memory (look at what we paid for concert tickets!) and this tour should have been one of those. This should have been the FULL concert, especially for those who could not see them due to limited tour venues. Hopefully someone from the \\"powers that be\\" camp will get wind of our bitching and correct this in the future. This is truly a disappointment.
B0000A1M68|5.0|Do not watch this under the auspices that it's reality.  This is meant to be a mythic rite-of-passage tale told in a horror film's body.  The biggest clue to this interpretation:  Rutger Hauer accosts his film-wide victim, C. Thomas Howell, at a diner, has a few words with him -- then places pennies over the boy's eyelids.  This is from the mythology concerning crossing the River Styx, so check it out.  Basically, the more educated you are as a person, the more you bring to this film.  Nothing about how this film plays out, or the villain himself, is rendered through the lens of real-world verisimilitude, except maybe for the police procedural aspects.<br /><br />Beyond that, it's extremely well directed, beautifully shot, acted with nuance, and full of story twists that make perfectly logical sense.  Very unpredictable, especially for 1986.<br /><br />Don't bother with the remake, it takes every plus listed above and perverts back into mediocrity; it completely misses the whole point of the original's existence:  to detail how a boy becomes a Man in the face of brutality.

B008476HBM|2.0|I shouldn't be writing this, as I am apparently missing something in this book. Jane Austen was obviously an intelligent lady, had great facility with the language, was able to make keen observations, and had a good soul. But reading this was an exercise in grim duty. I could not have cared less about any of the characters or the outcome of the \\"plot.\\" The one character with any potential of interest was Darcy, and he turned out to be a very dull boy. This seems to be the 19th century version of today's romance novel, written for a certain audience. Nothing wrong with that, I suppose, but I would rather even read Russian novels of the same century--another literary torture chamber, but a more interesting one.
B000FC12SM|5.0|Great book if you are male or female.  Age does not matter as we all can continue to learn about each other and make positive changes in our life.

B0076DCT2G|5.0|In addition to entertaining you, DeMille also educates you.  Granted some of his (Corey's) opinion are not PC....but neither am I. I find myself agreeing with Corey's views.  Possibly because I see the non muslim world has it's head in the sand (pun intended) where the terrorits are concerned.  It is impossible to \\"win hearts and minds\\" of these people.<br /><br />The plot moves well.  And at the end the door is left open for more adventures.  I missed the two books about the Lion,so am in the process of catching up.  And being informed.

B00A3OI8MA|5.0|Brilliant. Acting, direction, cinematography, art direction, score, editing, plotting - terrific. And another great showcase for the amazing Jessica Lange, horrifying, hilarious, and tragic.  There's nothing else like it, and it's fascinating, challenging, and perversely entertaining.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I  love this cd- I got it the week it came out at meijer- and was glad I did. I listen to it quite  a bit. For a young singer, Taylor doesnt disappoint. Normally most young singers dont make it as long as she has(lila mccann jessica andrews, jennifer day). Due to an enormous fan base taylor should be pleased with herself. This album strays from country, but in a good way.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|I know my review is simply adding to the positive numbers, but it truly is a must see. From the great interviews, to the overal presentation. Plus it brings to light all the economic and housing issues that hurt us all so badly. Charles Furgeson is brilliant.

0300169787|4.0|I could not get to the show, after seeing the book I am sadder than I was before. The content is quite provocative and moving, of course we will miss Mr. McQueen.<br />The book itself as physical object takes a shot at the originality and creativity, the lenticular cover is a good start. The quality of workmanship suffices, would have liked the lenticular fastened better to the front cover board and the paper quality could have been just a notch higher, I for one would have been glad to pay a bit more for those improvements, minor to me in relationship to the book as a whole.<br />I would have liked the designers of the book to have taken more conceptual risks, taking cues from the artist himself, that could have been quite fun.<br />Wonderful just to have this content documented and presented this well and made so available. Certainly in the top ten list for art books from the year...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A real time killer and addictive. I would recommend to anyone. This will make you forget to do whatever you were going to do that day.
B008VBYN80|4.0|This is a cool game to create you own medievil town, to build up to a great city. It does take some time waiting for crops and wood. You are alowed so many tasks untill you run out of Energy. If you don't want to buy more with real money. Sit back enjoy other things you do, then come back when it's filled up. My kindle notifies my when I have more. Over all this game is great.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|....that's about all I can say.  I agree with all of the well written 5 star reviews.  This CD is ABSOLUTELY Grammy material.  I hope that the powers that be will give it a listen!

Please keep the music coming - no one else is recording anything close these days!

B0053O89WY|5.0|I never enjoyed sit-coms.  My former TV habit was about half an hour of news a day, but a few friends really recommended this show.  I have now watched every episode on DVD and I even watch the current production with its commercials.  This is a magnificent show.  The DVDs are fantastic with great out-takes and lots of behind the scenes facts and interviews.  The first 4 seasons I bought at the local video store, but I bought the fifth season at Amazon, and now I can kick myself for spending so much at the local store.
B0042RUMIW|5.0|This is an awesome CD--my husband has it in his car. We watch the DVD on our computer almost weekly.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|As per usual,  Donald draws you in. The third time is the charm with this one and everything after is gravy. Listened to it 6 times today and could listen 6 times more. That's how good it is. Typical SD/DF where it just draws you in after a few listens and you find yourself thinking about it while your doing something mundane like laundry. All the Steely fans here know what I'm talking about. Each song will grow on you over time as each listen reveals some slight nuance you didnt pick up on earlier. Amazing cover of Out of the Ghetto. This is powerful stuff, but exactly what I expect from DF. 5 stars...on par with The Nightfly and, I do not say that lightly as that is a desert island disc as far as I'm concerned. The man is pure genius and we are blessed to have him still creating relevant music.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book confirmed a lot of what I witnessed when my mother passed.  I was with her the week that she died and was not sure if what she was telling me was real regarding contact with deceased family members a few days before she died.  This is the 3rd NDE book that I have read and it was riveting.  Dr Alexander, as a neurosurgeon, is in a unique position to absolutely identify what his brain was<br />NOT capable of doing during the meningitis attack.  I have many additional questions for him on what he experienced while out of body.  Fascinating book that I would recommend to anyone interested in what happens when we die.
1455527475|5.0|I just got my hands on this book and finished reading within a day, it was a very pleasurable short reading of Greg Smith's career at GS. The book actually gave me a better impression of the investment banking sector  rather than the intended purpose. I suppose I was too negatively reflected upon these institutions through highly subjective media, be them mainstream or niche. The entire 10 out of 11 chapters were talking how upright things had been for GS; its corporate culture, moral ethics, and people. I had a complete paradigm shift about investment banking because I have not heard of so many goods things about them. I felt naïve being indoctrinated by those banker bashing media on the Internet. Investment banking was a business of integrity, but when things experienced their greatest historic advances, quality had to be sacrificed for maintaining past growth momentum. Investment banking was over long ago when Hank Paulson quit as the CEO of GS in 2006.<br /><br />Smith pretty much nailed the crux of the book at the ending paragraph; perfectly executed.<br /><br />\\"People know that there is something deeply wrong with the system, but very few can put their finger on what the problem is. After the crash in 1929, the U.S. Senate conducted the Pecora Hearings, to investigate the causes of the crash. This inquiry led to real reforms that held banks accountable and eliminated the abusive practices that had caused the stock market crash. This was followed by decades of calm in the financial system. If I achieve one thing with this book, I hope it will be to empower some people with enough understanding to call their congressman, congresswoman, or senator and ask this question: Why don't you have the guts to do the same thing?\\"<br /><br />---<br /><br />Afterthoughts<br /><br />Before I read the book, I thought it was just another Wall Street banker who wanted to get famous for getting his sack. After reading, his argument seems convincing, all in all, he seems like agenuine guy who wants to change the world for the better.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|me and my son love this game and we bond playing it it shows him how to follow directions and save money for what he would like to purchase and he loves catching scrat

B007EECSFA|5.0|Well written and developed. The story builds right up to the last word. The reader is led through the maze of the character's lives and then drawn into the conclusion.
6304457391|5.0|If you do not believe in the Constitution, don't watch this Movie. There is a remake called \\"The Enemy Within\\" Staring Forrest Whittaker and Jason Roberts,Made for TV, Murder at 1600, twists into Seven Days,  don't miss them either.This movie is a \\"What If\\", movie and \\"How could they do it\\" Scary but,a grade A; a Classic!  Seven Days is in Black&White and adds to the feeling that it could have been on a covert camera, except for all the A List actors in the cast. A darn good yarn in a fearful world. So if this Movie was re-made twice! Go see the original.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Bored with most of what I hear on the radio, I spend time bouncing the internet, youtube, Slacker, etc, looking for something different and just plain good.  Every now and then I will stumble across a song or two perhaps by an artist I missed and feel like I found a little gold nugget.  I don't remember where I heard Lindsey's music the first time, or even what the song was (Shadows, maybe?), but it was like hitting the jackpot.  I was hooked and googled away to find more, more, more.  Like others here,  youtube is where I ended up and a great place to check out her music to see if you like it.  She likes to dance to her own music, and I can appreciate her creativity and other talents, but it's not what draws me.  She doesn't need to put on a show to be a great musician.  Her music holds it's own.  I love that she experiments with her music and I absolutely cannot get enough of her dubstep mixes.  I hope to see more of this in the future.  What a rockin' first album for this new young artist.  Every song is great and won't disappoint.  You won't be able to keep from tapping your feet.<br /><br />I am very grateful that Amazon finally started carrying her music.  I hope they add the MP3 version of the album in the future, but I was totally fine buying an actually CD...I just didn't want to wait once I saw Amazon was selling this.
B007UWBQEU|5.0|A must have! Amazon makes it so easy to buy an album and put it on just about any device you have! Buy it!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I purchased Proof of Heaven for Kindle, moments after seeing Dr. Alexander interviewed by Fox News.  He was impressive in the interview by his sincerity and calm, assured, matter-of-fact presence. I have been interested in NDE's since attending nursing school at the University of Virginia. Encounters with others who had NDE's further reinforced my interest.<br /><br />I read Proof of Heaven in one day; I simply could not stop reading. The narrative and style of telling his story is engaging from beginning to end. I especially appreciated the depth of research and detailed explanations related to brain activity and consciousness.<br /><br />Reading this book has reinforced all the teachings of my spiritual life and of my faith in the future. My 98 year old mother had died 5 days before, after 10 days in a coma. I am quadriplegic due to MS and could not travel 280 miles to be with her. Her Hospice doctors marveled at her long journey.She was surrounded by my siblings and many grandchildren. My life was changed and comforted by sharing Dr. Alexander's journey. I recommend his book to everyone who seeks deeper understanding of this life of love and the love we can joyfully anticipate in the afterlife.<br /><br />Janet St. John<br />Charlottesville, Va.

B005LAIHXQ|4.0|This movie was what I expected and more similarities to the &#34;Alien&#34; movie are obvious but make the movie that much more enjoyable.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I just can't finish this book. It started out promising enough, quite good in fact.  Then there were so many character twists that it turned me off.  Die hard Grisham fans may rate this better than I have, assuming they stick with it to the end.
B003NTSBUG|5.0|Excellent movie with a surprising twist at the end of the movie, I am going to watch the movie again.
B008FC4WA4|2.0|An amusing but very very short story takes only a few minutes to read.  I felt it could have been expanded on and given a bit more substance, somewhat amusing story line but really no message no plot very little characterisation. I had just started getting into it and it ended.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I had to read this to find out what all the talk was about.... now I have finished it I still can't understand what all the fuss is about.  Are we really meant to believe that this stuff goes on?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|When I saw that this app had 101 games I was blown away for one thing for the price and another the quality of the games. I expected subpar graphics or difficult game play or something that would not be worth the price, but you have made a believer out of me. Thanks.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|OMG..! This book took over my life until I'd finished it!<br />It is absolutely gripping. Many a night I would promise myself to stop reading and lights out at midnight, which I did, only to pick up and start reading again into the wee small hours as I couldn't stop thinking about it and what was going to happen next.<br />Excellent storyline, excellent 'steamy' bits - can't wait until the next book is released!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|i bought this episode and a kindle to watch it on. kindle wouldnt play it, and i couldnt download the episode to it. VERY MISLEADING amazon........shame on you. the show was great, i just had to borrow a laptop to see it on.

B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Contact is one of my favorite movies ever. I saw it in the theater right after I read Cosmos for the first time - a book that blew my mind and made me fall in love with cosmology. This movie is a love letter to Carl Sagan's passionate perspective on our beautiful little planet and humanity's unique place in the universe. Highly recommended!
B004SIIBGU|3.0|It's not the same as a reg ebay, the pictures are kinda weird on an iPad app..don't really care for it

B008JGSM6G|5.0|Been enjoying this game since I downloaded it.<br />Beats playing other mindless games. I've had to charge the battery twice in less than 24 hours
B007VUA7VO|5.0|The battery hd is very helpful.Thank you Smallte .ch. And I love it when it tells me that my power is about to go dead
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I have loved all the John Corey books and his humor.  This time, De Mille goes too far.  The jokes were incessant and ridiculous and spoilt the read.  Go back to your old books like 'The General's Daughter'  That was your best.  This was boring and laborous to read.  What a shame.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I enjoyed the movie.  Totally unrealistic fiction.  An enjoyable time away from reality.  I had very little expectations of the movie and was pleasantly surprised.  I am a fan of the vampire genre and consider this a likable addition.
B001G7HKZ4|1.0|I am a big fan of the actors in this film.  However, it was such a poorly directed, stupid movie that I couldn't watch it and normally I can watch paint dry.  Save your money.
B0091REZMW|2.0|Way too much switching back and forth from one page to the next with not enough to do once you get there.  Gets boring and cumbersome.
0385535147|5.0|Usually, I have a few books on my kindle, read a chapter or two then on to the next book and rotate through them. Drawback is it takes longer to finish a book, but fun when you can cross off 3 or 4 in a week. However, there are some authors who tell a story so well that I stick with it until I am finished. Lee Child fits this category and so does John Grisham. Great story telling, interesting plot that kept me guessing in a book that moved right along. Some people found the central character less than sympathetic but think about how you would feel if you were railroaded into prison under those circumstances. An enjoyable bit of \\"mind candy\\" to offset all the political and non-fiction material I have been immersed in lately!
B004J4WKDI|3.0|This is a good, light read. As one progresses through the book, the outcome is more predictable and the descriptive passages get a bit tedious -- The idea of the black and white night circus is captivating for awhile, but I found myself skip reading the last third of the book. (Though I usually enjoy visual imagery, how many times do I want to read detailed descriptions of costumes and decor?) I also wondered if the book had been self-published, because there were numerous incidents of comma splices and lack of noun-verb agreement. That just should not happen in a major publisher's release. It added nothing to the story. That aside, if you enjoy entertaining the possibility that real magic exists, this book will likely captivate you.

B00932A6G4|1.0|What a horrible movie.  It was like watching how a fourteen year old thinks macho grunts act.  The whole movie was one predictable over-stereotypical scene to the other.  It does not help that I served in the Marine Corps and know how that attitude is total BS.  The understanding of actual human reactions is what made the original so great.  Don't waist your money
B007549W62|4.0|Michael Biehn (Terminator), Courtney B. Vance (Law & Order), and Rosanna Arquette (Pulp Fiction) are the biggest stars in this movie along with a newer star, Ashton Holmes (son involved in incestuous relationship with Katy Segal on Boston Legal).  I am not familiar with the other actors.<br /><br />This movie is very intense and keeps your interest.  Residents of a building wind up in the basement after a nuclear attack with the maintenance man (Michael Biehn) who has fashioned a bomb shelter there and has power for lighting, a latrine, and food and water.  He calls the shots for a while until hazmat-suited people break into the basement room, and seize the little daughter of Rosanna Arquette.  They spirit her away and try to kill the remaining residents who fight back and kill two of them.  With a working hazmat suit, one of the guys ventures out of the room and sees strange experimental happenings along with the kidnapped daughter who is now inside a pod with her head shaved and a respirator/feeding tube.  We don't know if she is alive or not.  He is discovered, barely makes it back alive and the door to the basement is welded shut by these unknown \\"others.\\"  Meanwhile the remainder of the story unfolds as an extreme version of Lord of the Flies with unspeakable acts perpetrated upon one another.<br /><br />The plot may be slightly hackneyed, however, the film delivers suspense and intensity.  Biehn and Arquette give exceptional performances.  Recommend!
B007SYWFRM|2.0|poor effort for an app to provide fun with kids.  what more can you say about a difficult app used to entertain!
B0086700CM|3.0|The lag is really annoying.  I am glad that I didn't pay for the app.  Really need to get an update so I can play.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Best book ever! I read it in a day and a half! MY FAVORITE!!!!!! Rick Riordan is an amazing writer, and each book just gets better every time!
B004I7IPL2|4.0|I loved the final chapter but is it really over? Didn't expect the twist at the end where it went back to where it started.
B00846REIS|1.0|Thought at first it might be ok, but the plot (if there was supposed to be one) was very lame and just not what I was expecting. Then it just ended. Didn't make a lot of sense.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|my kids had a blast trying to earn more points to open new games. they loved trying to beat each other at the various different types of games. great app.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|i did enjoy these books very much.one of the best that i have read in a while. i couldnt put it down.
B008OOYALE|5.0|patience..a relaxing, no time limit game.  If you like the other &#34;story &#34; games you'll like this.  Just relax and watch your dragons grow.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|seriously i loved these collections and even enjoyed the movie. i couldnt put it down i even had dreams aobut this book thats how much i enjoyed it
B002KKBV8I|4.0|Bought this for my 3 yearold granddaughter. It was the last present opened. She dropped all of the other gifts and insisted on playing with this gift (apparently she had seen it before at a friend's).  She was intrigued by the way the pieces cling to each other. And played with it for over an hour (amazing!).  Balls are little and race all over so I would recommend putting the pieces in a large flat box or similar for play fun, so they don't roll away.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Loved it.  Character development was great-- beautiful ending.  I highly recommend.  Laughed and cried-- very moving.  One of those that causes you to think about life in general
B008AK8FHM|5.0|proof of heaven, and some books like this can change the world in future. After revolution in Iran I read Quran and decided that the God who created this world cannot be the same God who create slave and the God who made women co creator with himself cannot be the God who insult women so much. and God cannot order the killing of his own creature. If God doesn't want somebody he can kill that person himself so I don't believe the helpless God of Quran who need the help of his own creature to kill in his name for him. but I believe The God that Dr.Eben Alexander introduce.
B003O86FMW|3.0|The Hunger Games was good but the two following books were padded too much and to my mind should have been added onto The Hunger Games.  The Hunger Games had an inconclusive ending and the same with the movie.  In other words she should have written one book not three.
B0095R3D0I|5.0|This is a movie that instantly takes me back to my childhood. I still love watching and do so every year.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Great game...fun to veg to...even to my kids have to help me at times .  How can you not love Perry!!!!
B008OIQYTG|5.0|Lee Rit still sounds so fresh after all these years. This is a must have for all his fans. New artists as well as great production. So good !
B0083P1QUM|2.0|Quite honestly disappointing.  Ms. Cornwell has written some unmatched thrillers in the past, however this is not one of them.  Book is predictable and it's few minor twists are telegraphed well in advance.  I don't know if the author has simply lost her taste for writing or has worn out Scarpetta as her major character.  Either way, the book was flat and defintely not up to the standards of past offerings.  I wonder if Ms. Cornwell has considered moving on to Lucy as her main character with Aunt Kay playing the supporting role?<br /><br />Bottom line - check it out at the library or borrow a copy from a friend if you must read the latest from Patricia Cornwell - not sorth the purchase price.
B00908DDZM|5.0|Hands down the best album I've ever purchased. Meaningful Hip Hop music. (I used to think that was an oxymoron)
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Dr Alexander's book is an enlightening work. As a deeply spiritual old engineer who reads much science, my appraisal of his chances persuading his fellows in medicine of its reality will be no better than my own attempt to persuade my Christian fellows of the reality that there was a world that was before this one in which we now find ourselves, and that there were events in that world that brought about the necessity of this present creation. My views are presented in dramatic form in \\"THE BIG BANG,\\" an e-book on Kindle (Kindle got the title wrong. It should have been, \\"Before THE BIG BANG, We Were\\"). Readers can download a trial copy and get a taste of my ability to address the matter of Dr. Alexander's book. There are two allegories in the tale God gave me. The first is in chapter eleven and the second in the last chapter. The book has one serious shortcoming and that is that it was not dedicated to my great friend, Dr Ira Patton, who inspired me to write it.<br /><br />But back to Dr Alexander. He seems to have reverted to seeking a scientific and intellectual mode of persuading his fellows. A certain level of superstition is needed to enter into a personal relationship with a spiritual being, which God is. With some people that seems to be innate. However a personal encounter with him will shift one's paradigm entirely. These personal spiritual encounters sometimes come out of the blue, just as happened to Dr Alexander.<br /><br />I think Dr Alexander should change course in his future efforts. God very apparently has made a \\"first move\\" in his case. While interesting when viewed intellectually, his was an entirely spiritual encounter. If God suggests you and he play checkers, it is irrational to suggest to to him that you'd rather play dominoes (personally, I'd prefer poker). Get on your knees, doctor, and stay there with passion. It's a wonderful ride. Been there.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|My husband and I watched the movie together and we both liked the movie.  I was not to thrilled about the twilight girl, yet I thought she fit the movie perfectly.  The movie was suppose to be sad, and from reading other reviews she plays sad well.  Don't let the twilight girl deter you from watching the movie.
B007EDYN36|5.0|Really honest and eyeopening book about the Cat-man. IF you're a Kiss fan you will have trouble putting it down.
B0083P1QUM|1.0|I gave this one star only because I was not allowed to rate it no stars.  I was sorry to buy the book only after the first few pages and returned it for a refund.  I want to be entertained not preached to when I read FICTION.  Thanks but NO THANKS Patricia Cornwell, for ruining an excellent run.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|I love this dvd . I could not stop crying. The songs were wonderful. Only the master could do this. I will watch this again.  This movie is out of this world. Everyone should by it. I loved it.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|The plot is intriguing, and it is beautifully written as are all his books.  It was nearly impossible to put down; I enjoyed it tremendously.
B000ZMCVRI|5.0|My very first reggae experience was Bob Marley's Legend.  Nothing will ever compare.  I could listen to this all day and all night!

1568363931|5.0|This book came well-recommended and it is worth every penny.  We are looking forward to adding it to our repertoire of healthy choices!
B008XG1X18|5.0|this app is great for picking up new and cool ideas. I highly recommend it, especially if you are the creative type or you just want to look at some cool stuff.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|The case fits the Kindle Fire HD perfectly.  It's nice quality and it's sturdy.  The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5, is that I cannot make it stand.  I've put it on a perfectly flat surface, set it up to stand, but it keeps slipping down.  However, that it could be me, rather than the case, so I will only deduct 1 star for that.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|once reached level 95 and the game restarted. notified them of this and never replied back to me. Second time reached level 42 and game restarted from level 1.  Game constantly crashes. Doesn't always give credit for  what you've created. If they ever get the glitches out this would be a good game but right now it is not worth it.
B005LVR6ZA|4.0|Entertaining and quite enjoyable.  A bit of humor is mixed in.  He certainly had a unique way of describing the scene and characters.
B009329ZF2|4.0|Great movie with non stop action.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The movie was better than I thought it would be.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Got this -- together with Amazon's improved charger --  to replace the original charger for my Kindle Fire.  They sent me the replacement equipment free and it arrived very fast.  I'm quite pleased.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|The character development always seemed to take a back seat until the I read the ending. The whole finale was pulled together like an after thought.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|THE GAME IS AWESOME.....but there is only two levels and I know its new but its boring now.....so yea just know if your those ppl who like long levels wait for the next levels
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|Can't find it to download once I purchased it. What's up with that? Have all the other Angry birds, thought this would be great for my grandson. We enjoy playing these together. Would like to know where to find it to see if it works. Noticed alot of reviews are negative, should have looked at them before I attempted to download.
B004A8ZWWO|1.0|OK, I'm adding a spoiler alert here to satisfy someone who told me I was a \\"special kind of jerk\\" for not having one...<br /><br />Spoiler Alert! This film is a twisted wreck of inane plot points, a few of which I'm about to point out, BUT if you haven't already seen it then don't read what follows because I really think you ought to waste a couple of hours finding out how bad it is for yourself.<br /><br />There, now I'm not a special kind of jerk...<br /><br />This movie has to be the all time champion of inane plot points. It's actually stunning to sit there and watch how one senseless scene leads to another. The first hint that this is going to be a turkey of epic proportions comes during the opening sequence when they show two of the lead characters playing chess via computer. One quick glance at the board and anyone who knows anything about chess can see the game is long over. But they play on as the obvious loser makes a move and acts as if it's a real gem.<br /><br />Among the many, many plot points that will leave you speechless...<br /><br />In what condo building does the manager, who is just an employee himself, get to decide how all of the other employee's retirement accounts will be invested without their knowledge or consent?<br /><br />If the heist gang has all the access and security codes to the luxury condo building why does Eddie Murphy lock them on rooftop so they can learn to open a door with a hair pin? His character is a small time crook who steals things from people's balconies, why do they even recruit him for the luxury condo heist?<br /><br />Why does Alan Alda have an empty safe hidden within in a permanent wall of his condo? How could he ever use this safe? Seriously, they break the wall down with sledge hammers only to find a hidden EMPTY safe! They know the safe is in this wall because it's the only one that wasn't torn down years ago when the owner remodeled. So they figure that's where he hid $20 million that he recently set aside... in the safe that's been hidden in the wall that he hasn't touched in ten years. Did NO ONE on this set say, \\"Um guys, does this make any sense?\\"<br /><br />Why in the world does Ben Stiller recruit a down-on-his-luck, ex-tenant with no related skills to help out with this heist?<br /><br />The theives wear masks until all of the security cameras are covered and yet the FBI knows who to round up immediately after the heist, including the superfluous ex-tenant! How?<br /><br />How do you knock out an FBI agent for an hour or so by running a cleaning cart into his knees?<br /><br />How do they fool the FBI into thinking that they're due to bring their suspect into court on Thanksgiving Day? (To their credit when a guard tells them that the court is closed on Thanksgiving they quickly realize that it's a deversion!)<br /><br />How did Alan Alda manage to get a solid gold car assembled his penthouse without anyone knowing that it was a solid gold car? Why would he even want a solid gold car in his penthouse living room? Was he going to break peices off as he needed the cash?<br /><br />They tell Alan Alda that one employee he bilked has \\"stepped in front of a train\\" and then a moment later they say, \\"Ah Ha! You really don't care because you didn't ask if he was dead or not!\\" Really? You tell him someone stepped in front of a train and he's supposed to ask if he's OK!? What kind of moron would he have to be to ask if the guy who stepped in front of the train is OK?<br /><br />Trust me, I'm just highlighting a FEW of the jaw droppingly inane twists in this bomb. It just goes on and on. You could actually invent a drinking game based on taking a shot evey time something inexplicable happens. You'd be soooo drunk!<br /><br />By the time they start moving the solid gold car around the building like it's made of styrofoam you'll just be shaking your head. This is one for the record books.

B007FG9LIE|1.0|This was not what I expected at all. The farther I read the more I hated it. The story started off like a mystery thriller but then it just became annoying.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Like I'm trying not 2 say bad words but TF Its minecraft OMG Who ever made this game was disable LIKE no Joke and mincraft is 4 LOSERS GET A Life!!!!!!
0061992860|5.0|Can't really add much to the other great reviews. This is an awesome resource for survival techniques. Presented well, easily understood, and a great compact size to fit in a bug out/camping/hiking bag. If you are new to survival or even learned, this book is an invaluable tool. I recommend reading through it and then taking some time to try actually doing the things described. It will make you much better prepared, practice is perfect after all. Good luck to you.
B0058VW36U|2.0|wont let me down load says error try again later but I wanna play the game now so useless preety much
B005GRF2UK|5.0|I've only seen 2 versions, 1971 and 1996. I thought 1971 was very good, but it did not move me. The 1996 version moved me very much. Some thought the cast was, well, miscast. I thought it could not have been cast better. William Hurt was not perfect, but who can claim to be a perfect Rochester. He gave a strong performance. Gainsbourgh was Jane Eyre. I think it would be very difficult for another actress to claim a better performance of Jane. The photography and music put you in the story immediately and they leave a deep impression. The supporting players are also excellent.
B004ZISVWC|4.0|It was fun to watch.  Probably won't ever see it again, but for one time and for free it was a good.  Acting was surprisingly good throughout.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put it down!! It was easy t read and easy to follow. I would recommend it to everyone.
B00170GYB6|5.0|First time I've ever seen this movie, because I love Arnold.  I get all of the comical references, but would have liked the movie anyway if I didn't.  I usually hate movies that are older than 15 years, but this one is a gem.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app has a lot of information, well organized. I use it every day to check the weather where I am and where all our family lives.
B001F6TXME|4.0|About a year ago I purchased an Opteka remote shutter release for my Nikon D3100. When I got it the first thing I noticed was  the plug on the release didn't want to go into the GPS socket on the camera without considerable effort. That should have been my first clue. I did get it installed and the release seemed to work fine. I could lock it open for stellar photography or just use it normallY. After about the third time I removed the plug from the camera body the metal collar that surrounded the cable plug stayed in the camera body. I was able to remove it with a small pair of needle nose pliars. After awhile I just left the damn thing in there. The release was working but it wasn't very tight and would periodically come out of the camera until I started taping it to the tripod. What a pain in the butt. Well what do you get for $4.95? Some cheap Chinese thing made in a forced labor camp. Finally the plug just gave up the ghost and all the wires in the end of it were standing up like they'd seen a ghost. So I deep sixed this piece of garbage.<br /><br />I decided to spend more money on the next release and bought the Nikon unit, for six times as much money but it's worth it if it works right? Well it is to me anyway. When I got the unit I was surprised that it was smaller in all dimensions than the Opteka unit I had before. the cord was smaller in diameter. The plug also fits into the camera much better than the Opteka unit did. It works fine. I'm looking forward to more Stellar photography with it this year. Is this unit worth $24.95? Sure it is if it works like it's supposed to and doesn't give me constant headaches like the Opteka unit did. It's a camera accessory for a high end digital SLR so yeah it will be a little bit expensive but it's within my meager budget. Would I recommend this to a friend? Yes I already did.<br /><br />Dave Proffitt
B008WCP2KG|1.0|The actors in this film have scraped the bottom of the barrel for money! This film is boring, poorly acted, embarrassing and a waste of time and money.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|This app is great.The graphics are amazingnand the control s are realistic.I know this because I fly jets for anliiving. My kids love it. I love it.
B008M36ER0|4.0|We were looking at options for a rental and didn't really see anything interesting. Wife and I finally saw The Gringo & decided to give it a shot. It turned out to be better than expected. Well worth the cost of rental. Decent storyline. Gibson at his understated, low-key self. Certainly not the Beaver, for sure. Ha-Ha!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this trilogy.  Beautifully written.  Let your mind go and read this one, Ladies, its worth every minute.  Any woman in love or not...can relate to this excellent series.
1451627289|5.0|Achieves the expectations of a Stephen King novel, with a touch of history added. Also, the twist to the storyline makes this enjoyable on just about every possible level! Loved it!
B003YCI1PM|5.0|A Year Without Rain is the follow-up to the hardcore and sassy pop rock predecessor Kiss & Tell. This album is less of a rock album and more of a pop, dance and electronic album. I have to say her transformation from a rock and roll chick to a teen pop sensation is certainly a graceful one. But don't believe me, listen to this album and you'll find out yourself.<br /><br />My ranks:<br />1. \\"Round & Round\\" 10/10 - Perfect choice for a lead single and a fun dance track. Would be a great addition to party playlists.<br />2. \\"A Year Without Rain\\" 9/10 - Great choice for a second single and an awesome ballad.<br />3. \\"Rock God\\" 7/10 - A decent dance track. The way she sings the first verse is a little weird, but the rest of it is performed well.<br />4. \\"Off the Chain\\" 10/10 - Makes you wanna get up and dance. Had the potential to become a single. Also would be a great addition to party playlists.<br />5. \\"Summer's Not Hot\\" 10/10 - Great summer anthem. Also had the potential to become a single.<br />6. \\"Intuition\\" (featuring Eric Bellinger) 8/10 - Another great track and Eric's rap section was a good addition. The only bad thing about this track is Selena's auto tuned vocals. Also had the potential to become a single.<br />7. \\"Spotlight\\" 7/10 - Not the best, but certainly not the worst. The lyrical content is good, but the chorus can at times be a little annoying.<br />8. \\"Ghost of You\\" 9/10 - Another great ballad. Also had the potential to become a single.<br />9. \\"Sick of You\\" 10/10 - A great dance track. Perfect for the clubs. Also had the potential to become a single.<br />10. \\"Live Like There's No Tomorrow\\" 8/10 - This song was issued as a promotional single to create buzz for Selena's first major motion picture Ramona & Beezus. I guess it was a good album closer, but if I did the album track listing, this would've been the second track and \\"A Year Without Rain\\" would be the closing track.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great pop, dance and electronic album. Needless to say, Selena steers clear of the sophomore slump with this album. Perfect choice to play at house parties and nightclubs.
B002VWNIDG|5.0|When I ordered the Shining from Amazon, I didn't know if I would like it or not.  I had heard some good things about the movie, and I had heard some bad things.  But when I received the tape, I immediately watched.  This is one of the best movies featuring Jack Nicholson that I have watched.  I would recommend this movie to anyone that watches Jack Nichleson, or not, it is just a fanastic movie.
B0037471SU|5.0|Don't you just love it when characters come back from the dead? Definitely worthy of christening my new kindle with!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I must say, unlike the other books, was CONSTANT action. I mean there was a little Percy-Annabeth and Piper-Jason and Frank-Hazel-Leo time, but basically non-stop battles. Do NOT get .e wrong, this book rocked. I love EVERYTHNG Riordan writes. Even his adult mysteries (I highly recomend Cold Springs), but I felt a bit tired after reading. And also, I feel like he is losing his deep thought-out plans. I finished this book in less than 24 hours, with school and sleep, and the book is LONG. And it is predictable beyond belief. Think about it: the book focuses on Annabeth and her &#34;challenge&#34;; it has to be a incredibly hard quest; and who's Athena's biggest enemy? what is all children of Athena's biggest fear? Duh.<br /><br />But as the title suggests, where is lacks, it definitely makes up. It is incredible sweet and has little inside joles that only the most attentive fan that have read all of Riordan's young adult-ALL-would pick up on. And then it introduces tons of knowledge; I used some of Riordan's stories for my World History class while studying Ancient Greece. I must say, though, I will be very disappointed if Riordan's writing does not revert to the humor in The Son of Neptune, the depth of The Lost Hero, the planning of The Last Olympian, the history of The Battle of the Labryninth, the sweetness of The Titan's Curse, the prethought and links using The Sea of Monsters, and of course, the pure genius of The Lightning Thief. If Riordan can get that all together....well, I will be pleased into Elysium.
B008G8SFGO|4.0|If you are a long time Kiss fan, then you are going to recognize some of the riffs and melodies on Monster. However, when  you are Kiss there is really no reason to reinvent the wheel, their formula works. With that said, the main difference between Monster and Sonic Boom is that the songs are much heavier and that is a good thing. Overall this is an excellent album with all songs being good. Gene provides the strongest material on Monster, but the best song is &#34;Freak&#34; which is Paul's. Standout tracks include the aforementioned Freak, Back to the Stone Age, Shout Mearcy, The Devil is Me, and Take Me Down Below. Strong recommend to buy.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Twisty turns in unexpected directions. A good read, but you have to concentrate to keep the characters straight and to find the clues.
0307749584|1.0|I borrowed the audiobook from my local library and I am halfway through it already. I have to agree with most of the reviews here. They only thing I want to add that as boring as it must be to read it is even more so listening to it being read aloud. Why would they pick such a monotone reader for a Jack Reacher novel? I understand Jack has a broken nose but all the dialogue from the book makes Jack sound like a drunk.<br />I haven't finished it and some parts I wanted to \\"fast forward\\" through. But I haven't. Yet.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Racketeer is another great Grisham book.  This one is an involving page turner that is difficult to put down.
0446581348|4.0|I sell Cosmetics out of my home and as part of my personal service to my Clients I offer complete Make Overs. This way they can see how to apply their product, what to buy, and what they need for complete skin care. I do not get paid fo this service, they are howeve reuired to buy the product that they use. This Book is GREAT!! I'm getting up to date techniques and lots of ideas that is going well with my Clients. I would recommend this book. I would recommend any Bobbi Brown Make Up Book!!
B008HK3XOU|2.0|Overall I prefer the original Kindle Fire primerely for the followings:<br />-it is bigger<br />-it is very difficult to find the on-off button as well as the volume control<br />-There is no charging light<br />Overall it is a good tablet but lacks an external memory card and it has no back camera
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great book written by John Grisham.  I hightly recommend this book.  Of course I am a John Grisham fan and have never read one of his books that doesn't keep me intriqued.
045122499X|5.0|I really love how he weaves his stories around historical facts. Look forward to seeing more from him Thank You!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I love how they are starting to combo DVD and Blu-Ray into one package. I presently do not own Bl-Ray player, but I expect I will(prolly when Blu-ray goes out of style) and this will make it so I don't have to buy the same movie again. And the movie, of corse, absolutely ROCKED! Can't wait for the next movies from Marvel
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I would recommend this book to the people who loved 50, it's very similar but also very different. I loved it!!
B00002N9ER|5.0|Bought this product to mount in my truck. Holds my 4-cell Maglite in place exactly as expected. Now it's out of the way and I don't have to worry about it rolling around under the seat anymore. I wouldn't recommend mounting them where someone can put their feet on them though. I don't seem like they would withstand a foot on top of them.
B00008976Y|5.0|I absolutely loved the amount of time it took to arrive, and the movie is phenomenal! I would definitely recommend  Blue!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|So far I am very pleased with the Kindle for Android.  I have already read my first book and plan to read many more in the future.  The service is excellent and so is the product.  I would recommend it anyone who likes to read ebooks.
1601251505|5.0|Sadly, the best Dungeons and Dragons game on the market isn't produced by D&D at all.  That honor goes to Piazo and the best version of D&D ever made.  I balked at giving this a try because of its hefty price.  But I finally ordered it and loved it.<br /><br />I own most of the current 4th Edition D&D releases--I really wanted to buy into new D&D--but it's just too different (all classes and races basically play the same).  Not a bad game, but not D&D either.  Pathfinder has found a way to preserve all the goodness of previous D&D editions (this one is based on &#34;3rd/3/5 edition&#34;) while adding whole new dimensions.  Piazo puts all their energy into each book.  There is no fluff here like in 4th edition D&D (there's very little &#34;crunch&#34; in those books).  Every page has useful info.  And the accessory books are just as well done.<br /><br />It's a sad reality, but you can't play great &#34;D&D&#34; by buying the current officially-made D&D products.  You gotta jump into Pathfinder instead.  It's incredible.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed reading the first and second book far more than I enjoyed the movie!  Can't wait to start on the third!
1439152802|5.0|I was so excited about another Kate Morton book because I love her storytelling.  My first reaction was that it started a little slowly but then like a jigsaw puzzle you start to put together parts while you still can't see the whole puzzle.  That is what this book was like for me.  It slowly started to come together as the story went on but the kicker was that I had absolutely no idea what the finished puzzle was going to look like.  It was another great book by Kate Morton.  One that while I was rushing to find out the ending, I hated to see the book end.  I hope she doesn't take too long for the next one.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|my opinion is that this angry bird game is the best yet it iis very fun and addicting good for all ages to have even works on kindle fire doesn't glitch very good graphics
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have this app to my ipod kindle fire xbox Pc and its amazing I just wish the update would come out
B005HV6Y84|1.0|i didn't buy this my ex bought it for his stalker for xmas or bday or something. i'm ashamed it's on my bought items list
B0091REZMW|5.0|this is a&ntilde; amazing app it is addicting once I started playing I just couldn't stop by the time I looked at the clock I had been playing for 5 hours
B00190OHD6|4.0|I had already seen this movie prior to purchase. If you enjoy romantic movies this is a great one, a bit sad, but well worth watching.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|It's one of the best action movies I've seen.  Of course it's not perfect but it's entertaining, fast paced, decent effects, decent plot, etc.  It's been so long since I read the books I don't know if it's true to the book or not.  But it's a fun movie and won't bore you to tears with the same old same old like so many other hollywood cookie cutter movies.
B004VMX5TQ|5.0|I bought the album when it was released and loved it. Just received the cd and love it! Live albums don't always do justice to the music, songs, or performer but this one does. One reviewer said the audience was too loud but I don't think so. I've seen Mr. Seger live before and he gets everyone so charged that you need to hear the audiences reactions. Now for the songs. If you liked the studio versions of \\"Night Moves\\", \\"Old Time Rock and Roll\\", \\"Mainstreet\\", and \\"Betty Lou's Gettin' Out Tonight\\" then get ready as Bob unleashes Alto Reed and Drew Abbott and they rock the house. Other versions of songs like \\"Against the Wind\\" and \\"Fire Lake\\" are awesome, too. I'm a fan of his old tune \\"Beautiful Loser\\" and would have liked for it to have been included, but other than that no complaints! If you like to crank it up and rock and roll you should love this cd! BOB SEGER ROCKS!
0545425115|4.0|It was very inexpensive, interesting story.  Some people say it's a kid's book but I don't understand that it's very violent for a kid's book.  I enjoyed it and I'm a grown man.  It wasn't Agent Pendergast or anything but the plot is interesting and it doesn't lack for action most of the time. I haven't seen the movie yet because Amazon hasn't put it on free prime but usually the book is better than the movie anyway.  I would read the sequels if I could get them as cheap as this book was.  I guess that's the bottom line, I wouldn't pay more than $3 for this.
B009329Y30|5.0|This is a great movie. It's a love story that just touches your heart. The acting was decent and the storyline was great as well.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I like twitter, because it is a fun way to enjoy talking to your friends, and you don't have to deal with facebook games etc. but it could use more tweeting space instead of 140 characters.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Love it. Soooo useful...Tells you exactly how much time you have left for everything...its a really awesomee app. I would def recommend it.
B008WCP2PG|1.0|This movie.. is soooo boring.. Even the dance routines are sub par. The plot is weak. Save your money on this one. For them to even say there is going to be a 2 in production welcome to direct to video if they do
B0067AC5KA|3.0|I really enjoyed reading this triology. In spite of many flaws, the stories are quite interesting and engaging from the beginning to the end.<br /><br />What I liked: the story line, the character building, and the concept that is focused on violence against women. The focus does not change through out the story. Although there is focus on government, media, and indurstrial corruption, the core of the story remains on vicimizing innocent and often helpless women.<br /><br />The flaws in my opinion: 1) the characters are not very complex for such a complex story. People are either good or bad. Wrong doing of the \\"good\\" characters are presented as excusable and understandable actions. 2) I found the the predictable happy ending of the story cliche and unrealistic. All bad people see punishment. All the good people get rewarded. I usually don't care for such happy endings. 3) although there is a extreme feminism in the ideology of the story, not much power is given to women, something that I would have liked to see. The poeple who actually initiate or make a difference in the outcome of the story are men! Women provide really important assistance not much more. Also I found the fact that all powerful women in the story fall in love with Blomkvist and don't care much about his careless sex-with-whoever lifestyle, kind of degrading.<br /><br />These are the flaws I picked up from story but nevertheless I enjoyed the books and recommend them to everyone.
B003Y58CKS|4.0|The triangle leads of Duke, Jester, and Gilda in this production are magnificent emotionally and musically. The beasitary costuming and settings are over-the-top but delectable, with the direction alternatively fun and muddled. The result is occasionally camp, but highly entertaining. But you will need your own libretto to follow the text, as the subtitles, whether you rely on the German, French, or English, are at best occasional, and bear about as much resemblance to the Italian as Starbuck's drink titles do to their Italian models. The production provides about one subtitle for every ten to twenty sentences, and its relationship to the exact text of the original is at best approximate, and as often, mystifying.<br /><br />But Diana Damarau can really act, and is delicious as Gilda, especially as she revels in her new found love with the smarmy lothario portrayed with a huge pomade and horse-tail by Juan Diego Florez.  Zeljiko Lucic's Rigoletto turns Rigoletto into a Balkan tragedy steeped in blood and sorrow. He's a living nightmare of a man, and each of them delight. Yes, Damarau is too mature and knowledgable to be young Gilda, but for me, she makes it all work regardless.<br /><br />Shame on the producers of this DVD for the lackadaisical subtitling, which really fails to respect the audience.  Download the libretto or use one from any Verdi collection, and all is again well with the world, if not for poor Rigoletto and Gilda.
