B00005N5S5|5.0|The modern classics of science fiction have been able to infuse crowd-pleasing action scenes with truly thought-provoking and clever concepts. From the chillingly violent social commentary of Paul Verhoeven's Robocop to the stylish and brainy conceits of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, few genres are able to balance the scales so well, yet depressingly so seldom. One such classic was unleashed in 1984 under the title The Terminator. It stars well-known action star Arnold Schwarzenegger and is directed by then-unknown James Cameron, and would soon become a world-wide sensation.<br /><br />Sarah Connor is having a bad day. She's late for work, has tons of awful customers to contend with, and has just learned that two women have been murdered; women with the exact same name as her. If I told you that the murderer was a massive cyborg who was sent back through time to assassinate the eventual mother of humanity's last hero, you'd probably think I was describing something less than brilliant. You'd be wrong. The stunningly clever framework that Cameron provides (he also wrote the script) is only one of the many delightful aspects of The Terminator.<br /><br />Sarah has a hero. Also sent from the future, Kyle Reese appears to thwart the Terminator's attempts and protect Sarah at all costs. Through a seemingly unending series of chases, Reese explains the truth to Sarah, and the two of them promptly set off to... avoid the homicidal robot at all costs. Throw in some unfortunate hooligans who unwisely mock the hulking beast, an oversexed roommate, a disco full of mid-`80s dancers and a barracks full of the most unlucky cops ever caught on film, and you have the ingredients for one dark and violent thrill ride.<br /><br />As the Terminator, Schwarzenegger (Commando) shines. With very few lines of dialogue to worry about, Schwarzenegger can concentrate on that cold dark stare and a truly menacing presence. Though he's played a hero more times than I can count, Arnold delivers his most entertaining performance ever as the unstoppable beast. Linda Hamilton (Children of the Corn) is strong as Sarah, starting out rather ditzy and weak before displaying some real guts later on. As Reese, Michael Biehn (Aliens) hits the right \\"action-hero\\" buttons, and while he falters a bit in the movie's more tender moments, that's okay, because Biehn's a cool actor... and the \\"tender moments\\" last about three minutes in total.<br /><br />With one of the more clever sci-fi screenplays of the last part of the 20th century, and some truly exciting action sequences, Terminatorevery bit as good as you might have heard. While many feel that the sequel is the better film, I'd contend that Terminator 2 was merely more expensive. If you're building yourself a digital sci-fi collection, this movie should definitely be on your Top Ten list.livers his most entertaining performance ever as the unstoppable beast.

006072448X|2.0|Let me state from the outset of this two-star review that this book was easily one of the most well-written, gripping books I have encountered in years. There is hardly a dull sentence therein, and few books have held my attention so well. I tend to read slowly and thoughtfully, so it's unusual for me to finish a 400-page book within a work-week: this one I simply couldn't get away from. So why two stars? <br /> <br />For a start, it's a genuinely nasty and upsetting book which I still find myself profoundly dispirited by even now (just hours after finishing it). There are plenty of novels that have this effect on the reader, for good reasons and to good effect. If Nevil Shute's \\"On The Beach\\", for instance, depressed you with the reality of nuclear war, then impelling you to do something about it was a worthy bi-product of an otherwise dispiriting read. (Dr. Helen Caldicott's lifelong campaign against nuclear arms, for example, began after reading this book.) But Shriver's book does not belong in this category. Why? <br /> <br />Firstly, the novel is a monument to authorial mean-spiritedness. Celia, the delightfully super-sensitive and good-natured daughter is introduced into the story as blatant a foil to the unbearable Kevin. So her fate as a receptacle for his meanness is sealed from the start. But would kevin's appalling treatment of her have told us anything about him that we did not already know? By the time Celia arrives on the scene, the reader is already wearily thinking: \\"Kevin's nasty: we get it.\\" In literary terms, therefore, the author gave birth to Celia purely in order to gratuitously abuse her. <br /> <br />Secondly, the cynicism and exploitation. The twin topics of this book are motherhood and massacre. But strip away the Grand Guignol finale (and ancillary violence), and what do you have? An interesting kitchen-sink drama, but one that wont sell too well. But topical bloodshed, however insensitive, will sell. So the author makes that the nail uponwhich an otherwise responsible and interesting examination of family life is hung. Or rather, impaled. <br /> <br />Thirdly, lack of credibility. Kevin's entire life is a chronicle of appalling behaviour and deformity of character. Yet as far as I can recall, there is not a single punishment meted out by either parent. Furthermore, Kevin's permanently gulled father is as unbelievable to the reader as he is over-believing to his wife. Eva's infinitely renewable self-scorn also exasperates. Following poor Celia's injury (an upsetting and cheaply nasty trick on the author's part), the cord of credibility which the plot dangles from snaps. A mother who genuinely believed that her son did this to her daughter would drive him from the house immediately. But that would encumber the plot, of course. Instead, Kevin remains suprisingly under-questioned on his version of the event, and life in the household simply goes on. What really happened reamins curiously unpacked by all parties involved: from Celia the victim, through her mother (who never asks Kevin about it during any of her prison visits), to Kevin himself (who boasts about his every nihilistic accomplishment but never discusses this). Somehow, that's a little too convenient for the author. The ambiguity around the event is therefore entirely phoney: Shriver hasn't kidded anyone. From this point on, the rest of the story never recovers, and it all strikes a long false note.  <br /> <br />Fourthly, the red herring of Eva's 'questionable' first-person narrative. Unimaginative study groups in the US seem to be giving Shriver's novel a latter-day rendition of that rather Procrustean reading (so fashionable in the academy to this day) of \\"The Turn of the Screw\\", where the female narrator, driven by her own demons, dooms the two young children she is supposed to take care of. After all, much has been made of the epistolary structure of the novel (whereby we can never escape Eva's viewpoint), so 'students' are obliged to ponderously ask themselves if Eva's damning depiction of Kevin can be taken at face value. But unless Eva is making up whole sentences from Kevin's own mouth and grotesquely fabricating his response to his sister's ordeal (among other things), then the common-sense conclusion seems inescapable: the slovenly, vacuous and baleful Kevin is plainly a malevolent and useless human being. So what's there to cogitate on? <br /> <br />Fifthly, a garbled message. It has been bruited about in the press that this book 'offers no pat answers'. (Read: authorial cop-out.) Really? In fact, the 'answer' the author does provide bookends the novel: it's there in the opening quote, and in the incredulity-inducing closing lines, whose sheer nerve I found myself gasping at. If this is the 'moral' of a novel this mean, then it is a very twisted one indeed, all the more so so for being clumsily grafted onto a story whose villain clearly invalidates it. <br /> <br />So: two stars for genuinely superb prose. For everything else (the garbled theme, no responsibility to the reader, crass sensationalism used as bait for deeper issues, plot holes, the denouement): zero merit. For a truly interesting meditation on family tragedy, try judith Guest's \\"Ordinary People\\". That novel at least exhibits some responsibilty. And decency.
B0002J4X1Q|4.0|This is a great movie for all of you gamers out there. I enjoyed it. It wasent all that bad. I am gonna talk about the dvd aspects of it. I AM GONNA TALK ABOUT THE DELUXE EDITION. <br /> <br />                          IMAGE: <br />The 1:85:1 anamorphic widescreen image looks brillantly,hi-tech,smooth,sharp, and clear. The picture quality is not as good as the SuperBit DVD's video only when it comes to shadow-rendering. Had the SuperBit disc not existed, then this one would be great for showing off your expensive new TV. <br /> <br />                          SOUND: <br />The state-of-the-art Dolby Digital 5.1 sound design is tremendous. Sound effects ricochet around the room courtesy of five very active channels and an overactive mix. In fact,the subwoofer isn't made just to thump,rather,the sound designers created a low bass feed that thumps creatively,pulsingly,so you won't hear/feel a continous boom but a mix of booms that will rock you to your bones.However,since everything is so damn loud, you might have to constantly adjust your volume settings in order to hear the actor's dialogue and to avoid blowing out your speakers. There's also a DD 2.0 surround Spanish track, Optional English,French,Portuguese,and Spanish subtitles as well as optional English closed captions support the audio. <br /> <br />                           SPECIAL FEATURES: <br />The original Special Edition had a decent collection of extras. The Deluxe Edition is a simple expansion of the Special Edition, so it's up to you if you want to buy it.  <br /> <br />The first extras are two audio commentaries. From the first Special Edition we get and audio commentary bu Paul W.S. Anderson. Milla Jovovich,Michelle Rodriquez and producer Jeremy Bolt. They share a lot of laughs about the movie while they discuss what was done to create each scene that flickers across the screen. This is actually fun,enjoyable commentary even though the commentators are talking about a dreary,dreadful enterprise. Theother audio commentary features members of the visual effects team, and as expected, this is a technicalminded and occasionaly boring track if you're not a total tech wonk. <br /> <br />Next up are eleven featurettes. The featurettes have names that are self-explanatory. The eleven featurettes are <br />1.Playing Dead: Resident Evil,From Game to Screen <br />2.Scoring Resident Evil <br />3.Storyboarding Resident Evil <br />4.Costumes <br />5.Set Design <br />6.The Creature <br />7.The Elevator <br />8.The Laser <br />9.The Train <br />10.Zombie Dogs <br />11.Zombies <br />All of these featurettes are fun and interesting to watch. <br />Then theres an alternate ending with an introduction by the director.Then there's a clip from Resident Evil Apacolypse.Then there are filmographies. The last thing is trailers. <br />   <br /> <br />IMAGE:I give it 8 stars out of 10. <br />SOUND:I give it 9 stars out of 10. <br />SPECIAL FEATURES:I give it 6 stars out of 10. <br /> <br /> <br />  <br />
B000002U6E|4.0|With their first release, Enigma showed that you can create a commercially successful record out of sampled beats, French whispers and chanting, Latin monks. Various other artists quickly caught on to the idea and jumped on to the world-electronic-Newage-chillout bandwagon, releasing singles with various degrees of success. But Enigma returned with their second studio album `The Cross of Changes' to show them how it's really done.  <br />The album begins with `The Second Chapter', reintroducing the familiar horns from the first album's `Voice of Enigma', but largely abandoning that track's cringing pretentiousness with more grounded lyrics and ominous, rolling synths that flow into the epic `Eyes of Truth'. This 9-minute instrumental showcases fantastically how Michael Cretu extends his palette of instruments to those of...well, pretty much everywhere in the world. Yes, the pan pipes come back, but we also have reed instruments and a vast array of percussion that add such depth and texture to the songs that you'll hear something new with each listen. You do get the occasional choir of monks cropping up, but it's Asian chants here that take centre stage. And nowhere on this album are they mixed as perfectly as they are on `Return to Innocence': a truly moving and uplifting track about abandoning pretence and believing in yourself.  <br />The glory of this track is strangely juxtaposed to one of Enigma's darkest tracks, `I Love You...I'll Kill You', another 9-minute extravaganza with questionable lyrics but an awesome guitar solo provided by Enigma co-producer, Jens Gad. The darkness continues with the rhythmic, politically charged `Silent Warrior' with its rant on colonisation and Christian hypocrisy before we're given a breather with the short, sweet and tender `Dream of the Dolphin' which rounds off the brilliant first two-thirds of the album.  <br />The tracks which follow - `Age of Loneliness' (a slightly tweaked `Carly's Song', which Enigma contributed towards the film `Sliver') and `Out from the Deep' - are by no means bad, they're just weaker than those mentioned so far. The album ends far from disappointingly, though, as we're given a brilliant send-off by the short and stirring title song. <br />The consistency of this album doesn't quite match that of MCMXC a.D. as its mood (from joyous, to depressed, to angry) does tend to change quite abruptly which makes it quite hard to see what Cretu is trying to say. His raspy, sandpaper-ish vocals also feature more in this record and although they work on the `Silent Warrior', you can't help thinking that `Out from the Deep' might sound better with someone else on vocal duties.  <br />Still, this album does better its predecessor in one respect: even though all the tracks flow into each other, each one is strong enough to stand on their own. And with all the hypnotic sounds that trickle from the speakers, this album is definitely a worthy successor to MCMXC a.D. <br />
B000006TRV|5.0|Soft barely discernible notes twinkling in an almost sinister childish melody, suddenly loud anthemic guitar chords are played. This is how Pink Floyds \\"The Wall\\" opens, a rock opera that is along with \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" widely considered to be Pink Floyd's best album. Is it really Pink Floyd's best album, as many People here make it out to be? No its not, in fact its not even one of their better albums. <br /> <br />Why is it that this doesn't rank among their better albums? I used to think it was because their usual spacey psychedelic sound isn't as prominent on this album, that's not it though. I mean Genesis went for a different approach on \\"The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway\\", and yet it is probably Genesis's best overall album. The problem is that Pink Floyd had decided that the lyrics were more important than the music. Really it was Rogers and David's fault. By this time, both of their egos had swollen, and they both had decided to kick Rick Wright out of the band. It is the fact that Rick Wright was absent for over half of the album is what really brings it down, as his work with the keyboards is absolutely amazing. So is the music bad? Well because this is Pink Floyd, it is definitely not bad. It's got a lot of weak spots, but there are also some absolutely mind blowing moments. Comfortably Numb is a beautiful and mysterious song. Hey You is dark and quite eerie. The Trial is really weird but is also really good. Is There Anybody Out There? is haunting with its finger picked acoustic melody and light orchestration. Goodbye Blue Sky is perhaps even more chilling also featuring an acoustic finger picked melody, and some stunning synth-work. A lot of the album features an orchestra, and I have to say as with Atom Heart Mother the orchestra goes really well with the music. <br /> <br />So what's so great about these lyrics that Roger Waters felt were more important than the actual music? The lyrics tell a story and the story is a mixture of the story of RogerWaters and the tragic descent into madness of their original guitarist/singer/songwriter/frontman Syd Barrett. Of course there are a lot of fictional elements added in(neither of the aforementioned men ever got up on stage and called everyone in the audience out racially, neither man was or is a Nazi etc.) The lyrics and concept on this album are better any other thought up by Waters, and you always discover something new in the story with each listen. <br /> <br />So is The Wall worth buying, of course it is all Pink Floyd Albums(discounting AMLOR) are worth buying at some point, Who knows you may even end up considering it to be Pink Floyds best album. <br />
B000BM6AVA|4.0|\\"Hypnotize,\\" the second half of System of a Down's 2005 opus, is clearly a continuation of their first album, \\"Mezmerize\\" (which was released in May). In addition to not being very far removed musically from \\"Mezmerize,\\" this album also follows about the same blueprint. The songs on \\"Hypnotize\\" are very corky and energetic. It combines jokes with serious, bold political messages, and heavy songs (\\"Stealing Society\\") with slower, ballad-esque numbers (\\"Lonely Day\\"). Plus, many of the songs have several tempo changes. (\\"Dreaming\\" combines \\"Chop Suey\\"-esque singing with tempo changes that bring \\"B.Y.O.B.\\" to mind, and \\"U-Fig\\" and \\"Holy Mountains\\" are chaotic, off-the-wall tunes with whiplash speed changes and even acoustic guitar breakdowns.) And, finally, guitarist/songwriter Daron Malankian gets more time at the mic than he did on the band's first two albums. But most of his singing, here, is actually pretty good. (Track one, \\"Attack\\" begins with fast, ultra-crunchy riffs, before Daron begins to croon nasally, and he actually sounds as good as Serj.)     \\"She's Like Heroin\\" goes absolutely no where, and \\"Vicinity of Obscenity\\" is so silly, it could be a \\"Steal This Album\\" b-side. But most of these songs are very good and there are a few mature moments (i.e. \\"Kill Rock `N Roll\\" and the title track), which sound more along the lines of a traditional System of a Down song.     Upon my first listening to this album, I was not at all impressed. I thought System were trying too hard to be funny, but usually ended up coming across as goofy. Fortunately, however, I gave this disc repeated spins and it grew on me quite a lot. So I recommend you do the same; buy it, and give it time to sink under your skin (something it will most definitely do). It isn't a great C.D., but it's still quite good, and worth buying if you're a fairly big SOAD fan; if you're a casual fan, however, you will probably be satisfied with just one of System's five records.

0307276902|5.0|James Frey is one of the best writters today.  He writes this book beautifully.  This book is deep and meaningful.  I cannot wait to dig into \\"My Friend Leonard\\"
B000AARKOO|3.0|Here we have a film that crosses a few genres.  Kingdom of Heaven is part drama, part history, and part war flick, with content that will inevitably be associated with modern current events.  As such there are several different divisions of moviegoers who may have an interest in this movie, each with their own expectations and hopes for what they will find.  Bearing this in mind, I offer the following observations: <br /> <br />1.  This is not a history documentary.  It's a dramatized work of fiction.  If you hold some kind of degree in medieval history or just read a lot of nonfiction on the period you're likely to find some things that don't match up to the \\"real story.\\"  Of particular note is the uncharacteristically modern set of ideas on individuality and respect for those of differing faiths held and expressed by some of the characters.  If you can let that slide and enjoy the film for its story and action, you should be OK.  But if historical inaccuracies make you pull your hair out and curse at people who aren't there, you might not like Kingdom of Heaven. <br /> <br />2.  If you're an armchair general or fan of military tactics, the battle scenes may come off as a disappointment... not because they are lacking in spectacle or technical brillance, but because the tactical side of the battles is largely skipped over.  There isn't a lot of maneuvering or strategy in the depictions; both armies just sort of charge into each other and commence with the usual displays of carnage and chaos, although these in themselves are well done and live up to the quality one would expect from the director of Gladiator. <br /> <br />3. If you harbor some irrational dislike of Orlando Bloom, for whatever reason, Kingdom of Heaven probably will not convert you.  He performs ably enough as the moody Balian of Ibelin, but there  are often moments when you still don't forget you're watching an actor protraying a unlikely hero.  The character's sometimes-lukewarm charisma owes moreto the script than any shortcomings on Bloom's part.  In the end, he's certainly no worse than Kevin Costner as Robin of Locksley. <br /> <br />4. The historical-political and religious themes of Kingdom of Heaven will also draw criticisms from people who zoom in on this content and can concentrate on nothing else.  This is not a story of noble-Christians-against-savage-Muslim-pagans; neither is it a wholesale condemnation of faith or a glossy commercial for Islam.    If there is a \\"message\\" to be taken from the film, it would be a reminder of the folly of using faith as a license to wage war, while simultaneously glorifying the courage and gallantry of the warrior.  If this sounds dangerously close to \\"politcial correctness,\\" consider yourself forewarned. <br /> <br />Kingdom of Heaven is not the greatest historical war drama ever filmed.  But it does deliver in violent spectacle, exotic settings and an enjoyable story.  Its most venomous criticisms tend to say more about the critics themselves than the object of their attack.
B000AP04FG|4.0|I think most people believe this movie is good amusing fun.  I actually do believe there is a little more to it.  Its the hard to describe something that seperates the ok movies from the good films. The not so subtle commentary on domestic and suburban life is wittier and more profound than i'd expected.  I came away thinking i'd gotten something more than the mindless fun i was looking for, which really made it worth the time.
0790729644|5.0|The Unforgiven is an instant classic.  The movie pays homage to the western genre but has added realism and intensity many classic westerns lack.  The characters are richer and more complex than many westerns, and as I said has more realism and intensity, so you don't need to be a western fan to enjoy.  Film is a dark story, so if you are looking for a feel-good cowboy, this is not the film for you.
0553801503|5.0|By now you know that not all of your favorite characters are included in this volume.  Does it succeed in being as compelling and intriguing as the past novel have?  In large part, yes, but not  due to huge battles or overcrafted plots.  It's because we've invested so much into these characters, and we care about happens to them.     <br /> <br />Some of the characters' continue to evolve over time and some struggle to keep their own identity.  Take the Stark girls.  In this novel they both have identity crises of their own.  Sansa has to act the role of Littlefinger's natural daughter, and Arya has to change who she is to win the approval of the Faceless Men in Braavos.  Jaime Lannister also continues to try to improve is self-image as the Kingslayer.  His sweet sister, Cersei, tries her hardest to be her late father, Tywin, to disastrous results.    And then. . . <br /> <br />But I've said too much already.  The novel also has some Brienne of Tarth, Samwell Tarly, and Ironmen action.  Each storyline has their own intrigues, secrets, and twists, you'll just have to read to find out about.   <br /> <br />Detractors who say nothing happens in this book are reading for huge plot twists and action that came in larger portions in the previous books.  Those of us who have taken the bait with his characters will continue to be reeled in, while the nibblers might be disappointed.   <br /> <br />And only Moon Boy would compare Martin to Jordan.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|Whatever you may feel about Madonna, her new effort \\"Confessions on a Dancefloor\\" is the best work that she has put out since 1998's Ray of Light. And trust me this is coming from a hard core fan! Maddy has finally released a well crafted pop record, which has a focus,a  point, and even a theme even though its all cleverley disguised in the form of a non stop party record. <br /> <br />The theme is to have a good time and dance on the surface, but if you look closer the focus of the record is very often Madonna examing past relationships ( \\"Sorry\\" \\"Push\\" \\"Forbiden Love\\", or disecting her own behavior ( \\"How High\\", \\"Jump\\"). <br /> <br />The problem with Madonna's last couple of full lenght albums was her timing and ideas. 2000's Music was an intelligent album, but it was way ahead of its time, and I mean come on how many times can we look at Madonna in a cowboy hat? <br />2003's American Life did not boast the best musical choices, but was plagued right from the begining b/c of Madonna's desire to say the Right thing at the Wrong time. Would American Life have better success being released in 2005? - Hell yes. <br /> <br />Confessions, on the other hand not only invites you to dance, but also creates European infused sly pop and dance tracks like the infectious \\"Sorry\\", and the lead hit single \\"Hung Up\\". Nevertheless the cd still  gets 4 stars because the album does have throwaway fillers, but in Madonna's defense only two of them \\"Isaac\\" and \\"Let it will be\\" . As a whole Confessions works so well, because Madonna is one of those rare artists who can make you dance and tell an important story during it, a concept which many artists have tried to grasp, but have failed; because after all who do you know who can confess during a dance groove better than good ole Maddy? <br />
0375707972|5.0|This relatively easy to read work of emotionally \\"ensnaring\\" fiction by Bernhard Schlink, a gifted writer, who also happens to be a professor of law at the University of Berlin and an active judge, is one of those books everyone should keep forever and also buy to pass forward as a  gift. The plot and its characters - 30 year-old Hanna and Michael, her 15 year-old serendipitous sexual disciple - have already been reviewed here by others in detail. What I want to add is that this work of rare literary art lingered in my mind long after I read it. It became the central topic of stimulating talks about existentialism and life's seeming cruelty. And it became deeply inspirational to me and many of my friends before Oprah praised its special nature and helped it into a larger stream of readership. The question of who is the \\"victim\\" and who is the \\"exploiter\\", if the question is even applicable to a love story born within a sexual \\"molestation\\" setting and psychological drama between a 30 year-old woman and a 15 year-old boy, can become blurry at best. This is not yet one more story about Germany during or after WW II. This is a universal story about the deep, subtle folds of rare intimacy and abandonment between two souls in any country or period of humanity. This poetic tragedy will move you; especially the last four chapters. Buy it, read it, think about it and talk about its deep moral undertow with your friends because it shatters ordinary and comfortable moral superficiality.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Enough with the whole Mimi/Madge debate, it's stupid! (Although for the record, y'all say Mimi is better, but let's see how well she sells when she's 47).    Anyway, getting back to the real topic at hand; Madonna's new album is pretty rad. After 23 years it's hard to believe she still has it, but she does (not that she ever lost it). I recommend, completely.
B00003CXAE|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this movie. It's been a true classic since the 70's. John Travolta and Olivia Newton John do an excellent job with the acting, singing, and dancing.   Has a great storyline and is very enjoyable to watch. Even to this day, the music in this movie is very moving and you feel like you just gotta sing along. And this is coming from someone who is now in high school.   ALL PEOPLE OF ALL AGES WILL ENJOY THIS WONDERFUL FILM!!!    Two Thumbs Up!
B000AARKOO|4.0|Yes, Gladiator is better.  Yes, Orlando Bloom can be annoying.  Yes, the first half hour of this movie is a little corny and could have played out better, but this movie is very good.  The locations, characters, battles are all stunning and contribute to Ridley Scott's vision of the crusades in Jerusalem.  Unfortunately this DVD doesn't have a commentary by Scott, but some of the procuction footage is cool to watch and the 2 seperate documentaries about the real life crusades are interesting.  This movie might not be perfect, but it's still very good and worthy of at least one view by any Ridley Scott fan.
0553801503|1.0|I dont know why anyone would read this book and think its \\"good\\".  It totally IGNORES the main characters that were set and introduced in the first 3 books.  The queen targaryn in the south, Bran, Rickon, John Snow, Tyrion, and so many more.  Where are their points of view that solidified the first 3 books in the first place? <br /> <br />How do you go from forming a emotional attachment between the reader and the characters the author introduces as main characters and totally, TOTALLY devoids this fourth book of their presences after 4 years of waiting?  Seriously is this author hemorraging from some kind of brain disfunction? <br /> <br />I'm at exactly 1/2 way through the book now and I'm so disgusted with it that I will most likely not finish it.  I seriously wish I could get a refund for this garbage.

038533348X|4.0|A number of cultural institutions are in Kurt Vonnegut's crosshairs as he pens \\"Cat's Cradle,\\" and it's science, religion, and, to a lesser extent, basic social group identifications that come away bruised and beaten.  Even the childhood string game of Cat's Cradle is exposed by Vonnegut, which explains the title of the book.    The story's main character sets off to write a book detailing the day of the bombing of Hiroshima and how the family of the bomb's maker spent the day the world was introduced to nuclear weaponry.  What transpires is a wild ride where religion is mocked (San Lorenzan Bokononism is a seemingly logical religion that is closely followed despite its own admission that it's based solely on lies) and science is displayed as its own world that detaches its inhabitants from real society (Felix Hoenniker, the man behind the bomb, is lost in terms of raising his children and has never heard of \\"sin\\").  As far as Cat's Cradle -- the string game -- goes, Vonnegut uses the expression \\"See the cat?  See the cradle?\\" often throughout the book to emphasize the natural human tendency to see things that aren't really there, just as the array of strings in one's hands in no way resemble a cat or a cradle.    I'm not a big reader of this type of fiction but I definitely enjoyed this book.  For those who enjoy the eternal debate of science vs. religion and the investigation of these powerful institutions, I certainly recommend it.
B000002WYT|5.0|This is such an amazing CD, probably my favorite from anyone. I grew up with DMB, and i still love this CD today. My top 5 songs:  Crash (into me)- this is a highly recognized song which is sort of amusing considering that most people hear it once and think its a love song. If you listen to the words, thats not really it, but i dont care, its such a beautiful song and somehow still comes off to me as a love song even though i know its not really.     Let you down- not as popular as many other songs on the cd, but i find it's minimalistic approach gorgeous. A nice mix of catchy and melodic. Nice for when you're relaxing.    #41- another amazing song. Pretty mellow and just awesome. I dont know how to really explain this song, just listen to it. Its amazing.     Say Goodbye- this is a really amazing song which is basically about sex, but theres certainly more to it than that. Its about someone you could never have, and then you finally do, but so soon they're gone. I cant describe how good this song is, so just listen to it.     Lie in Our Graves- possibly my favorite song out of all of them. I love the meaning, and I also just love the song. Theres a good 3 or 4 minutes of just music- no words up until the end of the song. I can only imagine how amazing this song is in concert.    this entire cd is amazing, and anyone who's a DMB fan should definitely buy it.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|There isn't too much to say about Once Upon A Time In The West that can't already be found in the rest of these reviews. Sergio Leone ushered in the end of the classic American western with his \\"Dollars/ Man With No Name\\" Trilogy. OUATITW harkens back to the numerous films that inspired these \\"spaghetti westerns\\". High Noon, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, The Iron Horse, Shane, and Johnny Guitar are the most prevalent.  <br /> <br />I originally bought this first because I thought the cover looked cool, and secondly because I had enjoyed Leone's other films. A viewing later, and this DVD had begun it's rocket to the top of my favorite film list, where it now reigns as my all-time most beloved. I define this as my top film not only because of my enduring love for the picture, but aslo the watchablity of the piece. I try, and do so very easily, to watch the film at least once a month if possible.  <br /> <br />The film: I liken the story to fairy tale; not too much character development, but many classic elements of story telling that help weave a great western yarn. My take on why some negative reviews are always attached to this film is that some of the folks are looking for something more substantial, be it in terms of characterization, action, seriousness, or depth. I enjoy OUATITW because I don't have to think too much, but if I do want to, there are plenty of underlying symbolic elements to stimulate the ole cranium. <br /> <br />The DVD: this is where the item really shines. First and foremost, this DVD is one of the best restored films of all time. The sound is a joy to listen to (I speak primarily to the opening scene of the film), with a highlight being Ennio Morricone's outstanding score. The extras are on-par/ slightly above your average DVD. A handful of documentaries on the film featuring numerous cast/ crew and some substantial other contributors. Every other time I watch this film, I always listen to the commentary track. Filled with an all-star group of film personalities, the track proves to be very informational on the background of the making of the film, reactions to seeing the film the first time, and the film's place in movie history. Sir Christopher Frayling dominates the track, and rightly so being Leone's biographer. I wish he had his own track though. I ended up purchasing one of his books because I found him so informational and interesting. <br /> <br />The Price: A two disc DVD set with a decent amount of extras for less than $10.00?? If that doesn't seal the deal I don't know what will.  <br /> <br />Overall a highly recommended film for cineophiles, DVD collectors, aspiring film historians, and/or western fans (particularly the spagehtti western variety). <br /> <br />Other items to consider:  <br />- A Fistful Of Dollars/ For A Few Dollars More/ The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly by Sergio Leone (starring Clint Eastwood).  <br />- Once Upon A Time In The West Soundtrack by Ennio Morricone. <br />- Once Upon A Time In Italy or Something To Do With Death by Sir Christopher Frayling. <br />- The Art Of Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time In The West: A Critical Appreciation by John Fawell. <br /> <br />Happy movie watching!
B000B8QEYC|5.0|Enya returns with another classic. Her music is timeless, and this one is no different. Sure to be enjoyed by current fans and new fans alike. Very similar to 'A Day Without Rain' but the formula works for me. Definitely worth the purchase.
B0000B1OFN|5.0|Warning: This review might contain spoilers.  The 2003 version of \\"The Italian Job\\" is a great example of what a modern day action film contains.  It has villains, heroes, gun battles, car chases, great camera work, and of course a beautiful woman.  This film stands out on any list of action films and is an excellent movie. <br /> <br />This movie really has little in common with its 1969 predecessor, other than the fact that gold is stolen with the help of Mini Coopers.  However, this more modern version still manages to upend its earlier version.  The advancements in technology make the camera angles more impressive and much more interesting, while the idea of high tech tools make the characters the envy of modern males. <br /> <br />Seth Green steals every scene.  As the geeky computer hacker Lyle, Green manages to create a true geek image and brings a new level to the parody of the geek.  As he helps the thieves hack the computer systems necessary for the job, he constantly flashes back to his college days where he claims to be the real maker of Napster. <br /> <br />The casting is perfect.  Mark Wahlberg plays the leading role of hero Charlie Croker.  Edward Norton, who does a great job making his character disliked, takes on the villain role.  Charlize Theron plays the role of beautiful woman, Stella Bridger.  Charlize does an excellent job with this role and this is the best she has looked in one of her films. <br /> <br />In Conclusion, F. Gary Gray's version of \\"The Italian Job\\" is superior compared to its predecessor.  This movie updates all of the elements from 1969, which are now obsolete.  The film is well done and the new twist on a well-known plot is appreciated and creates a new classic. <br />
B00005JO1P|5.0|My wife and I went to see this movie the day after Thanksgiving. It is the first time we've been to a movie theatre in two years because none of the \\"predominately computer generated slash em and gash em garbage that Hollywierd calls movies have been worth going to see\\". I Walk The Line was a refreshing change!  <br />     The cast performances were excellent and Phoenix and Witherspoon were astounding! This is a must see for Country music fans, regular music fans, and nostalgia fans. <br />     In my humble opinion, anyone who could give this movie a bad review, is someone who just can't be pleased! <br />We can't wait for the DVD
B000BB14YY|5.0|It is no exaggeration to say that many fans of Kurosawa and his late-life masterpiece, RAN, have suffered through the indignity of two very sub-par DVD releases of this great film, at least in North America.  Basically, almost since the advent of DVD, people who revered this movie and this director waited in frustration for a decent distributor to take charge of the project and do it justice. <br /> <br />Third time's the charm as the old saw goes.  Criterion has answered our wishes in 2005--and how. <br /> <br />Not only have they given RAN a transfer so good that it may actually look and sound better than it did 20 years ago in cinemas when it was a new film--they have also put on virtually every supplement fans could wish for.   <br /> <br />Chiefly, Chris Marker's A.K.: a unique film, by a unique filmmaker, dedicated to a unique filmmaker.  No ordinary 'behind-the-scenes,' he creates an insightful but restrained tone poem about what a Kurosawa set feels like.  This film was exceedingly difficult to see in the U.S. for a long time and is an excellent companion piece to the feature. <br /> <br />Elsewhere on disc 2, Tatsuya Nakadai gives an interview, with great vitality, about working for the master and the immense challenge of the role of Hidetora. <br /> <br />Included is a Japanese TV documentary that provides a different, more straightforward but no less interesting look at RAN's production. <br /> <br />A gorgeous montage of Kurosawa's original art, from his long gestation period before RAN was finally green-lit for production, shows what a visionary and artist he was even when cameras weren't rolling. <br /> <br />Stephen Prince's commentary track on the film itself is fun and insightful. <br /> <br />Sidney Lumet's admiring comments and the creaky old trailers on disc 1 are non-essential but nice to have all the same. <br /> <br />The thick booklet is an interesting read, par for the course with some Criterion editions.  It includes an essay plus two interviews, one with Kurosawa and one with the excellent composer Toru Takemitsu. <br /> <br />But the main attraction is, naturally, the great film which is RAN...Kurosawa's dramatic meditation on the problems of violence, vanity, greed and hatred in the human soul, expressed through an adapted scenario of Shakespeare's King Lear.  It is a film to experience and re-experience for the richness of the drama, the grand, painterly and epic style which is near-perfect, and the universality of its themes. <br /> <br />And now, viewers can do so at home, in the best possible way.  If you have hesitated to get a DVD of this classic, don't wait a moment longer.  If you bought it before, sell it or throw it in the trash bin and be assured that your money is going toward the definitive edition which now does this masterpiece the justice it deserves. <br /> <br />Bravo, Criterion!
B000BM6AVA|2.0|Why is there no growling and deep yells?  Why is there a whiny punk voice that seems to always overthrow one of the most interesting voices in music today?  Why does one of my favorite bands build you up so much then kind of let you down?  This album would have 5 out of 5 except that i all i hear half the time is a punk voice.  Serj has one of the most captivating voices i have heard in along time.  I don't even like this genre of music at all but system has always hooked me with it's raw sound, and a voice that just pulls you in, i hate punk music and that's what i think of when i hear whiny darron, it just makes me mad that such a great band has to whine so much.  But i can't help not to love this cd.  It just is a let down.
B000005JA8|5.0|First of all this is a great and provoking album that any one who has heard and liked Captain Beefheart should own.<br /><br />That said, this is not a good starting point for neophytes.  It is by far the Captain's most strange and difficult album.  Only a few tracks will satisfy the casual listener (think \\"Moonlight on Vermont\\" and \\"China Pig.\\")  \\"Trout Mask Replca\\" is often cited as Beefheart's greatest album, and many agree.  This causes people who are new to Captain Beefheart obtaining this album first, which can be an off-putting event.<br /><br />My recommendation is to first buy \\"Safe As Milk\\" and the \\"Spotlight Kid/Clear Spot\\" double.  If you're happy at that point, verge into this album for perhaps \\"Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller).  There will be plenty of journey left!
B000AP04MO|5.0|AT LONG LAST, Fox has FINALLY put this movie out on DVD. This is one of my favorite films and along with Roman Holiday, my favorite Audrey Hepburn film. Released in 1967, decades ahead of its time, it was over the heads of most viewers and failed to find much of an audience. But over the years its attracted a fanatical cult who just love it. And I'm certainly among them. Road is what I'd call a realistically romantic love story. One that ends HOPEFULLY more so than happily ever after. Rather than tell the story in a conventional sense, writer Frederic Raphael (Darling; Eyes Wide Shut) tells it in a series of flashbacks. But even the flashbacks dont unfold in a conventional sense. Rather, like memories, they weave in and out of time: linked by locales, people, even conversations. The movie opens with Joanna and Mark wondering if its all been worth it after 12 yrs of marriage. Both are somewhat bitter and cynical and wondering what went wrong. Using their summer vacations to France as they travel through their marriage memories, the movie is a unique cinematic road trip. The movie isnt that difficult to follow. There are a half dozen different time periods and you can easily tell where you are in time by the cars, Hepburn's clothes and hair styles and the like. Hepburn and Finney have great chemistry (there were rumors of an affair and it was true her marriage broke up around a year later, so who knows?) There are great bits by Eleanor Bron and William Daniels as buffoonic American tourists, wonderful locales, great scenery, Henry Mancini music. What more could you ask for? Hepburn in particular is a revelation in this. She never had a more complex role (before or since) and gives what is perhaps her career peak performance. (One wonders what roles she could have played had she not retired soon after this movie came out. She was certainly capable of more than Hollywood demanded of her. What a waste!). She swears (charmingly); commits adultery, even has several semi-nude scenes! She has never looked more beautiful on the screen. This movie is a class act all the way. The kind of sophisticated romance that Hollywood, sadly, doesnt make anymore. (Come to think of it, the genre began to disappear after Hepburn stopped making films...). From Stanley Donen's direction, the wonderfully witty script and editing (characters start a sentence in one time period and end it in another; pass each other on the road...);the gorgeous photography and scenery; Henry Mancini's score (perhaps his best). Its amazing that only the script was nominated for an Oscar (and lost to Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, if you can believe that!) Hepburn was nominated that year but for the far inferior film, Wait Until Dark. This is one of the best and best loved movies from the 60's. Join the cult! Buy it for someone you love! More important SEE it with someone you love! I guarantee its one movie you'll want to watch over and over.  A wonderful Christmas gift too!
B00003CXAW|5.0|`King Kong', the original produced and directed by Merian C. Cooper and Ernest B. Schoedsack is one of those legendary films which totally transcend it's genre, even if it can be given credit for having invented that genre (of giant monster movies).<br /><br />With the imminent release of Peter Jackson's remake of `King Kong', the original has been released on DVD with a fair assortment of special features, the very best (or at least my favorite) is the commentary track by `Visual Special Effects Veterans Roy Harryhausen and Ken Ralston'. To be sure, neither of these two greats worked on this movie and I suspect Ralston wasn't even born in 1933 when the movie was first released. If you had any doubts about the movie's importance before, their comments, interspersed with interviews with Faye Ray, will clearly show where and how the movie was such a great innovation.<br /><br />I always had a warm spot in my heart for the original `King Kong', since, when I was in grade school (early 1950's), the movie was re-released in the theatre and my parents would not let me see it because `it was too scary!' Once I finally saw it, I always wondered if the real reason wasn't that the movie was just a tad too erotic. One sign of the weaknesses of the 1972 remake with Jessica Lange in the Fay Wray part is that the relation between Kong and the girl was simply not as well done. I hope Master Jackson will follow through on that matter.<br /><br />It has been a long time since I last saw `King Kong', but I get the feeling that several short shots which were typically edited out of the movie, especially for television, have been restored to this version. Harryhausen and Ralston both refer to deleted scenes here and there, and I am happy they have been restored, although they don't add a lot to the overall impact of the movie.<br /><br />Since I suspect that Peter Jackson will be largely remaking the original story (Harryhausen and Ralston reinforce this impression, as their commentary must have been made in the last few months) as is rather than rewriting the story to fit the 21st century, it is strongly recommended that you see this DVD plus commentary before Jackson's epic hits the multiplex!<br /><br />Highly recommended.mmentary must have been made in the last few months) as is rather than rewriting the story to fit the 21st century, it is strongly recommended that you see this DVD plus commentary before Jackson's epic hits the multiplex! <br /> <br />Highly recommended. <br />

0553801503|4.0|In playwriting, they say that if you show a gun in the first act, it must be fired by the end of the second act.  _A Storm of Swords_, the last book in George R.R. Martin's epic, closed with a veritable 21-gun salute, resolving questions from as far back as the opening pages of _A Game of Thrones_. <br /> <br />At the beginning of _A Feast for Crows_, the status quo is roughly this: The \\"good guys,\\" such as they are in Martin's complex universe, have lost their various bids to rule the Seven Kingdoms.  After a debilitating civil war, schemers and plotters circle like junkyard dogs struggling over the last bits of meat on a particularly thin kill. <br /> <br />In _Feast_, most of the popular viewpoint characters have left the scene or have died.  So instead of the life of the Starks, we get perspectives from the scheming Queen Cersei, who slowly runs the Seven Kingdoms into the ground with her petty plots; Jaime Lannister, her brother and erstwhile lover, who seems torn between redeeming his honor and living up to his father's legacy; and players among the Greyjoys and the Dornes, who have their own plans for the Iron Throne. <br /> <br />_Feast_ is hardly the most exciting book so far in the series.  There's precious little military action, and a lot of scheming and talking.  In some ways, that's a letdown, as Martin has addicted his readers to pitched battles, knights in shining armor, and the song of steel on steel.  But in reality, it's just fine.  _Feast_ isn't about war.  It's about what happens after war. <br /> <br />But _Feast_ is also a transition, a set-up for events yet to come in _A Dance of Dragons_ and beyond.  As the reader plows through _Feast_'s hundreds of pages, he can see Martin setting up the guns for his big finale.  Plots afoot in Dorne.  Lord Snow's balancing act in the north.  Sansa and Arya Stark and their dissimilar, yet similar, heroic journeys.  Rumblings of discontent between the Lannisters and the Tyrells. <br /> <br />_Feast_ offers one more element that sets it apart from the previous tomes in this series.  From _A Game of Thrones_ to _A Storm of Swords_, the war over the Seven Kingdoms has been something waged among the nobility, for the sake of the nobility.  But for the first time, _Feast_ brings home the war's deleterious effect on the common people ... and foreshadows the commoners' heightened role in deciding the land's fate. <br /> <br />A number of readers are going to read _Feast_ and walk away disappointed.  But not to read _Feast_ would be a huge mistake, akin to reading the first fifty pages and the last hundred pages of a novel.  A story's middle parts are seldom the most captivating.  But the story's middle is always, always essential.  Without the middle, you know where the characters start and where they end up ... but you skip over their journey.  And isn't that journey the whole point of reading a book?
0062502182|5.0|I just loived \\"The Alchemist\\"! I started reading it while waiting for a flight to Europe, then kept reading it until I finished it, many hours later on yet another airport. When I started I had felt a bit depressed, leaving my family behind, and the novel lifted my mood. It's so nice to read stories like these! My most memorable quote is when the Alchemist  tells Santiago: \\"Remember what I told you: the world is only the visible aspect of God...\\" Those words just keep running through mu head.  <br />Now, on my way through Spain,(I am taking a train from Paris) I will look around the countryside hoping to see a sheppard boy, perhaps about to embark on a magical journey in search of his personal legend. For me, it reminds me that I am following my personal legend, trying to get tenure after so many years of study, and now teaching. I have pursued my dream since high school, when I decided that I loved History and that I wanted to devote my life to it. Getting tenure would be my crowning achievement, my treasure.  <br />I am so happy that Mr. Coelho wrote this book, and also that people are starting to read and recommend \\"Dream Maker:A Mystical Tale\\" that wonderful novel about a past life that has all those spiritual secrets. I was suprised to see it mentioned because hardly anyone knows about it. <br />I can't wait to see both books turned into novels.

B000A6T1HC|5.0|The title of my review reflects my exact feelings when I was shopping for music today. Went into the Classical section of the store and heard 'Opera Proibita' playing over the sound system. Wow...what a voice! Boy, can Cecilia ever pound out some quick, almost mechanical vocals! This is no regular opera, that's for sure. I looked at my partner and said \\"come on, we gotta get this one\\". After 10 minutes, we walked out of the store with CD in hand. Each and every of Cecilia's albums brings a new meaning to Opera and Arias. Hers is a voice of unbeatable power and attitude. Although I love Operatic music, my knowledge of this style of music is still quite small. Among all the female Opera & Classical singers, Cecilia has always stunned me with her facial expressions and the way she propels her voice (when singing live on TV).<br /><br />I love this recording as a whole, so I won't talk about the tracks. Instead, here's the tracklisting:<br /><br />01. All'arme si accesi guerrieri (Aria dell Pace) - 2:38<br /><br />02. Mentre io godo (Aria della Speranza) - 4:48<br /><br />03. Un pensiero nemico di pace - 3:55<br /><br />04. Vanne pentita a piangere - 8:46<br /><br />05. Sparga il senso lascivo veleno - 2:58<br /><br />06. Caldo Sangue - 5:26<br /><br />07.

Inside are the lyrics and a tri-lingual (English, French and German) detailed bio of \\"Forbidden Opera\\", which is very interesting & informative. Included are photos from that time period when this style of Opera was forbidden by the Church & Theatre. Cecilia is gorgeous in her black gown with very bust-enhancing bodice.

0684824906|4.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin delivers and delivers well with \\"Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln\\".  The scope of her work is Lincoln's inner circle of Seward, Stanton, Chase and Bates but, more broadly, his ability to handle people and politics.  Goodwin vividedly demonstrates Lincoln's uncanny timing regarding the implementation of emancipation and gives a fair assessment of his views regarding the \\"peculiar institution\\".  This book is about Lincoln as a leader, a manager and a politician.  It is also about his evolving vision about certain topics (i.e, how to handle slaves once freed) and his steadfast desire to hold the Union together, literally at all costs.  His belief in the precepts of the Founding Fathers is at all times present.<br /><br />For those wishing an expansive biography on Lincoln, try Lincoln by David Herbert Donald.  For those wishing a broader view on the period and the Civil War, Battle Cry of Freedom by James McPherson.  For those who would like a good but accurate piece of historical fiction, Lincoln by Gore Vidal or Freedom by William Safire.<br /><br />This book is for those who want to see how Abe Lincoln led, managed, formulated stategy, handled very conflicting opinions, this is the book.  A great read, if a bit choppy (perhaps a given with the nature of the subject matter).
B000B8QEYC|5.0|Sometimes it's good to wait a while before buying & reviewing a CD. I downloaded the album prior to purchasing it, only because I wanted to see if Enya's comeback was as good as the reviews said. I'm proud to say...yes, it is a fantastic comeback and has totally outdone 'A Day without Rain'. 'Amarantine' is a gorgeous soundscape of liquid, flowing melody & rich vocals, making it one of Enya's best recordings. I put it right up there with 'Watermark' and 'Shepherd Moons'. Each song pulled me deeper into the album until I finally said \\"okay, I gotta go buy it\\"...and thats' what I did today. What a lovely pre-Christmas gift!<br /><br />With its colorful & stunning artwork, 'Amarantine' captures the listener's eyes, ears, heart and soul. All you have to do is look in Enya's pretty, ageless face and you feel her inspiration talents taking their toll on your soul. In the past 5 years, I've come to appreciate New Age & Celtic music even more than before, because of inspirational recordings such as 'Amarantine', as a whole. 'It's In The Rain' is a standout track, flowing with Enya's rich, \\"singing\\" voice...which I've not heard much of before. And no, Enya does NOT sound like Dolores O'Riordan in this song. Enya's voice is elegant and smooth. Normally, Enya vocalizes more, becoming part of background music itself. But this time, each song pops with lively vocals.<br /><br />Of course, none of this could be possible without Nicky Ryan's production genius. Together, over the years, both Enya and Nicky only get better, although 'Memory of Trees' was shorter & less \\"alive\\". 'Amarantine' makes up for that loss. I love the bell and the little things which make up the CD as a whole. There isn't a dry, boring song on the album at all. I don't care what the 3 and 4 star reviewers have to say. Enya hasn't lost her touch and she'll continue writing beautiful music like always. Although the album is 46 minutes long, it's still packed with a long journey of melody and talent.<br /><br />The artwork is pretty and simple. Inside the liner notes booklet, you'll find a Loxian passage on the innner front cover. There are 2 lovely photos of Enya, small but elegant, as always. The CD itself is blood red, contrasting with the solid white background & hint of blood red, continuing from Enya's red gown on the front cover.

0380789035|5.0|\\"American Gods\\" is about a normal guy with his past in shadows, not only to others but also to himself.  After he gets out of jail and tries to return home -- wherever that is, as it's not where it was before his incarceration -- he encounters many beings of dubious diety while wandering the heartland of America.  Things get tangled,  loyalties get challenged, duties get passed back and forth. And our hero's past, present and future become clear. The last few chapters, for me, were truly moving.

B00005N6KG|2.0|I'll do a simple pros-and-cons here, but will summarize by saying I was highly disappointed<br /><br />Pros:<br />Sound is excellent and rich. That's it.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Very short cord.<br />Buds pop out of the ear easily, although I had no trouble with the headset falling off.<br />Difficult to place buds in the ear for good sound.<br />Biggest negative: Rough edges (casting flash) on the earbuds require the development of ear calluses--a mere minute or two caused serious discomfort. Not acceptable.<br />A couple of months later: After I did develop the required calluses, the band started to stretch, so they now fall off easily. Sigh.
0553801503|5.0|Before reading the fourth book in the series A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE, all I really knew about it was that it was not intended to be a part of the original canon.  After the conclusion of A STORM OF SWORDS, George R. R. Martin intended to jump forward in the plot by five years.  However, enough of his readers requested knowledge of what happened during that time that he relented and wrote this book (and presumably A DANCE WITH DRAGONS). <br /> <br />Before starting this book, I checked here on Amazon.com to see what the general consensus was.  I was dismayed to see that it generated a 3 1/2 star average.  I knew I was going to buy and read it anyway, but I was scared that the middle portion of the series was going to become bogged down a la THE WHEEL OF TIME.  After reading the book, I am glad to say that it definitely not what happened. <br /> <br />From what I can tell, there are three main complaints about this installment: <br /> <br />1)  Too many minor/new characters.  I don't even see how this is an issue.  With one exception, every POV is from a character who was introduced in one of the previous three books and established  as integral to the overall plot, albeit not equally.  The sole exception is Arianne Martell (and the one early chapter with Areo Hotah).  Personally, that is fine by me.  How can any reader have been introduced to the Red Viper in ASOS and NOT been eager to meet more of his family? <br /> <br />2)  Jaime Lannister's changed character.  I credit this to presumption.  We have to remember that over the course of the first three books, we learn about Jaime as much from other people speaking about the reputation of \\"The Kingslayer\\" as we do from Jaime's own POV.  Thus what we thought we might know about Jaime might not at all be accurate.  Remember that on two separate occasions, Jaime saved Brienne at great harm to himself.  And recall his own recollection of the event that earned him his nickname.  Then realize that many of his \\"despicable\\" actions have been due to the great (although at least in one case questionably misguided) love he has for his siblings.  And since he is becoming more and more independent of them, he is able to make decisions on his own.  I don't think he's changing as much as GRRM is revealing the true Jaime to us and showing us how reputation can be greatly different from the true man. <br /> <br />3)  Sansa Stark's changed character.  This argument holds a little more validity because her charcter IS changing/changed.  However that transformation is not out of line.  For most of her life Sansa thought that whole world was full of gallant knights and fair maidens and she had a noble father and beautiful mother to reinforce those beliefs.  But now everything that she knew is gone and she is learning that the world is not like the stories she heard growing up.  She spent much of her recent time with first the Imp and later Littlefinger so she is absorbing the notion that it requires guile and cunning to survive in the world. <br /> <br />There is justification in the argument that many favorite characters (Tyrion, Arya, Jon Snow, Dany) get little to no mention in this book.  However, GRRM explains all that at the end.  This book is about what happens in Westeros.  The next one will cover what happens everywhere else. <br /> <br />I am happy with this book.  I am mostly intrigued with the Martell family and want to know what's going to happen with them.  I love how GRRM is turning Cersei into one of the men she despises the most.  Then, of course, are all the questions.  Um...Brienne?  What's Jaime going to do now?  What's going to happen to Cersei?  However, while I am curious, I am not concerned.  I think GRRM has everything under control.
B0000029AP|5.0|For years I was always satisfied with just Aerosmith's Greatest Hits from 1981 (the re-issue is even better!). But then I decided to buy some of their albums from the 70s so I got Get Your Wings, Toys In The Attic, and Rocks. All three are great but this album is my favorite. EVERY SONG IS GOOD! The big hits were of course Sweet Emotion and Walk This Way, but this is one of those albums that you can listen to all the way through over and over again. I'm not going to bother talking about each song. You'll just have to get this classic if you don't have it already. As I write this review, Toys is only $7.97, what a bargain! I was happy to see Aerosmith bounce back in the 80s but their music started to become too formula. Aerosmith of the 70s rules!
0553802534|3.0|Although I eagerly gobble up the books I can find by Lisa Gardner and enjoy them, this book disappointed me. The pacing and dialogue were fast and well-done, but somehow the characterizations left me completely cold. There wasn't a single character that elicited any extended sympathy, even Catherine. Stories have to draw some sympathy or empathy from the readers to at least one character for a real buy-in of the tale, but this book failed. I believe it was written to draw the reader into more than one character and make the reader care about him/her, but somehow that didn't happen. The protagonists were detached and often off-putting, and this decreased my interest and enjoyment.
B000001ELL|4.0|Dynasty came out in 1979 and featured one of Kiss' biggest hits, the disco influenced I Was Made For Lovin You. Some fans cried sell-out and their popularity began to wane. Having released the now somewhat cheesey movie Kiss Meets The Phantom Of The Park the year before did not help matters. But looking back over 25 years I still think this is a good album. My favorite songs are Charisma (classic Gene and a great solo!), X-ray Eyes (good verse and chorus), Magic Touch (great vocals from Paul), and Save Your Love (good lyrics/vocals). The cover of the Stone's 2000 Man was a good addition to the album. There is not really any song on the album that I dislike but I think Dirty Livin and Hard Times are two of the weaker tracks. I seem to recall reading that Anton Fig (David Letterman) played most or all of drums on Dynasty (as well as Ace's solo album) which is a shame because Peter's drumming was a part of many classic Kiss songs. Unfortunately a string of good Kiss albums would come to an end with Dynasty as the original line-up would officially break up after the so-so Unmasked.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|Everytime a new System of a Down album comes out, it blows me away. It's funny, considering the first time I ever heard them (the song Suite Pee in particular) I thought they were garbage. But that was 1999. Now it's 2005, and Hypnotize is just amazing. I'm not too fond of the title track, but songs like Dreaming, U-FIG, and my favorite - Vicinity of Obscenity are winners. The chorus of the last mentioned song is somewhat of a motown-sounding piece. And the way Soldier Side clinched it together with Mezmerize knocked me out. You need to buy the double album and check it out. There are no words for it.
B000002I99|4.0|In 1975 Alice sacked the rest of the band and went solo with Welcome To My Nightmare. This was a pretty bold move considering that the original band helped write many of Alice Cooper's classic songs. While this album did not chart as high as 1973's Billion Dollar Babies (#1) it did contain one of Alice's biggest hits, a ballad called Only Woman Bleed. WTMN does not have my all-time favorite AC songs but it's one of the few albums that I really enjoy from beginning to end. My favorite songs are Devils Food (with a classic narration by Vincent Price!), The Black Widow (covered well by Bruce Dickinson), Cold Ethyl (classic lyrics), Years Ago (haunting), and Steven. I also recommend The Best Of Alice Cooper which packs 22 songs on one cd!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Television is hardly the ideal format for an epic story with so many characters, exotic settings, and a serious attempt to update the Audie Murphy story for an audience that is so familiar with science fiction that the bionic surprises in the final episode have been expected all along by everyone whose childhood included dreams of taking the hood off Darth Vader.<br /><br />Having all the episodes available on a 3-disc DVD set with a few extra features at the end allows those who are used to inhabiting books to devote every available moment to deciphering how well the writers of the `Firefly' series were able to build stories based on transport jobs capable of earning enough to buy fuel to keep hopping from planet to planet.  The writer responsible for the `Shindig' episode in the special features appears to be a woman.  Populating far-off worlds is risky business, but an upper crust manages to promote as much glorification of the culture of the old west as circumstances allow.<br /><br />Torture is a topic which is foreshadowed early with a wife's nephew hanging upside-down as a result of his failures.  A clean get-away at the end of the early episode does not preclude the capture of members of Serenity's crew much later in the series.  The pleasure to be derived from finally having the opportunity to torture someone who has been duly warned but still did something deserving electrical voltages that barely avoid killing familiar characters is skillfully drawn out in shocking sequences of questions, comments, and wild spasms with flying sparks.  This might be a suitable introduction to some Japanese philosophy for some people who are bound to associate limit situations with the idea of meeting the man.<br /><br />What makes `Firefly' so modern is the ineptness of the alliance, which is so concerned with security that anyone who has talked to a certain doctor, or his little sister, are likely to be wiped out before they have the opportunity to communicate with anyone else.  Living under an administration which seems truly astounded whenever it encounters assertions which counter its basic beliefs, my favorite line in the entire series must be the doctor saying, \\"This must be what going crazy feels like.\\"anyone else.

B000002KGT|4.0|I have never been a huge fan of Fleetwood Mac but a great album deserves to be praised. I own this album and their Greatest Hits on cd. When I put my favorite FM songs on my i-pod, what do ya know, the majority of them came from Rumours. This album was released in 1977 and has sold over 18 million copies to date in America alone. The songwriting is excellent and there is a lot of variety, certainly helped by the fact that most of the members can sing and write songs. The production and instrumentation are also very good. Other than the hits, and there were many, I really like Oh Daddy, and Gold Dust Woman. But The Chain is still my favorite track on the whole album. I think the 70s was simply the best decade for music. Bands (and record companies!) were not afraid to experiment. I also recommend the DVD Classic Albums - Fleetwood Mac - Rumours (1977). Rumours: Four and a half stars!
6305897786|4.0|This film is a great introduction to The Club Dumas by Arturo P&eacute;rez-Reverte.  What's missing in the film is almost deducible from the title of the book.  An entire subplot is removed to simplify the film.  This was probably Polanski's only and best decision.  The literary sub-plot had to go, but unfortunately, this film does suffer from the lack of credibility that subplot brought to the overall structure of the work.  In the movie, we are asked to believe that Depp is a rare-book vulture/genius while he smokes all over a work that is worth millions.  At times there are references to things left out of the movie (the Raymond Chandler reference toward the beginning) and other odd anachronistic moments, but we are too often distracted by Polanski's gimmicks for them to be believable.  And, finally, the Devil.  Hmm, well, even the book didn't pull that off well.<br /><br />For all its flaws, this is a good film.  Almost everyone who enjoys it likes the same things - the books, the attitudes, the intrigue.  There is virtually no horror and the devil stuff comes off a bit lack-luster, like Polanski returning to the tried and tested well of \\"Rosemary's Baby\\".
B000BGH22W|5.0|We start off with \\"The Story Continues\\", which happens to be my favorite cue from the score.  Yeah, it's only a minute-and-a-half long, but it sets the mood quite early, and perfectly, and it let me know right away that Doyle's efforts weren't going to be synonymous with bust.  The twist that Doyle puts on John Williams' trademark theme gives me the shivers: sweepingly tragic - pretty much, gangsta.  \\"Quidditch World Cup\\" is another nice track, with cues for the Irish and Bulgarian teams.  The \\"Rita Skeeter\\" cue is just as flamboyant and charismatic as she is... \\"Golden Egg\\" is the most exciting, energetic - yet not bombastic, cue on the score.  We are then treated to a triplet of waltzy cues in \\"Neville's Waltz\\", \\"Harry in Winter\\", and \\"Potter Waltz\\", followed by the seductive \\"Underwater Secrets\\".      I want to jump ahead and say a few words about the standout track, \\"Voldemort\\".  Here, Doyle accomplishes something that I don't think Williams would have been able to - a truly dark, brooding, suspenseful, heartbreaking piece of tragedy.  To his credit, Williams did accomplish this feat in \\"The Immolation Scene\\" featured on this year's \\"Revenge of the Sith\\" score; however, that was not even three minutes long - \\"Voldemort\\" is almost an epic ten minutes in length.  I just think Williams would have fallen into his usual \\"noise\\" and general \\"confusion\\" for a cue like this.  Instead, we are blessed with Doyle's abilities - \\"Voldemort\\" is outright painful for me to listen to, especially the last two minutes or so; a wonderful job.  After \\"Voldermort\\" comes the \\"Death of Cedric\\", which is another moving track, as its name suggests....  In closing, Doyle ends with a couple of beautiful, hopeful tracks in \\"Another Year Ends\\" and \\"Hogwarts' Hymn\\" - the latter which closely rivals John Williams' \\"Reunion of Friends\\" cue from \\"Chamber of Secrets\\".  In closing, although I was one of many who made a weird face when I heard that Doyle would be replacing Williams for the fourth Potter, I am presumably one of the few who gives this man the praise he deserves - top praise.  Still, this doesn't take away from the marvelous groundwork Williams introduced in creating Harry's wondrous world for the first film, nor does it harm the surprising, innovative work Williams gave us for \\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\".       * This was a review of the score portion only.  The appended tracks at the end of the CD are basically vocal fanfare, but I'm not a fan of them.

B00005JOGU|4.0|Bennett Miller's biopic about author Truman Capote and based on the Arthur Clarke biography of the same name. The film focuses on Capote's time spent researching the killing of a family in Kansas at the end of the 50's which would later be the subject of Capote's classic \\"non-fiction\\" novel In Cold Blood, which quickly rocketed the young writer to super-stardom. The film's structure is a bit perplexing; a film could easily be made from a number of segments in Capote's fascinating life and this version chooses to elaborate on the 10 years he spent on this particular work, which is essentially the middle of his life. This period certainly yields a lot of interesting material, yet I feel that those who have not read Clarke's biography may feel a little lost as there is very little context included. The most awesome facet of the film is Phillip Seymour Hoffman's incredible impersonation of Capote; he managed to capture all of the complexity and vulnerability of Capote's character, and the film is very interesting in revealing how the young writer's efforts on this project may have ultimately destroyed him.<br /><br />The film is very engaging and often disturbing. However, a few inaccuracies are worth mentioning. The film seems to depict Capote as being uncaring and disinterested in Dick, the less intelligent of the two killers, yet the biography makes it clear that Capote devoted a great deal of attention to both killers as they awaited execution, despite his clear affection for Perry. Also, the film indicates that In Cold Blood's reception was universal acclaim; quite the contrary, many mainstream reviewers and writers such as Norman Mailer denied the book's literary merits. And thirdly, the title card at the end of the film states that In Cold Blood made Truman Capote the most famous writer in America (which is disputable), and that he never finished another book, which is blatantly false. Capote published Music for Chameleons in 1980, a collection of short stories clearly conceived as a complete book. Despite these problems, Capote is a very compelling film, and Hoffman's performance is one of his best yet.s clearly conceived as a complete book. Despite these problems, Capote is a very compelling film, and Hoffman's performance is one of his best yet.
0743455967|5.0|I've always been disappointed with the way Stephen King's novels end.  But that's never kept me from reading them.  They read so easy that the story is worth whatever terrible thing is going to happen at the end.  King has a voice that's completely and fluidly us.  You can get lost in it.<br /><br />And that's what he's brought to his effort, On Writing.<br /><br />If you are interested in writing and you enjoy King, then you need to read this book.<br /><br />King talks about growing up and becoming a writer, about the early home brew newsletter with his brother, the support of his mother.  He writes about his college days, his wife's writing, about getting his first novel published.  It is all there.<br /><br />Then he goes into what he believes are the mechanics - about what it takes to write.  The Toolbox section goes over the different things you'll need: vocabulary, grammar, words, sentences, and paragraphs.  Don't worry.  It's an easy read, and gives a revealing look into what a working writer thinks is important.<br /><br />In the heart of the book, the section On Writing, King says \\"Now comes the big question: What are you going to write about?  And the equially big answer: Anything you damn well want.  Anything at all ... as long as you tell the truth.\\"<br /><br />That's the biggest lesson I took away from this.<br /><br />But there's more.  You can tell it from his writing.  And before he gets to the end, King lets the cat out of the bag when he is writing about beginning again after a debilitating accident:  \\"  ... I feel that buzz of happiness, that sense of having found the right words and put them in a line.  It's like lifting off in an airplane:  you're on the ground, on the ground, on the ground ... and then you're up, riding on a magical cushion of air and prince of all you survey.  That makes me happy because it's what I was made to do.\\"
0446577383|5.0|David Baldacci is in my regular \\"mental floss\\" book rotation - whenever one of his books comes out it immediately ends up in the \\"read when you need a break from serious stuff\\" pile.  His latest - The Camel Club - didn't disappoint me.  It started off slower than most Baldacci books and it took me 100 pages to get completely sucked in.  When I finished, I realized that he needed more time to set up all the characters in this one, as he had a large number of interconnected plots.  My evening was sacrificed to the reading gods as I downed 300 pages of riveting storytelling.  Spies, conspiracies, government corruption, secret societies, old CIA training facilities, presidential kidnapping, secret service heroics, many bad guys (some Americans), a bunch of scary dudes running the country including a few that thought nuclear war was a solution, computer hacks, meglomanics, near miss surveillance incidents, characters with major pasts coming back to haunt them, OCD, a little romance, and excellent gunplay made for a good evening.
B0009ICXX0|5.0|Comparisons between \\"Stage Beauty\\" and \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" are inevitable, but this 2004 film does not suffer much by the contrast to that Oscar winner for Best Picture. Both films deal with the conventions of the English stage that dictated the roles of women be played by men and while both have a woman who wants to play a woman's role, this one has a man who wants to play only women's roles. Both films conclude with a live performance in which the focal character ends up playing the opposite of their original roles. Both films are intricately involved with the Shakespeare plays being performed to such an extent that it goes beyond life imitating art. But whereas \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" was about writing and love, \\"Stage Beauty\\" is about acting and love, and I think it is ultimately more about its primary artistic focus than about romance.<br /><br />When it comes to performing the classical plays of Shakespeare or the tragedies of the ancient Greeks, I believe in realistic (nee naturalistic) acting rather than following the acting conventions of those periods in contemporary performances. I enjoy those conventions, but I also think that if you can break the poetic constraints of the dialogue you can make those texts come alive for contemporary audiences. So one of the reasons \\"Stage Beauty\\" resonates so strong for me is that it not only endorses but also celebrates the idea that such realism can have much more of a profound impact on an audience that those historically accurate sytlistic conventions.<br /><br />Half the inspiration for the original play \\"Compleat Female Stage Beauty\\" was when playwright Jeffrey Hatcher came across an entry in the diary of Samuel Pepys (Hugh Bonneville) that the actor Ned Kynaston was the most beautiful woman in the house when he was portraying one upon the stage. The other half was the decision of Charles II (Rupert Everett) to not only revoke the prohibition of women acting on stage, but to declare instead that henceforth only women would play female roles on the English stage. Thus we have the story of the most famous female impersonator of his day suddenly thrust into a world where he is no longer allowed to do what he does best.<br /><br />Billy Crudup plays Kynaston and his success as a woman on stage hinges in part on the acting conventions of the time. He has studied the affected mannerisms demanded of the women characters on stage and if you would fault Kynaston's portrayal as Desdemona you can level the same charges against the Othello being played by Betterton (Tom Wilkinson). This is simply what acting was during the Stuart Restoration. Pointedly, a pair of women with aspirations towards acting on the stage doom Kynaston's career, one being his dresser, Maria (Claire Danes), who has memorized each inflection and gesture of his Desdemona and performed it in a tavern (which is technically not a theater). The other is Nell Gwynn (Zoe Tapper), the king's mistress, who has more than the king's ear when it comes to persuading him to change the way things are in the theaters of London.<br /><br />There is, as you would suspect, some sexual tension between Maria and Kynaston, although it is more ardent on her part for most of the story. She loves him, but he loves acting. His argument against women playing women is that there is no \\"trick\\" to it. I was going to say that he means no skill to such performances, but he really does mean trick. Kyanston has studied his craft and literally suffered as his training stripped him of every aspect of acting masculine. He has the trick of creating the illusion of a perfect woman (for example, the five positions of feminine subjugation), without the skill of acting the part, and he is offended by the very idea that being born a woman would give Maria or any other woman any advantage in doing so. It is only when Maria and Kynaston discuss the tricks of being a woman versus being a man, after his life has been taken away from him, that he not only seesher as a woman but begins to see himself as a man. For her the key is her admission that she has never been able to do his Desdemona, not because it is mimicry, but because she disagrees vehemently with his premise that the character would not fight back when Othello murders her in her bed chamber.<br /><br />This all sets up the grand finale and for me the last act of \\"Stage Beauty\\" when we get to the rehearsal and performance of the play is totally captivating. What we see is no less than the birth of naturalistic acting, which is exactly why I was so absorbed and why I know that those who have acted or directed actors will respond to those scenes and this movie in different ways from those whose vantage point has always been as members of the audience. Danes shows flashes of brilliance which we have not seen from her since her death scene in \\"Little Women.\\" But Crudup gets special mention here, not only because his role is the pivotal one in the story and because he gets to play both Desdemona and Othello, but because his character is put through the wringer and has to evince two different styles of acting.t only sees her as a woman but begins to see himself as a man.

0553801503|4.0|Whew, this is a tough book to review simply because it doesn't follow on the expectations of the readers after A STORM OF SWORDS.     Now some people are already saying that the book is horrible and a great letdown and others go to the other extreme and hold faithfully that it's just as good as the previous books.    I don't feel either take is fair or accurate.    To be fair, yes, the book doesn't move like the previous books, especially a STORM OF SWORDS.  There are simply not the same level of WHAM BAM big moments nor shocking realizations (i.e. who killed Jon Arryn?).  Additionally, some of the favorite characters of readers, like Jon, Dany and Tyrion, are not in this novel.  Lastly, there are two new main POVs so we need to adjust to those.  BTW, since other readers are spoiling the mystery POVs, did most of you notice that Brienne is apparently a descendant of Dunk from THE HEDGE KNIGHT.  Pretty kewl. :)    Getting back to the debate, remember that:    (1) This is only half of a mega-sized book.  GRRM is putting out only half of it and the other half is going to be in the next book.  So, in essence, for those complaining he's taking too long, this is like four books as the average novel is 400 pages.  Additionally, remember the guy has been writing for something like 30 + years and he's finally getting national acclaim. He has been asked to write scripts to some of his old novels, there's a game based on his series that he looked over, he's also gone over the HEDGE KNIGHT comic strip, he's written two novelettes on the hedge knight, hes been asked to attend dozens upon dozens of readings at various book/convention events (and, most recently, the prestigious one in D.C. where he was asked to give a long speech), he tends to answer the emails he gets from everyone which is in the thousands, he taught at the Odyssey program for about six weeks back east, etc.  Most of these in the last two years.    So, bully for him as he's getting more acknowledgements but keepin mind the guy has said he can't write except back in New Mexico.  Things are going to go slower; and    (2) While several of the POVs don't have resolutions, also keep in mind that they may show up in the next book with all those WHAM BAM moments everyone is seeking.  Additionally, it probably isn't fair to view this as a stand alone simply because book four and five are like one book.  The reason he broke it up, per his webpage at [...], is that his publishers demanded he get it out.  For all we know, book four may be the midpoint of the story and book five is going to have a lot of climaxes.    AFFC is really a come down from several climaxes.  As the dust settles, lots of information is shared.  There's a great deal of focus on characters.  Lots and lots of characters, even if fleeting.  As a result, not as much seems to happen.  To some, this might be seen as meanderings, and, well, yes, some of it probably is. lol  For those who want to know more about the world, here's your chance.  Just don't expect it to be like ASOS.    I remember several complaints by earlier reviewers of previous books that there wasn't enough about context and almost nothing about the religion of the times.  People complained that one would think the religion would have a greater impact and political power base than shown in the last three books.  Well, you get it in this book.  Big time.    Another thing to keep in mind: there are probably about 35-50% more character POVs simply because there are several small focuses on various characters all over the globe.  We get a lot of focus on Dorne and the Iron Isles as well as King's Landing. There are sprinklings in other areas, too, like Oldtown and where Brienne travels (i.e. don't want to spoil it so I won't say where).    As result, these characters slows the story down from having big moments because there's more to tell.    While I get this is probably the least popular book of the four, assuming we were to take a tally, I still feelGRRM is the best living fantasy author out there if you want tales that don't overuse archetypes and have complex characters and plots.  I challenge anyone to email me to suggest a better author.    On that note, for people who haven't read the previous books, here's why GRRM is a superb writer from my previous review on ASOS:    First off, I'm a heavy duty fan of GRRM. I've read over a 100 different fantasy authors in my time (started at 12; I'm now 32). Took about 5 years off from the genre b/c I felt it was all getting too formulaic and cliched. Typical archetype character who turns out to be the missing heir or boy wonder who saves the world against the Dark Lord.  So, when I came back to fantasy at the end of 1999, I read the usual: Goodkind, Jordan, etc. and then someone told me about GRRM and man, that was the kicker!    Here are the reasons to choose GRRM. I've also listed the reasons not to choose him to make it fair b/c I know their are certain personalities who won't like this series:    WHY TO READ GRRM    (1) YOU ARE TIRED OF FORMULAIC FANTASY: good lad beats the dark lord against impossible odds; boy is the epitome of good; he and all his friends never die even though they go through great dangers . . . the good and noble king; the beautiful princess who falls in love with the commoner boy even though their stations are drastically different . . . the dark lord is very evil and almost one sided at times . . . you get the idea. After reading this over and over, it gets old.    (2) YOU ARE TIRED OF ALL THE HEROES STAYING ALIVE EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE UNDER CONSTANT DANGER: this gets even worse where the author kills a main hero off but that person comes back later in the story. Or, a hero does die but magic brings him back.    This sometimes carries to minor characters where even they may not die, but most fantasy authors like to kill them off to show that some risked the adventure and perished.    (3) YOU ARE A MEDIEVAL HISTORY BUFF: this story was influenced by the WARS OF THE ROSES and THE HUNDRED YEARS WAR.    (4) YOU LOVE SERIOUS INTRIGUE WITHOUT STUPID OPPONENTS: lots of layering; lots of intrigue; lots of clever players in the game of thrones. Unlike other fantasy novels, one side, usually the villain, is stupid or not too bright.    (5) YOU ARE INTERESTED IN BIASED OPINIONS AND DIFFERENT TRUTHS: GRRM has set this up where each chapter has the title of one character and the whole chapter is through their viewpoint. Interesting tidbit is that you get their perception of events or truths. But, if you pay attention, someone else will mention a different angle of truth in the story that we rarely see in other novels. Lastly and most importantly, GRRM doesn't try to tell us which person is right in their perception. He purposelly leaves it vague so that we are kept guessing.    (6) LEGENDS: some of the most interesting characters are those who are long gone or dead. We never get the entire story but only bits and pieces; something that other fantasy authors could learn from to heighten suspense. Additionally, b/c the points of views are not congruent, we sometimes get different opinions.    (7) WORDPLAY: if you're big on metaphors and description, GRRM is your guy. Almost flawless flow.    (8) LOTS OF CONFLICT: all types, too; not just fighting but between characters through threats and intrigue.    (9) MULTILAYERED PLOTTING; SUB PLOTS GALORE: each character has their own separate storyline; especially as the story continues and everyone gets scattered. This is one of the reasons why each novel is between 700-900 pages.    (10) SUPERLATIVE VARIED CHARACTERS: not the typical archetypes that we are used to in most fantasy; some are gritty; few are totally evil or good; GRRM does a great job of changing our opinions of characters as the series progress. This is especially true of Jaime in book three.    (11) REALISTIC MEDIEVAL DIALOGUE: not to the point that we can't understand it but well done.    (12) HEAPS OF SYMOBLISM AND PROPHECY: if you're big on that.    (13) EXCELLENT MYSTERIES: very hard to figure out the culprits; GRRM must have read a lot of mystery novels.    (14) RICHLY TEXTURED FEMALE CHARACTERS: best male author on female characters I have read; realistic on how women think, too.    (15) LOW MAGIC WORLD: magic is low key; not over the top so heroes can't get out of jams with it.    REASON TO NOT READ GRRM    (1) YOU LIKE YOUR MAIN CHARACTERS: GRRM does a good job of creating more likeable characters after a few die. But, if that isn't your style, you shouldn't be reading it. He kills off several, not just one, so be warned.    (2) DO NOT CARE FOR GRITTY GRAY CHARACTERS: if you like more white and gray characters, this may unsettle you. I suggest Feist or Goodkind or Dragonlance if you want a more straight forward story with strong archetypes.    (3) MULTIPLE POINTS OF VIEWS TURN YOU OFF: if you prefer that the POVS only go to a few characters, this might be confusing for you.    (4) SWEARING, SEX: there's a lot of it in this book just as there is in real life. If you have delicate ears, this book may upset you.    (5) YOU DEMAND CLOSURE AT THE END OF EVERY BOOK: this isn't the case for all stories in the series. Some are still going on; some have been resolved; others have been created and are moving on.    (6) IF YOU WANT A TARGET OR SOMEONE TO BLAME: this can be done to some extent but not as much. This is b/c he doesn't try to make anyone necessarily good or evil.    (7) ARCHETYPES: some readers like archetypal characters because it's comfortable; we like the good young hero (sort of like Pug in Feist's THE RIFTWAR SAGA); it's familiar and we sometimes like to pretend we're this upcoming, great hero. You wont' get much of this in GRRM with the exception of one or two characters. There really aren't any super heroes compared to all the other characters as it's more grittier and no one is shooting fireballs every milisecond or carrying around some super powerfulsword.    (8) LENGTH: you don't want to get into a long fantasy epic series. In that case, look for shorters works as this is biiig.    (9) PATRIARCHY: men are most of the main characters with lots of power (one female exception). While this is realistic of the medieval era, some readers may not prefer this if they want more girl power, so to speak.    By the way, if you don't want to commit to a big book until you know the author better, check out his short story, THE HEDGE KNIGHT, in LEGENDS.

B00005JNJV|5.0|First off, I really liked the BATMAN in the 80s with Michael Keaton.  That said, this take on Batman is just better. <br /> <br />Why? <br /> <br />Well, yes, they've got CGI and a better budget to help them out and the cast is arguably more known.  But the big thing is that it's true to the actual comic books.  For instance, unlike the older BATMAN, the Joker didn't kill Bruce Wayne's parents.   <br /> <br />Also consider that big name actors chose small roles to be in this . . . most notably Morgan Freeman. <br /> <br />Action scenes are purposefully fast to make it more realistic.  <br /> <br />Character of Batman is far well-defined than in any other Batman movie.  Several payoff dialogues add closure to the tale (i.e. with Katie Holmes, the homeless dude and Rutger Hauer). <br /> <br />Enjoy!

B000068OCS|5.0|I just ordered the duo-set, because this is a movie I can't walk away from.  Stunning in scope and concept, moving in a humanitarian way, it punches you a good one, and makes you think.  An earlier reviewer noted that he really didn't like it, especially because of the drawn-out footage of the destruction of the Challenger.  To anyone who read that review, be aware that this movie came out in 1982/3, and we didn't lose the Challenger until 1986.  However, the impact of the destruction is very defined, even if it was only a rocket attempting to place a satellite... <br /> <br />You really need to watch this in one sitting - this isn't football, there are no time-outs...
B0000025LS|2.0|A pop recording with decent guitar solos but average singing and average songwriting.    The best songs are the 3 instrumentals.    Listen before you buy.    By the way, why does Amazon include a 'NO' in 'was this review helpful to you?'. People are only human and don't like opinions that differ from themselves. With some who are less mature, this the 'NO' makes it too easy express such displeasure.     Are they trying to discourage negative reviews, hence not purchase the CD. Such reviews only help a person in not being dissatisfied a product that received positive reviews
1573225517|5.0|Rob Fleming, the \\"hero\\" of HIGH FIDELITY runs Championship Vinyl, a used record shop on a sidestreet in London (and I mean records...though there is much talk of compilation tapes and some evidence of CDs in this 1995 novel as well.) His girlfriend Laura has just walked out on him, prompting him to list his top five heartbreaks of all time. Compiliing lists of \\"top fives\\" (of anything, though mostly music-related things) is a very serious pastime for Rob and his equally adrift coworkers, both of whom are, believe it or not, worse at relationships with women than Rob. What follows is vintage Hornby--fast-pased storytelling, clever dialog (with women often outshining the men), and a real honest sense of the current zeitgeist for thirty-somethings. I only got about 40% of the musical references (the ones that go back to my era and tastes--Dusty Springfield, Aretha Franklin, the Beatles), but Hornby doesn't really include such references to tax the reader's memory, but rather to make statements about the characters who care so much about slight differences in taste. The abundant humor, however, doesn't deflect from the serious scrutiny Hornby lays to bear on the Rob & Laura's (Is this an ironic Dick Van Dyke Show reference?) relationship. In the end, Rob makes a compiliation tape for Laura, one that's \\"full of stuff she's heard of, and full of stuff she'd play.\\" At last he is seeing her the way she is, not the way he thinks she should be. You can't help thinking, if you're at all romantic (or at least somewhat optimistic), that Rob and Laura just might make it. A fun read!
B000244FDW|5.0|After just seeing the newest adaptation of Pride and Prejudice by Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFaydyen, I must say that this 1980 version of Pride and Prejudice still remain my favorite adaptation. It is mostly because of the wonderful performance by Elizabeth Garvie as Elizabeth Bennet. She is exactly how I pictured what Elizabeth Bennet would look and act like when I read the book many years before I first saw this version last year. Although I think the 1995 A&E version is also wonderfully adapted, when I feel the desire to rewatch the P&P, this 1980 version is the one I choose to watch because it's not too long and it has the best Elizabeth Bennet of all.

B00097A5HW|5.0|Shakiras music style in this CD is not much like her other stuff. This is the kind of music that grows on me (Unlike her other stuff, which the more I listen to her other stuff, it does not get better nor worse, just stays great). There is soo much depth into her songs in this CD, once I noticed all that, I realized it was some of ther best work. <br /> <br />I say that this CD is distinquishable to her other CDs the same way many of her songs are distinquishable vs each other.
B000BBOUU4|5.0|Now, I'm probably sounding a little lame by the title of my review, but, there's really no other way to put this movie than that.  I'm a big fan of Burton's work, and even bigger fan of a Burton/Depp collaboration.  I believe this is their fourth film collaboration.  Now, the movie itself is imperssive and imaginative. Johnny Depp is fabulous as Willy Wonka.  All the kid actors also did a great job at their roles.  Most people won't agree with me, but I enjoyed it a lot more than the original, which I didn't really care for. <br /> <br />Most of you know the story, but here it is anyway: <br /> <br />A young boy Charlie, lives in a small run-down house with his poor family.  He lives near by the legendary Wonka Chocolate Factory.  One day, his grandpa tells him the story why Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp)closed down his factory to public workers and machines took over the job.  Shortly after hearing this, Willy Wonka announces he will be giving 5 kids a tour of his factory, and he has hidden a Golden Ticket in five candy bars.  But poor Charlie only gets one bar a year, and that bar, sadly, does not contain one of the prized Golden Tickets.  But when Charlie finds a twenty dollar bill in the snow, he buys a Fudge Mallow Delight bar, and to his surprise, finds a Golden Ticket! <br />And with that, Charlie soon finds himself standing by the front of the factory with five other lucky kids, but will they win the one big prize Willy Wonka has promised the best kid? <br /> <br />Now, this movie is very funny, very visual and very VERY weird, but non the less, the 2 Disk Special Edition is truly and treat to have and deserves a spot on any movie collectors shelf.

B000092ZYX|2.0|Okay so I bought this album because people that I thought had good musical taste liked it.  Unfortunately, as much as I tried to \\"appreciate\\" it or I guess meditate admist the droning voice and lyrics that don't go anywhere or do anything, the album is simply boring. They are doing a nice job going against the system or whatever, and in the process they are making some hypnotic and down right revolutionary garbage.
B000002UJQ|5.0|After all these years, I FINALLY got around to OK Computer. Radiohead never seemed like my thing, but the acclaim for this cd is so overwhelming, that I had to investigate. Overall, I like the cd more than I expected after one listen. The robotic theme kind of put me off at first, but I liked it. As with most good cds, every few listens resulted in my liking more and more of what I heard. My favorite songs are: Paranoid Android, No Surprises, Subterranean Homesick Alien and Karma Police, in that order. Paranoid Android seamlessly blends two totally different types of music together and amazes me every time I listen to it. No suprises is a simple lullaby-like song that is beautiful. I'm very glad I finally bought this disc and I now see what all the hype was about. I especially enjoy this music on rainy days or in the evening before the sun sets. The whole disc flows nicely and it causes me to be reflective. If you're an open minded listener, I highly recommend this cd.
0671027344|5.0|Last week Arizona's School Superintendent made headlines, claiming that this book, and citing in particular its scene of forced oral sex and implied rape -- in which the narrator observes but does nothing to stop it -- is not suitable for middle school or high school libraries or their readers.  He recommended copies be pulled from the shelves.  This was enough recommendation for me to pick up a copy at the library.  And you know what?  That scene is disturbing.  It's meant to be, and it raises many questions about the narrator, a 15-year-old high school freshman boy, and why he chooses to be life's wallflower instead of a full participant. <br /> <br />I doubt Tom Horne has read the complete book, but if he had, he would have discovered that the narrator's inaction is the result of past trauma, that he effectively distances the pain hiding in plain sight.  Through his friendship with two step-sibling seniors, and his English teacher who challenges him with an individualized great books curriculum, he starts coming out of his shell. <br /> <br />This is one powerful emotional book.
B00004XONN|5.0|First off, I admire Radiohead for having the guts to follow its vision of this album. Following OK Computer, it would've been really easy to offer more of the same and sell millions and millions of albums, but they didn't. That said, this was my second Radiohead purchase (following OK Computer) and it is very unusual, to say the least. I have to be in a certain state of mind to maximally enjoy this music, as it goes well with certain moods and not as well with others, but it's still a great cd and I wouldn't give it up. Very creative and challenging.
1400032717|5.0|After months of reading a few pages here and there, I finally sat down and read the whole thing from start to finish on one Saturday afternoon; with the right atmosphere, this book is a fast, fascinating read which I thoroughly enjoyed.<br /><br />The protagonist, Christopher, is an autistic kid that's trying to solve a dog murder mystery. In the process, he invites us into his mind and shows us how he thinks and why he thinks the way he does. He teaches us a lot of things about logic, humor and empathy. He'll definitely make you rethink the way you look at things and analyze them. He'll also change the perception you have of autism and kids afflicted, of blessed, with it.<br /><br />This is an absolute delight of a read that will rev up your brain and warm up your soul. This would make a great gift to someone you love or to yourself. Get it!
B00080ZG10|4.0|I say good movie to own because it is so long and is full of many interesting minor characters (for example the incredible scene where Jude Law shows up as Errol Flynn).  At your first sitting you may lose track of all the characters that move in and out of the life of Howard Hughes.  With the amazing sets and performances the movie holds up to repeated viewings.      Like all good biopics the movie doesn't try to tell the full life story of its subject.  It focuses on the time from his first Hollywood movie to the short flight of the Hercules.  During that time period you witness the passion, genius, humor and oncoming sickness of Howard Hughes.  You don't get the full story but you do come away with the sense of the man and that makes the film successful.      I can't finish without mentioning Alan Alda's performance as Hughes' antagonist, Senator Brewster.  Alda looks like he is relishing his role as the unlikable Brewster.  It's a meaty part and he really sinks his teeth into it.  It was good to see him in a great role such as this.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I am just responding to the overwhelming critical underrating of the song \\"Isaac\\". I think that they just don't have taste for Middle-Eastern melodies, and Madonna has succeeded in blending the beautiful \\"Im nin alu\\" perfectly with her thing!
B0000089FS|2.0|I'm a big Elton fan but this just doesn't do it at all for me. Reg really struck back in the early 90's when he left re-hab and cleaned up his life. In 1988 ( the year of this album's release), Elton was battling bullimia, cocaine addiction, and alcoholism. The qualiy of the work really suffers.     Much more so than even on his improved 90's albums, this is full of 80's synthesisers and electronics. There is almost nothing on this album even resembling a real piano sound. The only decent tracks are 1- I Don't Wanna go On With You Like That. Although really limited here by the overproduction, (which you can probably tell I don't care for), it really rocked on the One Night Only DVD, as it was stripped down to a more geniune sound with the live musicians. 2- Heavy Traffic. A bouncy piece co-written by Davey Johnstone, it makes it sound like he was the only sober person working on this album. Mona Lisa's and Mad Hatters Part II is awful and Japanese Hands is worse. Some of his 80's songs such as Cold as Christmas and Slow Rivers could have been really good if the the production was scaled back, but most of these tracks are beyond hope.    Sorry Elton. I love your music, but this isn'nt who you are. Its hard to strike back when you have eating disorders and drug addictions. Luckily, the greatest British soloist of his generation rebounded as a mature and prolific musican- but this album came before then.    Don't bother with it!!
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is a great movie!  I mean, it's romantic, the acting is great, and...it's just perfect!  If you haven't seen this  movie, then  you'd better get to the theaters to see it.  <br />The soundtrack is great too.  The piano is beautiful and when you listen to it, you get just as excited as you were when you were watching the film!  Even though I bought it at Tower for $19.00, which is a little expensive, it was definetely worth it!  I only bought it yesterday and I've already listened to it two times through.  Buy it now! <br /> <br />\\"You have bewitched me body and soul\\"
0064407667|4.0|The Bad Beginning is the first book of the series of unfortunate events by Lemony Snickets. The Bad Beginning is about three young children who has just found out about a terrible accident that would change their lives forever. This first book takes you into their first adventure, where the beginning of their changed lives begins. The Bad Beginning is a book where you cannot judge how the story goes, however this book is different from many other books which is rather fascinating. I highly recommend this book for the readers who like adventure stories. The Bad Beginning is a good book, once you begin to read you cannot put the book down.  <br />

B0002F6BRE|4.0|Every holiday season reminds us how few good holiday films there actually are. For every genuine Yuletide classic like A CHRISTMAS CAROL (1951), there's a sleigh-full of junk along the lines of SANTAS CLAUS: THE MOVIE and ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS. ELF is that rare seasonal movie that's both entertaining and funny-in fact, it's the funniest holiday film since A CHRISTMAS STORY (1983; still the funniest Christmas film ever made), which is no small accomplishment.  <br /> <br />In a role tailor-made for his trademark man-child persona, Will Ferrell stars as Buddy, a normal-sized 30-year-old raised as an elf at the North Pole, who decides to journey to New York to meet his birth father (James Caan). Jon Favreau (SWINGERS, MADE) deftly handles the directorial chores, as he showcases Ferrell's gift for broad physical humor. This is also one of the few modern comedies that actually makes good use of its powerhouse supporting cast (Zooey Deschanel, Mary Steenburgen, Ed Asner, Bob Newhart, Faizon Love, Peter Dinklage, Amy Sedaris, Andy Richter), rather than wasting them in pointless cameos. ELF is a real holiday treat.        <br />
0393035158|5.0|First off, permit me to say that I have never before felt compelled to write an online review of any kind.  However, \\"The End of Faith\\" obviously changed that. <br /> <br />It makes such clear, persuasive arguments about the absurdity of faith in gods-and perhaps even more importantly reveals the detrimental effects of such antiquated belief systems-that if everyone read it, this book might actually make a difference in the world. <br /> <br />Harris is obviously well-armed and not afraid to fire the necessary ammunition to blow big, gaping holes in the flimsy fortress of believers.  And he does this with intelligent, engaging, witty, and occasionally highly-comic prose. <br /> <br />It's about time someone really started taking to task even the moderate religious believers (more guilty than you might think in all this) for their indefensible part in perpetrating an outmoded way of viewing the world. <br /> <br />Considering all the implications of people's continued belief in gods and religion-especially living in today's nuclear-armed world as Harris points out-disabusing people of their ultimately harmful beliefs is about as important a thing as anyone can do for the future of humanity.
B000006TRV|5.0|A Great Album from the Greatest Band of this or any generation.  Pink Floyd's epic double disc masterpiece is a dark collection of brilliance.  The only problem I do encounter with this album is that it is often dubbed Roger Waters' masterpiece. Hear me out, I'm not trying to take anything away from the legend that is Waters, but this album is in my opinion David Gilmour's best work.  I find it frustrating at times that more of the credit goes towards Waters.  This rant is probably better suited on a Floyd message board, but I have to say that Gilmour's minor scales and incredible riffs made this album the ultimate masterpiece that it is.  Gilmour is a god among men and I just don't like seeing credit taken away from a place it is surely due.  This album is the epitamy of classic rock, and the perfect example of the possibilities of a concept album.  Waters truly was and still is a musical genius.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am not your typical techno-nerd scifi fan. as a kid I liked a good comic book and I have seen all of the Star Wars movies but there are other types of entertainment I prefer to scifi. <br />I went to the Serenity movie to keep my two sons out of my wife's hair.At worst the movie would provide the opportunity for a 2 hour nap. Much to my surprise I enjoyed the movie and later purchased Firefly to watch during my nightly workouts. I will watch just about anything to pass the time on the treadmill. <br />I started the program and found it to be much better than the movie. I started to look forward to the hour on the treadmill, which should tell you just how good the series is. <br />I found the plots and acting to be superb, which in my view is extraordinary for the usual scifi stuff. Morover there was a complete realization of the artistic vision of Joss Whedon andhis co-creators. If you watch the extras, something that I never do, you will see that Mr Whedon knew exactly what he wanted to do and went out and did it. <br />I have never even seen Buffy or heard of Angel but if they are anything like this program I may just have to break down and purchase them---Maybe I will become HIP---let's not rush this. <br />Anyway, go and buy this series, and then tell Fox and or Universal, or whoever owns the rights to put it back on the air. I just have to find out what will happen to all of my new friends who live on Serenity
B000AGTPUA|1.0|I liked the theme of the story.  I hated the production.  Either do true animation in the form of cartoons or claymation or have real actors.  I hated the way this movie was put together.  I do not want to watch computer generated animation in a film.  If I wanted computer generated characters, I would play computer games, thus, this movie was a bust.
B000B8QF00|5.0|Each and every end of year, you can be sure that there will be a heap of Greatest Hits albums from our favourite singers.  This is another of those albums and this is from one amazing singer/songwriter.  She's great.  Her voice is raw and full of emotion and it's nice to hear music that isn't fluffy.  Alanis is so talented and this album totally reflects that.  All of her best songs are here and I recommend this to all her fans and non fans alike, because there's a great chance that non fans will soon become fans after one listen to it.  A nice bonus touch to the cd is the inclusion of lyrics in the linear notes.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|This is the ESSENTIAL Michael Jackson collection you're looking for! What's so great about it is that the occasional as well as die-hard fan will appreciate this collection for different reasons.    Occasional fan view:  Great selections of early (Motown) tracks are on here. The Jackson 5 hits like \\"ABC\\" and \\"I Want You Back\\" are featured and tracks like \\"Ben\\" and \\"Rockin' Robin'\\" that were some of Michael's first solo appearances are highlights. This compilation also features a few hits from the Jacksons career at Epic Records, including the huge hit \\"Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground).\\" The centerpiece of the entire collection is the inclusion of tracks from OFF THE WALL, THRILLER and BAD. Every hit from all three albums are featured here and then some! These hits alone could have made up their own compilation! There is also a very nice selection of tracks from DANGEROUS; including the #1 hit \\"Remember the Time.\\" The classic \\"You Are Not Alone\\" from HISTORY: PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE BOOK 1 is here as well as Michael's most recent hit \\"You Rock My World.\\" Wow, 38 great songs all in one package. This is the best collection of Michael's hits anywhere!      Die Hard fan view:  Outside of the unreleased tracks, overall this package is much better than the 5 Disc Box set ULTIMATE COLLECTION. That collection contains all LP versions of tracks, unless noted. That was unfortunate for fans looking for the edits of \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" and \\"Rock With You\\" which have yet to see the light of day on CD...until the ESSENTIAL collection! Just having both of these rare edits makes this package very special to Michael's fans. On the down side, the tracks from BAD are all LP versions, and the \\"Spoken Intro\\" to \\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\" is STILL missing. (FYI: The only CD I have found the \\"Spoken Intro\\" version on is the Japanese BAD PICTURE DISC CD.) The selections from DANGEROUS are nice, but are only LP versions or remix edits, which can be found on multiple CD singles. I was unimpressed with the track selection representing HISTORY: PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE BOOK 1. The only track that appears from that release is \\"You Are Not Alone.\\" Where in the world is \\"Scream\\"? It is not on here or the ULTIMATE COLLECTION. There has to be a \\"Michael Only\\" version in the archives (no offense to Janet...much love to her!) I'm guessing Sony still wants to sell HISTORY: PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE BOOK 1 so they leave off from this and every other collection one of Michael's biggest hits. As suspected, only \\"You Rock My World\\" represents INVINCIBLE. Perhaps there would have been more hits if more tracks were released from one of Michael's finest work. However, THE ESSENTIAL MICHAEL JACKSON is still a must have for every fan!
B000B9EY2U|4.0|I am a big Depeche Mode fan. Have been since I was 13, now I'm 30. Exciter didn't ring my bell and I listened to PTA a few months before it's official release at Warner Brothers' headquarters here in Mexico City. I was blown away by the way it sounded and the fact Depeche Mode went back to their dark side which I had loved for so much time. Anyway, I wrote a lot of reviews for mags in my country, but wanted to give it some time to write a personal review. Everything good and bad about this album has been said before. If you want to know what it is like, forget the sound of it's first single 'Precious' and focus on the sound of the second one 'A Pain that I'm Used To'. It's true that DM have taken the path of the dance floor once more, but there's a lot of sinister ballads here, specially Dave Gahan's input -I just can't get enough of 'I Want it All' and 'Nothing's Impossible'. 'John the Revelator' is damn strong, though the lyrics sound empty when you compare it to 'Personal Jesus', something you won't resist to do, as both songs have this bluesy feeling to it and sound hard and violent. 'Suffer Well' must be a single, and I bet Mr. Gahan would be happy to have one of his songs remixed by ten thousand DJs and producers, as it often is the case with this band.<br /><br />Make no mistake, Playing the Angel is not Depeche Mode's best, and wil never beat Violator, Music for the Masses or Black Celebration off the throne, but it's a powerful album from a band that has been around for almost 30 years and still sounds impressive. The lyrics are the only weak point of the whole thing. I think Martin Gore is more interested in overcoming his divorce than other topics, and you can really see that from the lyric sheet. Anyway, you must buy this record if you like the band or love electronic pop, you will get something no one else can give you.
B00005NKK8|5.0|As a 21-year old I have always loved oldies and classic rock, which  is why I've owned this album for more than 5 years now. I listen to all of it as much as I did the first day I got it. This soundtrack has something for everyone- if you like the Supremes, you're set. If you're more of a CCR fan, you're good to go there as well. If The Beach Boys is more your speed, then you're made. The double-CD set has all the songs from the movie and puts you right at the scene it played in and brings you back to your younger days. The mix of folk, rock and pop music dating from the 1950 to the late 70s and early 80s has just the right combination of oldies but goodies, whether you've seen the movie or not.
B00005CDNI|4.0|I'm no ABBA fan -as you can tell by my other reviews, I'm a big Depeche Mode fan-, but I know a good record when I listen to it. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that my parents brought this back from Europe in 1981 and I would listen to it every sunday or so, but this record kicks major butt, and I love the remasterized version. These guys could do anything musically and turn it into brilliant pop tunes. I still don't know the reason ABBA is such an underestimated band amongst a lot of so-called-music-lovers. Voulez-Vous features rock (Does Your Mother Know?), disco done righty-right (title track), beautiful ballads (Chiquitita and Angeleyes) and even brilliant lyrics by today's pop standards. Please pay attention to the brutal production gimmicks of this think, guys. It will blow you away if you truly know what music is about. You will dance, you will sed a tear, and you will even sing along, which is something modern pop tracks don't allow to. This is too brilliant to be true.
B00004WKII|5.0|If you are already a Hendrix afficionado, then you must already have this box set.  If not, what are you wasting your time reading the musings of this fat middle aged white dude for?  Buy this right now!  As some other reviewers have already mentioned, the Bold As Love track on the second disc will simply blow you away.  That said, if you are new to Jimi, I would recommend that you start with some of the studio recordings and more commercially accessible live releases.  My recommendations are the three Experience albums (Are You Experienced?, Axis: Bold as Love, and Electric Ladyland) as well as the Band of Gypsies record (my personal favorite for Machine Gun alone).  If these records appeal to you, then venture further and pick this Box Set up.  It is a marvelous collection for the Hendrix lover, I just think that it may hold a few too many obscure and experimental tracks for the uninitiated.
B000001G5H|5.0|Since many people read these reviews as a source for deciding what to purchase (or not to purchase) I will start off by emphatically expressing that this one of the best piano performances/CDs of all time (and in the history of the piano most likely). There are not enough superlatives in the English vocabulary to describe this performance which is tantamount to elevating an earthly piano to the high heavens.     Etude = An instrumental piece, usually of some difficulty and most often for a stringed keyboard instrument, designed primarily to exploit and perfect a chosen facet of performing. (Groves)  Ok so Chopin's etudes are not exactly Czerny but they are still etudes!     The etudes, in my opinion, belong to a certain subset of pieces that stretch the limits of the piano, specifically, and the art of pianism, in general. This subset does not necessarily have to be defined, but Liszt and Rachmaninof also fall under this category.    One of the distinct qualities of Pollini that separates him from the rest of the crowd is COMPOSURE. Pollini has the ability to nullify all the human tendencies/temptations that are destructive to the cause of pure music (fear of mistakes, inability to sustain tempo, the legitimate tensing of the hand after technically difficult passages, uneven pedalling, swallowing notes, etc....) Pollini plays the 24 Etudes with practically no mistakes (if one listens closely the only intermittent mistakes are extremely trivial to nonexistent - taking a nanosecond here and there to breathe).   The Chopin etudes are some of the most feared pieces in the piano world. Not for nothing we don't have a complete strong recording of Rubinstein playing these.   Pollini presents a majestic, Olympian and masculine version of these pieces. His rendition in contrast to what his critics say (these critics always seem to be anonymous in nature... I would like to hear a substantive criticism of this rendition from a musicologist if possible) is emotional, just not sentimental (this draws him close to Richter). The pathos here derives from the notes themselves (and the score) and how the interplay with the other notes in a polyphonic, architectural way. These layers of sounds and the way Pollini constructs them is a manifestation of emotion through musical intelligence instead of showmanship. The HIGHEST level of emotion is when the emotion flows from the symmetry of the object itself in its most succinct, pure, and architectural form..... and exposes the nakedness of these tunes in their glory. This is analogous to breaking a multi dimensional diamond to its elements (or any very complex physical compound), like a Kaleidoscope. More specifically it is obvious that Pollini mastered each element in its own right.... the pedalling dynamics, each hand, the melodic structure, the harmonic developments. This is a much higher level of emotion than \\"trying\\" to be emotional (which is also a high level since many pianists play with little emotion). In fact, Neuhaus said similar things about Richter in his famous book on piano playing.    It is true that many pieces of Chopin are soft and fragile - the Nocturnes, the Mazurkas (these are pleasant pieces but rather simplistic at times), many of the waltzes.... The Chopin Etudes though are considered monumental to a pianist's pianism having that explosive mixture of everything - technique, virtuosity, polar opposite emotions... and this is what makes them so hard. One has to find the balance between the technical challenges and the wonderful melodies..   I could write a book on just the amazing musical miracle that is this Cd. When I first heard the Etude 1 Opus 10 I had to listen to it at least 100 times consecutively (I am not kidding) to even being to fathom what Pollini does here. Pollini's playing of the first etude is just from another planet... and this after comparing closely to Watts, Berevosky, Freire, Richter, Wild, Ohlson, Zayas, Ashkenazy, Lorte, Arrau, Lugansky, Perahia,Cherkassy (who makes some pretty notable mistakes), and Gavrilov (who plays this well also)...... Novaes, Chiu, Cziffra and Cortot ( I put these four in a separate category because their performance is absolutely unacceptable by any stretch of the imagination...I am not a diehard stickler of technique necessarily, but they play different chords and notes all together, I am not even sure they are playing Chopin at all.... a real crime against this music.... its almost laughable that people here can just \\"excuse\\" Cortot for practically making like 30-40 mistakes in one minute) and they are not even close AT ALL to Pollini. At some stage all of them either blatantly hit wrong notes or lose their cool/breath and have to hide it with pedalling/playing slower/speeding up (this is what I call the art of using rubato at times of need).   Pollini plays this grandiose - Pollini here is saying \\"I am the Napoleon of the piano.\\" Pollini brings the \\"hidden\\" tune that appears right before the descending arpeggios (in the right hand) end (and go back up afterwards) and not only illuminates this tune but also merges it with the passage in the left hand perfectly.... all with perfect pedalling - giving it a monumental/ bell ringing texture. So you have a pianist that is playing fast, plus is able to play this hidden theme ( which is three notes per arpeggio - I can't understand how he did this (maybe he is possessed of some extraterestrial force). He is the only pianist who really has complete control of these hidden tunes. Richter does less of this and highlights the tune in the left hand more. I have even heard Richter really struggle a little bit with this etude (and he is one of the most technically brilliant pianists of all time). Its a pleasure also to hear this being played without panting, incorporating staccato like phrases, uneven pedaling and wrong notes, of course. Some of these arpeggios are unbelievably difficult. Pollini's playing of the revolutionary etude is much better than Perahias. Perahia and Ashkenazy at times play staccato instead of legato.... and don't accentuate the theme in the left hand..... Arrau does this also (I really don't like his version - he incorporates this staccato like legato at times).    Now, there is a review here that criticizes Pollini for not playing piano and staccato at the a minor arpeggio. So maybe wer should also not listen to Horowitz who made minor alterations of dynamics at times (this same reviewer reccommended Cortot who changes the actual NOTES). We can assume that pianists with the stature of Horowitz, Pollini, Perahia, and Richter have enough acumen to make small dynamic alterations, within reason (especially with Chopin). In fact Pollini does play this arpeggio slightly softer than the others. In addition dynamics is often a relative concept - piano is quiet RELATIVE to forte - there is no universal consent of what \\"quiet\\" is (again, within reason of course). For example, when there are two different cadenzas for a concerto and they both have different dynamics its at the pianists' discretion to merge some ideas. Now all this in the grand scheme is ludicrous (this arpeggio lasts about 2 seconds in the span of a 50-60 minute CD) but I wanted to bring this issue to light.   What makes a superstar pianist is the ability to do something that someone else cannot do (this applies to art and probably to most, if not all discplines). Do you honestly think that Pollini could not have played staccato if he wanted to? Pollini takes these pieces to terrain for beyond mere staccato-legato quandaries.    Ok enough already. There is no \\"opinion\\" involved here. The vast majority of pianists are too scared to even record this whole cycle (they like to hide behind nocturnes, mazurkas and various other concertos where they can hide behind an orchestra). From the few that have recorded the whole cycle they are rampant with either missed notes, nervousness leading to involuntary pulls/pushes in tempi, swallowingthe melody, etc. (and this includes Richter who I have heard both in the BBC legends series and Richter in memoriam - and in both he sounds very nervous and makes many mistakes...... not getting even close to the level of Pollini.... and I say this being a big fan of Richter). There is no close second or room for comparison.  Please listen to #2 Opus 25 - this is the epitome of beauty and truth. No nonsense, no gimmicks.... just the pure sound of the piano. Pollini's understanding of music is beyond what mere mortals can discuss.    This is Pollini's gift to humanity - love it. Cherish it. Embrace it.  This is one of the best piano CDs ever. Period.  You will cry out to the heavens when you hear this CD.
B000BKJ78U|5.0|I'm pissed because this box set looks MUCH better than the first box set he released.  I want to buy it just for the way the box looks.  I understand his point in making another box set, but I think he should release a box set with the ORIGINAL movies plus the NEWER versions of the original movies together.  I wish he would do that because then all Star Wars fans would be happy.  Lucas is probably going to release another BOX set with all six movies next year.  And I'm going to have to end up buying that as well.  My suggestion would be to buy the first box set that was released because it contains the bonus disc.  It is more $, but it also has more.  If you just want the movies && don't care about the extras then buy this set. I might end up buying this as well just for the actual box :/  Hope this helped &lt;3
B000092Q4U|5.0|To the Ashlee Simpson fan, if you don't like metal or hardcore than don't listen to it, stay with the no talents. Im going to compare Ashlee to a little band called Pantera, Ashlee had her sisters fame, she used it so MTV could put her on display nad shove her down our throats and perceive her to be a fake because her boyfriend and other writers made her music and claims that something inspired her,fake!!! then she dyed her hair black so that no comparisons could be made, then all her songs were played non stop at all top40 stations and then SNL, no talent to lip synch and the Orange Bowl showed she had no vocal skill. Pantera were a band of men who wrote their own music, did not have help from daddi or big sis, had no MTV or radio help, no internet downloading but managed to make chart toppers, you know why? dedication and perceveirance to their craft because the love of music is better rhan having people love you for who ypu are not. PONDER THAT.  As for Lamb of God, they are sometimes called the new Pantera because of the way they carry the torch to music, being real, and writing songs that impact instead of making songs for profit. Lets see if Ashlee can ever grow some true talent, but pigs shall fly first.
B000BNTM96|5.0|I got into qotsa when my friend told me to listen to Songs For The Deaf, and that made me go out and buy lullbies to paralyze. If you are new queens of the stone age fan, or a fan thats loved them since the beginning you will love this live cd/dvd. Great song choice on the cd, some of the concert clips have pretty crappy quality but others have the best quality i have ever seen on any dvd, its like your right there. and the sound is great too. In the dvd we also get to see former band members like Nick Oliveri, Dave Grohl and Mark Lanegan. I recommend this live cd/dvd to any queens fans. its definitely worth the $15
B00003CXI1|5.0|Normally, Hollywood takes a great book like this, and totally mucks it up on the screen.  This film is a pleasant and excellent exception.  The casting of the three friends--Harry, Hermoine, and Ron--is perfect, and the film retains all of the charm of the book.  Never in my life have I seen a film that so closely follows the novel.
B000AOEN2C|4.0|The biggest problem that I saw with Enterprise was that it took place after all the previous series. People's expectations and preconceived ideas as to what the show should be is the biggest downfall to this series. I can't tell how many times I heard people preface their comments with \\" I like the show but it's isn't like the original\\" or \\"it doesn't compare to TNG\\". Enterprise is a good show. The plots were fine but I think people didn't let go of previous series and judged it against them. Scott Bakula's character was great and the relationship between Trip and Tapal was fun. The ending to the series stank because there were so many potential story lines that could have been explored and weren't. Given that it still was pretty good.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is an amazing book in that it mixes elements of science fiction, technology, and military, with deeply felt psychological connections and maturation. Ender is a top of the line prospect set to train in outer space boot camp in order to perfect his mental and physical frame to prevent aliens from scorching the Earth.<br /><br />The details regarding the various games and the psychological maturity necessary to achieve in them are tremendous. Despite his young age and numerous pressures, Ender endures through the trails with great results.<br /><br />This makes you long for intergalactic low gravity moonball or crater pit paintball. Very fun and entertaining read.
B000B8QEZG|2.0|She sings in the beginning of \\"Sorry\\", as the phrase \\"I am sorry\\"  in a great number of other languages. <br /> <br />She probably used Babelfish, because if you translate \\"I am sorry\\"  into Dutch you get \\"Ik ben droevig\\". But unfortunately, \\"Ik ben droevig\\"  has quite another meaning in Dutch, it means \\"I am sad\\". Let's call it a research mistake. <br /> <br />The album itself makes me kind of sad too. This has nothing to do with disco music, this is simple DJ music (samples all over the place). Yes it's popular music, so it will sell well. But this album will be forgotten in a few years from now. <br />Except maybe for some legal cases popping up every now and then.

B00005JO1J|2.0|RENT the film works for exactly four minutes.  The opening credits role and then the cast sings 521,600 Minutes and its all downhill from there.  What follows a nice opening is a film so pointless, so banal, you'll asks as my wife did for the two and half hours back you spent watching RENT.<br /><br />I remember when RENT opened on Broadway.  I remember I had a buddy who camped out on the street to see the play.  I remember people called RENTheads would record the shows in other cities and trade bad audio and video of the off Broadway productions starring Molly Ringwald and Doogie Howser. It was a phenomenon based on the tragic death of it's creator Jonathon Larson more than a well made show, and so the play stayed untouched, unfiddled around with, for who would dare touch the Genius of Larson?  Who would dare walk on his grave?<br /><br />If I were the director of this movie I would have begged for a rewrite.  If ever there was a film dying for some heart, some central core, its RENT.  It's jumbled, it's messy, it contains characters that don't mesh, there's no coherence, no one worth rooting for, no one worth hating, and that's wrong. The passion and drive of the clunky play may work as live theater, heck CATS works as live theater, but RENT is charmless, pointless, and murky and it really shouldn't be.<br /><br />RENT follows the exploits \\"in the year of the life\\" of Mark (Anthony Rapp) the angst ridden film maker, Roger (Adam Pascal) the Rockstar with AIDS, Mimi (Rosario Dawson) the heroin addicted Stripper with a heart of gold (and AIDS), Tom (Jesse L. Martin) the unemployed professor with AIDS, Angel (Wilson Jermaine Heredia) the Drag Queen (with AIDS)  who steals Tom's heart, Maureen (Idina Menzel) the performance artist and Mark's Ex-Girlfriend, and Joanne (Tracie Thomas) the Lawyer who falls in love with Maureen.  They are the bohemians, they can't pay the rent, they can't pay the heat, and everyday they stand the chance of being evicted.  So they sing.  They sing a lot, and at one point at a protest, they Moo.  That causes a near riot.  I wanted to laugh, but I didn't because I didn't want to be mean to the rest of people in the theater.  But I had a feeling they were watching a different movie cause they kept clapping.<br /><br />Why was this film so joyless?  Why were the main characters so whiney?  Why does RENT have no real heart?  The film just assumes that we the audience will like these people and so it makes no attempt to allow them to win our hearts.  It assumes that because the script has introduced us to them that they are friends.  But half the film revolves around how these people don't get along. They are disgruntled about life and yet the film praises that fact and instead of doing anything about it they whine.  They hate progress, they protest the idea of personal responsibility, and fight the man, for what? Nothing but a crappy apartment in New York City.<br /><br />The most honest moment in the film comes when the Mark films a homeless women who was being harassed by the cops.  The homeless women look at him and screams something like \\"don't exploit me, get a job.\\"  These people are not happy, the lifestyle they promote is pointless and the film fails to take a stand on any of it.<br /><br />The film also doesn't work on a purely technical level.  The dialogue clunks haphazardly into the songs.  The actors take a moment to reflect before the songs take off, and none of the songs are worth humming when you leave the theater.  But you'll have 521,600 minutes attacking you in your dreams.  If the screenplay would have been retooled to fit the screen instead of the screen trying to replicate the stage a better movie would have emerged.  But RENT will appeal only to those who love the play.<br /><br />The other glaring problem is the actors seem too old to embody these parts.  With actors culled from the original off-Broadway cast, it casts and even deeper gloom over the film.  We all have to grow up, this group of 30-somethings edge on pathetic.  A new cast of twenty-somethings would have worked a bit better.<br /><br />So save your money.  You thank me I promise.have to grow up, this group of 30-somethings edge on pathetic.  A new cast of twenty-somethings would have worked a bit better. <br /> <br />So save your money.  You thank me I promise.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|Well, after Mezmerize left me with a great, but ultimately far too small taste of the new direction System is now taking, I of course had to wait impatiently for this second half to be released. I loved Mezmerize, and aside from the somewhat mediocre \\"BYOB,\\" I thought it could compete face to face with any of System's other albums. It wasn't perfect, in my opinion, as it had some of System's laziest lyrics. But it was still a shocking revelation of how much System has grown and matured. Instead of slowly deteriorating and giving in to the wishes of short-sighted marketing executives like almost every other band from this era of metal, SOAD continues to create art and progress. For a more in depth opinion of Mezmerize, I have written a separate review, but of course this is a review of Hypnotize.<br /><br />...and to be honest, I was disappointed upon first listen. The songs just wouldn't gel for me, didn't grab me emotionally like the best songs on Mezmerize. But this turns out to be a bit of a grower (albeit it a very fast one): three spins and I was hooked. Sure, it doesn't resemble the self-titled in quite as many ways as Mezmerize did. But it takes those elements that Mezmerize brought back into the equation and develops them even furthur. The frenetic, progressive Mr. Bungle-esque time shifts and dissonances are more seamlessly combined with the melodic sentiments carried over from the Toxicity days to create a new sound of sorts. System is going forward and won't be looking back anytime soon.<br /><br />One major difference between Mezmerize and Hypnotize is variety - while Mezmerize had a more interesting variety of different sounds (\\"Old School Hollywood,\\" \\"Cigaro,\\" and \\"Question\\" for example,) Hypnotize shows a more cohesive sense of flow. Many of these songs are the same blend of addictive melody and old school SOAD punk-metal energy. This can work for or against the album, depending on your preferences. Either way, though, it splits this \\"double album\\" into two distinct albums. And all for the better... who wants to sit around and listen to the same sound for 80 minutes?<br /><br />Another major difference is this: Hypnotize is easily the darkest SOAD album since the self-titled. Even my friends who aren't particularely sentimental or over emotional when it comes to music say that this album does something to them... it hits a nerve somewhere. A lot of the best examples are towards the end, like \\"Holy Mountains\\" which I see as being a far more mature successor to \\"Ariels\\" and one of the best songs on this album. After the comic relief of \\"Vicinity of Obscenity\\" comes the ungodly creepiness of \\"She's Like Heroin.\\" Despite sloppy lyrics, \\"Lonely Day\\" is still a haunting melody. And of course there's the full version of \\"Soldier Side\\" which sends chills down my spine still after listening to this album for a week.<br /><br />Even in many of the other songs, this emotional intensity can be found in assorted choruses and bridges. \\"U-Fig\\" seems to have a Dredg-like antsy quality to it and the apocalyptic \\"Tentative\\" foreshadows the too-close-for-comfort intensity of the last few songs on the album (and at the same time manages to evoke the meloncholic vibe of Steal This Album's better songs.)<br /><br />The title track was the perfect choice for single, and it was the first song to grow on me. In many ways it is the oldest-sounding song and could have been a track off of the self-titled if it were not for Daron's lead vocalizing. By the way, while I'm on this subject, I would like to share my opinions on Daron's voice; many people seem to unfairly dismiss new System solely based on his voice. While I will admit that he doesn't have the \\"nicest\\" or most well trained voice, I could cite dozens of worse singers in any form of popular music. He may not have the outright beauty of Serj's voice, but he has style and energy that I think benefit this new direction System is going in. Besides, Daron isn't REPLACING Serj, the two voices are simply playing point and counterpoint. If anything, Daron-critics should like Hypnotize more because it has more Serj than Mezmerize did.<br /><br />People who complain that this album isn't enough like the \\"old\\" System need to stop being nostalgic whiners that are afraid of change. System of a Down have changed as a band, matured, developed - and thank God for that! Had they stayed the same to appease the fanatics, they'd be down the drain with all those other nu metal bands. I couldn't be happier with the changes System has made. I will always have a place in my heart for the self-titled, it was my favorite album for a long time and I don't think they'll be able to top it in my book... but I would rather they change and continue to become a different band that makes more cds that are great in their own unique way than drive the same formula into the ground repeatedly until I stop liking them altogether. In art, change is survival. Learn to embrace that concept, or be left behind - your choice.the two voices are simply playing point and counterpoint. If anything, Daron-critics should like Hypnotize more because it has more Serj than Mezmerize did. <br /> <br />People who complain that this album isn't enough like the \\"old\\" System need to stop being nostalgic whiners that are afraid of change. System of a Down have changed as a band, matured, developed - and thank God for that! Had they stayed the same to appease the fanatics, they'd be down the drain with all those other nu metal bands. I couldn't be happier with the changes System has made.

B00003CXXS|2.0|In Jurassic Park III Sam Neill as Dr. Grant looks tired.  No wonder, this 3rd in the series of Dinosaur experiment gone wrong movies has the look and feel of a film thrown out for public consumption and quick profit.  While big on blood and special effects there is nothing new here.  This film is why people hate sequels.  Raptors, raptors everywhere.  Terradactyls fly off into the sunset at the end of this movie, with glee on the look of the faces of all the main characters.  Considering these creatures were hunting them down, you wonder why?  Its one thing to make a sequel that adds something to the original story line, Jurassic Park III just has nothing to contribute.  The scene with Barney did give one hope that this stinker was almost over.
B000AGTPUA|3.0|I am a huge fan of christmas movies and found this one enjoyable. The film aims moor to the younger age but anyone can also enjoy the film. The film gets you right in the christmas mood and features some good chritmas songs. The best thing about the film is the animation it's great the only bad animation was santa I felt like he looked the least real of all the charactors. The story is slow at the begging and dosent get really good till the middle. But again it's a good christmas movie to get you in a festive mood.
B0009YA386|3.0|They do what they do well, but its been done, and re-done before.  And perhaps it is because of this that I was not moved at all by this album.  Their pedestrian synth noises are similar to those as that band that never wanted them in the first place, and the singer's voice sounds just as affected as the other band to which everyone is drawing comparisons.  Don't get me wrong, they do what they do well, but if you know what bands I'm talking about, then don't waste your time here.  Otherwise, this might be new to you, and you might enjoy it.  I gave this album 2.5 stars because I feel that degree of origionality is a pertinent factor in attempting an objective measure of quality of music.  If you don't feel the same way, then take this as a 4/5.
B000B8QEYC|4.0|On her first release in five years, Enya does not stray from the formula that has made her an international sensation:  lush multi-tracked vocals, haunting melodies (all composed by Enya), synthesized orchestration, and poignant lyrics (all written by longtime collaborater Roma Ryan). And when you consider that she has sold 65 million albums worldwide, it's hard to argue with that kind of success.<br /><br />My personal favorite is \\"The River Sings,\\" which begs comparisons to \\"Ebudae\\" from SHEPHERD MOONS.  It is also one of three songs in the Loxian language (created by Roma taken from his book \\"Water Shows the Hidden Heart\\" to be published next month).  The other two are \\"Less Than a Pearl\\" and \\"Water Shows the Hidden Heart,\\" another standout track.<br /><br />My only complaint is that this is the third time Enya has waited five years between releases.  So while you're waiting for 2010 to roll around, savor AMARANTINE in the meantime. [Running time - 45:35] HIGHLY RECOMMENDED<br /><br />PS: Dec. 6, \\"Amarantine\\" is being released as the first single with two non-album tracks:  \\"The Comb of the Wind\\" (3:39) and the instrumental \\"The Spaghetti Western Theme from The Celts\\" (1;57). Whether this is the record company's or the the artist's idea, it strikes me as a bit greedy to have to shell out another five bucks for two more tracks that could have easily been included on the full-length CD.
B00000DOZH|5.0|FROM THE PAST COME's THE STORM's!! <br /> <br />Dont we all remember our first time hearing the song ''HIGHWAY TO HELL''?? I do!! <br /> <br />So good and feel good..it's absurd!! <br /> <br />Who are you without it....A POSER.. POSER!!! <br /> <br />YOU SUCK WITHOUT IT(OR NOT LIKING IT)!!!! THAT SIMPLE!!!
B00000099Y|5.0|Ever heard of analogy?  Comparison?  I read an interview with Maynard when this album was released wherein the interviewer asked if \\"Eulogy\\" was about anyone in particular... like Henry Rollins (whom some felt had sold out during that era).  MJK just laughed and refused to say anymore.  Anyhoo, this is probably the best album from one of the best contemporary art-metal bands.  Own it.  Nuff sed.
0440178002|5.0|A lot has been said about the film, but you need to read the book to really appreciate the greatness of this work. James Clavell in Shogun portrays an absorbing picture of the mind and land of the Japanese - conceptualized gardens and elaborate tea ceremonies; poetry and politeness - and all the subtlety beneath; bushido - the way of the warrior, kimonos, sashes and swords; karma - fate; secret messages sent across fiefs by carrier pigeon; and pissing, literarily, on deals to seal them. <br /> <br />The cast Clavell presents is just as engaging - Mariko, the delicate, petite lady who courageously confronts guards outside Osaka castle in a dwell. She's samurai, she's Christian, and she's in love with Blackthorne. But beneath all these seemingly entangled affiliations lies one deep, unswerving devotion - and that is to her liege lord, Toranaga. <br /> <br />Ian Blackthorne...the `barbarian' pilot who happens on the scene with a ship bearing muskets and cannon, vast potential for future warfare in Japan, and telling implications for whichever feudal lord can lay hold of this advantage. Blackthorne has come into a good thing, but as things go in this surreal world of willows, he just doesn't know. He's in love with Mariko. He's even slept with her - he thinks - but then, he can't be sure. He's Toranaga's friend. He's even saved the man's life once. But isn't he no more than just a pawn - valuable but expendable - in the hands of the powerful general? <br /> <br />And there's Toranaga himself, whose favourite pastime is falconry - and manipulating the people around him, studying them and playing them off against each other, like he does with his falcons. The novel is set in 17th Century Japan, but Toranaga looks as if he has already read Machiavelli's The Prince and Robert Greene's 48 Laws of power. The story is largely about his bid to become Shogun - Supreme Military Dictator - ruling by fiat of the Emperor, who then would really be just a puppet. <br /> <br />Japan'scurrent leader, The Taiko, lies on his death-bed and asks Toranaga what can best be done to ensure his little son will grow up to rule after him. The two men, The Taiko and Toranaga, have come a long way and have the greatest regard for each other. Toranaga is the only commander The Taiko has ever lost a battle to, and Toranaga sees The Taiko as the only leader who has ever been worthy of his followership. But now The Taiko is dying and Toranaga tells him, \\"Let me go outside and commit seppuku\\" [ceremonial suicide], implying the obvious - that Toranaga himself forms the most apparent threat to The Taiko's son's ascension. The Taiko declines and constitutes a Council of Regents that will handle affairs till his son comes of age. The Council of Regents, Toranaga included, is made of the strangest bed-fellows and has Lord Ishido, Toranaga's arch-enemy, as Commander of the Heir's body guard. The Taiko reckons these people hate each other so much and will continue to disagree and cancel out each other's powers until his son is ready to take over. <br /> <br />In the aftermath of The Taiko's death Toranaga continues to affirm his loyalty. He is passive and acts demure when Lord Ishido (who happens to have fancy ideas of his own) accuses and tries to provoke him. He is indignant when his own aides as much as hint at the begging opportunity for ultimate power. \\"That is treason\\", he vehemently chastises them. But Toranaga is a great actor. In his private moments he is astonished that people can be so gullible. He continues to watch - plotting and plotting, weighing his aces, strengthening his position. <br /> <br />And while he's doing this he's not above using any means he considers expedient, even if these means tamper with sacred ways or border on the amoral. He needs to have the foreign ship pilot firmly in hand - so Mariko's husband is ordered to divorce her, then Blackthorne's ship gets razed by unidentified arsonists. Toranaga commiserates and orders the immediate rebuilding of the ship, but reckons privately that the ship might just again get burnt sometime in the future, with yet another building reordered. Also, in the same breath he orders a couple of his grumbling generals outside a conference room to commit seppuku, but when his trusted aide and most senior commander, Hiro-matsu, asks to be accorded the same `privilege' to ease a certain shame, Toranaga tells him, \\"I don't approve of useless death.\\" Hiro-matsu's grandson-in-law had brought disgrace on his family when he committed an ill-advised breach of court, drawing his sword, unordered, on the Lord Ishido when the latter had insulted Toranaga. <br /> <br />And, as events play themselves out and the hour of decision approaches, Toranaga is on the lookout for treachery, constantly gauging the loyalty of friends, family and associates. Yabu, the daimyo - or feudal lord - of Izu, whose support could really swing things for either side in the coming war, is supposed to be Toranaga's ally. They negotiate, parley and plan towards the event, and in the end Toranaga tells Yabu, \\"But I don't trust you\\", and gets him to commit seppuku. Yabu's greatest pride as he composes his death-poem and kneels for the blow, is that he finds himself without fear. Toranaga also tests his son and heir, Sudara, telling him to put to put to death his children, all of whom Toranaga has already hidden beforehand. Sudara passes the test, but Toranaga, looking at him wistfully, feels sorry for his son, knowing that Sudara, who has been bred since he was young for the greatest responsibility, will never know any joy. But I'm different, Toranaga thinks. I love to drink sake and to `pillow'...And yes, I love to win. <br /> <br />And win he does in the end: \\"That year...the main armies clashed...By late afternoon Toranaga had won the battle and the slaughter began...Ishido was captured alive and Toranaga genially reminded him of the prophecy...Ishido lingered three days and died very old\\"...Machiavelli and Robert Greene would have been extremely proud of Toranaga. <br />
B000AYQLX6|4.0|\\"Walls and Bridges\\" was the remains of the \\"lost weekend\\". Alcohol dominated Lennon's life during this period. The album isn't as tough sounding as other Lennon albums from earlier and, in fact, it seems Lennon was trying to rediscover his sense of melody and produce something as lush as McCartney's \\"Ram\\". While \\"Walls and Bridges\\" doesn't measure up to Lennon's first two solo albums, it more than compensates with melodic, rich songs that feature some of the most interesting arrangements of any from his solo career. While the music is a tad inconsistent with filler, the best tracks here compare well to Lennon's best material as a solo artist.<br /><br />The new reissue has a mix of remixed/remastered tracks for the album. While this edition sounds improved compared to the cloudy first edition, it isn't as large a difference as \\"Mind Games\\" or even \\"Sometime in New York City\\" (which always sounded a bit muddy to me). The good news is that the best tracks here stand up very well to Lennon's best material; \\"Going Down on Love\\", \\"#9 Dream\\", \\"Nobody Loves You When You're Down and Out\\", \\"Surprise, Surprise\\" and others may lack the fire of the primal scream albums but they make up for it with some of Lennon's best vocal performances. it also features Lennon's biggest #1 hit until his death \\"Whatever Gets You Through the Night\\" recorded with Elton John. Fans know the story that John predicted it would be a #1 and bet Lennon that it would be. John challenged Lennon to appear in concert with him for the number if it did become a #1 hit. True to his word, Lennon did appear and Lennon performs the song with John (it is missing his performance of \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" which Elton John sang lead vocals on as it was his single at the time). Also included is a nice early version of \\"Nobody Loves You\\" and an interview with John. While it isn't John's best album, it has enough of his fire and talent in it to make it worthwhile for Beatles and Lennon fans. Like McCartney, Lennon did indeed endure an artistic slump as he lost his place in the changing world of rock music during the 70's but his talent never deserted him. If anything Lennon could have used an outside producer to help him consolidate and weed through his ordinary songs vs. the gems on this album.<br /><br />Although I understand Yoko's reluctance to include \\"Move Over Ms. L\\" (since it's written about their \\"break up\\")as a bonus track here,  it was written around the same time and would have fit perfectly. I'm not really clear as to why it wasn't included since it isn't on any of the other albums. Strange days indeed. It's a minor criticism at best and some of the remixed tracks here are a relevation such as \\"Going Down on Love\\".<br /><br />I really dislike the redesign of the cover and prefer Lennon's original one (which I still have as an LP). The original cover folded out with the picture of Lennon sticking out his tongue on the flip side. I would have loved to see the original album cover reproduced (and, in fact, ordered the import edition in hopes that it would reproduce it but it doesn't). The booklet reproduces the original 12 page booklet that came with the album pretty accurately (I haven't broken it out yet for a head-to-head comparison though).d indeed endure an artistic slump as he lost his place in the changing world of rock music during the 70's but his talent never deserted him.

0679720200|5.0|As with most great literary works, there appears to be endless interpretations of this brief but strangely compelling novel.  My own reading  of it came while listening to a Teaching Company course on Existentialism.  My take on the book will undoubtedly reflect my own prejudices and biases.  Nevertheless, here it is. <br /> <br />I find I must disagree with the many reviewers who describe Mersault as an \\"existentialist\\" character.  Far from it; indeed, Mersault seems the opposite of the existentialist ideal.  Nietszche would have despised him for his lack of passion.  Kierkegaard would have rebuked his unwillingness to take a leap of faith.  Even Sartre would have found his inability to take responsibility for his actions despicable. <br /> <br />Existentialism is far more than just \\"gloominess\\" or being fashionably depressed.  It is an outlook on life that admits the ugliness of the world and still urges us to take hold of ourselves in the face of all the apparent reasons for despair.  In this sense it is a very empowering and positive school of thought. <br /> <br />Mersault is the opposite of the existentialist ideal.  He eschews passion in all forms.  Love, moral discernment, even opportunities for self improvement are nothing to him.  He finds an odd sort of comfort in his nihilism.  To him life holds no meaning, and this belief shields him from the sting of grief at his mother's death.  It enables him to use Marie for his own pleasure while feeling no obligation, no inconvenient emotions, towards her.  It allows him to overlook the shady character and misdeeds of his \\"friends.\\" Even murder is a passionless act to him, one he regards with no more thought than taking a breath. <br /> <br />The only time he displays strong feelings is when confronted by the chaplain.  He flies into rage at the priest's compassion and belief in an afterlife.  Such ideas threaten the relentless despair that comforts him.  In the end he rejects with finality all forms of hope and takes solace is his belief that the world just doesn't give a damn about him or anyone else.  It is this atttitude that not only enables him to think about being beheaded but to look forward to it. <br /> <br />Camus, while not a believer in God, nonetheless had faith that life in worth living, that good and evil exist, and that the good is worth fighting for.  In all of these things Mersault is his opposite, and is thus a poignant example of what existentialism has to offer.  It is by rejecting his nihilism and passionately saying \\"Yes!\\" to life that we find the sense of meaning he so fervently dreaded. <br /> <br />
B000AGTPUA|5.0|The delightful award-winning book \\"The Polar Express\\" has been turned into one of the most delightful films I've ever seen. I have since read many reviews that make me glad I watched the film before reading the reviews: some of the delight comes from being surprised by events in the film that wouldn't be a surprise if I had read them first.<br /><br />This film looks like nothing I've ever seen.  The combination of \\"motion-capture\\" acting and animation results in a look that is much more \\"real\\" looking than traditional (or even Pixar) animation, but much more stylized than simple live-action filming.  For this story - it's a perfect marriage of \\"story\\" and \\"look\\".<br /><br />To avoid spoiling the \\"surprises\\" I'll only encapsulate the first few moments.  A boy is at that age when the existence of Santa Claus is very much in question.  After all - Santa would have to fly faster than the speed of light with a bag of toys larger than an ocean liner to cover his appointed rounds.  He lies awake on Christmas Eve, waiting to hear a sound a friend has told him he will never hear - the sound of sleighbells on Santa's sleigh.<br /><br />The movie begins weaving it's magic spell from the opening seconds.  Although it's a stylized animation, it gets the most minute details exactly \\"right\\".  This is a film that knows how new-fallen snow crunches under your feet.  It knows how a kid will check the milk and cookies left for Santa for evidence of whether or not the jolly old gent has come by.  It knows how a kid will fake being asleep when the parents come in to check on you when you're SUPPOSED to be asleep.  It's a movie that knows what it is to question, and what it means to have faith.  Another thing this movie understands is that at the North Pole - Santa is a really big thing.  It's one thing to meet Santa at your local mall, but if you were going to meet him at the North Pole, wouldn't that be just a little bit bigger?<br /><br />As our hero boy lies awake in bed the whole house suddenly rumbles as if an earthquake were in progress.  He rushes outside to find a huge gleaming train.  The conductor (looking an awful lot like Tom Hanks - Mr. Hanks provides voice to six characters) calls out and asks the boy if he's going to get on board.  The boy asks where the train is going.<br /><br />\\"Why, the North Pole, of course!  This is the Polar Express!\\"<br /><br />The conductor sizes up the boy and astutely observes that the boy is at that time when he begins to not believe.  \\"If I were you, I'd get on board\\", he advises the boy.<br /><br />This is a movie that understands the transition from believing to questioning, and it understands the importance of not giving up the faith.<br /><br />If I were you - I'd watch this movie.  And be prepared for it to become one of your favorites.arthquake were in progress.  He rushes outside to find a huge gleaming train.

B00005JMJG|1.0|This movie is sooo not worh it. While Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet both gave decent performances my question is why they wasted their talent on a movie like this. The storyline kept going back and forth between reality and memories so much so that you couldn't tell which was which. At times you didn't know what was going on at all. All of this craziness doesn't allow the viewer to get involved with the so-called love story going on between the leading actors. I have to say this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I am surprised, actually shocked, by the amount of good ratings on amazon.com it has recieved. It was hard to watch.

0465011020|4.0|The greatest crime of the West has been to stand by while brutal regimes by Kim Il Sung and others flourish. If there is any charge to level against liberalism in general, it is that as a movement, it has never thought to take brutal and swift action against the Sungs, Mao Tse Tungs, and Stalins of the world. In fact they have have always mocked conservatives for wanting to do so. Liberals always wait for the hammer to fall and then they act. Things are not evil to most liberal politicians until they happen to Americans. This lack of species loyalty is what characterizes the American liberal (again speaking generally. Their ire falls mainly on conservative or fascist regimes.
0451457994|5.0|@001 a Space Odyssey is an important book. Arthur C Clark is an important writer. Just think about the Clarke belt where the manmade satellites are. The Monoliths are a neat idea. The Artificial Intelligence description of HAL is well done for the 1960s. Hopefully Aliens who read this book some day will be cheering for the Humans in it. The spaceship Discovery is a technological marvel. Read the other books in the series as well.
0312335164|4.0|I have to say plot is multi-layer, and the twists really surprise me. The reasons behind the character's actions are believable and reasonable.  However, it doesn't draw your attention like Da Vinci Code.  There is just something missing that doesn't create that \\"can't put down\\" reaction.  Perhaps, because when David runs around finding the ring, I know that he won't find it until near the end, so it's doesn't create any suspences.  Or perhaps I know for a fact that Susan, who is working on finding the owner of the code, is not in imediate danger, so there is no worry on what will happen to her.  That's why I feel that the middle part drags a bit too long.
B000B8QEYC|3.0|I've collected everything worth having of Enya's, even a lot of her singles (that means selections with a lot of duplication which renders having ALL of her work not worth the money), and decided I had to have this album as soon as I saw it was coming out. <br />Unusually for Enya, you don't get any Latin or Gaelic on this CD, you get three Loxian tunes (I think I've read that this made up language has some Lord of the Rings Inspiration) and one in Japanese (Sumiregusa). I think that the overall tone of the CD is somewhat slower than past efforts, it's more of a backgrond music album to my way of thinking because of this. <br />It might not be the album for a new Enya listener to start with but established fans will find a lot to like here. I don't consider it to be Enya's best but Amarantine is much better than most CD's out there, it is worth owning. I only hope she doesn't wait 5 years for the next one.
B000BGH22W|5.0|I have heard a lot of negative reviews on this soundtrack, mostly because people are bitter that John Williams isn't composing. But I think Patrick Doyle has done a WONDERFUL job. His music brings a more mature theme to the film while still drawing from Williams' old themes.  <br /> <br />This is a real film score - there are the exciting tracks and \\"happy\\" ones (like the Quidditch World Cup, Potter Waltz, and Foreign Visitors Arrive), and then the more emotional ones (Harry in Winter, Death of Cedric). You really feel like you're reliving the film, with added parts like the mermaid song in \\"Underwater Secrets\\" and the last couple of tracks. Overall this is an excellent advancement in the Harry Potter film scores, it is the first time that I, personally, have felt EMOTION while listening to a HP soundtrack!
B000A2GHXW|4.0|This is made in Thailand but the quality of the sound is just great.  A great bargain to get the mini-lp sleeve design plus the remastered sound.  It looks and sounds just like its Japanese cousin but at a much lower price.  As far as debuts go, this album is a homerun; 3 of the Eagles' all-time greatest hits are here: \\"Take it Easy\\", \\"Witchy Woman\\" and \\"Peaceful Easy Feeling\\" and the rest of the albums are a nice mixture of country and western and classic rock.  Not their best overall album but still a good buy.  Recommended.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Did you expect anything short of greatness? Honestly now, I have become so accustomed to Opeth far surpassing any other form of musical expression, but it's always how they choose to do it that leaves me in awe. Ghost Reveries moves Opeth from a Death Metal band with Progressive influence to a Progressive band with Death Metal influences; at the end of the day, it's interchangeable.  <br /> <br />For those of you who think Opeth has lost its heavy Death Metal edge, think again; Ghost of Perdition hits like a lightning strike after 5 seconds of near-silent sound. I'm contemplating whether Ghost of Perdition is my favourite song off of Ghost Reveries... but it would be extremely difficult to keep The Baying of the Hounds off of thethe favourites list. Both songs have some of the most beautiful transitions music has ever had the pleasure of offering its listeners; Opeth's 10 minute masterpieces flow naturally and it is clearly evident with the first two tracks off of Ghost Reveries. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong though, it is difficult to have it all sink in with just a few listens. At first, you will listen to the songs and you will only retain certain melodies and transitions that will leave you awe-inspired. You will listen to the rest of the record and pick up on more countless awe-inspiring melodies and riffs. After a few listens, you won't be able to tell where you heard these melodies or how they sounded like... so it's very important that you listen again (especially if you are new to Opeth). <br /> <br />Once you sink your teeth into this record, you will be amazed by the complexity and the beauty of Metal's most magnificant band (and this isn't even a biased commen; look it up and you'll know what I mean).  <br /> <br />Atonement has got to be the most talked about song on Ghost Reveries. Most people who have no earthly business listening to any Death Metal band seem to be in love with this song. This is one of the lightest songs Opeth has done (minus anything off of Damnation). What makes this song so sensational is the Middle Eastern tones that overwhelm it, as the keyboards add the most beautiful atmosphere (just like on Damnation). You have to experience this song to truly know how I feel.  <br /> <br />The Grand Conjuration is another tune that defies textbook song structure, as Akerfeldt goes from whisper to growl in mere nanoseconds.  <br /> <br />\\"The eyes of the devil, fixed on his sinners.\\" <br /> <br />\\"The hands of Satan, assembling his flock; pale horse rider searching the earth.\\" <br /> <br />I often tend to lose my face when Akerfeldt rips into the grows during those interludes. There's nothing else that gets the adrenaline going. The added sounds of the keyboards/piano definately make this track evil in all its respect.  <br /> <br />Opeth permanently added a fifth member to its band, with the addition of a keyboard/piano player (who has played on other Opeth cds). This extra addition does wonders for the songs. I've never believed Opeth needed a keyboard player/pianist, but the extra layer of sounds adds atmosphere to the whole record. <br /> <br />The whole of Ghost Reveries flows fluently, as Isolation Years closes off the year's best record. Now, with numerous 10 minute songs and overwhelming complexity (followed by the jaw-dropping of the listener), one often tends to leave out a certain track. That certain track (which went unnoticed at first) was Isolation Years. I was so blown away by the rest of the record, that I somehow over looked this one. Isolation Years is a painful song to listen to, as it follows Atonement in its quiet, soothing sound. Akerfeldt proves he is the greatest vocalist today, as well as the greatest musician Period. No other song affected me more emotionally than Isolation Years.  <br /> <br />Experience Opeth. If you can't handle the Death Metal growls, pick up Damnation, or listen to some of the songs off of Ghost Reveries. Whatever you do, experience this band. It is a great shame, and a great loss to anyone who enjoys true music to go without this band.

In the second installment of the home alone movies, Kevin finds himself in a similiar situation with a twist. He has gotten lost in the airport on the way to christmas in florida, and ends up in New York City with all of the families' money and credit cards. Most young kids would panic, but Kevin takes advantage of the situation, going on a spending spree all around New York City, until he runs into a couple of old friends. Fresh out of Prison, Marv and Harry are up their old scheme when they come across the little kid who sent them to jail. Looking for revenge, Kevin must once again defend himself from the wet bandits.  <br /> <br />This movie is very closely related to the first. The general plot is the same in both movies, Kevin is stranded away from his family at christmas time and must defend his house from Marv and Harry the criminals. Many of the tricks kevin uses to keep his distance from the theives are repeated from the original movie, and sometimes can be repetitive. The movie has its own twists and the action is hilarious throughout the movie, much like the first. The ending is almost identical to the first, exciting and heartwarming.  <br /> <br />The new setting gives kevin a whole new world of toys to play with. The original movie gave Kevin familiar surroundings and a lot to work with, but stranded at his Aunt and Uncle's house in New York is a bit different. Kevin is forced to make do with what he can find, and it makes for some entertaingig action. New York City instead of a hometown is also a big change, and Kevin reacts differently in a unfamiliar city. The plot is able to stay remarkably the same in the two movies and play out so differently in each to the audience.  <br /> <br />The characters in each movie are the same, yet different. THe main characters are all the same. The family, Marv and Harry and Kevin are all the same from the first movie. This movie allowsfor a few more characters to be thrown into the mix, including a woman who lives in Central Park, and the Hotel Desk Manager. The interesting people Kevin meets plays a vital role in the attention of the audience, because the humor carries the film. Everyone kevin crosses paths with in the movie has an impact on his sucess in the big city.  <br /> <br />Overall the sequel did live up to the original. The first movie was great, but this one had some magic of its own. The New York setting is a perfect backdrop to the action and humor that plays out in this christmas classic. Watch them together or separate and they are still both fun and enjoyable movies for the whole family. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000127LW2|5.0|The first season of voyager seems way better than the last season.  Although it is the shortest season most of its episodes are higher quality.  If you watch the second season it really brings the first season down cause they over use the kazon which are one of the dumbest aliens ever to appear on star trek.  after seeing the kazon one suddenly finds science fiction boring. The reason the first season survives the kazon being so dumb is because they are only in two episodes.<br /><br />the vidians are ok and better than most people give them credit for but the writers never took full advantage of them.  body harvesting aliens could have been way more interesting than the borg if used properly.  they only used the videans in two episodes as well the one where they captured a few of the crew being the better episode.  they used a lot of episodes using the temporal mechanics theme wich are usually pretty interesting episodes.  the episode where the captin and pilot go back in time on the one alien planet is pretty good but the ending where the planet gets destroyed because the crew was trying to save their people which is what brought them to the planet after all was an obvious example of the writers having no idea what was going on with the show and just making up any ending they think sounds good.<br /><br />another one of the shows highligts is the crew moron neelix.  whenever the writers run out of ideas they use neelixs bad cooking as a plot.  they also portrayed the captain as the crews mother figure.  this was a dumb idea too.  if your on a star ship thats similar to a ship in the military the captain isnt a mother figure.  however the show could have been more interesting useing that theme if the crew would have been more rebelious just like any bad kid and which they could have done since a quarter of the crew were supposed to be rebbel maquis.  the packaging was poor and the season was too short to be above 60 bucks but besides that it was pretty entertaining.ning.
B00005JO1G|2.0|This is a waste of money. It is boring and has nooooooooo action whatsoever. The only action parts are in the beginning when he is in basic training.<br /><br />It is very realistic of the war though. Both my parents were veterans of the gulf war and they said it was right on the money in terms of how it was out there. The only people I would recommend this movie to are people into war movies but not into all the guns, explosions, and gore.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|This is a great cd. It ranks right next SOAD's Toxicity and is a must own for any SOAD fan. You might have to give it a couple listen throughs before you really get into it but once you do. There are a lot of fantastic songs on the track and all of them are listenable.  <br />  <br />1. Attack- THis is a great ferocious opening track that really gets your blood pumping a great fast paced song that slows down in some parts it all works well. 8-10 <br /> <br />2. Dreaming- I love this song! I can listen to it over and over again. I love the vocals and lyrics. One of the best songs on the album. <br /> <br />3. Kill Rock 'N Roll- THis is a pretty decent song though Daron's lyrics are somewhat annoying. It has a great chorus and some weird lyrics good stuff. 7.75-10 <br /> <br />4. Hypnotize- The title track and it's good song slow and rythmic and quite ejoyable. I got very excited when i first heard this on the radio.  8.75-10  <br /> <br />5. Stealing Society- This song never really clicked with me but none the less it is still good and has nice vocals. 7-10 <br /> <br />6. Tentative- This is another solid song with a message and i really like Serj's vocals in this one. <br /> <br />7. U-Fig- Not one of my favorites but it's not bad. It's loud and has crazy vocals and ok rythm. 7.25- 10 <br /> <br />8. Holy Mountains- An instant SOAD classic a awsome song dominated by Serj. The longest track and it should be. Holy Mountains is a perfect blend of all that SOAD is known for. Great sound, message, this song will be remembered and i hope that it gets on the radio. 10-10 <br /> <br />9. Vicinity Of Obscenity- Strangley right after one of the most powerful songs on the album you get this wackily awsome song about banannas. The lyrics are out there and Serj's shouting of Bananna over and over is sweetness. I love this song to and it's the Cigaro in a way of Hypnotiz. 9.25-10 <br /> <br />10. She's Like Heroin- A pretty good song dominated by Daron's so so vocals but i likedit a lot. A good chorus and Daron's vocals don't destroy the song. The song really picks up in the last minute. 8-10 <br /> <br />11. Lonely Day- Pretty Simple song dominated by Daron again. It's an ok song that is listenable and there are good parts in the song but it's nothing special and i hope that this song won't become a single like the band talks about because there are so many better songs on Hypnotize than this. 7-10 <br /> <br />12. Soldier Side- Wow just wow is just the start of what i think about this song. It absolutley blew me away. The best song on the album just barely edging Holy Mountain. Powerful lyrics for one thing and it sounds fantastic. It's a very emotional song that could possibly bring you to tears. If this song doesn't become a single than something is wrong with SOAD. Soldier Side is the perfect song to end SOAD the absolute best song that has ever ended an album.  <br /> So overall Daron sings a lot more in Hypnotize but doesn't ruin the album though many of us still wish he would keep his singing to a minimum because Serj is one of the best singers you'll ever hear. A lot of people say that SOAD shoulda just released both a these cd's at once but i didn't mind because it was something to look forward to. So if you like good music with a message get this cd! <br />
B000A0GP0Y|4.0|When movies come out with a remake it is usually not as good as the original.  The remake of The Longest Yard is more entertaining than the first.  Some of the sexual jokes may not be suitable for younger audiences.  As compared to the original with Burt Reynolds, the remake is much funnier and more enjoyable to watch.  The director also did a great job of introducing the characters and gets viewers to really dislike the guards with use of racial discrimination and abuse to Paul Crewe.  Adam Sandler along with Chris Rock makes this a great comedy for all teenagers.  The chemistry of these two actors showed in this movie.  They were why this movie was so funny.  Sandler did a great job of playing Paul Crewe and was a huge factor of why this remake was better than the original.   <br /> Movie technology played a big role in why this movie was so entertaining.  The final football game was intense, humorous, and fun.  Camera positioning and cutting made one feel as if they were in the game.  This not only occurred in the final game, but also throughout the entire movie.  This remake is one that can be watched over and over because the comedy never gets old.  It is a great movie and everyone should buy it, or at least rent it.       <br />
B000301YY8|5.0|I went in search of the artist who sang \\"You're Beautiful\\" after an episode of ER featured it at the end of one of their shows. <br /> <br />While that song is great, it's not the best . The whole album is a nice blend of pop, folk, and an original sound I can't quite put my finger on. Flute, piano , and acoustic guitar, lend to different songs, each in a unique way. <br /> <br />I normally don't buy CDs , and would rather just download, but this was one I made an exception for. In today's day and age of quickly cranked out music by \\"artists\\" who don't even write their own music, it's nice to come across someone whose heart,soul, and life experiences, brings a visually vivid picture of the individual to his listeners.  <br /> <br />This is one that some of the folks on my Christmas list will be getting in their stockings. <br />
B00008H2LB|2.0|Ok..sorry about the title, but seriously, i can't listen to this band without feeling like running to the bathroom and letting it all out. The whiny voice is so anoying, i guarantee it will anoy the hell out of you. What anoys me is, that people think it is metal. i bet 50 % of the instruments aren't real. It just sounds so fake. The drums, guitars, and the bass isn't plugged in. Just so fake, and MTV-ish. They're even worse live..let's not go down that road. If you want good music, please don't go for this, please. There are plenty of better bands worth your money.
B000929AJQ|3.0|This is an album I find sounds somewhat like all their previous albums rolled into one. In a way that should make it the best disc, but in another way it simply recalls something we've heard before. There are no mind-blowing songs to my ears, no metal ala \\"Broken\\", and \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" and \\"Only\\" are indeed the catchiest of what's here. However, I still really like it, and \\"With Teeth\\" is a move in the right direction after the bloated \\"The Fragile\\". The Dualdisc version of this is simply the \\"Hand That Feeds\\" video, a discography with some samples, and the album mixed in stereo and surround. Nothing I need myself. Overall, if this was NIN's only disc I'd call it excellent, but when compared to their other albums it's simply good.
B000AP04OM|4.0|For some reason The Sound Of Music has never had any luck in home video release. It has never achieved the picture quality commensurate with its status. The 40th Anniversary Edition seemed like the opportunity for it to finally shine. Alas no. Yes it is a marked improvement over the previous DVD which image-wise was deplorable. But it is far below what we know is possible in film restoration today.    What's good about the new SoM transfer? Well for starters they've removed the much criticised electronic edge enhancement which infuriated so many people in the previous DVD. This is artificial sharpening which looks good on small screens but produces halos around objects when seen on larger displays. The result is a slightly softer image but definitely an improvement over the old DVD. And they've made some effort at restoration. The picture looks visibly brighter. The color timing which was way off in the previous DVD has been partially corrected - but not totally. Skin tones which looked overly red previously, now appear closer to normal. However this color correction is haphazard. Some scenes have skin tones looking very natural, others still have that ruddy, sun-burnt look. The night scenes especially have skin tones taking on an ugly muddy-red appearance. In short, the color timing for the new DVD is inconsistent. Ironically, one drawback of the present color-correction is an overly-accurate representation of the original colors in some scenes - in the Edelweiss reprise at the Salzburg Folk Festival, Angela Cartwright's face (Brigitta) takes on a faint greenish-yellow hue under the stagelight. In the previous DVD this had been corrected to give everyone a uniform pink glow but not in the present DVD. It may be a truer reflection of stagelighting but it is not at all pretty to look at. So in terms of color-correction, in trying to please everyone, the technicians ended up pleasing no one. Black levels however are spot on. Level of detail is also fairly good, especially shadow detail in the darker scenes, definitely better than in the previous DVD but again below what we've come to expect of DVD transfers on the cusp of the Hi-Def era. This is especially so considering that SoM was shot, not on 35mm film like other movies, but on 70mm which should, if properly handled, enable us to see detail that would eclipse the very latest Hollywood productions, almost all of which are shot in 35mm today. Sadly it does not.    Sound-wise, the THX Certified 4.1 Surround Sound of the previous DVD has been replaced by a 5.0 Surround. Note the loss of the .1 LFE (subwoofer). This won't make much difference as SoM does not make much use of the LFE channel but those using less expensive sound systems may end up losing the lower-most frequencies as the front speakers of these systems often cannot reproduce the lowest frequencies that will now be passed on to them. One also wonders why they did not use all 6 channels of the original Todd-AO soundtrack for this DVD. To find out in the Extras that they actually remixed the original 6 track audio into a new DTS soundtrack which we are not given here is only to add insult to injury. Apparently Fox is reserving the DTS soundtrack for its upcoming High-Definition version of SoM due out next year.    The selling point of this 40th Anniversary Edition must be the Extras of which there are tonnes. What I appreciate most in the current set of Rodgers & Hammerstein Anniversary releases is the inclusion of a separate songs-only chapter list. I hope this becomes a feature for all future musicals. An interesting curiosity in this DVD is the ability to hear and sing along with the film in both French and Spanish with the appropriate lyrics appearing beneath much like in a karaoke-singalong. Although the French soundtrack was already present previously, this is the first time I've heard the songs sung in Spanish. There are hours of documentaries. I especially liked Charmian Carr's new documentary \\"On Location with The Sound of Music,\\" and the children's reunion, \\"From Liesl to Gretl: A 40th Anniversary Reunion,\\" where the now grown-up children reminisce about their time on the set and point out all the little bloopers they made onscreen. It's heartening to learn that they've all turned out very well indeed. Unfortunately with all the new Extras, some of the features from the previous DVD had to be dumped. By far the saddest loss was the exclusion of Charmian Carr's delightful 1967 documentary \\"Salzburg Sight and Sound\\".    The Sound Of Music underwent a complete restoration in 2002 for its inclusion in the Academy Film Archive (A.M.P.A.S.). That 65mm restored print was first exhibited in early 2003. From the Film-to-Video restoration comparison included among the Extras, it would seem that this is the restoration used in the DVD. However it also shows how much more muted the colors on the film elements were even after restoration. It is only after the video transfer and color correction that the colors come to resemble what is seen here. The telecine color-timer was obviously over-enthusiastic with the color correction, pumping the colors up beyond what is natural.     For those contemplating getting the 40th Anniversary Edition, do note that Fox has announced that The Sound Of Music will be re-released next year on its new Blu-Ray High-Definition DVD. That's where the new restoration will re-emerge, hopefully with a more accurate telecine transfer and the newly remixed DTS soundtrack. If you can, it may be wiser to wait for the next incarnation of this beloved classic and hope that Fox finally gets things right.
B00013RC8O|4.0|\\"Vanishing Point\\" like \\"Easy Rider\\" does not withstand the test of time. It has demons, artsy scenes, and a plot that doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Yet it meant something to us then, and that may not be its fault but ours. Like Marc Antony tells Brutus, \\"the fault dear Brutus . . .\\" well, you know the rest.<br /><br />I think for these movies as is true in any generation, young people (us) believed that they had the one true vision of reality. This of course is fallacious and self centered, but not necessarily because they are wrong. It's because their is no 'one true vision' and we don't learn that for several more decades and several more busted lips.<br /><br />So Kowalski thinks that the war in Vietnam was wrong and that it was led by those political leaders as part of a giant conspiracy. Wrong. The war was a result of stupidity and greed and self serving, shallow interests. This was bad news for the 60,000 men and women who died there and 10 times that number who carried scars for the rest of their lives. But there was no conspiracy of evil. Other examples? How about the Crusades? Now they were pretty meaningful. Or Napolean's march on Moscow, Hitler's alliance with Stalin, OUR ALLIANCE WITH STALIN, and the Korean War?<br /><br />Anyhow, Barry Newman, in the role that would define his body of work, bets he can drive a 1970 Dodge Challenger from Colorado (I think) to San Francisco. We're not sure why but . . . . here are some of the reasons given: Despair over the war in Southeast Asia (not bad, a worthy explanation for being muy loco, his own despondancy over reporting corruption in the police department (we suspect he was kind of like a Harry Callahan who was ridden out of town), and the death of his surfer-hippie girlfriend (???)<br /><br />So off he goes enroute to becoming a symbol, kind of like Tommy Smith and John Carlos clenching their fists at the 1968 Olympics. His navigator (read soothsayer) is the blind DJ who has mastered what was then limited radio frequency distance, to speak to just Kowalski and give him 'secret' police bulletins. That is until the man comes and crushes his blind behind.<br /><br />Along the way Kowalski does a lot of speed, sees a gorgeous naked woman on a Japanese motorcycle (that happened to me, golly, almost daily in the 70's), and picks up gay hitchhikers (ditto).<br /><br />So it's hard to lash out against the machine if you can't pick your target and . . . pick the symbol of what and why you are targeting that/those targets. While not becoming comedic it does become confused.<br /><br />Some folks have suggested \\"Vanishing Point\\" became the model for other movies. I don't see it. What I do see is the sullen anti-hero of the 60's, and in a way Kowalski reminds me of the Jake Holman role portrayed by Steve McQueen in \\"Sand Pebbles\\" (1966, a few years earlier). McQueen did it better because he was probably a better actor however Barry Newman didn't have the writing he needed to work with. I mean there's a naked woman on a Honda riding in circles. What the hell is that supposed to mean?<br /><br />It's a good movie. Odd but good. Probably you're not going to say 'I forgot how great that movie was!' I will say that the 1970 Dodge that is the centerpiece of the movie is one hot car that old guys like myself still lust after. 4 stars.

B000BTC5LW|1.0|Ditto what the last reviewer said -- whomever is responsible for the utterly inept handling of this DVD release should be summarily fired.  A chimpanzee could have gotten this product out the door sooner!  And now they've missed the Christmas season -- nice work!!
B000BJS4SU|5.0|If you don't listen to this album closely, you can miss brilliant nuances. This is one of the best albums of the year. JM has enlisted 2 of most talented session musicians out there. Steve Jordan was in the first generation of the Letterman Show Band, when the show was on NBC. Pino Palladino is known from his work with Paul Young (\\"Every Time You Go Away\\")where he played fretless bass and with the Who, after John Entwhistle passed away. There are instances of going \\"off the beaten path\\" with songs on this album. Instead of straight ahead 4/4 rock/blues, on \\"Who Do You Think YOu Are\\", the beats are on the \\"and\\" of 1,2 and then on the 4, giving it a slightly \\"off\\" beat jazz/rock spin to it...
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|...but, golly, this white guy sure does rock!!!
B000BKDOCA|3.0|I probally could have waited a little to buy this but didn't.<br /><br />As anther reviewer noted, this album should have included \\"Oops! I Did it Again\\", \\"Sometimes\\", \\"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\\" and \\"Stronger\\" with at least \\"Oops\\" and \\"Stronger\\", since they were hits in the USA more so than the other two.  However, \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\" and \\"Everytime\\", though they were hits more with the UK made it onto this release, so it stands to reason that \\"Sometimes\\" and \\"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart\\" should have made the cut. Another hit song that should have made is \\"Crazy\\" which did hit hard in the USA. Also, another that should have made it would have been \\"Born To Make You Happy\\".<br /><br />Ok, for the remixes:<br /><br />\\"Toxic\\" is typical Peter Rauhofer along the lines of his work with \\"Me Against The Music\\".  Speaking of \\"Me Against The Music\\", Justice's remix for this was a nice departure from all the techno and hip-hop mixes this song has received.  Justice opts for a rockier edge and it works pretty good.  As for \\"Touch Of My Hand\\", I was a bit disappointed with Bill Hamel's handling of this one.  What I did not like about this mix it seems to skip right into the chorus from the verse unlike the album version.  As for \\"Everytime\\", this mix was ok but seemed wanting.  Perhaps an extended version of the Hi-Bias mix would have been a better choice if not the Above & Beyond Radio Remix as A&B's Club Mix is mostly instrumental.  Jason Nevin's mix of \\"Early Morning\\" is pretty good but I think it takes away from the setting of the original which is dark and perhaps very late night or early morning sounding.  Nevin's mix brightens things up thus missing the point.  As for \\"Someday I'll Understand\\" Hi-Bias takes basically the same dance-pop formula that worked well with \\"Everytime\\"; short, sweet and to the point awhile keeping the song's original feel intact.  The remix for \\"Baby One More Time\\" is pretty much a rehash of the 1999 mixes but shorter.  You know what would have really been nice for this one?  A lounge-jazz version like Britney did for here 2004 tour it would have made for a nice way to end off the album.  Alas \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\" which was. released as an import single with a 10 minute remix by Hex Hector.  This mix was shortened by 2 minutes, but why?  I think they should have put the Thunderpuss remix in all of it's splendor and glory (the full-length version) instead.<br /><br />Now as for why a lot of remix albums sound terrible, that could be because the artist's original material was not dance material.  Britney's music is pretty much dance music just waiting to be expounded on pretty much like Madonna, her idol.ter.  You know what would have really been nice for this one?

B00005ATQD|1.0|I just wasted 2.5 hours+ on this nothing film.  What a shame.  I love Kubrick's other films and was very surprised by how bad and dull this film is.  There's is almost no story, no humor, not much drama, no action, and a lot of stuff unexplained.  After this movie I felt empty, like this film.  Was Kubrick senile is his final years, as this movie is real garbage and his previous works were masterpieces.
B000BBOUU4|3.0|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is not another version of the 1971 movie.   It has nothing to do with the former movie and is supposed to be adapted from Road Dahl's novel.   However, the new movie takes a cute and imaginative children's book and begins to twist it into a weird, disturbing and slightly aggressive movie.  If the movie had dove into the idea and had created a dark movie, I would have respected the 2005 movie much more.  Yet, the movie was spineless, the center of a tug-of-war match between the dark-side and children's fantasy. <br /> Charlie and the Chocolate Factory could have been an amazing adventure for both children and children at heart, or it could have been an amusing film for those who enjoy dark humor.  The film's portrayal of Willy Wonka was that of a mysterious young man with a dark-side. This could have created a great canvas for a movie in which Wonka acts according to his personality; however, the film just flip-flops from a cheesy and generic scene of a (spoiler warning!) happy ending to a stirring character pulling his audience into a dark, disturbing world. <br /> If this movie would have firmly chosen a path, it would have been an excellent movie.  This movie can be enjoyable to children or to adults, yet does not greatly appeal to either age group.  If the movie had been created to create a land of \\"pure imagination\\", children of all ages would rave about the film for years to come.  If it had been created in order for a peculiar audience to ponder over, the movie could have created a dark enough movie to be mused over.  However, this film wasn't brave enough to choose its own category, therefore can't be completely enjoyed by many solid minds <br />
B00003XAQ6|5.0|Okay, most probably every jazz collector may have this album as part of their collection. Perhaps after many incarnations in different formats, one begins to ask why we should purchase this album once again. Is it not enough to get the digitally remastered CD? At first I was hesitant to get this new format. Because I felt that the latest CD version is good enough. But as I listened to this SACD version of this album in my friend's house I realize that the sound produced by SACD is remarkably better than the conventional CD. I immediately purchased my own SACD player and purchased this album. My enjoyment is simply indescribable in words. I will give you the technical reason why one should consider in investing on SACD. Super Audio CD uses a new and radically different technology called Direct Stream Digital (DSD) to convert music into a digital signal that can be stored on a disc. Compared to the traditional PCM method (the technology used for CD), DSD offers a much higher resolution by following more closely the original wave form of music. With a frequency response of over 100kHz and a dynamic range over 120dB across the audible frequency range - some 64 times higher resolution then CD - Super Audio CD offers music reproduction that reveals details you just can't hear on a normal CD. Of course Sketches of Spain by Miles Davis and Gil Evans is the best classically influence jazz album in the world. Many music critics say that the rendition of Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez  by Davis and Evans is the best classical piece  rendered in Jazz. As a matter of fact I do not need to elaborate why this album is great, just read the reviews from credible music critics and you will know.  If you loved this album as most of Miles Davis fans do. This is album in SACD is worth the investment even if you already own this album in any format.
B000B8QF14|3.0|Listen, Green Day sold out and entered \\"popularity\\" when they left Lookout records(look it up youngsters) not with American Idiot.  I stopped listening to them long, long ago but fondly remember there first two albums.  With American Idiot I was shocked, all there promise was back and with a message.  A great album to be sure.  Now as for this disc:  covering Operation Ivy's(argualby the most influential band on current \\"punk\\") \\"Knowledge\\" they screwed the pooch, awful.  But for the rest of the show and the passion with which they play their new music I am a cynic slightly impressed.  They sound tight and rich which is something they were never really known for.  If you are a fan I am sure you will enjoy even more than I.  But please guys don't think punk begins and ends with Green Day or blink-182 as most mention, start in the mid to late seventies in the UK and in New York, LA and trace it from there.  I think you will enjoy the journey.
0596009208|5.0|I cannot say more than the other reviewers put.  You know what? I bought this book after reading many positive reviews from this page, but still with a doubt, how does it really look like?<br /><br />When I received and opened it, I was kinda suprised.  The book does not quite look like a technical book.  It's more like..hmm..a novel or comic book, maybe?  It's really different than all of other computer-related books I own.<br /><br />Flipping page-by-page, every page has illustration, fancy bookmark/handwritten notes, and other stuff that make us really understand what the authors really try to explain.  The most I love is the \\"There is no Dumb Questions\\" at the end of each chapter, which answer questions (amazingly, most questions the author had were really questions in my mind when I was reading the chapter.  It's like the authors could read my mind :-).  Another one is the exercise/problems.<br /><br />I haven't finished reading the book, but I got addicted with this book. The authors really try hard to make their readers understand Java.

B000092Q4U|5.0|this album was definetly really good, i definetly give props to willie and mark for their quick riffs and solos...chris is an amazing f*cking drummer u can never really tell if there is even a bass player in the band becuz the rest is so loud and insane...randy knows how to scream for sure like usual..but whoever said this album above me sux... is a f*cking n*gger
B0009WFFS6|5.0|When I first watched the Cream DVD, I cried. For me it was just too excellent to see the boys at it once again. Hell, the first song I learned on the guitar was \\"I'm so Glad\\", so we go back. Still, I was a little disappointed that they had understandably lost some of that sparkle. But now that I've watched it 20+ times, in some ways I like it better. Back in the day, they were youngsters playing songs written by old black guys - TBone Hooker, Muddy Waters, Robert Johnson, etc. It was way cool then, but a little wierd to listen to their old stuff now - not to mention that the sound quality from 66-68 ain't that good. I mean, \\"Outside Woman Blues\\" from a 22 year old rock star really doesn't ring true. But when Eric sings it now, he means every word oh yeah!  The songs just seem to fit the band better, which I think is just truly astounding.  <br /> <br />I'm a big SRV fan. A friend of mine got the Cream DVD, and said he thought Eric was \\"quite possibly\\" better than Stevie. Well now, this is going to take an evening and a few beers to sus out. So we got together last week, fired up the big screen 2200 watt surround and compared SRV Austin City Limits 89 with the Cream Reonion. It really comes down to Stevie's \\"Leave My Little Girl Alone\\" versus Eric's \\"Stormy Monday Blues\\". Man, that's a hard call! But I give the edge to Stevie, because there is absolutely no question at all that SRV is meanin' what he is sayin'. But band honors go to Cream. Quite possibly there never would have been a Double Trouble power trio without Cream breaking that ground so many years before. And the combined musicianship is greater with Cream. But is this fair? They're really in the same league - we're blessed to have both Cream and Double Trouble. <br />
0767827716|4.0|I was waiting to see this movie after I read the book, because I have this thing where I have to read the book first, my imagination is at its strongest when not supported by visuals, but it was on TV all the time and I kept hearing how wicked it was and I cheated, I saw it before the book!    Well worth it; I still want to read the book, so I can weave my mind through King's web of twists and turns, but I'm glad I got to see this very popular movie.    I loved the whole retro feel; the 70s clothes and scenery. The car was also this bright tomato, something you can't take your eyes away from and I'm not even a car person. Everything felt true to time and to King.    Arnie was a geek. Sweet, awkward, bit of a klutz but nothing threatening and nothing wild.  Upon passing Christine with its For Sale sign in some stranger's backyard he is infatuated with it for life.    Everything he does revolves around it, he changes, he dresses better, and his attitude goes up a few degrees, dates a hot girl and has some bullies who want to bash what he loves the most, his car.    The car is an enigma from the beginning. We know it's a machine yet it's like a bad person, you can feel your hair raise on your arm as you watch this movie. Christine is basically a parasite, and when you give her your all, she will chew you up and spit you out, and Arnie is in the driver seat now.    Great flick, watch it!
B00005JO1J|5.0|IVE SEEN IT 5 TIMES ON BROADWAY AND 2 TIMES (ON SUNDAY it will be 3)IN THE MOVIE THEATRE.  TO SAY THE LEAST ITS ADDICTIVE.
B00005JOHU|5.0|After 25 years in West central Africa and after living through several of the wars that went on there, it was like going home to watch this movie. There were one or two items out of place but other than that it was as real as a movie of this nature can get. If anything it was not violent enough and didn't show the gross incompetence of the U.N. in stopping some of the killing of civilians that went on.
B000BPCCZA|5.0|I have to say that after Mezmerize I wasn't expecting yet another album that would musically blow me out of the water...well...I was wrong.  <br />   Hypnotize is another reason on the list of reasons why SOAD is probably one of the best bands out there today. This record has a slightly pop-ish feel to it, which doesn't lessen the quality in the least, and the messages in the catchy lyrics don't fail to reach the audience at all.  <br />   Between the disco, 80's electronica, metal, and Alt. rock flavors on the cd, with your occasional heart wrenching war-themed tune , you'll never be bored listening to it even if you're not a hardcore System fan.  <br />   As far as the DVD side goes, the Making of Mezmerize/Hypnotize was , in my opinion, done well considering the signature System style, however there was alot of Daron and not much of the other guys and there could have maybe been a little more something on there.  <br />  So in my opinion, the whole thing deserves 5 stars if only for the incredible music on the cd.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|This is just nice Enya. I had figured it would knock my socks off but so far none of the tracks has that absolute magic that some of her earlier CDs have. Perhaps the tracks will grow on me and I will revisit this review. Meanwhile, it is great music and nice to listen to.

B00008DDSC|5.0|This is not your typical Hollywood movie...that would be the understatement of the year. Lee Holloway has just gotten out of a mental institution, only to find that life on the outside is still has painful as she remembered. She copes by cutting herself with sharp objects she keeps inside of a pink box covered in butterfly stickers (a sinister and original prop). She lands a job as a secretary for a complete freak of a human being, E. Edward Grey, who delights in punishing her when she makes typos or sniffles too loudly. They flirt using red pens and dead worms. From self-mutilation to sado-masochism, this is the darkest, sexiest movie I have seen in a long time.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This album has been the best so far! she kicks butt, this cd is amazing, outstanding and the best ever I give it 5 stars for sure

B000059PQ5|4.0|In Django a laconic anti-hero drags around a crucifix incrusted coffin with a little surprise inside. Django seems to be surrounded by more Christ symbolism then I can count including a death wielding crucifix in a grave yard showdown(with symbolic red rose bush and a Catholic prayer).<br />I assume Django must represent the vengeful Christ of Revelations. This is because as Christ figure Django certainly is not of the \\"turn the other cheek\\" variety.<br /><br />Very unfortunately Franco Nero's understated anti-hero style of acting is completely ruined be thin Casper Milquetoast voice, hokey dialogue and flat sound in the English version of the film and the English version is the only one where the words seem to match the actors' mouths.  Djangos voice is far richer and fitting in the Italian dub of the film but now the words dont match the mouth. The sound effects and music and are far richer and natural in the Italian dub of the film too.<br /><br />I found that the music score in Django by Luis Bacalovis is far better then average for a none-Ennio score but the opening Django song is cliched, bombastic and belongs to a much older conventional American western style and not a spaghetti. An Ennio Morricone-like opening piece of music is definitely missed.<br /><br />Anchor Bay's DVD of Django looks and sounds only OK soI only recommend the Blue Underground Italian language version of Django as their print is the most pristine of all that I have seen. Their Italian version of the film is by far the richer and fuller. (although I did find it a bit odd watching a western dubbed in Italian where the mouths dont match the words.)<br /><br />I'd give Anchor Bay's bland English version of Django only 2 stars not for the orignal film but for the quality of the DVD print and sound.  But Blue Underground's beautiful clear Italian dubbed version rates 4 stars.
B000BO0LKY|5.0|Yes, it was certified 4x platinum. She rereleased it. Big deal. I mean... is this really something on which to waste your time writing a sad one star review? Also, Madonna, though being an INCREDIBLE singer and artist, is NOT the biggest selling female artist of all time. That title actually goes to Celine Dion- with sales of nearly 200 billion worldwide... more than ANY other female artist. Check your facts...
0553213105|5.0|This is one of my favorite books. It will bring out the hopeful romantic in anyone.
B000002KXV|5.0|<br /> <br />I can't fault the reviews on here. But one guy said EVERYTHING I was gonna say, but with one glaring omission...BASS! <br /> <br />This LP is a bass players deam, featuring Marcus Miller, Chuck Rainey AND Anthony Jackson. WHEW!  <br /> <br />Better than ANY Norah Jones.' This is the sound of finely crafted, palattable pop music, shaped out of RnB, RnR, Jazz, Soul and Blues.  <br /> <br />I usually can't bear the polished studio sheen of 80' s records, but this is fiiiiiiine. <br /> <br />The cover is an ode to legendary DJ/Broadcaster Mort Fega. <br /> <br />'Ruby Baby' is also one of my all time Faves.    <br /> <br />All in all this is what we in the biz call 'The BIZ!'
B000005Z0E|5.0|This is 2 me the 3rd best Pac Album bet it still gets 5 stars because He was the Rebel of the Underground and nobody could stop him I love this album
B000ASATWQ|4.0|WELCOME TO JAMROCK is one of the best albums of 2005, period.  It is well produced, but not overproduced as Sean Paul's 2005 release THE TRINITY tends to be at some times.  Marley combines singing, rapping, and such influences throughout the span of WELCOME TO JAMROCK.  I have taken a sudden interest in modern reggae music and I heard critics playing this album up to be very excellent, so I thought that I would listen and buy it for myself.  I am so glad that I did.<br /><br />The album opens with the track \\"Confrontation\\" which features interspersed dialogue by Marcus Garvey, lush strings, nice drum programming, and a killer reggaeton-rap by Marley.  He follows up with the slower, reggae-tinged sung \\"There For You\\" which is chilling in its overall timbre.  Here, Marley exploits his beautiful falsetto.  While the first two tracks prove to be strong hits, the best is unquestionably the political title track and first single \\"Welcome To Jamrock\\" which as a deep bass line, well produced drum programming, and very strong  vocals by Marley.  WELCOME TO JAMROCK also produces some suprise tracks with the excellent Marley/Bobby Brown collaboration on Beautiful which features a very contemporary R&B backdrop where Brown provides the background vocals.  Also, Damian samples his daddy on the very effective \\"Move!\\" using the Marley performance of \\"Exodus\\".  There are also hits in such songs as \\"The Master Has Come\\", \\"For The Babies\\", and \\"We're Gonna Make It\\", among others.  This is a very good album on many levels.  4 Stars.
B000BM6AVA|4.0|I've been a long time SOAD fan.  I loved their self-titled album when it was released in 2000 and have been hooked ever since.  Toxicity is one of the most amazing albums i've ever heard.  Steal This Album, while although it was all unreleased tracks, was very solid and had great moments.  But earlier this year they dropped the much anticipated Mezmerize on us all.  And i must admit that i was quite disappointed.  It seemed too mainstream.  As i listened to Mezmerize i realized that most of the songs didn't even have versus!  But enough of that.  I just picked up the follow-up, Hypnotize, and i must say that it's head and shoulders above Mezmerize.  From the opening staccato's of Attack to the slow ending of Soldier Side (which was a brilliant wrap up to this epic 2 album endeavor) i was engaged and impressed. <br />Some standouts for me were Attack, Hypnotize, Stealing Society, Tentative (my favorite), U-Fig, and Vicinity of Obscenity.  However, every song is solid.  I can listen to Hypnotize straight thru and not skip a single track.  SOAD is almost back to the grandeur that was Toxicity.  If they continue to tweak the formula (hopefully less Daron on vocals) i think they could get back to that lofty platform of auditory ecstasy. BUY THIS ALBUM whether you're a die hard SOAD fan or a rock/metal fan.  You won't be disappointed!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It irritates me that a large percentage of the negative reviews for this show have some kind of agenda, such as \\"This other canceled show I liked is better, you should go buy it\\" or \\"The fans of this show are artificially inflating its reviews.\\"  See, they're not artificially inflating reviews; they LIKE it because it is GOOD, and they review it as such.  That would be how reviews work. <br /> <br />This series wasn't always the most polished that it could have been, and it had some plot flaws. The acting wasn't great, but it had some really powerful moments.  But every TV series has its flaws, and the strong points of this show make up for these minor issues. <br /> <br />But it had some of the most brilliant creativity of any show aired in the past five years.  The idea of taking elements that had *all* been done before and combining them in ways that made it feel fresh and new was brilliant.  By cutting and pasting things from other genres and time periods, everything felt more genuine.  The really amazing element of this show is that Whedon and Minear managed to take the right pieces of each genre such that they would blend well. <br /> <br />This is a show that makes one question morality, that makes one question belief, and that brings a lot of humor and action along with it.  The lines are witty, and the lesson in the end is that the only person who can guide you is yourself- every character, from the captain to the prostitute to the preacher, learns this at one point or another.  It's not about putting forward an agenda; it's about learning that agendas are just ways for other people to tell you what to think. <br /> <br />You shouldn't buy this show because of my review.  I think it was awesome; you might not.  You should buy this show if you are interested in it and think it could be a lot of fun.  It is as-advertised; a Western in Space.  If you don't like westerns, if you don't like sci-fi, don't go for it.  You won't like it.  If you like either of these things, or both of them, you'll have a good time.  Don't look for me to tell you what to think about it; the series speaks for itself.
B000075BFK|4.0|But no disrespect I would have to say this is the best Pac album after he died one CD he is mad and the other he is in his all eyes on me faze(in love and Peaceful) Good CD
0307276902|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  I highly recommend it to everyone who wants to know what it's like to be in the mind of an addict.  It is written with such truth!
B000B5XZLU|4.0|A Masterpiece! They have never sounded more better,inventive, lush, deep, and funky. I love the fusion of Jazz,House,AcidJazz,Disco,Rock,Symphony,R&B,Hip-Hop,and perhaps a touch of Gospel? Again, this is what Jamiroquai does best - they are able to fuse all these musical styles with ease. I especially love the title track, Dynamite, and Starchild, but ALL of the songs have been crafted with excellence and a certain sound that I cannot yet describle musically, perhaps because nobody else has come up with such a unique blend of artistry, the sound is futuristic but also reminiscent. Very hard to pull off, but very enjoyable to hear if it's done right, as is the case with this album. Yay for Jay-K! Jay-K is the new Stevie Wonder. If you have any doubt that this is true, you should listen to Time Won't Wait. On this track, Jay-K has a certain soulful growl that more than compliments the strong back-up vocals, and on Seven Days in Sunny June and World That He Wants, you can hear a new maturity combined with thoughtful, deep, melancholy lyrics.  Also, (Don't) Give Hate A Chance is destined to be a dancefloor classic and anthem - and most deservedly so.  The album is spectacular. Do yourself a favor and buy it. Tell all your friends.
0307276902|4.0|This book will have you staying up late reading on to find out what happens next. James Frey's relationships with Leonard is amazing, he was able to go from yelling at him for getting involved in his life, to becoming something that is priceless. The way James Frey was able to relate and live with the other patients, was really admirable. During a period of time, James was living with a judge Seeing as how James was/is a criminal, you would think that living with a judge would be a little wierd. But, this turned out to do some good for James. I think one of the major reasons that James stayed a patient was because of Lilly. He didn't want to leave Lilly by herself, they needed eachother and that's what helped them throught the whole thing. This is the book that will help you keep yourself in check. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more about what it is like to be a drug addict, but keep in mind that there are some rather graphic parts.
B000AOEN2C|1.0|I am an avid Star Trek fan, having watched the original series as a young teen.  I have found two of the series, DS9 and Enterprise, to be hack writing that seemed intended to slap a \\"Star Trek\\" label on swill and sell it to the public.<br /><br />Enterprise was doomed by bad writing with none of the original thought or vision that the original series or TNG had, and, to some extent, Voyager (Voyager's strength was good writing, good adventure, character development and maturation of the Borg).<br /><br />I can't tell if the actors on Enterprise were very good or not because I think they were given such corny, cheezy material to use by the writers.  The writers were usually, I believe, the producers, and I wonder if they were \\"double dipping\\" to supplement their paycheck (getting income from the script writing) rather than trying to produce an excellent SciFi series with radical, ground-breaking new ideas.<br /><br />While there were a few clique shows intending to oppose gay bashing, support HIV research, etc., all this has been over done (and done better) by others.  Star Trek is supposed to original, not \\"me, too.\\"<br /><br />In short, this series (and I kept hopefully watching every episode) is, in my opinion, a disgrace to Gene Roddenberry, his family, and the vision of Star Trek.  It has the distinction of being the only Star Trek series, since the original, to be canceled before seven years, and the planned finale (the original seies from the 60s was canceled due to a total lack of vision of the management, from what I can tell, not due to lack of quality).<br /><br />I hope that, should the Star Trek genre be salvagable at this point, an honest, thorough critique of what went wrong with Enterprise (and DS9, in my opinion, for that matter) will be done to prevent these mistakes in future work and to return to the original creativity and vision intended by Roddenberry.
B0001HAISG|4.0|When thinking about P. J. Hogan's Peter Pan, many would think that the important character is Peter Pan.  But, it is really Wendy who is the major character going through the most changes.  Throughout the film, Wendy begins to discover herself emotionally and sexually.  P. J. Hogan secretly puts this into film and it is not easily discovered.  This film review will convey why Wendy is at a loss of innocence in her life. <br /> Compared to the Disney film Peter Pan, the film is much more suggestive that Wendy is growing up and losing her innocence.  When Peter found out that Wendy must grow up, he invites her to Never Land.  When Wendy agreed to go, she had no idea she was losing her innocence, as well as her chance to grow up.   <br /> After arriving in Never Land, Wendy soon becomes infatuated with Peter.  She is interested in him romantically.  Wendy has never liked a boy the way she liked Peter, therefore, Wendy is losing her innocence in Never Land.  She finds secret ways to tell Peter that she likes him.  She even disguises the word \\"kiss\\", so that Peter does not know what she is talking about.   <br />In the Disney classic, Peter and Wendy are just playmates. But, in Hogan's version, they are much more.  At the end of the film, Wendy does kiss Peter and he kisses her back.  After the kiss, Wendy knows it is now time to grow up.  It can be easily said, that Wendy finding herself emotionally and sexually is why she decided it was okay to grow up.  That is also the reason why Wendy's childhood innocence is now gone and she became a young lady.   <br />
B000002VCZ|5.0|A transition from the style of Eye and Ammonia, this disc foretold the musical style that was to follow in '85 with Stereotomy. If you listen to the title cut, it really has an 'Urbania' feel to it even though it's not an instrumental song. It's actually one of the best Lenny Zakatek tunes in the Parsons catalog. There is a shift apparent on this disc and I believe it was much needed and well done. The only song that doesn't score big is ironically Hawkeye, the lone instumental. Usually the Parsons instrumentals are the best reason to pick up the newest disc, that is not the case with this disc. Still, I do enjoy VC and it is probably in the top 5 of my fave Parson's discs.
B000002J1U|4.0|Most fans recognize Led Zeppelin for their classic hardrock blues sound. Their two first albums were grounbreaking for Rock music. They followed similar, smashing Rock N' Roll style that gathered huge number of fans for the band. However, with their third studio album, \\"III\\", Led Zeppelin proves They can play not only Rock N' Roll; What We've got here is generally bunch of soft, acoustic ballad tunes, mixed with a few rockers and experimental tunes. <br /> <br />Reviews on \\"III\\" are mixed; Some say this is a disasterous album; the others say this is a masterpiece. From my personal experience I can say that at first time I didn't like this album. But after a few listens it caught my attention. I cannot say it's my favourite Led Zeppelin album, but it is still great piece of work. <br /> <br />As I mentioned before, \\"III\\" is mixed stuff. There are mostly acoustic tunes here. But songs like \\"Immigrant Song\\", \\"Out On The Tiles\\", \\"Celebration Day\\" are raunchy rockers that clearly show these guys didn't stop playing blues-rock. \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" is excellent, lengthy and melancholic bluesy tune with stellar guitar work from Jimmy Page. This song thrills Me every time I listen to it. \\"Gallows Pole\\" is propably my favourite on this set. An acoustic folk-rocker, extremely catchy and cool. A minor Led Zeppelin gem. \\"Tangerine\\" and \\"That's The Way\\" are mellow, sad and soft tunes, with recognizable folk guitar riffs. \\"Friends\\", \\"Bron Y-Aur Stomp\\" are another excellent catchy acoustic tunes. Finally, \\"Hats Of To Roy Harper\\", a bit twisted blues cover, closes the album. Personally, I think it's a funny and interesting tune, though most reviewers here describe it as dull, bizzare, etc. Just listen to it and form Your own opinion. <br /> <br />If I'd have to make an overall mark, I think this a really good album. It may not be Led Zeppelin strongest release, but it doesn't mean it's bad. Definetly worth checking out. <br /> <br />
B000A7Q2DM|1.0|Great album, 4 stars for content, but only 1 star overall and I'd give it a zero if possible for copy protection.  Please, for heavens sake, don't buy copy protected CD's like this one that prevent you from exercising your RIGHT to FAIR USE.
B000067J1H|5.0|\\"If I could wake up in a different place, at a different time, could I wake up as a different person?\\" <br /> <br />This is the question Jack, played by Edward Norton, asks himself in this excellent movie. Jack is like a slave to his deadening job at the office and has a cynical view of the world. He is trying to find a way to deal with his insomnia, caused by his discontent about everything in life. At first, he finds this in visiting support groups. Every week he visits different support groups and finds a way to release his tension by crying. This is until Marla Singer, played by Helena Bonham Carter, shows up at every support group. Jack can no longer concentrate and therefore he needs an alternative for these support groups.  <br />He meets Tyler, played by Brad Pitt, and finds in him everything he is not; he has found his alter ego. Tyler is a sort of bad-guy, who is exceptionally convincing and confident and who has everything figured out. Together, Jack and Tyler start 'Fight Club'; groups of men fighting each other in a basement. These men are also fed up with society and by fighting they can get rid of their fear and hate. <br />This gets out of control when Fight Club, led by Tyler, changes into an well organised fighting-machine which sabotages society. <br />Jack develops moral doubts about Fight Club, but Tyler seems to get more and more extreme in this situation.  <br />At this point the movie starts to change into a psychological thriller, which makes it so good. The twist at the end is unexpected and is a very strong scene. Despite its humour, the movie comes across frighteningly serious. I guess that, and the superb acting of Norton and Pitt, is what makes people want to see it again and again.  <br />

0553801503|5.0|It's true, this novel is slow paced...is almost all intrigues and movements of players we have previously gotten little information on.  To me it's all fascinating.  For me, Martin has earned the right to a set-up book.  I would never advocate this much preparation for an introduction to a series. A book should start off with a bang, I think, but in-spite of Martin's low-key approach to this chapter, he has created such a rich world, such an intricate political tapestry that I was never bored.  The ending definitely kicks into old form though, and I won't say there isn't a contrast between stories...only that this one is still worth 5 stars, and will fit significantly into the whole. <br /> <br />I also like the split.  I like the shadows cast by the characters that we've previously read about, upon the Westeros landscape, as they all take on legendary significance.   <br /> <br />But Martin's story is bigger than any character, as we've all known for some time, and this book proves this further, by introducing a new cast of viewpoints that are all very interesting and all feel very relevent in the movement towards whatever it is that may yet come.
B000002NG7|4.0|The last Faith No More is also one of their best.  They evolved into a high-quality songwriting machine by this point, almost every song here has depth, melody, and charisma.  It's a mature sound never before heard on any of their previous records, perhaps because they knew the end was near and didn't want to go out on a chaotic note.  Standouts are the incredible  \\"Stripsearch,\\" \\"Helpless,\\" \\"Mouth to Mouth\\" and \\"Collision.\\"  Good stuff, check it out.
B00004BZ16|5.0|I said that London Calling set The Clash apart from all the other punk bands. Well Sandinista! sets The Clash apart from EVERY band. They try absolutely everything. Now with most bands, the \\"experimental\\" effort is regarded as the worst, and many Clash fans follow the trend and say that Sandinista! is rubbish. I'm astounded every time I'm told that. Sandinista! is the most beautiful musical creation I've heard, and not only do The Clash try everything, they do it with great enthusiasm and make everything sound great. Well...about everything, by the time you get to L.P. 3, some of it is just too much, but at least they tried. Sometimes to me it seems unnecessary to include the numerous dubs, but they are in fact very enjoyable. Sandinista! is an album that cannot be compared to anything else and an album that must be listened to by everybody. By far The Clash's best effort, no matter how good \\"White Riot\\" or \\"Train in Vain\\" is. <br />HIghlights: The Magnificent Seven, Hitsville U.K., Junco Partner, Ivan Meets G.I.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|For those looking for an intelligent television series that features excellent character development, wonderful writing, and a compelling storyline - Here it is.  A testament that something wonderful can come out of the wasteland that is mainstream television.  In its short time of being on the air \\"Firefly\\" proved to be one of the greatest science fiction shows television has seen.  It's a terrible shame it was cancelled after only fourteen episodes.   <br /> <br />In the few episodes that were made each of the nine passengers on board the spaceship Serenity is developed and shown to have an interesting history, though the most compelling may be that of River, the genius experimented upon by the government, and her brother Simon, who sacrifices his career as a doctor to save her.   <br /> <br />Each episode is exciting and serves to advance the story, avoiding the cliches of so many other science fiction series.  In the end, it left us with many tantalizing mysteries, some which were answered by the great follow-up film \\"Serenity,\\" and some which were not.   <br /> <br />I've since found a few highly entertaining and intelligent series such as \\"Lost,\\" \\"Veronica Mars,\\" and \\"Arrested Development\\" - but they'll never be able to take the place of \\"Firefly.\\"
1594200653|1.0|I was expecting much more from this book. Unfortunately, I must concur with the _Economist_ review that it is too long and has little new to offer. No doubt it will be used as a textbook- probably by Judt's students- but it is just a rehash.
1401307450|4.0|Just finished reading this book and I am still feeling uneasy. This story reveals some shocking truths about a band I have loved for almost two decades. I had no idea that Kiedis was such a junkie and a self-centered jerk. Right from early childhood, Kiedis lived for instant gratification and anyone who stood in his way was bullied or beaten. His drug-dealing father left Anthony to raise himself amidst the lunacy of their household, so Anthony became a kid who took what he wanted. In most respects, Kiedis never grew into an adult - he perpetually lives as a child who takes what he wants regardless of the consequences.<br /><br />I knew he had dabbled in drugs - or so I thought - but I was shocked to read that Kiedis is a full-on junkie. Nothing glamorous, just straight out a skid row junkie. The only difference between him and regular bums is that Kiedis somehow managed to have periods where he could work with his band, sometimes sober but often times not.<br /><br />For most of his life he has no fixed address, no bank account, and his daily goal is to get high. I don't know how he managed to live like this and A) never get arrested and B) look healthy in the public eye. Kiedis talks about wasting away and being a living skeleton but he never appeared that way in videos, promos, tour clips, etc. In fact he always came across as the healthy one of the band.<br /><br />Also had no idea that the band members barely talk(ed) to one another - they always came off as best friends but apparently that ended years and years ago. The way Kiedis tells it - these guys just happen to rock out but their friendships stopped being close long ago.<br /><br />The book is very detailed with most of Anthony's life, going over all his drug abuse and sexual encounters. But then the book gets very general and almost skims over the sober years since John rejoined the band. I wish there was more to read about how the Chillis make their music and how Kiedis lives his life now.<br /><br />It baffles me that a band that I have loved for so long has so many awful problems. How was Kiedis able to contribute to the band when he was junked out in crack hotels for days / weeks at a time? I don't get it. After reading this book, I feel deflated. Kiedis is lucky to be alive and AIDS free. Other than that, it is a mystery that the RHCP have been able to make such incredible music. By this account, they should have imploded years ago.<br /><br />One great thing about this book is the level of details discussed. I can't remember things I have done in the past year, so the lucid descriptions of Anthony's past are fantastic. Anyway, I think the book is a great read. It is well written and it gives some insight into the life of a modern music star.loved for so long has so many awful problems.

B00004BZ0N|5.0|\\"London Calling\\" is often considered The Clash's masterpiece, and it is a very amazing album. Blending ska, reggae, jazz, rockabilly into their sound, The Clash create14 very interesting songs and 5 better-than-average fillers. This album sets The Clash apart from it's two punk rock counter-parts, The Ramones and The Sex Pistols. The biggest experimentation those bands did was maybe play four chords instead of three, and in my eyes both are overrated rubbish. <br />Anyways back to The Clash, it's not only great that they could explore this many kinds of music, but that they do it with such enthusiasm and make it sound so darn good. \\"The Guns of Brixton\\" sounds like it could be straight out of Jamaica, while \\"Brand New Cadillac\\" sounds like it was on the radio in the 1950s, not on The Clash's third L.P. in 1979. And Hateful, that's the most catchy song I've ever heard, aside from Train in Vain, the Clash's \\"big radio hit\\" at the time. very splendid. <br />Highlights: London Calling, Jimmy Jazz, Hateful, Lost in the Supermarket, the Clampdown, The Guns of Brixton, Train in Vain.
B00005JO1P|4.0|\\"Walk the Line\\" is the story of Johnny Cash from his childhood in 1944 to the late 1960s.  As a child, we see two people that shaped his life: his brother and his father.  Skip ahead ten years, and Johnny Cash (Phoenix) is married to his wife, Viv (Goodwin), and has started a band.  After getting a record deal, he finds himself on tour with Jerry Lee Lewis and June Carter (Witherspoon).  Along the way he finds drugs, which threaten his newfound popularity, and he falls in love with June, which just may save him.<br /><br />Both Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon give excellent performances, sounding and acting just like the stars that they are portraying.  Phoenix is as good, if not better than Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles in last year's \\"Ray\\".  The story is well told, and it is interesting to see the events that shaped Cash's life, and made him who he is.  Whether you are a Johnny Cash fan or not, \\"Walk the Line\\" is a highly entertaining and well made movie that is worth seeing.
0743490304|4.0|What can I say, I loved this book and I thought it was great entertainment!<br /><br />NASA is on the ropes when failure after failure has them dodging budget bullets and having to justify the dollars for every project.  The President, who just happens to believe in the noble cause of space exploration and the independence of that organization, is up for reelection and his challenger is gaining ground in the polls by making NASA and its existence an issue in the election.<br /><br />Now, looking down from outer space and literally out of the blue, NASA discovers a 190 million year old meteorite buried under two hundred feet of ice in the Artic.  The meteorite, once it is raised to the surface, shows evidence of extraterrestrial life OR does it? Is this a big win for NASA and the President, just in time for the election, or not?<br /><br />Nothing is as it seems.  But Rachel Sexton, someone who believes in this President, and writes intelligence briefs for the White House, is going to risk life and limb in an effort to discover the truth.  And she's not going to let the fact that she also happens to be the daughter of the President's primary challenger, get in the way.<br /><br />Suspend your disbelief for a couple days, kick back, and have fun reading this book. Dan Brown tells a good story, plain and simple.

Definitely worth it!
B000056K04|3.0|I must admit, I wasn't a fan of Dave Matthews band early on, when everyone else was raving about this act when they erupted in the early 90's. I may still not be a fan, as it were, but I do appreciate good music and that's what I found on their 2001 offering \\"Everyday\\".  <br /> <br />It sits in my CD collection among my eclectic mix of music from the 70's to now, which includes such notables as Ah-Ha, Tears for Fears, Joe Jackson, Tom T. Hall, George Harrison, Sting, Rush, Alan Jackson, and many others, even the Monkees and Bob Marley. \\"Everyday\\" was recommended by a friend, and I liked it.  <br /> <br />It is crisp, well produced, and features outstanding musicianship alongside Matthews' well seasoned, inarguably original vocal style, which is especially pleasing during harmonies. His vocal style does offer qualities I'm not a great fan of, such as the \\"sexy\\" growl that serves as a wind-up to certain words in some songs. That style annoys me to no end, especially when it's abused by guys like Enrique Iglesias. Another quality is the yodel range he gets into for certain notes. Not too bad, but I'm not bothered as much by it when I hear Chris Martin of Coldplay do the same thing.  <br /> <br />Thankfully Dave Matthews uses these stylings fairly infrequently on this CD. Not as much as his earlier efforts anyway. That's why I was never a big fan, but on the whole \\"Everyday\\" is a great collection of songs with enough twists and turns to keep most rock music fans happy.  <br /> <br />Because of this CD I will sample another from Dave Matthews Band to see what else they have in store.
B000BBOUU4|1.0|I watched this with an open mind. I admit that I loved the original, but I gave this a chance. I am a fan of well-styled special effects so I thought it might be fun to see how professional computer graphics specialists rendered the chocolate factory. It was much more than a disappointment. First of all Johnny Depp was not likeable at all. Now, I know the book portrays Wonka as colder than Wilder's depiction in the earlier film, but in reading the book, you get a sense that Wonka cares about his factory, the oompa loompas and what's to become of his business. None of that here. Depp is just a lunatic who doesn't even seem to care about his business. Awful. The factory design is atrocious - it looks like the designers for DOOM were put on this project after creating a dismal depressing video game atmosphere. It is not inviting at all. Remember, Charlie is supposed to think this is the greatest place in the world, a place where his family could live and be happy. This chocolate factory is neither. Do yoursef a favor and do not see this film.
B000BYY0RY|5.0|Hello, I too have been a huge Kylie fan from the late 80's and traveled from the states to London to see Kylie perform.  Bottomline, the concert is worth every penny!!!  It is 2 hours of non-stop dazzle,lights, dancing, singing, and FUN! Everyone in the audience stood up the ENTIRE 2 hours while she was performing! I only wished she would perform in the states b/c many of her US fans are missing out on what a REALLY concert should be about...live singing, audience dancing in the aisles, lots of fun, lots of smiling happy people singing along, audience participation, diversed crowd, and the very best production, staging, and PERFORMANCE!  Kylie really knows her fans and absolutely delivered-100%!!!  She isn't a diva! She is an awesome performer!!! Kylie's music is fun pop but is lyrically mature, at times sexy & seductive,and inspirational: it's about personal triumphs and revelations, love/heartache, changes,& enjoying life. The best thing about this concert is that Kylie is able to really \\"connect\\" with the audience!!!  Enjoy yourself!
B00004TS0E|2.0|I actually saw the remake before I ever saw the orignal... and after seeing this movie I couldn't help but be amazed out how bad it is...  Now, that I have seen the orginal I know exactly what this movie lacks.  The remake of such a classice was 110% unnecessary and it's easy to see why it was remade- the directors and produces knew that fans of the orginal and the book would stand by this movie...<br /><br />Richard Attenborough although an extraordinary actor- is a horrible- with such deep lines their was really no real wimsy or kindness you saw from the first... he seemed to be almost to deep to be believed. Susie played by Mara seemed to be a natural choice for the serious actress. But, she seems to have little to no change in her manners in this movie. So feel as though their is no real change. Her mother seems to unnecessarily stern and cross seeing with her daughter is like watching some kind of twisted form of child abuse. Making you believe she is delierabately cruel to her own child. Mr. Walker and her seem to have little to no connection on screen and seem to live in mutual self-hatred towards one another.<br /><br />While the whole point of the orginal was to show the change is Susie due to her new belief this one is not echoed in this. More about corporate takeovers and the battle for Santa Clause- it emphasies no real change in Mara or her mother- in fact you come to believe that the belief and faith they have just gained is really nothing.<br /><br />This movie really is not a miracle... and it's not a remake that will ever be able to stand on it's own. Judging by the reviews some people are bound to like it. But, watching it for me is kind of boring... it lacks the magic that you see that in the first...it dosn't show the power of faith or belief so, this is definately a holiday movie I'd skip this Christmas. Rent or buy the orginal- and forget about this diaster on 34th Street.
B00005JNQA|1.0|This happens to be the worst movie I have seen in a long time. The plot meanders everywhere, the actors are stiff as boards, and even when they do show some acting ability, there is not enough direction to create any character development. Finally, until one explosive moment there is no action to speak of. I actually fell asleep during the movie and had to be awakened because my snoring was louder than the vapid dialogue.    If I were Sean Penn I would be embarrassed - he is truly a good actor who probably was too awestruck by the usually great Sydney Pollack to complain. Nicole Kidman - sorry but I can't see you in this role. You are not weathered enough.    Plot has so many holes and unbelievable sequences. How can a single person be allowed to float around the UN building during at any time of the day and end up overhearing news that will shake the world ... in a rare language no less? Come on!!!     The one star I gave it is for the banter I had with my fellow viewers making fun of this garbage. I am thankful that I rented this as a $40 trip to the theater would have been too painful!    Do yourselves a favor and skip this unless you enjoy poking fun at poor cinema.

B000AP04OM|4.0|There was really no need for another release, and I hope I'm not the only one who's getting sick of stupid re-releases of DVDs already out, with just one extra bit on them. It's not necessary. Apart from this, I've already seen a 15th anniversary edition of Pretty Woman, fabulous, unless you already own the 10th anniversary edition.<br /><br />Much as I love this film, if you already own the previous DVD, then there's no point buying this. If you haven't seen the film, or haven't bought the DVD already, maybe thinking about buying it for a member of your family, for Christmas, then sure, go for it.<br /><br />OK, there's a few more extras on this, than the previous release. On this one, you have: commentaries by director Robert Wise, Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, Charmian Carr, choreographer Dee Dee Wood, and Johannes Von Trapp; introduction by Julie Andrews on both discs; separate chapter list for songs only with Play All feature; English, French, and Spanish sing-a-long subtitles; A Few of My Favorite Things: A retrospective documentary; Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer: A Reminiscence; Charmian Carr on location with The Sound of Music from Liesl to Gretl: A 40th Anniversary Reunion; When You Know the Notes to Sing: A Sing-Along Phenomenon; Biography: The Von Trapp Family--Harmony and Discord; Restoration comparison; storyboard gallery; behind-the-scenes stills; lobby cards and one-sheets; screen test: Mia Farrow; and Trailers and TV spots: Theatrical teaser, Theatrical trailer, 1st Anniversary trailer, Academy Award trailer, 1973 reissue trailer, testimonial trailer, TV trailer.<br /><br />On the old edition you have: Original 1965 documentary Salzburg Sight and Sound (14 minutes); making of documentary The Sound of Music: From Fact to Phenomenon with cast interviews, rare music outtakes, photos and more! (87 minutes); audio supplement by Ernest Lehman; audio Interviews with Julie Andrews and Robert Wise; DVD-ROM games and links to fan site; storyboards, sketches, production stills and theatrical trailers, radio and TV spots.<br /><br />OK, so there's more on the new release, but do you really want to pay for it, when you're probably not that interested in watching the extras? I wouldn't. And as for the singalong bit, with the words going across the bottom of the screen, if you've seen the film enough times, then you'll already know the words off by heart!

158234082X|1.0|This would not be the valedictorian's address, it is rather the bottom feeder's look on the \\"culinary industry\\".  The book is full of poor taste gossip, unnecessary sex and pointless narrative.  I do not consider it a culinary book.
B00005JKG7|3.0|After watching the lack-lustre 2005 remake of Carpenter's \\"The Fog\\", I quickly ran to my nearest television set and inserted this DVD into my DVD player just so I can recall the days when horror film's were made without the over-use of annoying CGI.<br /><br />This film (along with that other Carpenter film, whats-its-name?) is a testament to the fact that you do not need a $30 million dollar budget to create an effective scary ghost movie. There is no CGI here only talent, mood, a great location and a creepy story.<br /><br />The story takes place in Antonio Bay. A depressingly gloomy but charming seaside town whose inhabitants become the victims of a thick, glowing fog carrying the angry ghosts of lepers who were killed in a shipwreck a century earlier. What makes this ghost story original in my opinion is that the ghosts depicted here are not transparent, floating phantasms that move objects and say \\"boo\\". They are walking dead guys, covered in rags, dripping in salt water and armed with knives, hooks, swords and possibly every other sharp, metallic object you can think of and simply slice up their unfortunate victims.<br /><br />The cast is first-rate. The stand-out performer is Carpenter's then-wife, Adrienne Barbeau who plays Stevie Wayne. A sexy radio disc-jockey who becomes trapped inside a light-house while the rest of the cast seeks refuge in an old church outside of town. Scream-Queens Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh and Nancy Loomis co-star as the other luck-less female victims and put their screaming talents to good use. The legendary John Houseman makes a great cameo appearance in the opening sequence, setting the creepy tone and the man sure knows how to tell a tale. The great cast, the location, the creative fog effects and a simple yet effective Carpenter score all contribute in making this low-budget chiller a clear winner.<br /><br />However, it should be stated that \\"The Fog\\" is not perfect. Despite a chilling first 20 minutes, the film takes its time in building its tension and therefore drags a bit. And even those who love this movie will admit that it's not as effective as Carpenter's \\"Halloween\\" and under close inspection, plot holes become too apparent. But us fans don't seem to care since we all know that this film is not intended to be taken too seriously. It's about a killer fog for crying out loud. Anyone approaching this for realism needs to re-evaluate their criteria for viewing horror movies since many of these genre films are simply made to entertain (and to scare the pants off you) and if you are a horror fan (like I am) you should find plenty to like here. By combining several different branches off the horror genre and using it to great effect, \\"The Fog\\" is a combination of such classics as \\"Halloween\\" and \\"Night of the Living Dead\\".<br /><br />So forget all of this CGI stuff for a minute and see what a true horror movie should really be like. \\"The Fog\\" is simple yet deeply chilling and atmospheric. Follow it with Carpenter's ultimate classic (you know which movie I'm talking about) and double your pleasure.<br /><br />There's a reason why this low-budget shocker is so beloved by fans of the genre. Recommended.<br /><br />3.5 out of 5.ime in building its tension and therefore drags a bit.

B00005JNQA|3.0|The movie neither stalls, nor leaps ahead.<br /><br />The major problems with this movie are that the characters are totally one dimensional and the plot is absurd.<br /><br />You are transported to a world where the UN is not the author of child rapes, food for oil scandals, and a general fund for 3rd world dictators as is well known to everyone.<br /><br />Instead in this fictional world we are treated to an opening where France wanes eloquent about moral issues confronting the not so free world which it created and continues to propogate, the US is of course and at a best an uncaring bully, and the UN is the hope for all oppressed people everywhere.<br /><br />This movie is really nothing more than another trip for Sean Penn to Iraq, but this time he gets to make full use of hollywierds revionist story telling skills.<br /><br />At the end of the film I was fairly bored and completely unsurprised and unimpressed as usual with the typical drivel these left leaning pedantic preofessional underachievers seem to churn out these days.
B00009UW0N|5.0|This low-budget film became a massive hit when first released back in the late 70's and time has done nothing to diminish its impact and popularity. It spawned countless imitations and inferior sequels but accept no substitute, HALLOWEEN reigns supreme as the ultimate in the slasher genre and John Carpenter has never been able to surpass it's brilliance.<br /><br />The story is rather simple. A young boy brutally butcher's his sister in Haddonfield. Years later, he returns bigger and badder than ever and for no apparent reason, targets a young babysitter (Jamie Lee Curtis in one of her best performances) and her colorful, troublemaking friends.<br /><br />Unlike its sequels, HALLOWEEN lacks intense gore. There is hardly any of the red stuff on display. Okay, so maybe there is but not to the degree you might expect. Despite this, it's still a hundred times more effective than it's countless imitator's and what it lacks in the gore department, it more than makes up for it in suspense. The film starts off with a brutal killing and then mellows down quite a bit. It slowly takes it's time to build up the tension and thanks largely to the clever script and slick performances, it never looses its target audience like so many other horror movies do. We are kept glued to the screen right up until the chilling climax. And let's not forget Carpenter's eerie score which has become as iconic as his enigmatic killer.<br /><br />Another reason why this film works so well in my opinion, is because it does not try to explain every little detail. Movies of today try to explain too much and it kills (no pun intended) the overall mood. They may be loaded with screams and gore but there is little to no mystery.  And a little bit of mystery never hurts a film. There really isn't a reason for the killer's vicious attack on these unsuspecting girls. But does there have to be one? Let the audience try and figure out the motivation behind Michael Myer's rage against mankind.<br /><br />So for the few out there who have not yet experienced the eerie magic of HALLOWEEN, what are you waiting for? Slasher films of today have not been able to top Carpenter's classic tale of bloodshed and tormented babysitter's.<br /><br />HALLOWEEN deserves to be in everybody's DVD collection. Highly recommended and pleasant dreams.have not yet experienced the eerie magic of HALLOWEEN, what are you waiting for?

B000065BPB|4.0|Very clean sound with a flat response across the frequency spectrum. The closed back design blocks out surrounding sounds reasonably well. I use it with an iPod from time to time and they do need more power to drive them than the supplied earphones. They apply a lot of pressure on the head and can't be used for extended periods of time. If the cable moves or hits against other surfaces, the sound it conducted to the ear cups and that be heard very clearly - therefore one needs to sit quite still while using these.
0446364495|2.0|I love romance novels. I love reading Mills and Boon as well as Avon romances. This wasn't a romance novel. It was pointless. Let me save you from having to read it:-<br /><br />* The first 20 or so pages detail the main hero's life. I will sum it up for you: he is a photographer. He travels. He has no one in his life.<br /><br />* Next 100 or so pages detail four days he spends with a middle aged married woman. They cook dinner. They dance. They have sex.  Then the story goes on about how they never see eachother again, yet pine for each other alot. They die.<br /><br />* Last 30 pages detail her children discovering about her affair, and about a musician who met him.<br /><br />Thank goodness the book is only short!<br /><br />I would recomend this to middle aged women who feel like they are in a rut.
B0000TB01Y|1.0|A 5 star review means the BEST. Sorry, this musical doesn't even come close. When you're throwing 5 star ratings around, you're throwing them in the direction of My Fair Lady, South Pacific, Phantom of the Opera, Oklahoma, Hello Dolly, and many musical scores more. Who do all these 5 star raters think they're trying to kid! They must all be members of the cast.    If this musical is noted for anything, it's for the most un-memorable music I've ever heard in a Broadway musical. It's lucky to get a 1 star from me.
1400031087|1.0|this review is going to go all over place because there was so much I hated... <br /> <br />Everyone keeps talking about how they couldn't put it down & they loved Frey's writing style, but I disagree.  I found his writing annoying and boring, and I found myself struggling to finish each chapter.  He couldn't go a page without trying to sound so profound.  None of it felt honest, it just felt glorified and amateur.  I wasn't rooting for James to win because I didn't like him as a person. <br /> <br />Frey's time in rehab felt like a waste.  He didn't utilize any of the tools presented to him by the people who worked there.  He basically spent his time thinking, eating, and sleeping.  If he is so self-sufficient what the hell did he need rehab for?  The only thing that made his time spent there wortwhile were the friendships he formed, which enabled him to unrealistically serve less time in jail than he deserved (Leonard was freaking weird! \\"Ooh yes, call me daddy, baby\\"), but other than that it seemed like all Frey needed to combat a lifetime of disease was a little time away from the substances he abused.  I don't think he needed to go to an extremely expensive rehabilitation center so he could refuse almost all their forms of treatment.  He just needed to be detained.   <br /> <br /> <br />I didn't like his unhealthy romance with weak little Lilly either, and her suicide was totally expected.  Yet I don't understand how, if he depended on her as much as it seemed like he did, he's still alive today.  In each other, they were replacing one addiction with another & the whole scene where he goes to save her from a crackhouse is totally pointless (as is their entire subplot) if she ends up dead anyway.   <br /> <br />I am an atheist who hates authority and conformists myself :P, but even I found James Frey's attitude toward the 12 Steps and religion annoying.  He ignored all the statistics and people he came to trust (Joanne) and belitted methods that have been provento work because he was too stubborn and too full of pride to think that maybe someone besides himself knows all the answers.  Joanne was quite dislikable too, by the way.  They way she \\"understood\\" James and \\"respected\\" James even though he gave her no reason to.  Ugh.  Fools.  I'm done. <br /> <br />Oprah gets 1 star too.  She sucks.   <br /> <br />
B00005JO1J|5.0|My best friend and I have seen the play the first time it came to Minnesota back in 1997. We had since three times a year since. It has become our thing. I am even having some of the songs played during my wedding ceremony. So needless to say I have been in love with this production before I saw the movie. <br /> We went and saw it on opening night. Besides having teenage girls (I am only 24 I feel old) giggling and talking behind the whole movie. I enjoyed it. It did seem long at times; especially when you were waiting for them to sing they sang you know should go there. But I loved how Chris Columbus organized the movie having gone throughout the entire year. One thing was unlike seeing the play you couldn't sing a long without getting shhh! Today for me sung by Angel seemed a little dry, maybe because we were so used to dancing along. Viva La Boheme was really good a lot of energy. I guess the energy is what is expected in a movie. There will always be more energy at the play when you see them in person. <br /> It gave more depth to characters I have been following for eight years, which was nice. I knew I loved Jesse L. Martin in Law and Order, but that boy can sing and it just makes me like him more. Rosario Dawson filled the shoes of Mimi wonderfully. Even though I wasn't used to her voice listening to one Mimi on the soundtrack for eight years, but she did great. The other cast members were great too. I loved this movie. It has more talking, but it's a good tearjerker and fun movie to watch. I can't wait until it's out on video to dance to in the privacy of my own home. This is one movie either you love or you hate it. The play does have cult following, but hopefully the movie will bring the story to new people. There are not words to write to tell you how wonderful I think this movie was, but then again I am bias.  <br />

B000B0WODA|3.0|Franz Ferdinand is the best band to come along in years.<br /><br />In many ways they are like DEEP PURPLE (my all time favorite band) who continue to thrive outside of the good old U.S.A. Why? Because it's just about the music.<br /><br />There's not alot of fashion statement, no real trendy crap and no techno bull. Just good rock music!<br /><br />When I heard FF on SNL, I was pretty impressed. They had that same essence which I've only seen in Purple. There was that raw in your face, well played rock music, well, I became an instant fan.<br /><br />You Could Have It So Much Better and Rapture Of The Deep (DP's latest) are two of my two favorite discs right now, with every song being good to excellent! Just when I was giving up on new music, both FF and DP come through with great new discs. These albums get better with each listen. Celebrate!<br /><br />3 1/2 stars: You Could Have It So Much Better<br /><br />5 stars: Rapture Of The Deep

B000001ESF|5.0|<br />         Before their breakthrough hit, '2112', Rush had already released three albums: 'Rush', 'Fly By Night', and 'Caress of Steel'. The latter was a flop, the former was a bluesy-rock type album, and it wasn't until 'Fly By Night' that Rush welcomed in legendary drummer Neil Peart. <br /> <br />         That was probably the greatest move Rush could have made. <br /> <br /> <br />         Armed with only a guitar, a bass, a killer drumset, Neil Peart's admiration with Ayn Rand, and the typical nerd instinct (I've got it too!), the legendary trio wrote and recorded what is now one of the greatest progressive rock albums in the world. The album opens up with 'Overture', which is Neil Peart's \\"rock opera\\", complete with a hero, a villain, and a guitar to further depict the story. After some trippy sound effects we are led into 'The Temples of Syrinx', which is a metal-esque song. Lifeson's guitars shine on this song, and Neil Pearts drums only add to the fun, but it really doesn't begin until Geddy croons, \\"And the meek shall inherit the earth...\\"  <br /> <br />          From then on we are indulged in a world full of excitement...and anger...and tragedy...and emotion...and, well just about everything else along the way! Forget Dark Side of The Moon being the greatest prog rock album of all time. Don't even consider clicking the 'Back' tab on the browser. Take it from someone who is obsessed with new wave. Rush rocks. <br /> <br />   Nerd power, man. <br /> <br /> <br />*TWO THUMBS UP FOR 2112* <br />
B000BO0LLS|4.0|So here it is, Mariahs so called big comeback. For the most part it is a comeback but only from her lifeless whispering that Charmbraclet gave us pleny of, so this is definity a huge improvement on charmbraclet. Songs like Circles, Stay the night, and espcially mine again take you back to the daydream days when her voice was at its strongist point. Also we belong together is a great song which deserved to be her 16th number. Most of the rest of the album besides this is pretty mush mid tempo or watered down hip-hop.<br /><br />As far as the new bonus track go, Don't forget about us sounds like a slower version of we belong together but its still good. Makin it last all night has a great beat but is nothing special. So lonley (one and only part 2) sucks. Sorry Mariah but there is WAY too much pointless rap and not enough her voice in it. The beat isnt even that good.<br /><br />All in all its an album with very great high points, but low ones as well.
B000002JS6|5.0|Ac/Dc is not great like Jimi or Tull and the likes.  They are just solid.  Every song is solid rock & roll.  This is their best album and one of the best rock albums ever.  Angus Young wails through his guitar solos with such ferocity that even the shy will start slammin on their air guitars.  I just can't get over how every song has the same high-level of energy.  Loud guitars, screaming vocals, and a great sense of humor make this an awesome album to listen to all the time.  You MTV viewers can have your Coldplay, I'm just gonna rock out with Back in Black.
0060512806|3.0|\\"Cryptonomicon\\" is, to say the least, extensive.  It's detailed, extremely detailed.  It's a dream-book for those who love sci-fi, computer science, and military history (SFCS&MH).<br /><br />I'm an avid reader, a former computer programmer in the Army, and a computer science graduate, and even I had a hard time really loving the book.  At 900+ pages, it sometimes felt like 9,000+, with Stephenson's need to prove to you that he is so intelligent, and has done so much research on every single possible detail.  From crypto to digging tunnels to playing cards to scuba diving to WWII history to Captain Crunch to Van Eck freaking to Asian culture, he leaves nearly no stone unturned.  It's the book's strength and weakness at the same time.  It's as if Stephenson cares less about story, plot, and character development than he does the minute details and the witty dialogue (which is not necessarily a bad thing).<br /><br />Upon completion of the book I thought, \\"Did I really get everything that Stephenson intended?\\"  Immediately afterward I thought, \\"Well, there is no way in h*** I'm going through that arduous, long, and sometimes boring book again to find the parts I might have missed.\\"<br /><br />While \\"Cryptonomicon\\" had digressions upon digressions, it was nonetheless interesting.  At times, I simply couldn't put the book down.<br /><br />I laughed several times while reading the book, and couldn't help but to admire the quirkiness of some of the book's situations.  If Jerry Sienfeld was into SFCS&MH, I imagine the book would have several similar situations.  Several times while reading, I smirked, thinking that such a digression or plot-line connection was absurd, quirky, and at the same time absolutely brilliant.  At times it's like hearing an incredibly witty joke for the first time; you simply can't believe how funny it is, and you respect the fact that it's an odd type of humor shared between you and the joke-teller.<br /><br />The book is informative, fun, and enlightening, but it's not one that I would recommend to anyone who wasn't already a lover of SFCS&MH.  Missing any one of the three attributes could cause a reader to hate this book and put it down before the midpoint.<br /><br />In the end, it needed some serious editing prior to publishing, and a better ending wouldn't have hurt.  But I still enjoyed it quite a bit.fun, and enlightening, but it's not one that I would recommend to anyone who wasn't already a lover of SFCS&MH.

B00005LC4B|5.0|I have watched this movie many times, and I like it very much.<br /><br />Robert De Niro plays a villain (Max Cady), who gets released from prison after 14 years. Then Cady tries to get revenge on the lawyer, who didn't defend him zealously enough.<br /><br />I like Max Cady, his wisdom, his strong emotions, his car.<br /><br />Robert De Niro plays a likeable villain, who is very self-confident and doesn't hesitate to chase the lawyer, his secret lover, his wife and daughter.<br /><br />My female friends don't like this movie because in it Cady does terrible things against women.<br /><br />Logic says that I should simpatise with the lawyer's character.<br /><br />But De Niro plays the ex-con character so convincingly, that he is irresistible. The movie is filled with wise sayings, like:<br /><br />\\"I am as large as God, he is as small as I. He cannot above me, nor I beneath him, be\\"; \\"A few minutes with me and you'll be speaking in tongues\\"... and so on.<br /><br />This is a powerfull movie and it gave me hope in difficult times, regardless of the fact that the main character (Max Cady) is a bad guy.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|\\"Opulent\\" is the defining term for \\"The Phantom of the Opera,\\" Joel Schumacher's lavish film version of the Andrew Lloyd Webber mega stage hit from the 1980`s.  Based on the novel by Gaston Leroux, the film tells the story of a mysterious, masked specter, his face disfigured from birth, who haunts a Paris opera house in the 1870's.  Embittered by the treatment he's received all his life from a callous, cruel society that could never see past his physical deformity, the Phantom lives an isolated, lonely existence in the rafters and bowels of the theater until he falls in love with a beautiful young ing&eacute;nue named Christine whom he both inspires and terrifies with his actions and demeanor.<br /><br />The original production relied heavily on feats of stagecraft and theatrical legerdemain - the boat rowing across the stage, the chandelier crashing to the floor - to wow its awestruck audience.  Since such special effects are de rigueur in the world of film, Schumacher has had to retain much of the theatricality of the original to make these moments work as well here as they did on the stage.  This he achieves through the use of elaborate, larger-than-life sets - soaring architecture for the scenes above stage and cavernous causeways for the ones below.  Yet, Schumacher keeps it all reasonably cinematic through fluid camerawork and an occasional excursion into the great outdoors.<br /><br />Like most musicals, \\"Phantom\\" rises or falls on the quality of its score.  Although many have noted that the songs all tend to sound the same after awhile, this criticism does an injustice to some of the really stirring melodies Webber has come up with.  Although a few of the pieces do, indeed, feel like filler, the music, on the whole, perfectly captures the high flown romanticism of what is, let's face it, a pretty florid piece of Victorian melodrama at its core.  Needless to say, the songs are impeccably sung, with Emmy Rossum's clear, shining soprano a thing of beauty.  Gerald Butler as the Phantom and Patrick Wilson as Raoul, his rival for Christine's affections, both lack charisma as actors, although Butler has a few touching moments at the end (Wilson, on the other hand, has been stuck playing one of those bland, white bread hero types Victorian audiences seemed to adore so much, so, unlike Butler, he has little or no chance of redeeming himself at any point in the movie).thing of beauty.

B0007GAEW6|2.0|This album is a mess. It seems to have no idea about what it wants to be. Shall we prog it but keep it real with the punk and shall we go salsa with the tango and sing in Spanish about rotting maggots in our brains while having tuneless guitars but yet quiet electronic moments with found sound bird noises and oh you know how Neu! and the Butthole Surfers did those part of their records with the tapes speeded up and distorted....yeah let's do them. Come on guys, show that you at least know what you're doing ( even when you don't ). I laughed when I first heard this. The whole thing was so comical, I just couldn't take it seriously. But, like all jokes, play it one too many times and it starts to really wear thin. The one thing that astounds me is how there is the Vismund Cygnus \\"suite\\" shall we say. It clocks in at over 45 minutes and is bloody tiring too. It takes all the clichs of prog into overdrive and then some. Normally I would have used that as a compliment but not here. It's just so sounds so misplaced. Sure it has all the heart and parts of it I did like particularly the quieter sections where they actually did sound interesting but it was ruined by wanky tuneless \\" look-at-me-ain't-I-a-god-damn-virtuoso-of-this-here-guitar\\" playing that and the singer singing in tune to a different song in his head. It was so heartbreakingly hilarious but then it was tiresome to hear it for 78 minutes and there's nothing. There's not much variation. Sure there are those moments of quiet and tape manipulation ( which goes on way too long ), but it becomes so mind numbingly tedious set in a pattern that it's just a painfully laborious thing just to get to the end of the CD.  <br /> <br />In short, you'd either have to be a rabid fan of the band or just plain stupid to believe the hype around these guys. It's so mind numbingly tedious that you end up thinking record executives should be shot for allowing this mess out to the general public. Or you could like this record........
B000B8QEZG|4.0|\\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" is a great album and you can't go wrong with this purchase. \\"Hung Up\\" is a great song and a great way to kick off this non-stop collection of future pop. All the songs were well produced, excellent samples, and technology usage. It is by far one of her best albums to date. I think that it is a few notches below \\"Ray of Light\\" and \\"Music.\\" I just wished that she'd focused more on providing some depth to the lyrics. She has been successful in the past with providing great lyrics along with some addictive beats. This album is pretty light in that territory and \\"I Love New York\\" is just terrible. She should have used it on her \\"American Life\\" and it would have been in good company with the rest of the cheesy songs. So please skip that song and enjoy the rest of a very good dance album.

B000002AH9|5.0|Many people complains that the fanatics of this album just could not hear her as she is because there are so many emotional baggaeges attached to this album. However,  I am sure I was impartial when I heard this album for the first time. I was born and raised in Korea and I have never heard of her or her name when I bought the LP in late Eighties in Korea. I just started to listen to fusion jazz(I mean that was the only available jazz around) and I am afraid I did not know who Duke Ellington  was. I usually listened to Pop and Classical music. And boy! this album really blew me away and she instantly became my favorites along with Billy Joel and Wham. Later on, I listened to her earlier records, but I still think this is her best record. Please listen to this album not thinking of her glorious earlier Columbia and Verve period. I think people complaining about her vocal quality are the ones who are prejudiced about this album. They are so enarmored with her earlier beautiful voice that they just refuse to hear it as it is.
B00003CXAW|5.0|After waiting for years to see this masterpiece on an official DVD I can tell you it was well worth the wait.  The special features are spectacular. It's amazing that what was done in 1933 has yet to be surpassed by today's standards.  You'll know what I mean after you view the DVD.  The time and love that these pioneers had for this movie is unsurpassed (and it shows in what they created).  There was nothing like it then, and there's nothing like it today.  For anyone who has never seen the original movie I recommend that you watch all of the special features first, then view the movie.  Peter Jackson, who is remaking this tale, is a great fan of the original and states it many times here that it could not be duplicated.
B00006L7XQ|4.0|Ok, I am by no means a country music fan and so this was a rare departure from my musical headtrip.(Check out my \\"How to...\\" list) I bought this album because Johnny Cash covered more than one artist I definately count as being top favorites. (Nine Inch Nails and The Beatles) The tipping point that actually made me buy the album, however, was the clip I heard of 'Personal Jesus'. Something about Cash's rendition was extremely appealing for some reason. <br /> <br />Now I listened to this album from beginning to end and there were some songs I definately loved and some I did not. I will not say this album is not one of the rawest pieces of music I have ever heard...because it is. However, that didn't necessarily translate into fully enjoying each song. Cash's cover of 'Hurt' is definately unique and definately doesn't lose any of the emotion present in the original. (Didn't like the lyric change, but anyway) However, Cash's cover of 'In My Life' was not something I enjoyed at all. John Lennon's version was just SO much better. My favorite song on the album had to be 'I Hung My Head'. <br /> <br />Overall, this album has some good songs and some not so good songs. So a 4 star rating is definately appropriate for this ALBUM (I'm rating the music, not the man).
B000002KJQ|5.0|this music on this album is actually the same as the old stuff, the problem is the way its mixed so it sounds different and more 80's. Those drum parts arent redone, just echo and reverb have been added to the tracks. I readdy for the day when ALL the old Top albums recieve the treatment on Chrome Smoke and BBQ.
0060170123|5.0|I am very much a fan of the short story and would read the occasional novel, which would mostly be classics, and I am not into romantic tales either. I had only bought this because it was highly recommended by a friend. However I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it and in spite of its size, I couldn't get enough of this book. Though it took a while to get into but after the first 3 or more chapters, I couldn't put it down so I finished it in 2 weeks. The intricately-woven plot and strong characterisation are some of the best I've come across so much so that Seth's writing style, though rambling at times, didn't bother me much at all. For all its occasional comedic scenes and tongue-in-cheek wit, this story is very real. I didn't mind the ending at all because for a story like this that resembles real life, absolute closure cannot be expected. The closure we get here is that it is just the beginning of a new phase for Lata, and the other characters move on with their own lives as usual. Now I am hoping that Seth would consider a sequel where \\"a suitable girl\\" would be found for Varun, Lata's younger brother or possibly a focus on the Chatterji family, especially Amit (whose character reads like he could have been based on Seth himself.)
B000002KJM|5.0|You can't beat this old top. And just so you know the drums are not electric drums and redone drum parts. What those guys did is add reverb and echo to the original drum tracks to all the 70's albums up to Deguello. It does sound weird that way and they outta re-issue all their old albums in the sound of Chrome, Smoke and BBQ. But until that happens, here's some darn good Top.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|worth the wait!! <br />i didn't care for mezmerize that much, and i was really skeptical about hypnotize, but i was really shocked when i first listened to it. Let me start off my review by saying what i disliked about mezmerize first... <br />Mezmerize was more of a popish album, and the songs weren't that great. The guitarist Daron wrote all the songs, but one, and sang in every song...overpowering Serj's  voice (the vocalist). I was drawn to this band because of Serj's voice and Mezmerize was a huge let down to me. now...back to hypnotize. <br />This album was more like the old albums because serj sang more in this album, and it was heavier than mezmerize, and more political.If you were a fan of Toxicity then you will like this album a lot. It has a good mix of funny/weird songs like in the old albums, and it has serious political songs. I am very impressed with this album. What is cool about hypnotize/mezmerize is that it was meant to be a double album so you can link both packages together making it into a double disk boxset, and the art work connects too. Hypnotize leads into mezmerize with the song Soldierside (hypnotize) and Soldierside intro (Mezmerize).  <br />If you didn't like Mezmerize , or you liked the older system of a down more, then you will like hypnotize. I recomend this album to all the people that were dissapointed with mezmerize. other than that i recomend it to everyone. <br />good album <br /> <br />
B000002H2H|5.0|Popular belief is that Master of Puppets is the greatest Metallica album. Not true. MOP is very good but not quite at the level if this stuff.

Escape 8/10 -See above <br /> <br />7. Creeping Death 10/10 -One good song right here. It is simply amazing live, when thousands are screaming \\"DIE DIE DIE\\" <br /> <br />8. The Call Of Ktulu 11/10 -Simply amazing. In my humble opinion, I like it better than Orion or To Live Is To Die <br /> <br />80/80 A+ <br />Don't be discouraged by these \\"low points\\", this is an epic album! <br /> <br />
B0002Z0EYK|1.0|Hello Hollywood?  Yes, Homer here - 8th century poet extraordinaire.  I wrote a couple of epic poems nearly three thousand years ago - a story of a great war that has attracted the interest of men not only across time but across cultures.  I would like for you to take this tale and bastardize it as best you can.  You don't even have to read the story - you remember the cliff notes that you scanned when you were in eleventh grade right?  If not, don't worry about it - just ad lib what you don't remember.  By the way, anything interesting or innovative - make sure that you take that out and replace it with something hackneyed and pedestrian.  Sure my stories have stood the test of time (I know you'll appreciate the cliche), but I think that Hollywood probably has a better idea of what audiences want.  Oh yeah and the ending?  I never really like it anyway.  Why don't you have the two lovers end up together.  Forget what I recorded or was handed down by history.  Menelaos?  Go ahead and kill him off.  I always thought that he was kind of a tool and should never have been one of the few to make it home.  I think that it should really have a great 'love conquers all' climax.  Well, can't wait to see what you come up with.  Hopefully, it won't be much different than gladiator.   <br /> <br />Best, <br />Homer <br /> <br />PS  While you're at it, why don't you change the story of Jesus?  I always thought that instead of a crucifixion, Jesus should have taken out the Romans with an AK-47 and then been declared emperor.  That's way better than what Matthew, Mark, Luke, or  John recorded!
B000BKVQTS|1.0|I watched Terry Gilliam's The Brothers Grimm.   I am sickened and appalled at the use of animal cruelty as humor. The scene where a fluffy kitten gets chopped up in a machine is totally unacceptable. It does not add anything to the story and is clearly added as a sick attempt for humor. I am familiar with Terry Gilliam's previous work and feel this is a new and disturbing low. Animal cruelty is not funny. I recommend a boycott of this movie and all of Gilliam's work. Animal right's groups have worked too long and hard to stop animal abuse to allow this kind of warped humor to be used. We need to show that we will not stand for this kind of treatment of animals in films. It is simply not acceptable.
B000B8QEZG|3.0|Madonna seems to have anticipated the criticism many of the reviews on Amazon and elsewhere have thrown at this album - that it's brilliantly produced and aurally pleasing, but empty and filled to the brim with ripped off samples from other songs.. \\"This is who I am, you can like it or not..\\"<br /><br />This album really ISN'T 'who' Madonna is so much as what she's willing to be, publicly, at 48 - the creator and innovator has become the copier.  For those who are having trouble letting go of Madonna's earlier, soul-filled and hook-laden repertoire, it's not like those discs became unplayable upon the release of this disc.  And this set of songs is actually very catchy and very danceable.. so all is not lost.<br /><br />What I don't like about this album is the complete and utter lack of depth or emotion in any of it - it would have been hard to predict that Madonna could ever move from the best pop hook ever - 'Romeo and Juliet, they never felt this way I bet' - to rhyming 'New York' with 'dork.'  But that is really more a reflection of where music is/is going than on Madonna herself - catchy but forgettable, mass-produced for maximum selling power.  If you're old enough to remember the sheer hysteria that hearing the opening beats of \\"Vogue\\" or \\"Express Yourself\\" in a club would bring, you'll understand this point.  This new music is good; the older stuff was great.  'Transformational' has just been shortened to 'trance.'<br /><br />There is still plenty of 'meaningful' music out there; don't buy this CD for its meaning, buy it because you just wanna dance and want an old friend to take you out to a frenetic but<br /><br />generic night out at the club.<br /><br />In short:<br /><br />Danceability - 5 of 5<br /><br />Lyrics - 1 of 5<br /><br />Overall - 3 of 5

B00005JO1S|5.0|Well unless you have been living under a rock for the past year or so, you must know that Zathura is a sequel to the movie \\"Jumanji.\\" Basically, if you liked Jumanji, you will like Zathura. It has the same plot, very simular characters and story line.<br /><br />However, I enjoyed Zathura a little more than Jumanji. Maybe it was the space aliens who look like dragon-men, or maybe it was the meteor shower barraging the living room of the house where Zathura takes place.<br /><br />It's one of those movies that makes you start thinking, \\"What would I do in this situation?\\" As you watch the characters fall out of the frying pan and into the fire again and again. Despite some tense situations, none of the characters are actually hurt, so it's just clean fun. Some bad language is used but all in all a great movie for little kids.
0880389052|5.0|This book was a refreshing change from the typical fantasy novel. I found the world setting very unique and I fell in love with the Drow life and the underdark. I am not the kind of person who readily gives a book 5 stars, but this book is a masterpiece. I enjoyed every page of this book, every sentence of this book. I loved all of Salvatores descriptive battles. I found myself immersed into Salvatores drow world. I loved the politics,  The callus behavior of the drow, the cold darkness of the underdark, the uncarrying and self-absorbed drow personality, the cruelty the drows were capable of. I enjoyed reading the wars between the houses of Menzobberzan and the houses trying to overthrow each other. The architecture of the drow houses and how the city was built out of the stalgmites and stalagtites I found very creative. Even though salvatore may not have been the origonal creative work behind Menzoberrzan I found this world to be very unique and creative. I have read the Drow series, but I found this book by far the best of the trilogy.
0060755598|5.0|This review is for the unabridged audio version. I spend a lot of time in the car and listen to a lot of audiobooks, mostly business and sales. I found this book to be far more relevant and applicable than most. The book really gets down to the operational how-to level where as most books can't seem to get past broad cliches that sound good and may be true but don't give you anything to run with.  <br /> <br />Most of the business management books out there seem to be written for larger businesses. I'm sure this is because the authors that write them usually are running large corporations. It seems very hard for these authors to get back to the very beginning stages where most of us are starting from.   <br /> <br />The ideas of creating systems to run and grow your business are so obvious yet I have such a tendancy (as apparently many others do as well) to try to manage everything on the fly. This book takes a lot of the mystery and intimidation out of running and growing a business. I will admit that the author could be more concise and often he spends far too much time on a simple point but I will still give it 5 stars because it is far better than most. I would definately recommend it to anyone just starting out or anyone who wants to grow their business past mom-and-pop size.
B00005JMUA|3.0|After vol.1, I expected better but I suppose that the 2nd of anything is never better than the first. The ending was too toned down and they should have stuck with the alternate ending that was going to show Uma and Dave swordfighting on the beach! The only reall high point to this film is the big altercation with Elle and Bea. Still a good movie to have, though.
B000028U0Y|5.0|Best live album ever<br /><br />This is easily the best live album ever cut.  Johnny Cash's music is great to begin with, but listing to it played with that extra little something that live crowds, and this crowd in particular, bring out of artists is something. Plus all the songs he ever did about prison are sung with an extra little something.  You will never hear a better version of I got Stripes or Folsom Prison Blues.<br /><br />Easily worth the 8 bucks you will spend
0790731479|5.0|Bravo Bravo! The atmosphere of this movie is spectacular! It has it's share of gloomy moments and hilarious moments which is what made this movie the success that it was, is, and forever will be.
0446577383|5.0|It is a truism that you cannot judge a book by its cover. However, if there is an exception to this, this is it! <br />  Author Baldacci has produced a book to match its great cover. He has combined a timely, well-paced plot peopled with interesting, believeable characters and a page-turning style that is probably unmatched by any other legal thriller writer. <br />  The plot is almost too real-time. It combines Arab terrorism with American conspirators with the U.S President as its target. <br />   Read it for pleasure and enjoy your time in a new (and exclusive) club---the Camel Club. A solid five star performance by Mr. B! <br />
B0009S4IHY|4.0|What do you get when you cross Stephen Chow with Stephen Chow? Invariably a movie about Kung-Fu. This is no exception, but at least it holds up to the standard established for American audiences by Shaolin Soccer.<br /><br />Kung-Fu Hustle has that same irreverent feel to it, and astute observers will notice that every actor and actress of note from Shaolin Soccer has returned here as well, with a few notable exceptions from Team Evil.<br /><br />This film doesn't try to break any new ground, convey a moral, or do any other such nonsense. Instead, it stays true to its core and emerges as a fun way to spend an hour and some change watching the hybrid offspring of The Matrix and an old Kung-Fu film.<br /><br />All the classic elements are here: there is the good guy who is trying to be bad but can't, the girl who has a link to the good guy's childhood and who anchors him, the supernaturally-powerful heros who -- of course -- meet up with an impossibly tough bad guy, the resurrection-themed ascension of the aforementioned good guy to power, and the axe-wielding mobsters whou seem to double as dancers in an off-Broadway musical.<br /><br />You know, the basic elements of any Kung-Fu film.<br /><br />Overall, a very enjoyable bit.
B000006E4C|5.0|Composed in 1976 by Reich, this is a piece that goes down as a classic in my view. Although some of his earlier work with tape manipulations now sounds a bit dated and simply doesn't hold up as well, the beauty of Music For 18 Musicians still sounds as fresh to me now as anything that I've heard lately. This particular release on Nonesuch, recorded in 1996 is actually about 11 minutes longer than the original composition, but that length really only adds to the bliss of the piece. At 14 tracks and almost 67 minutes of music, it's just over an hourlong excursion into what feels like a safer place.<br /><br />Performed by musicians, just as the title states, it actually might fall into what many would consider 'trance' music. It's highly repetitive, and while it bears no relation to the crap being pedalled as trance music these days, it's nearly as hypnotic as any music you'll find. With vocals, stringed instruments, lots of percussive elements (vibraphone, gamelan, marimba, maracas), pianos, and clarinets, it's one of those pieces of music that you can trace back to as a starting point for not only individual artists, but genres as well. It blends non-western, classical, and even a touch of jazz for something that was original at the time, and still stands solidly on that ground.<br /><br />With all this praise I'm heaping on this piece, I must warn that if you don't enjoy repetitive music, you probably won't appreciate this release quite as much. While it is repetitive, though, it's far from minimal (although it's grouped into that category often). Unfurling over the course of 11 different parts, as well as phasing pieces that lead into and end the overall composition, it breathes like something real and organic as each instrument and voice take their place with the harmony and again blend back down into the mix. It's constantly moving and shifting, and while there are moments of quieter transition, there are also ones of breathtaking splendor as melodies overlap and change speed while different instruments come into and out of focus. It's like taking several different minimal paintings printed on transparencies and subtely shifting them over one another to create new pieces as you see colors blend into one another and fold into something new each time.<br /><br />Considering that the piece is one that's performed by actual people, the juxtaposition of the different elements is quite amazing (of course, imagining how you would program something like this electronically also staggers the mind), and as mentioned before, you can hear little bits of everyone from Tortoise to different electronic artists like Vladislav Delay and Gas (Mike Ink) having developed parts from it. While their were groundbreaking pieces both before and after it, it's one of those recordings that will envelope you if you allow it to. So, if you're a fan of modern electronic music or even post rock, you should probably hunt down this release and hear it at least once. If you can, simply stop doing everything else, pop it in the CD player and relax with it on a pair of headphones for the entirety of the release. You'll come to just under 70 minutes later when the CD stops spinning, and chances are you'll want to do it again sometime. I certainly do.<br /><br />(from almost cool music reviews)p and change speed while different instruments come into and out of focus.

B000BJS4SU|5.0|People who go out of their way to bash this album, do so by comparing Mayer to Stevie Ray.  Mayer is not Stevie Ray.  Not even Jimmy Vaughn is Stevie Ray.  Where Mayer takes his influences from go deeper than solely just Stevie Ray. <br />This album is creative, and is more of a pure electric sound than previous albums.  With Mayer in the past, we tended to see a more pop-based acoustic sound, without any solo'ing of any sort.  Only at a live show would you get a taste of his blues side, and those instances were infrequent.  Any Given Thursday showed a bit of the blues flavor, but teaming up with Buddy Guy and Double Trouble in preparation for this new direction has helped him transition into this new sound, with two new players- both of which are all stars in any rock and blues conessieuer's book.   <br />This album is not so unlike his past albums that you will dislike it, but rather a different direction taken by the same Mayer most know and love.  I highly recommend it, especially to the guitar enthusiast.
0307276902|5.0|James Frey's book is one of the most accurate accounts of recovery ever written.  The emotion he conveys and the pain he endures is incredibly raw.  The style in which he composes his story allows you to digest each sentence as you would a bite of a fantastic meal, taking a bite, tasting each individual flavor and digesting it slowly. He shows you the human condition at its worst, describing a world that few of us will ever experience. What the media tends to glamorize, Frey shows as the horror that any drug addict knows is the truth.  Mr. Frey's triumph over his demons and what he calls The Rage are nothing short of a miracle.  Read this book immediately!!

B000AY3KN0|5.0|king kong is  a american classic and now  everybody's favorite ape is getting the star treatment in this special edition dvd ...all i can say is  its about time:) <br />  first off this is the original 1933 print (minus the missing spider pit scene..but peter  jackson did a great job  creating his own version of it..they should have cut it into the actual film though)  that was cleaned up and digitally remastered  and kong looks as great as he ever did..in fact better:) <br /> <br />  you all know the story, so im not going to go into that here..but i will say this  the stop motion animation done on kong  is fantastic..in fact he looks more realistic than some  cg characters these days(can we all say the hulk movie)..the animators  gave kong total personality  and he looks like he has heart..in my opinion kong is not a special effect  but rather a actual character..just look at the emotion on his face  when he  discovers that  hes bleeding when hes on the empire state building  he looks like hes starting to cry and wondering  why are they shooting at  him?   hes in love thats all..the beauty made  the giant weak.. <br /> <br />  this movie is well paced from start to finish and besides kong my favorite character in this film  is filmaker  carl denim  played by robert armstrong..he gives a energetic feel to the movie.. <br />     king kong is a special effects masterpiece(for its era anyway)  that should not be passed up..i can only wonder how peter jacksons version of kong pans out  but thats another review for another day....get this movie and not  the version from the 1970s...unless you want to see a kong with a high  sex drive LOL
B00005A0V0|5.0|In the early Sixties there was a stir going on musically in the brand new world of Pop and Rock music around the area of the quiet  Cathedral City of Canterbury in Kent . The catalyst for all of this, which was to be wittily called \\" The Canterbury Sound\\", stemmed from a band calling themselves \\"The Wilde Flowers\\" ( appropriate sixties misspelling like \\" The Beatles \\" and \\"The Byrds\\".) Formed in 1963 the band imploded in 1967, splitting into two major fractions, one side ,the more avant-garde Jazz/Rock fusion minded musicians, Robert Wyatt,Hugh Hopper, Kevin Ayers,  going off to form \\" Soft Machine \\" which later begat such bands as ''Gong'', \\"Kevin Ayers and The Whole World\\" ,Matching Mole ,etc. While the other more Pop/Rock members Richard Coughlan,Pye Hastings , David Sinclair , and his bass playing cousin Richard Sinclair , went off and formed \\"Caravan\\".<br /><br />The  four members of Caravan went off and  did what every self respecting band did in that much beloved era , went into retreat in the country \\" To get it together\\" After a year camping just outside nearby seaside resort Whitstable , rehearsing every night in a nearby church hall , and  fighting off starvation, they became one of the tightest little musical outfits in the British Isles without even playing a gig. In 1968 they were snapped up by American Record label Verve who released their first album Caravan (1968) . Which went completely unnoticed by the record buying public, which is hardly surprising as nobody had heard of them , and there was next to no publicity as Verve went bust anyway .<br /><br />This was all put right ,when with great enthusiasm the giant Decca records signed up our young heroes recording contract, and not only prepared them for their second album , but sent them out on the road to get them in the public eye . This included not only playing any place that would have them, but at such major events as the Kraalingen Pop Festival at Rotterdam in Holland in front of 250,000 people on the same bill as\\" Pink Floyd\\", \\"Jefferson Airplane\\",\\"Santana\\", and\\" Frank Zappa\\", admittedly \\"Caravan\\" were on first on the second morning ,so most of the people were probably asleep, but some of them must of taken notice as Holland has always been a stronghold for \\"Caravan\\" fans.<br /><br />Caravan's second album the wonderfully titled \\" If I Could Do it Again I Would Do It All Over You\\" ( 1970) which was released to a far greater fanfare and critical acclaim. Enabling the band to enlarge their following and develop their natural talents . After six months on the road promoting the album the band were ushered back into Air London studio's , under the inspirational eye of young producer David Hitchcock to record a follow up album. When the band came back out of the studio and released the results to it's waiting public they had come out with what many people consider to be a seminal moment from the early Seventies .<br /><br />\\" In The Land Of The Grey And Pink\\"(1971) has one of the most unique and instantly recognisable sounds in the history of rock , perhaps a little whimsical for some,but then that is a lot of its charm. In those fondly remembered days of innocence , anything written by any member of the band was considered a band composition , and songwriting royalties equally shared amongst the  band members, a far cry from today's mercenary contracts. On\\" In the land of the Grey and Pink\\", what you actually get is three of Richard Sinclair's finest ever songs , one from Pye Hastings ( According to Pye that was fair enough as he had written most of the first two albums) , and then side two of the vinyl album was taken up by the one twenty-two minute opus \\" Nine Feet Underground \\" which came in five separate movements,with four bridges , and was mainly written by David Sinclair, with the others linking all the parts together, and adding bits here and there.<br /><br />The album opens with 'Golf Girl' a wonderful song of love ( There were no songs of war,hate or politics' in the Caravan repertoire, just songs of idealised life that we can all relate to in our happier moments) about Richard Sinclair's future wife . This song should be played regularly in all of Pattaya's many golf bars , no song could improve the atmosphere in a bar more. \\"Golf Girl\\" is followed by another Richard Sinclair song \\" Winter Wine\\" a song of fairy tales and dreams which weaves along perfectly with the feeling of well being laid down by the first song. Next up is the Pye Hastings's composition \\" Love To Love You ( And Tonight Pigs Will Fly)\\" . The lyrics to this very hummable song are extremely naughty , not smutty, or crude,just enjoyably naughty.The title track another Richard Sinclair number is a nursery rhyme set to music as if sung to children , including one of the most beautiful piano solo's ever put down on tape ,and lyrics that would soften the most jaded soul, about \\" Not leaving your Dad out in the rain ,those nasty grumbley Grimblies, and cleaning your teeth in the sea\\" the songs final verse is sung in bubble as you would to sing to a six month old baby , quite delightful.<br /><br />The albums epic \\"Nine Feet Underground\\" is a stunning display of exactly how well the members of Caravan had mastered their chosen instruments , including the duel lead vocals of Pye Hastings and Richard Sinclair. Obviously it is mainly David Sinclair's  keyboard's that are in the fore through out, deservedly so as he was on a par with any player of his day , the piano, Hammond organ and the mellotron are all given thorough workouts in the space allowed in Nine Feet Underground's twenty two minutes, but this does not detract from the jazzy bass work of Richard Sinclair, the melodic lead guitar work from Pye Hastings , or the rock solid drumming of Richard Coughlan.There is also room for Pye's brother Jimmy Hastings to come in and add some flute and tenor saxophone .<br /><br />Although the albums was not a great commercial success at the time it has never been taken out of print and sells steadily to this day,Decca have just released a remastered version with thirty minutes of extra music , including two tracks that were recorded at the time but had to be left off because of time limitations ,  demo versions of two of the Richard Sinclair songs, plus an alternative ending to \\"Nine Feet Underground \\" where \\"Caravan\\" prove that they could rock as hard as any of their contemporaries if they wanted to .<br /><br />The commercial failure of the album was to lead to great internal stresses within the Caravan ,and David Sinclair was to pack up his keyboards and leave almost immediately ,going off to search for his musical ideal with Robert Wyatt in \\"Matching Mole\\" . Cousin Richard lasted one more album ,'Waterloo Lily' (1972)  before he cast off  to roam afield in the musical world ,later forming \\"Hatfield and the North\\" , before joining \\"Camel\\" Caravan stumbled on ,but were to never match the magnificence of ' In The Land of The Grey and Pink\\" Only reforming for one off gigs in the nineties for financial reasons.<br /><br />Mott the Doghe Caravan repertoire, just songs of idealised life that we can all relate to in our happier moments) about Richard Sinclair's future wife .

B000ANVQ0K|5.0|Sorry, this is going to be long. <br /> <br />James Cameron is such a talented writer and director, Titanic is definitely one of his finest films. <br /> <br />This is the only film that can get me to cry and i mean tears gushing down my face and even 8 years later, there are still scenes that get me. Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet are the main stars in this picture as fictional characters Jack Dawson and Rose DeWitt Bukater. In my opinion, the strongest character is the older Rose played by Gloria Stuart, she is such a wonderful actress, and even though only being seen in a few scenes, she is amazing. <br /> <br />Others are Kathy Bates as Molly Brown, she doesn't exactly look like the actual Molly Brown but she fits the personality well in this movie and i really couldn't picture anyone else in that role. Billy Zane who plays another fictional character Caledon Hockley. Frances Fisher as Ruth DeWitt Bukater is another fine actress in this movie, and is also a fictional character. Bernard Hill is wonderful as the captain and is a great actor. Victor Garber as Thomas Andrews is great. That's all i'm going to say about the cast because the list goes on forever. <br /> <br />The movie tries to mix history with fiction, with sinking of Titanic and a love story with Rose and Jack, which works rather well, because they are able to introduce us to the real names on that ship. The plot starts off with basically treasure hunters (that's what i call them)lead by Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) looking for a Diamond which was named The Heart Of The Ocean, after failing in their attempts, they find a drawn picture that has a women wearing the diamond, and it just so happens that later that day, that woman calls them (ironic isn't it). They quickly fly her over to their ship and she eventually tells them her story on Titanic. In her story, she is set to marry a man named Caledon but is doesn't want to. To make a long story short, she meets Jack Dawson in her attempt to commit suicide and he stops her, and everything goes from there. <br /> <br />Visual Effects are amazing in this film, especially shots of the ship. I'm still amazed that they built that ship, that is truly amazing. <br /> <br />The music in this movie, is probably the best music i've ever heard in the history of the movie business, the scores in this movie are wonderful. Usually i don't buy soundtracks but i bought this one right on the day it was available. <br /> <br />The ship sinking is amazingly done. Very emotional to watch, because we have to remember, this actually happened. The moment I started to cry during the sinking was when the glass dome over the staircase broke, the combination of the music and seeing all those people getting hit by that water just made me cry. The tears just kept on coming after that. <br /> <br />The ending to this movie, is also great. Gloria Stuart in the last few scenes is great, even though she does play a fictional character, in the end you feel like she was a real character, which made the ending so good. The very last scene when she dies (i guess she dies or it's a dream, not sure) and she goes back to Titanic, and we see the wreck evolve into its original form is an amazing shot and seeing all the characters in that one shot was very well done. <br /> <br />Overall, a Classic, i know some people didn't like the Jack and Rose story but i liked and this movie will remain one of the all-time greats. 200 million dollars to make, 600 million in domestic box-office and 1.2 billion in international box-office. Overall, 1.8 billion. Like the movie or not, you have admit that is impressive <br /> <br />DVD extras are the reason why i bought this. The Commentary by James Cameron was the reason why i bought this.  <br /> <br />Out of a 3 hour movie, i really didn't think there were going to be that many deleted scenes, i couldn't believe there were over 20. Seeing the making of this film is amazing. I still find it hard to believe the recreated that entire ship, that is amazing, and seeing them build it, made it even more unbelievable. <br /> <br />The DVD extras overall, are totally worth watching.
B00000DHR0|5.0|What a collection. To start with  O Holy Night, the traditonal christmas song which every artist seems to put in theire christmas collection, shows what a register in here voice Celine has. Celine Dion is not a critique favourite among some critiques But the hardest \\"stone hearted\\" which is in no contact with his soul will soon forget this when listen to this stunning opener. If you are stressed this realy put you down to your innerself in a good way. You will get in to the real christmas spirit  when listen to this CD, and it`s a treat if you looking for the christmas album with what we can call  has the X-factor. Track 4 written by Bryan Adams Another Year has gone by, is a winner, and has the Celine magic over it.<br /><br />You have it all here from Ave Maria to Happy Xmas. This is music to close you eyes too, and also open you ears too.<br /><br />To put in a track with Andrea Bocelli (Track 9: The Prayer) makes you at least for a couple of minutes  belive in angels. Call me to simple, to emotional,and to little intellectual, i dont mind, the music lift`s me anyway. This album is certainly special times, at least from those who open their hearts. And sometimes i dont mind if more people does that, and it will bring more peace to earth. Celine Dion is certain santas little helper when it comes to this collection. To put in Happy Xmas  (war is over) written by John Lennon and Yoko Ono, says it all about christmas: Let's hope it`s a good one . And this CD certainly help in that department. And you wonder why Celine Dion sells many records ? Shame on you . It`s simple. The little you need will the heart tell you when you are confused. A treat for you inner voice this one.
B00028HBKM|4.0|Mel Gibson writes and directs this classic movie.  <br /> <br />James Caviezel gives one of the greatest performances i've ever seen in my life, and whether you like the movie or don't like it, i think everyone would agree. Maia Morgenstern is another really great actress, playing Mary, and she does a magnificent job.  <br /> <br />Mel Gibson took a chance with this film, and a large chance. Of course, there was criticism, just like the movies before it, The Last Temptation Of Christ, and Jesus Christ Superstar are two examples.  <br /> <br />There is one thing i did criticize and that was the violence of the movie. It just feels like Mel Gibson goes too far, all of the blood and all the painful hits is just too much for an audience to stand. I think the worse part was that parents brought their kids to see this movie. <br /> <br />Besides James Caviezel, no one in this cast speaks english, which i found completely impressive, it just shows the effort that went into this movie, which is why i respect it.  <br /> <br />25 million dollars to make, which i find amazing, because you figure with all they put into the film. You think it would cost more.  <br /> <br />DVD Extras- that is the sad part, because i was really hoping for DVD Commentary or something, because there is so much i wanted to find out about this film, but i guess i'm going to have to wait. It was said that a special edition DVD would be released, i'm guessing later in the year.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Is there anything Opeth can't do?  These guys have to be one of the most talented bands I have ever heard.  Album after album is a master stroke for Opeth they are in every sense of the word musical geniuses.  Ghost Reveries like every other Opeth album flows together seamlessly from song to song and their transitions between the heavy and the melodic are still done flawlessly.  Each album stands apart from the other with it's own unique sound and this one is no different as Opeth continues to utilize all their talents.  This is seen here with the larger use of keys on songs like Beneath the Mire which has a middle eastern feel to it at the beginning which I think sounds amazing.  Other great songs are Ghost of Perdition, Harlequin Forest, Hours of Wealth and The Grand Conjuration.  After Damnation I was curious to see if they would lose their death metal edge and I'm glad to say that's not the case at all as this album is as heavy and beautiful as anything they have ever put out.
B000BO0LLS|1.0|That's right lambs, it's just been announced that Mariah will be releasing a new edition of this trashy album in late december, with all new sauce and low-sugar bun. What's more, is that you will also get a free upsize for an extra $4.50, which will include 6 new remixes of 'we belong together', and and a new song called 'Trash Belongs Together (Me&the Money Mix)'. So remember to slurp it all up, and leave nothing on the tray, cause Mariah is as 'fast food' as they come!!! <br /> <br />Enjoy

Not only does it contain unique information not found elsewhere, but this unique info comes right from the four guys who should know better than anyone -- John, Paul, George and Ringo. Even though this came out a few years ago, put it at the top of your xmas list for the Beatlemaniac in your life. There are a couple of other great Beatles books out there (TURN ME ON, DEAD MAN by Andru Reeve and JOHN by Cynthia Lennon are just two that come to mind), but be sure to get this one if you haven't already.
B000AYQLX6|2.0|Yoko changes the cover art. The original art was chosen by John and was a drawing he did as a child. Yoko lists herself as producer despite the fact that John was separated from Yoko when this album was made (he was living with May Pang). Yoko changes the disc art so that John morphs into Yoko instead of the other way around as it was on the original. Yoko even inserts her name in an audio addition to a song written for May Pang! This woman (Yoko) is now tampering with John's legacy in so many offensive ways that it is difficult to believe that history won't savage her once she is out of the picture. Just you wait, Yoko! Your time is coming!     \\"In 2003 Ono courted controversy by editing herself into the video of the classic song \\"#9 Dream\\" for the \\"Lennon Legend: The Very Best of John Lennon\\" DVD set. There you will find her mouthing the backup vocals that were sung by May Pang. Pang claimed, \\"She is trying to erase everyone who had anything to do with John with her alone. I am definitely upset at her misleading everyone into thinking she is on '#9 Dream.' She had nothing to do with this particular album and it was John's only No.1 album and No. 1 single during his lifetime. Boy, do I understand how Paul [McCartney] feels.\\"
B000B8QEZG|4.0|This album is a pleasing amalgam of Disco, '80's Brit pop, and the slower genres of contemporary dance music.  Though much has been made of the Disco and '80's influences, this CD is not pure retro--the sound here is backward-looking and nostalgic, but modern.  \\"Hung Up\\" is an instant classic, even if part of its brilliance comes from the ABBA sample.  The Middle Eastern borrowings towards the end of the album (on \\"Isaac\\" especially) work, and sound less watered down than did her Latin borrowings on \\"La Isla Bonita.\\"  As others have said, the lyrics here do not match some of her earlier output.  While everyone knows the words to \\"Like a Virgin\\" or \\"Material Girl,\\" I would surely never sing aloud the lyrics to \\"I Love New York.\\" Thankfully, that track is definitely the worst in that regard; the other songs are passable to good lyrically.  Overall, this is a successful, enjoyable album that I know will spend quite a lot of time in my stereo.
B000AY3KN0|3.0|I have shown many prints of King Kong, both in<br /><br />35mm and 16mm, and have never encountered the<br /><br />level of grain as seen here.  It is certainly<br /><br />sharper and with more detail than the 60th<br /><br />anniversary Laserdisc.  The track is better than<br /><br />anticipated.  This grainy quality is also<br /><br />present in the recent \\"Top Hat\\" issue.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Not one bad track on this \\"super nova.\\" Each song seamlessly flows into the next, giving you a sense of sexy, meaningful continuity. This CD goes beyond mere dance music, sure it makes you wanna dance till you drop, but the lyrics send you to a meaningful place called \\"great music\\"! I can't say what my favorite song is, cause they're all great! There is no hint of \\"Gangsta\\" or at the other spectrum \\"Brittany\\", just a welcome return to killer music! Buy this now!!!
B000B8QEYC|5.0|Words to describe this CD:  haunting, beautiful, lush.  These describe the beauty that is Enya's music to a T.  Definitely a keeper.
055380457X|4.0|This book is very inspiring. It makes you think what you can contribute to mankind, like brin & page.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Excellent.  Much better than the previous release.  If you take the self-titled debut and combine it with RAY OF LIGHT, you get CONFESSIONS OF A DANCE FLOOR.  There is not one ballad on the record, and it does not lack for that.  Each song flows into the other, just like a true dance CD.  Definitely worth it.
B000BM6AVA|4.0|Overall, this album is pretty good. The whole album is creative. It is wierd (in a good way) and takes some getting used to. I also don't like how John Dolmayan is more in the background than in Toxicity (same thing for Mezmerize). <br /> <br />\\"Attack\\"-good song. Verses are great, and transitions from the verse to the pre-chorus is really cool. But during the chorus, he is just screaming ATTACK! and sticking a few bad lyrics in between. 4/5 <br /> <br />\\"Dreaming\\"-one of my favorites on the album. I loooooove the harmonizing in the verses. But the chorus just doesn't sound right. I like the switch from heavy to light, but the chorus could be different. 4.5/5 <br /> <br />\\"Kill Rock 'n Roll\\"-live version is better, but this version is still really great. I actually like Daron's lead vocal part. 5/5 <br /> <br />\\"Hypnotize\\"-some people say they don't like it because it is overplayed, but I love it everytime I hear it. 5/5 <br /> <br />\\"Stealing Society\\"-The 1st half (where Serj is singing) is great, but the 2nd half with Daron doing lead vocals in terrible. 3.5/5 <br /> <br />\\"Tentative\\"-I don't really know how to explain why I like this song so much, but I just do. lol. 5/5 <br /> <br />\\"U-Fig\\"-SOAD is known for their strange/unique style. \\"You & me should go outside and we'll beat 'em, beat 'em, beat' em, beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em.\\" (When you hear the song you will know why it sounds wierd) It's a great song. 5/5 <br /> <br />\\"Holy Mountains\\"-Very dark and gloomy. At times it can be a little boring, but the rest of the song is heavy and very dark. My favorite part, \\"LIAR! KILLER! DEMON! Back to the River Aras! Someone's blank stare deemed it warfare!\\" 5/5 <br /> <br />\\"Vicinity of Obscenity\\"-I love the 'banana terracotta pie' part. The part after that seems a little bit pop music-esque, but you gotta love this song. 4.5/5 <br /> <br />\\"She's Like Heroin\\"- Daron's not one of my favorite lyricists. But I like how they incorporate the topic into the song,which is prostitution to get money for drugs. 4/5 <br /> <br />\\"Lonely Day\\"-I actually like this song very much. The lyrics seem very personal. Nice ballad, but ballad's aren't really SOAD's thing. I remember how surprised I was when I heard \\"Roulette\\" on Steal This Album!..... 4.5/5 <br /> <br />\\"Soldier Side\\"-I was pleased with the ending to this album. It was creative to make a 2nd part to the intro on Mezmerize and connect them. But once again, those damn lyrics by Daron! They are good in this song, but they repeat too much. 4/5 <br /> <br />Another interesting fact-The very end of \\"Lonely Day\\" leading into \\"Soldier Side\\" is like the transition from \\"Soldier Side-Intro\\" into \\"BYOB\\".  <br />
B000021YQV|1.0|I bought this a couple of years ago as a mate was going on about them. Big mistake! There's only one really decent song on it - Chop Suey!, which is actually very good, but makes you wonder how a band capable of this is able to fill the rest of the CD with utter tripe. <br /> <br />The lyrics to most of these songs are utterly dreadful, a child could write more meaningfully. They seem to be popular with the 10 to 15 age group, and really is you're older than that stay well clear. <br /> <br />One star may seem harsh, but I really cannot bring myself to give it two stars, even though there is one song which impresses me. One good song on an album just isnt good enough; buy the Chop Suey single if there is one, and save some cash and disappointment.
B0000AQS6R|4.0|NATIONAL LAMPOON'S CHRISTMAS VACATION is one of those films that gets better over time.  Way back in December 1989, I approached this movie with some apprehension.  I thoroughly enjoyed the original VACATION film, but the absolutely horrible EUROPEAN VACATION seemed to spell doom for any future movies.  Fortunately for Chevy Chase, the FLETCH movies came along.<br /><br />However, CHRISTMAS VACATION was a pleasant surprise.  Okay, the soundtrack could have been more exiting and the tempo of the film would have been better if raised to the pitch of VACATION, but overall it was not a bad job.<br /><br />Beverly D'Angelo and Chevy Chase reprise their roles for a third time as Ellen and Clark Griswold.  Like their previous adventures, Clark sets out to create the perfect family event.  Unfortunately, his attempt to create a festive holiday environment turn out to be the recipe for near disaster.  Add some colorful relatives and Clark's klutzy accidents and you have CHRISTMAS VACATION.<br /><br />The best selling point of the picture is the potrayal, albeit exaggerated, of what happens when you fill a household with relatives.<br /><br />This DVD rates a spot alongside of other \\"new\\" classics like HOME ALONE.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|Pay no attention to the reviews from overzealous and petty Madonna fans who should just be happy for their own artist's amazing success with \\"Confessions of a Dancefloor\\". This repackaged edition of Mariah Carey's wildly successful album, \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\", is worth the money. The DVD have 4 videos, including an unreleased video here in teh US and when you access the online video you get a 25 minute look into Mariah Carey. And surprisingly you find yourself liking her more after watching this video of her world promo tour, having fun at a party and sitting down for a serious moment revealing tidbits on what motivates her. There have been a lot of great albums this year, including Madonna's new one, but Mimi is definitely among the very best. I think this album reveals a new maturity in Carey and definitely that she is a force to be reckoned with. Regardless of whether you are a fan of her music, you have to respect and admire what she has done in the past year after the riducule she faced after 2001. I guess it gives me a little hope that nothing is impossible. Pick this album up and enjoy :)
0393327655|1.0|I bought this book anticipating a thorough discussion of how our growing understanding of brain function, its relation to how humans view religion, and the increasingly violent nature of religious expression (like 9-11) compels us go abandon religion in favor of rationalism.<br /><br />The first two chapters fit my expectations quite well. But after that, the book degenerated into a long rant against Christianity and Islam. Sure, Harris says that he dislikes all religions equally. And I don't have much respect for organized religions either. But to repeatedly savage just two religions and rely on the same old criticisms of transubstantiation really didn't impress me. Moreover, Harris concludes with a discussion of the benefits of moving to more \\"Eastern\\" practices. Hardly a strong endorsement of rationalism.<br /><br />The final straw was a lengthy justification for the use of torture in the War on Terrorism! Harris relies on statements from Alan Dershowitz and Samuel Huntington to support his very naive argument for the morality of torture. Too bad Harris hasn't read about the subject from people who actually know what they're talking about, like former intelligence officers and prisoners, most of whom make quite a strong argument that the quality of the information obtained from torture rarely justifies the costs of such barbarism (in human and monetary terms).<br /><br />In fact, the book really suffers from a lack of a clear thesis and well defined terminology, something very disappointing from an author who claims to have a Doctorate in Philosophy from Stanford and is studying neuroscience. For example, Harris repeatedly discusses the folly of using \\"faith\\" in decision making; yet, he never defines the term and even appears to backtrack on this point later in his book. What he really seems to be focused on is the end of religious dogma, which he never seems to articulate clearly or defined.<br /><br />And this appears only to apply where Christians and Muslimsare concerned. Harris finds many reasons to pass over the absurdities in the other religions, like Judaism and Buddhism. (Talk to any interesting burning bushes lately, Sam?) Indeed, I was quite surprised that Harris didn't even mention the difficulties and logical absurdities in IsraelI politics that result from reconciling religious dogmas and secular needs.<br /><br />I really expected better from this book. If you want to read something competent in this subject area, I suggest Keith Stanovich's book \\"Robot's Rebellion\\".
B000BFH2S2|5.0|When Michael's grandfather persisted that his grandson was going to \\"bring the music back\\", he wasn't wrong.  Michael Bubl took the standards that he knew and loved so well, added little nice touches here and there and used that talent of a voice and presented to the world a neat little package that was to bring all generations together. <br /> <br />In this DVD, he made the audience stand up and let all inhibitions go in \\"How Sweet It Is\\" and \\"Save The Last Dance For Me\\" as well as hold their hand to their hearts in \\"Home\\" and \\"Song For You\\".  And if you have been to any of his shows before, he delivers yet again as an entertainer.  He mocks Josh Groban (who did a surprise appearance) as well as trying his hand at pop/rock with a little Maroon 5 number.  And since this is his first PBS special, he remembers his audiences at home as well and proceeds to introduce the audience at the Wiltern to the man-at-home-with-his-tighty-whities. <br /> <br />Bubl pays a few tributes as well.  The first being Ray Charles, singing \\"You Don't Know Me\\", while doing a little of the famous Charles sway.  He introduces the core of his band beginning with his great friend, Alan Chang then Craig Polasko, Randy Napoleon, Rob Perkins, Jumanne Smith, Justin Ray, Bryan Lipps, Frank Basile, Rob Wilkerson, Mark Small, Nick Vagenas and Josh Brown.  He also pays tribute to the crew that helped bring it all together while all he did was just turn up and sing. <br /> <br />He continues to thank his fans for being such an eclectic and great bunch.   <br /> <br />Bubl makes it his responsibility to bring his audience away to another world, to take away all of their troubles for that 2 hours. <br /> <br />And he did.
B00000K3CM|5.0|This should have been the end of the Home Alone series, seeing that the same premise and cast were used for two films but, naturally, Hollywood just can't resist trying to squeeze more money from a proven formula.<br /><br />I'm not one for sequels but this was one of the handful that I can enjoy time and again, not only because the original cast is in it, but because of Macaulay Culkin's comedic ability (even as a kid) and Joe Pesci's and Daniel Stern's reactions to getting their butts kicked, booby trap style.<br /><br />Kevin is not forgotten (like he was last time) but hops the wrong plane after he puts fresh batteries in the family camera right before he gets to the gate at the airport (his family had all the bad luck with high winds knocking out the electric - and the alarm clock - twice).  He mistakes a man with the same coat as his father and after Kevin reassures a flight attendant he's on the right plane, takes his seat ... in a plane heading in the exact opposite direction the rest of his family is going (naturally, no one realizes Kevin's missing until they're in Miami and he's in NY).<br /><br />Who could have thought a vacant New York brownstone could be so much fun?  Sure, Pesci's and Stern's characters are more banged up this time but, hey, they started it.  (The adventures in the Plaza Hotel are hilarious, as well.)<br /><br />Anyway, this is one sequel worth the time to watch.  Just don't bother with the irrelevant, contrived, and unncessary third installment of the series.
0156027321|1.0|I loved this book all the way until the end, then I hated it. I have usually been a fan of Booker prize winners, but this choice has made me re-think that decision. The ending left me sick to my stomach and feeling decieved. If I had known... never would have read it. If you are the type of person who does not enjoy psychological horror- 'Silence of the Lambs meets Sophies Choice' I would encourage you to look elsewhere for your reading pleasure.
076781214X|5.0|Peggy Sue Got Married is one of Francis Coppola's better projects and I came away from the film wishing I had lived through the 1960's.<br /><br />The big question is \\"what if\\" we could go back in time and have a chance to make our decisions over again.  Would we choose to do things the same way or differently?<br /><br />Even though Peggy Sue wants to change things, she finds that she can't (or is unable to) but getting a second perspective on her relationship with her then-boyfriend changes how she views her marriage at the end of the film.<br /><br />While I wasn't born until the late-1970's, I constantly heard stories when I was a kid about the close-knit feeling of families and neighborhoods back then.  I can't envision being able to live in a house where you didn't have to lock your front door at night, although that's what I keep hearing from Baby Boomers (and even what's left of older people) to this day.<br /><br />It's cool catching this movie on TV.  It gives people my age (and younger) a glimpse into how things were \\"back in the day\\" when being into your family (parents, grandparents, etc.) was a part of everyday life.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|It's a warm, peaceful afternoon in the upstanding, prominent town of Sunnyville.  The birds are chirping; children are playing 'Hopscotch' on the sidewalks, and the elderly mingle amongst eachother with friendly games of Chess and Checkers in the park.   <br /> <br />As you drive, slowly and cautiously through your neiborhood on your way home from church, mindful of young children playing about, you peer out of your left window and wave to the mail man with a smile.  He reciprocates, excitedly; then continues going about his work as your vehicle passes. <br /> <br />Continuing down the road, you are suddenly struck with the urge to put some music on.  You notice that your sister has left her case of CDs right there on the passenger seat.  Not wanting to take your eyes off of the road, you blindly reach into the case and pull out a random CD.  Unbeknownst to what you are about to experience, you insert the disk into your player........ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />ATTTTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACCCKKKK!!!!!!! <br /> <br />Your auditory senses are being raped and pilaged as the sky darkens, and flames jump up from cracks in the sidewalk.  You are now head banging uncontrollably and rip open your button down shirt, barbarically growling and shrieking at the top of your lungs with no regards to the road ahead of you.  You veins are now pumping blood at triple the normal rate as your heart races to match the frantic drum patterns that powerfully penatrate your chest. <br /> <br />Four or five songs have passed now, and you have lost all sense of time and space.  You are experiencing complete transendentalism.   <br /> <br />BOOOOOOMM!!!! <br /> <br />You have struck somebody.  The impact is so brutal that a body can be seen flailing helplessly through the air.  As you witness their uninhibited acrobatics through your windshield, you notice that it almost looks artistic.  Almost like a soundtrack to the aural  mayhem that is blasting all around you.  Who had been hit?  It didn'tmatter.  They were sacrificed for the sake of rock n' roll. <br /> <br />You then swerve on to a curb at an insane level of speed, narrowly missing an elderly man.  As he yells at you out of fear and falls to the ground, subserviently, you stick your arm out of the window and flick him off with conviction, shouting obscenities before laughing hysterically with your tongue hanging out. <br /> <br />............................................................ <br /> <br />Some time later, the album finally comes to a close, and you have hit a total of six people, two dogs, grazed one fire hydrant, and finally, a telephone pole. <br /> <br />Your car is now at a complete stop, with smoke rising up from the hood and the front bumper wrapped around a telephone pole, which is now leaning at a 45 degree angle. <br /> <br />You sit completely still, eyes wide open, staring straight forward.  The neiborhood is in shambles, and the disbelief of what has happened can be felt in the air.   <br /> <br />The COPS have already arrived and begin to put the cuffs on you.   <br /> <br />After searching the vehicle, one of the officers is asked by another if any drugs were found. <br /> <br />\\"No, but I did find this,\\" the officer responds, holding up a CD.  \\"It was in the CD player\\". <br /> <br />The other officer grabs the disk from him and stares at it. <br /> <br />\\"System of A Down...Hypnotize, eh?  Hmmmmm...interesting.\\"     <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0446577383|4.0|This is the first time I've submitted a review. I've just finished The Camel Club and I enjoyed it so much I was curious to see what others had to say about it. When I read all the online reviews, I was amazed that most of the really negative reviews had more to do with politics than plot. Granted, those who strongly disagree with the political points-of-view expressed in this book will be turned off but it's a roller coaster ride of a novel with enough thrills, twists and turns to satisfy most readers of this genre. There were points in the book when I was literally \\"on the edge of my seat\\". I am a David Baldacci fan. I've enjoyed all his novels and this one didn't disappoint at all.
B000002LUB|5.0|And of course the rest of Sabbath circa 1992. I used to own this way way back in the day after receiving it accidentaly from Columbia House. I never listened to it, not even once. I eventually gave it away at some point in my teenage years, because at the time I was extremely prejudice towards any post OZZY SAB. Well, man, I recently picked this up, because after so many years... I was finally curious. I mean, I'm older now, I've broadened my horizons quite a bit since I was thirteen, and something told me that 1992's SAB reunion with DIO had to be good. Well man, I was wrong... cuz it wasn't good. No, this album is flipping unbelievable! I mean I was blown away. Songs with stupid titles such as TV CRIMES and COMPUTER GOD actually rock in spades! Excellent sh*t on this god damn thing! I'm only used to early eighties DIO (his solo and SAB stuff is what I've come to know) This stuff is way, WAY better than ANY of that stuff,.. (except maybe HEAVEN AND HELL) DIO's vocals are way more intense. He no longer sounds like a fruitcake, he actually sounds almost MEAN! Its wicked awesome! This album made my day, kids.... don't disregard this one. Disregard anything else that says Black Sabbath from the late eighties early nineties though... the rest IS absolute crap.
B000B2YQX4|3.0|OK, first I'll start by telling anyone who gets ticked by this review that I've been listening to these guys well over 16 years. The money I've spent on their music and travel to see them perform live speaks to that. So from my point of view, I am a real fan. This is not one of the easiest reviews for me to write. It took a while but I wanted some time to fairly evaluate this latest album. There are no &#34;big fan&#34; blinders on when comes to this one needless to say.<br /><br />The first couple of times I listened to &#34;Playing The Angel&#34;, I thought &#34;this is pretty good I guess&#34;. After a few more times not so much, which is usually the opposite for me. In fact some startling &#34;revelations&#34; came to light. The first of which is that Dave Gahan has clearly become a better song writer than Martin. Yes, I just wrote that! The songs that are the stand-outs (i.e. &#34;Suffer Well&#34;) are written by Gahan, not Gore. I've also compared the music from &#34;Paper Monsters&#34; and they are much better lyrically, instrumentally and sound quality wise. Dave's enthusiasm about doing his own work for the first time really shows. Martin's tracks on PTA tread the same territory we've already been before. Religion, death, etc. It seems like the band is trying to reach back in time to &#34;Songs of Faith and Devotion&#34; with a computerized approach. The bleeps and extreme noises make the album sound like a demo version, not to mention the rough production quality. The analogue synth approach should have meant a return to form, but it doesn't happen here. The references to this being the next &#34;Violator&#34; seem downright ludicrous now. The most telling flaw of this album is that the first half seems to be leading somewhere, and then the last half gets lost in some creative cataclysm. I'm willing to bet I'm not the only person to hit the skip button for the last few tracks on this album.<br /><br />When I read the band recorded this album so fast it explained a lot of things. Another reviewer who wasn't as kind wrote that this is one of the bands that &#34;should quit&#34;. I'm not sure about that just yet, but with &#34;Exciter&#34; and now this one, it would seem like Depeche Mode have run out of fresh concepts and ideas. Maybe Martin is getting tired of Depeche Mode. If you go back through the back catalogue of albums, from &#34;Speak & Spell&#34; all the way to &#34;Ultra&#34;, each album took another step toward a different sound with a successful approach. The last two albums are just sort of &#34;there&#34; and add nothing new to Depeche Mode's resume. Those two CDs just sit on the shelf while the others still find their way to my CD player.<br /><br />I'm not totally trashing PTA, it is good, but not that good.  The difference is that 10 years from now it will not get the same playing time &#34;Black Celebration&#34;, &#34;MFTM&#34; and &#34;Violator&#34; gets from many fans today. All in all, it will be largely forgotten.<br /><br />Edit 9/2015: Ten years later, I hate to say I told you so but anywho...the really sad part is Depeche Mode's work since has only gotten steadily worse, not better. I now have to say while I still love their classic albums, I no longer get any of their releases and barely flinch when an album comes out. I'll listen to the first single on YouTube, yawn and forget it. They are now all well into their 50s and it is so sad seeing Dave Gahan try to pretend it's 1988 at concerts. Please retire with dignity before it is too late.gs. Another reviewer who wasn't as kind wrote that this is one of the bands that &#34;should quit&#34;.

1400031354|4.0|Good mini mysteries with Botswana culture intertwined. I wouldn't call it a must read, but if you see it on the shelf at the library and nothing else you want is in at the moment, check it out for a quick, easy read. Some of the cases are funny, others interesting, but I wasn't drawn to the characters and it didn't leave a strong impression on me.
0802130208|5.0|The flamboyant life of Ignatius J. Reilly springs into humorous situations from start to finish. The misunderstood 'genius' of the huge character guarantees entertainment, and he's not the only extreme character. Of course, the knowledge that the writer took his own life at the age of thirty-two casts a slight shadow over the tale. I looked for clues he might've revealed through written word as to why he committed suicide. If not for the persistence of Toole's mother, readers might not have been introduced to these unforgettable characters. Readers like myself are grateful she persisted in having this delightful novel published.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay<br /><br />author of 'Souls of the North Wind'
1400034779|4.0|I enjoyed learing more about the Botswana culture from this book and the short, mini mysteries were interesting and humerous at times. It was a very quick and easy read. I'm not so sure what all the hype is about this book...it is not one that I would say is a must read, or even a book that I would pass on to a friend. I wasn't drawn into the book or touched in any way by this story, but it was a nice, relaxing read. I did also read The next one in this series and feel the same about The Tears of the Giraffe.
B00008VGL6|5.0|<br />Martin L. Gore is one of few male vocalists that give me chills down my spine. Moreover, he's an extremely talented producer, who brings some of his favorite songs to a whole new level. Actually I prefer Martin's covers to the original versions, which is just amazing. His electronica is full of soul and heart-felt, so is his singing. I hope he makes more things on his own, because he's really talented. Believe me, \\"Counterfeit\\" is a must-have.
0684824906|1.0|This is simply another white wash from the Lincoln cultists of the most despicable man to ever be President. In her typical fashion Goodwin once again ignores the truth, as she has in all of her previous books, and elevates a tyrant to god-like levels. This has become her method of operation that now serves to produce nothing more than propaganda. I found this book to be nothing more than a \\"How to be a Dictator\\" manual. Goodwin should be ashamed of herself for attempting to beatify America's first emperor! Why anyone would admire the man who destroyed our republic is beyond me!
B00005UW9T|5.0|<br />Definitely the best non-Disney animated musical. The amazing animation, clever plot, solid voice-acting - everything is just top-notch. Meg Ryan with her perky voice made Anastasia character one of the most interesting and non-cliched animated heroines. Even if you're not into animation, you should watch \\"Anastasia\\" just for the music, which is breathtaking! Such songs as \\"Journey to the Past\\" and \\"Once Upon a December\\" (beautifully performed by Liz Callaway) are already classics that just beg for a Broadway stage musical version. The movie is a brilliant entertainment for both children and adults - it's so great that you can forget it's animated! Just take my word for it.
B000AARKW6|5.0|Brilliant story, and a Pacino classic.  This film gives you all you need, with violence, drugs, gangsters, and death to Sean Penn.  The 70's feel is awesome, and the inclusion of Mafia involvement toward the end is great.  Death scenes are violent, and beautifully done.  It's no Scarface, but it's definitely for someone who loves Pacino and gangster movies.
0783219695|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  The price is good, and the extras on the special edition are great.  My only regret is buying the full-screen version by accident.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|This and this alone, is the only Christmas movie anyone would ever need.  The comical events are unparalleled, and Chase is tremendous.  The story line will keep you interested as one thing happens after another.  Cousin Eddie is in this one, and is better than his first debut.  Additional relatives are introduced and are by far a great addition to the unluckiest family to ever exist.  No Christmas is complete without the viewing of this holiday classic.
0156027321|5.0|This book is to be savored - reading sentences over and over again and earmarking pages you want to go back and read again.  An amazing (almost unbelievable) story, except you find yourself totally believing it.
B00004XPPB|5.0|This movie is by far one of the best Mafia films ever made.  Pacino is excellent, Madsen is fabulous, and Depp is great as well.  The film sticks very close to the book, minus some Hollywood fabrications.  That aside, if you are a fan of Cosa Nostra films, this is an absolute must for your collection.
B00097DXZS|5.0|I commented before about how much of a great CD that this is, so I strongly recommend that you get it. <br />I want to comment, however, on the griping about rootkits and the like. Amazon.com is gracious enough to list when CD's have this Content-Protected feature on the CD, so whenever I see that, I purchase the CD on iTunes. That way, it will work on my iPod, and I don't get the bug. Whenever you see a listing \\"Content-Protected\\", then this means it won't work on your computer, save for Windows Media Player, and definitely not your iPod. Your best bet is to purchase it off of iTunes - and it's even cheaper.
B000286RKW|4.0|This film has been hailed as a masterpiece in the Mafia Genre of movies.  Although few films have a greater cast as a powerhouse such as De Niro, Pesci, and Liotta, the history of the premise behind the film's story is shoddy.  If you have extensive knowledge of the Mafia's history, than you would also know that Henry Hill and his cohorts weren't even Mafia members.  Nonfiction accounts of these characters portray them as small timers and sometimes even laughable at best.  For what this movie is, it's great entertainment.  But if you are an aficionado of Cosa Nostra, it's not much of a story.
B00004CZVT|5.0|This is a very interesting and well written mini-series from Australia that tells the story of a group of Australian and British women and children who are captured by the Japanese at the outbreak of WW2. Separated from their husbands, they are forced to march many miles to the prison camp. Without food or medicine, they suffer many hardships. They run across a couple of Aussie POW's who give them some food. After the war one of the women goes back tho the hometown of one of the men. A not to be missed program. NOT for the faint of heart or for younger children. Stars Bryan Brown as one of the POW's.
B00008MZ0N|1.0|Crap!  I blame this movie entirely for the rage of driving cars with Chinese symbols painted on the doors with lawnmower-sounding exhausts.  A creation of Satan both actor and plot wise.  Michelle Rodriguez is an attention retainer, but that aside, Paul Walker should \\"Walk\\" himself into on coming traffic.  Complete moron.
B00012QM8G|2.0|I'm  not going to make a review of the movie itself because it's wonderful. That's as far as my praise for the DVD film will go however because the widescreen DVD is anything but. I bought my Widescreen copy not long ago and while watching the movie I always felt there was something wrong with the image. Sure enough there was. After I compaired the widescreen DVD to my old VHS full screen copy I discovered that the sides of the widescreen edition had no more image content than the VHS full screen and the top and bottom of the DVD widescreen had its image cut off. At least 20% of the top and bottom image was missing compaired to the VHS fullscreen. For example, the scene where Ralph Fiennes shoots a prisoner for stealing a chicken is telling. Right after he shoots the prisoner Fiennes is bending next to the boy who points out the chicken thief then stands straight up. On the VHS full screen we see all of Ralph Fiennes up to the rim of his hat. In the DVD widescreen we only see up to the top of Fiennes chest with his head missing completly. I can go on and on with examples and the outcome is the same. It looks as if the editors of the DVD had only a 4:3 image to work from and made the image look widescreen by cropping off the top and bottom. Universal should be embarassed for what they have done to a great movie and should fix this. I just wonder why no others have written about this.
B000002JPA|5.0|I am overqualified to make that statement, given that I have listened to, time after time, the entirety of Dream Theater's creative output. And finally, I have come to the conclusion that their sophomore effort is the best of a career spanning 2 decades. What is it about Images & Words?    The underdeveloped sound of Dream Theater here is exactly what connects with me. 'Underdeveloped' for Dream Theater is just right for me, compared to the absolutely over the top sounds of Train of Thought. Here, Dream Theater have a good vision of melody, and not letting solos encumber their music. I think that was exactly what Kevin Moore, first keyboardist of DT, brought to the set-up, a sense of restraint, for often in music, less is more. Parting ways with DT after 1994's Awake after citing a clash of opinion over which path DT should take, Moore's and DT's post-Awake creative output are highly contrasting.    The melodies here are solid and the musicianship is as ever, proficient. There's a sense of tightness and agenda on the record, and this disciplined music structure of the individual songs and the songs on the album as a whole works excellently for Dream Theater.    13 years on, I am still wondering why Dream Theater do not take the same discipline they once took to the I&W recording sessions to their new albums. Now, DT songs are pretty much vehicles for soloing. Are Kevin Moore's taste and restraint really irreplacable?
B00005JMAH|4.0|One can't say that this third entry of the Potter series isn't a good film; it's just a little disappointing with its aloofness and a time travel sequence that seems forced and contrived.  But don't blame Alfonso Cuerin; taking over for Chris Columbus, the Latin director infuses his own surrealistic and gothic style and we have some marvelous CGI effects.  The cast of youths continues to grow in their maturity and we have some fine support as always including Michael Gambon taking over for the late Richard Harris; Emma Thompson as a dotty divination teacher; a magical cameo from Julie Christie; David Thewlis, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith et al, do justice to their roles.  The preoccupation with Harry's parents has tended to grow a little redundant and Gary Oldman's character seems programmed and not as much fun as one might have expected.  But, it's enjoyable and I'm sure Potter purists are happier than punch.  I didn't find it quite as good as the previous two films, though.

B00005JNJV|5.0|When Batman Begins was announced, I (like so many others) found myself saying \\"oh no, not ANOTHER one!!!\\"  In fact, I didn't go see this one in the theater until it was almost released to DVD...one night on a boring business trip when I had nothing better to do, I strolled to the local theater and decided to check it out... <br /> <br />...and WOW. <br /> <br />If you were tired of the Batman flicks of the '90's and how they got worse with each movie, do not fear.  This one is leaps and bounds ahead of the rest (yes, even better than the first one with Jack Nicholson).  Batman Begins is, in a word, incredible.   <br /> <br />Strong performances from Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, Cillian Murphy, and others.  A fabulous storyline that is much, much more than cheesy one-liners and ridiculous comic book style visuals and effects.  And some great action sequences that will even make you say \\"WOW\\" in this era of super-sized special effects. <br /> <br />A review can't do it justice...SEE THIS MOVIE NOW!!!
B0007O38F8|2.0|This guy has done to music what McDonalds has done to chicken... turned it into something it's not and sold it to the masses. And my, do people gorge on this absolute trite. <br /> <br />The songs on this album have stripped music of any creativity and fluency, instead, looping some stolen sample and rapping, no sorry, mumbling like a geriatric turkey about how hard and rock-steady he is. <br /> <br />He's honest though, you gotta give him that... he's made it clear that it's about the money not the music. And he's responsible for every guy I see on a night out thinking they're one of his proteges and every girl I see thinking they're his bride... clonned droids with big chains of copper-come-gold plated cheap rubbish around their necks... it's a shame it hasn't strangled them. <br /> <br />Rap should be taken back to what it was meant to be - defiance, anger, politics, rage, confusion, people music... like it was in the late 80s early 90s. Eminem continues this legacy and thus should be regarded one of the few modern legends, but should be slapped across the chops with a leg of ham for introducing 50 cent to music... <br /> <br />Hopefully, music will recover from his mechanical music, but until then, run for cover. <br /> <br />Plus I hate those weird dimples on his face <br /> <br />Peace out baby <br /> <br />AND i gave it two stars instead of one because i actually really like one of the songs on the album, but i'm not saying which one! He's still poo though!
B000003TA4|1.0|Lets see, yet another collection of the same dozen Nirvana songs we've all heard ad nauseam a thousand times.  Only in the 90s could an unstable dopehead calling himself \\"Kurdt\\" be hailed as a \\"genius\\" and a \\"brilliant songwriter\\".  Kurt Cobain a brilliant songwriter?  Is that when he's on heroin or coke?  In the drug crazed world of the Seattle grunge scene of the 1990s, everybody was too stoned to see Kurt \\"Somebody Please Tell Me Where I Am\\" Cobain for what he really was----a filthy, unbathed, dirty looking lowlife----out of his mind on drugs----who wrote inane lyrics while playing the same three chords on his noisy, muddy, out of tune, distorted guitar.  \\"Wow duuuuuuuuudes!  Nirvan is like totally deep!  I can't understand anything he sings, so that must mean he's saying something profound...\\"  Most blatently hypocritical of all is the fact that this whiney, noisemaking @ss.hole became a filthy rich, multi millionaire, even as he moaned and groaned about the evils of commercialism.  Hey Nirvana fans, tell me this.  If Kurt really was so hardcore anti mainstream, than why did he make so many videos for MTV?  Why did he perform live on MTV and Saturday Night Live?  Why did he sign multi million dollar, major label record deals?  No answers to these and many other questions?  The answer is simple, Nirvana were not a real band.  They were just a corporate creation designed to exploit a trend and make their record company a fortune.  Nirvana were the Linkin Park of the 1990s.  Their music was so soulless and corporate, they might as well have dressed in suits and ties on stage.  I'm barely even old enough to remember that g0d awful piece of sh.it band Nirvana, but I still remember all the teenagers of the 90s all going around claiming that Kurt was the \\"voice of a generation\\".  Yeah right, Kurt was the voice of his record company and nothing more.  Even at the young age of eight years, I thought Nirvana were dirty looking, musically amateurish, and mostly a product of mass media promotion.  Fifteen years has only confirmed that opinion more than ever before.  Its just so blatently obvious to me now.  Nirvana were a soulless, watered down, mass produced, corporate marketing machine.  What Linkin Park is to the 21st century, Nirvana were to the 90s.  In fact, I think the members of LINKIN PARK are reincarnated versions of nirvana.  JUST LIsten to how similar these two bands sound----whiney vocals that explode into raging screams, walls of distorted guitar noise, and whiney lyrics about how miserable life is.  If it weren't for that DJ shredding his nails on the chalkboard, I wouldn't even be able to tell the difference.  In fact, there is only one good thing about Nirvana----Kurt blew his head off.  Nirvana is the worst band in the history of the world, and I'm glad they're gone.

B000BM6AVA|5.0|You can't expect a band to sound exactly the same over, what, 7 or 8 years.  But you do expect a band to maintain honesty, quality, and style, and that's exactly what system has done.  All of these songs are amazing, its just so sweet to have all this excitement built up for the release of a CD, and have it be everything you expected.   <br /> <br />Mezmerize and hypnotize should be listend to as an entire album, but it seems to me that they can be listened to in any order: <br />     If you listen to Mezmerize first, its awesome because it starts with the soldier side intro, and then hypnotize ends with the same tune <br />     If you listen to hypnotize first, the soldier side ending melts into the mezmerize soldier side intro creating a sort of interlude between the two parts. <br /> <br />Im not gonna say this is their best album, but it definitely shows how system has evolved and progressed, and it is definitely freakin AWESOME. <br /> <br />ROCK! <br /> <br />btw my girlfriend said this cd freaked her out, and i think thats friggin SWEET!!!

B00001U0E1|5.0|I know that everybody and his bodkin has seen this film, but I would like to offer a teacher's perspective.  One of my projects is to alternate scene by scene showing the Zefferelli and Baz Luhrman versions of Romeo and Juliet.  Taking a break after each scene, I have the classes (whether acting, film or English)  write their opinions of whose version in better.  At the finish we discuss any conclusions (Zefferelli almost always wins, even among the hard-case Matrix fans).  You would think after these exercises that any mention of R&J would ingnite rebellion.  The star power of Gwenneth Paltrow lures even the most obtuse student into my trap--understanding!  After listening to these lines repeated twice, the students actually \\"get it\\" when the play is presented by Shakespeare in Love.  They remember the scenes critically and they start to know it.  They feel educated.  Shakespeare is no longer so daunting.  It works.  Plus, it's a darn good film; Paltrow is magnificent in all three roles.
B0009SOFFY|5.0|How the hell do you improve on someting that's already perfect? Well, Rhino has done just that. I popped this disc in and there it was... the most menacing, swaggering riff ever, the opening for \\"Down On The Street\\". I've heard it a million times before on the original release...but here it sounds bigger, badder, and more potent than ever. Does it ease up from there? No way! The remastering of this already sonically perfect album brings it to a whole new level of intensity... as if such a thing was even possible. I won't give you a song-by-song account... they ALL sound bigger, badder, and more potent than ever, and this is one album that you just have to listen to all the way through at maximum volume to appreciate anyway. What does need to be mentioned here is the bonus disc, which is chock full of goodies... demos, alternate takes, single versions, and a previously unreleased track which to my knowlege hasn't even been included in the countless bootlegs (I've heard many) that have accumulated over the decades. The song is called \\"Lost In The Future\\", a title that would best sum up the Stooges existence. Not too many people were ready for this album at the time of it's release at the dawn of the 70's. It is only in the last few years that the rest of the world is finally catching up to it, and even that is questionable... so it only makes sense that Rhino stepped in to up the ante. There's also some great vocal banter on some of the alternate takes, which sort of clues you in to the overall vibe that was buzzing in the studio at the time of the recording. Funhouse was and still is probably the most primal and dangerous rock and roll album ever recorded. It's all here... the primordial stew from which punk, hardcore, metal, and other edgy genres evolved, but never improved upon. This is the genuine article, and it has been remastered to ultimate perfection with great liner notes and photos. If you're wondering what would make the perfect christmas present for that teenage nephew or niece that needs to be steered away from all those bland pop-punk and emo albums which are cluttering their music collections... you can't go wrong with this one.teenage nephew or niece that needs to be steered away from all those bland pop-punk and emo albums which are cluttering their music collections... you can't go wrong with this one.
0671015206|2.0|The author of The Millionaire Mind and The Millionaire Next Door has certainly stumbled onto a great idea: He's become rich by selling his books, written in pseudo-scientific jargon, how rich people live and think based essentially on their self-reported answers to surveys.  Actually, that description is a little simplistic, but not far off.  I've read both books and they are somewhat interesting for their insight (most multi-millionaires are very, very different from the celebrity trash we all see on t.v.).  However, anyone with a very basic knowledge of statistics and a practical understanding of basic psychology or human nature will have a problem with some of the conclusions that the author alludes to.  Such as: People who have their shoes repaired rather than throwing them away, people who have strong religious backgrounds, and people who avoid do-it-yourself home-improvement are more likely to become millionaires.  The author frequently makes leaps to conclusions without really analyzing the causal connection.  He also relies too heavily on self-reported answers to his surveys.  Sure, the deca-millionaire is going to tell you \\"hard work\\", \\"honesty\\", and \\"charity\\" are important to \\"being successful.\\"  But he's not going to necessarily advertise that \\"off-shore tax evasion\\", \\"sticking it to the working class\\" and \\"having blue-blood parents\\" doesn't hurt the balance sheets either.  It sometimes seems like the author was born yesterday.  One last complaint: The books could be reduced to around 50 pages if all the hokey anecdotes were edited out.  They don't add much and almost insult the intelligence of the reader (\\"To tell you how important it is to save money, let me tell you about Mr. Moneybags and how he saved money and thus accumulated money.\\").  Overall, to be clear, these books are worth reading, but I'd borrow them from a friend (or library) and save your money.
B00005JO1J|4.0|Rent as it exists as a Broadway show is a unique product of a specific time and specific place, and most importantly it plays to a certain audience because of its cast of 'starving artists' characters.  Rent as a film is difficult to capture, as the original show had a very sparse production design and the story was carried on the raw energy of the eprformers on stage.  Loosely based on Giacomo Puccini's opera \\"La Boheme,\\" Rent tells the story of Mark, a filmmaker looking to make the next great film, and his roommate Roger, who is trying damn hard to write the next great song.  Their landlord and ex-roommate Benny, who has recently become wealthy, is threatening to evict them if they don't pay a year's worth of back rent.  Benny offers to cut the pair a break if they help stop Maureen, Mark's ex, from putting on a demonstration protesting one of Benny's real estate developments.  Mark refuses, maybe partly because he was dumped for na girl, JoAnn.  In all the hubbub, the power in their building goes out, and Mimi, a stripper and drug addict who lives downstairs, comes up to get a light for her candle, and falls for Roger.  Add to the mix Tom Collins (no, I'm serious) and his new love, a drag queen named Angel, and you have the comnplete ensemble.  Of these, Tom, Angel, Mimi, and Roger have AIDS or are HIV positive. <br /> <br />On paper, this sounds a little hokey.  Keep in mind that the plot is still operatic, even if the music is rock/gospel/r&b.  The cast, most of whom were the original broadway company, are all committed, and all turn out great performances, both acting and singing.  Much of the 'sung lines' from the show have been made into dialogue, but I feel that this is necessary for a film adaptation of such a show.  Most convincing are the opening \\"Seasons of Love\\" and \\"The Tango Maureen.\\"  Some elements ahve been cut, some have been added, all for great effect.  This is not an amazing movie, but I think that this is the best possible film version of a show that is best seen live.  Director Chris Columbus has done all he could with a difficult production, which does achieve moments of honest emotion and exciting energy.  Final grade: A-/B+
0393035158|3.0|For six full pages, in the middle of a very illuminating chapter ('The Trouble with Islam') from \\"The End of Faith,\\" Sam Harris provides a list of Koranic quotations--complete with chapter and verse references--on the subject of God's justice. I admit I only skimmed it though I certainly got his point; the quotes reveal an absolutely bloodthirsty god itching to bring the fiercest cruelty to any suspected non-believer. He admits the tediousness of the exercise upon completion but I found this diversion a near-perfect encapsulation of the book: straightforward, making some excellent points ... and too long by half (at least). <br /> <br />To his credit Harris pulls few punches while drawing clear lines between the irrationality of religious faith--at least that extolled by major religions, especially (but not exclusively) Islam--and its ethical results. Not unlike the great deist Thomas Paine in his 'The Age of Reason' (clearly an influence), the author simply takes the religionists at their (literal) word--then shows where these teachings lead (and led). After a chapter devoted to explaining how and why we believe anything (which gave me some minor epistemological indigestion, but was generally well-argued), Harris digs in, starting with a gut-wrenching list of Christian crimes inflicted on heretics from medieval times to the near-present. The Jews, of course, figure prominently; Harris even finds references among anti-Semitic German (Christian) writers to \\"solutions\\" to \\"the Jewish problem\\" advocating their physical extermination ... in *1861*. <br /> <br />But his clearest arguments, of course, center on Islam. Within this chapter--the aforementioned six page diversion notwithstanding--Harris hammers home his thesis: \\"We are at war.\\" \\"... the evil that has reached our shores is not merely the evil of terrorism. It is *the evil of religious faith* at the moment of its political ascendancy\\" \\"Our enemy is nothing other than faith itself.\\" Amen (italics mine). In the plainest possible terms, Harris shows how-again, taking Muslims at their word-the Islamic belief system *inevitably* leads to terror, destruction, and death. There are no \\"moderate\\" Muslims and Islam is most definitely *not* a \\"religion of peace\\"--even if one interprets the Koran in the most liberal terms. <br /> <br />Explicitly exposing religious irrationality as evil required no small amount of courage. And when moving on to propose solutions and defenses Harris begins well: delineating, for example, how the lack of an Islamic reformation was a major contributor to its current death-worship and confrontation with the West. Pushing beyond this, however, he appears out of his depth; the fuzzy philosophical thinking apparent earlier comes back to haunt him. His epistemological (\\"the traditional opposition between reason and intuition is a false one\\") and metaphysical (some rumination on consciousness) solutions are half-baked and would be hard-pressed to convince a fanatical believer. His ethical and political solutions range from the sensible (a near-perfect skewering of pacifism) to the unexamined (\\"we need a world government\\"). <br /> <br />Still, Sam Harris earns his three stars for showing the clear ethical and political conclusions of religious faith and his (mostly current) examples are stellar. I would have had little difficulty rating this effort higher if he'd stayed on the offensive; his thin rationalizations for what might \\"replace\\" traditional religious faith lack the rigor he displays elsewhere.
0553801503|2.0|The greatest problem of AFFC is not that it was a five year wait for a setup novel that is the precursor to another setup novel (which it is). Martin is like a coach who in an important game plays his second team while the first team rides the bench. The more profound characters in whom mysteries and angst are deeply invested (Jon, Sandor, Tyrion, Dany etc.) are only shadows. <br /> <br /> For many of Martin's audience to praise the novel with 5 stars because they understand it is a 'setup novel' compounds an irrational 'Jordanesque' perception.

B000AARKOO|4.0|-- though I'll leave it to others to discuss the historical accuracy.<br /><br />Balian, a blacksmith in medieval Europe, loses his wife. He finds that the village priest not only desecrated but looted her body. This costs Balian much of his Christian faith, and costs the priest his life. Balian joins a myterious traveller on a Crusade to the holy land, one step ahead of the law, whether or not that law stands for justice.<br /><br />The rest of the story builds well. Balian enters Jerusalem, and rises in importance there. His dealings with the other Christians in charge of the city corrode his already rusted faith. Although their voices aren't as loud, he speaks as one of the secular rulers of the city, dealing as fairly as he can with Jew, Muslim, and Christian alike.<br /><br />Balian becomes ruler of Jerusalem, through improbable circumstance, and its defender when the Saracens attack. The battle scenes are dramatic. In-fighting is bloody and vicious, and the night attack on the city will horrify anyone who thinks about it. The night sky light with Greek fire isn't that different from the napalm and phosphorus attacks of our own age, in all the worst ways. In the end, the city wall falls to the catapaults, and the attackers flow in like water through a breached levee.<br /><br />Although the city falls, Balian single-handedly saves the people in it. His personal honor is known and respected among the attackers, so they trade him the brick and stone of the city for the lives of its citizens, and for their safe passage out.<br /><br />It's an exciting movie. The battles are vivid, even if parts them were computer enhanced. The people are larger than life, but not exaggerated beyond belief - perhaps that's what cost it at the box office. Ignore the critics. It's well made, with characters you can care about, and better than a lot of other quasi-historical dramas out there.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B00000ILDE|5.0|Aliens is widely acknowledged as the greatest sequel ever made. I agree, in fact it is the only sequel I can think of that eclipsed the original movie. You might say it is the PERFECT SEQUEL<br /><br />CHARACTERS:<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver .... Ellen Ripley<br /><br />Carrie Henn .... Rebecca 'Newt' Jorden<br /><br />Michael Biehn .... Cpl. Dwayne Hicks<br /><br />Lance Henriksen .... Bishop<br /><br />Paul Riser .... Carter Burke<br /><br />Bill Paxton .... Pvt. Hudson<br /><br />BACKGROUND<br /><br />Ten years before the release of the Horror/Sci-Fi action film Aliens, the original Alien broke new ground with it's suspenseful depiction of a single deadly, vicious alien, who had been born, hatched, actually from the host body - one of the crew members, of a interstellar cargo ship. The alien, had been accidentally brought aboard, when crew members went to investigate a distress signal from an uninhabited planet. Driven by instinct, with seemingly impregnable natural defenses this eight foot creature hunted and eliminated the crew, one by one and was apparently unstoppable. I won't go into this movie any further, in case you haven't seen it and if you haven't I suggest you see this appetizer first before you see the main course - Aliens<br /><br />THE PLOT<br /><br />In the preceding film, Alien, Lt. Ripley, the lone survivor of the Alien encounter, was in suspended animation in a escape pod. After fifty seven years she was rescued but hasn't aged. The giant shipping company has put her on leave, while they investigate the destruction, fifty-seven years before of their multi-million dollar cargo ship, when Carter Burke (Paul Riser) knocks on her door. It seems a colony has been established in the ensuing years, on the planet from which her space ship had been infected and communication had ceased. Burke said, a relief expedition was being organized which included a contingent of Colonial Marines and they wanted her to join. Ripley, at first, was incredulous that a colony had been set up on the deadly planet but eventually acquiesced.<br /><br />THE STORY<br /><br />Once the party had landed on the desolate forsaken planet it became obvious that the problem was indeed the aliens. No one was found alive, in fact they didn't even find bodies, the reason for which, became apparent later. Sometime later ,during a thorough exploration of the complex, the lone survivor was found, `Newt' (Carrie Henn), a frightened ten year old girl. As with the original Alien movie the humans found the aliens unstoppable, though they did manage to kill a few but they were quickly loosing the war of attrition against this merciless enemy, while they were being subverted within their ranks.<br /><br />THE BAD @SS MARINES<br /><br />Lt. Ellen Ripley/Weaver a former Space Merchant Marine returns from the original Alien Movie and forced retirement to accompany an exploratory mission with a contingent of Colonial Marines. Lt Gorman/Hope, a raw inexperienced officer, seems unable to exercise much control over his rambunctious charges or have their respect either. The most effective core of the unit seems to consist Ripley, Sgt. Alpone (Matthews), Cpl. Dewayne Hicks and Pvt. Vasquez. As a unit, their bluster and hubris is comical, especially when it becomes apparent they are no match for the enemy. Also accompanying the mission is, as in Alien, an android, Bishop/(Henriksen) and the company rep. Carter Burke, a man you grow to hate.<br /><br />WHAT'S PERFECT<br /><br />Screenplay<br /><br />Cast<br /><br />Acting<br /><br />Direction<br /><br />Special effects<br /><br />Atmosphere<br /><br />Suspense<br /><br />What`s Not<br /><br />Nothing<br /><br />TRIVIA<br /><br />The theatrical release of Aliens was July, 1986.

B00005JO1J|5.0|I will be going to see the movie again this weekend!  The music is great, the story is great, the cast is GREAT!  I even think Rosario does a decent job.   <br /> <br />You will not be disappointed.  Even my dad, a minister at our church, enjoyed it. Minus the obvious, of course.  LOL <br /> <br /> <br />La Vie Boheme!
B00006EXCC|5.0|I've had this disc for a couple of days now and here are some immediate impressions.  First of all, this is the \\"Lp\\" The Rolling Stones intended to release on both sides of the Atlantic.  The length of this session tracks at just over 53 minutes and back in those days, most Lps averaged around 40 minutes,so this is a very generous release.  The remaster is stunning.<br /><br />The CD starts out very very strong, the first 5 tracks are terrific, the sixth is also good but, and this is a big but (ha!) Going Home, which tracks at over 11 minutes is just too long for what is going on here.  Mostly a one chord vamp that has some decent interlocking guitar parts and what sounds like a fantastic harmonica solo buried down there somewhere.  The problem is that Jagger never shuts up.  There's only so much \\"going back home\\" \\"can't wait to see my baby\\" yadda yadda yadd that is necessary.  I find myself wishing he'd just shut up and let the guitars stretch out a bit.  Alas he NEVER does shut that rubber-lipped gob throughout this entire tune and it pushes the tolerance boundary to plain ol' aggravating.  But DO NOT let that put you off of purchasing this otherwise delightful session.<br /><br />Once you get through Going Home the CD picks up again and it's pure magic.  Especially listening to Brian Jones marimba parts - and marimba and vibes are used all over this CD - something that just wasn't done back then. If you are familiar with the Psychedelic Furs music you can clearly hear the influence of this CD. I'm also pretty certain Robert Smith (of The Cure) must have listened to this release when he was growing up. You can really imagine Smith covering Under My Thumb, Out of Time and Stupid Girl.<br /><br />Another standout is Lady Jane - there are new subtleties you'll hear in this mix - even some shimmering vibes here and there.  It's a beautiful little tune.  All of the tracks (except for the meandering Going Home) are par excellence.<br /><br />Another interesting thing about this CD is you can hear the seeds of musical styles The Rolling Stones would later explore, for example High and Dry could fit very nicely on Beggar's Banquet and Flight 505 wouldn't be out of place on Exile on Mainstreet.  The scope of this band's ability to play across a wide range of musical styles really is amazing and it's  demonstrated here - without being uneven!<br /><br />Again, the only negative I can write about this release is the aforementioned Going Home, the meandering isn't so bad, it's Jagger's constant improv vocal and it destroys the cohesiveness of an otherwise stellar release.<br /><br />Look, I could go on and on about Aftermath UK.  Bottom line, this really is worth your hard earned pennies.<br /><br />A word of warning on the used disks. Make sure they are the 2002 remaster before wasting your money. I once purchased a used King Crimson CD advertised along with the remasters. It was a 20 year old remaster that really sucked.the seeds of musical styles The Rolling Stones would later explore, for example High and Dry could fit very nicely on Beggar's Banquet and Flight 505 wouldn't be out of place on Exile on Mainstreet.

B000AGTPUA|5.0|I'm probably a little late coming in on this. I did not see Polar Express when it came out in theaters. I offered to take my children, and they weren't interested for some reason. We first saw it when we watched it at home after our Thanksgiving meal. What a perfect way to kick off the Christmas season. I was planning to turn it on for the kids and then leave the room, but I was hooked right away and we were all mesmerized throughout the movie. It is beautiful, exciting and touching all at the same time. I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly I fell in love with this movie. It really is in a league of it's own for Christmas movies. The music is also wonderful. I have purchased the soundtrack and it will become a Christmas classic along with the movie. I NEVER cry at a movie, but if you don't get misty-eyed during 'When Christmas Comes to Town' or 'Believe' then you have to be made of stone. No one will regret having this in their collection to pull out every year and re-live the magic. I think we will probably watch it every Thanksgiving night to kick off the season from now on. Usually when I purchase a DVD, I think long and hard about how often I will really watch it and if it will be worth the cost. I didn't think twice about this one. I am very proud to own this DVD and know it will bring many, many years of joy.
068987474X|3.0|I was working the closing shift(till 12 AM) at my local Borders bookstore a couple days ago when I got bored and decided to open up a mini version of this book. I recall, last year, when a bunch of younger females would come in(or call) and ask for this particular book.     My preconcieved perceptions were \\"I hate this book\\" and \\"I hate the people who are into this book\\". Just seemed like typical \\"robotized\\" thinking for a particular group of people to be all attracted(societal and media programming) to the same thing.    To my surprise, the book was fairly entertaining(for a short period at least). Some of the advice-even though obvious-seemed pretty solid. As a naturally shy guy, I would like to caution the ladies on one piece of advice: about the guy not asking you out(or for your phone #). The author basically paints the situation as like if the guy doesn't make a move, he's not really into you..WRONG!    There have been a handful of ladies that I have been really attracted to(at school,work,others) but was too damned shy(and nervous) to even ask for the girl's phone number(much less asking her out). Fortunately, I have been able overcome this shyness(I've been able to approach reasonably well without too much nervousness recently). I've lost out on many dates because I was too nervous to let my feelings be known.    Anyhow, the guy can REALLY be into you; he's just too shy to let you know. Doesn't mean he's a bad guy. So the book is good for some single-layered entertainment and a mixed bag as far as advice. Love yourself, trust your own instincts, and good luck with finding true love.
0723241120|1.0|These books were great back in 1909, but now they don't talk to children about their world. They don't even talk about a world of yesteryear in a way that is useful or entertaining. The illustrations are good and can be used to make up a story that is more interesting and understandable to children, but why should this be necessary?
B000BBOUU4|1.0|This movie was such a disappointment on so many levels. It turned a belved childrens story into one describing a twisted psychopath who isn't warm or endearing just nuts. Depp's portayal of Willie Wonka makes the character out to be the type that yo'd tell your kids to stay away from and definetely not to take any candy from. The Oompa Loompa songs have been changed to \\"Rap\\" and the lessons learned are lost in a sea of political correctness (Won't call a kid a brat, etc). Doo yourself a favor and forget this abomination and get the 1971 version.
0887306101|5.0|There are 1000's of trading books available. They can be divided into four categories: books about trading written by non traders (most are in this category; don't waste your time or money on them), books about traders written by non traders (most are worthless), books about trading written by traders, and books about traders written by traders. This book is the best book available in the latter category. If you need a book about technical indicators, this isn't it. If you need a book to get a glimpse at the thought processes of successful traders, this is it. Jack has the remarkable ability to ask relevant and productive questions of some of the most successful traders of our time.
0553106635|5.0|The confrontation among the different candidates to the throne in this third book in the series is heating up, and the supernatural elements begin to have more and more relevance. Joffrey Baratheon is currently sitting as acting king, but there are several challengers to his power, including his \\"uncle\\" Stannis, Robb Stark, the king in the north, and the last of the Targaryen, Daenerys, who is coming with her three dragons! (Reader's should thank Phyllis too for making Martin put in the dragons)<br /><br />This setup, together with an abundance of interesting sub plots make this the most entertaining fantasy series I have ever encountered. For example, Jon Snow is beyond the wall in the north and has proven his loyalty to the wildlings by killing a brother. He is acting as a spy but without the rest of his brothers from the Night Watch knowing it, and while the Night Watch prepares to defend the wall against the wildlings and the Others (terrifying undead creatures), Jon needs to find a way to help them. But at the same time he needs to keep the wildlings' trust and deal with the added inconvenience of love.<br /><br />One of the characteristics that make this series so remarkable is that the author establishes extremely interesting situations in which the characters need to be extremely cunning to succeed in their quest. In this regard, one of my favorite characters is Tyrion Lannister, the Imp, who is a dwarf that was almost killed in the previous book and in the process was disfigured and left even uglier than he already was. He has only one weapon, his intelligence, and seeing him use it is a true pleasure. The fact that as happens with many other characters in the series, it is hard to determine if Tyrion is \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\", makes him even more interesting. The match of brains between Tyrion and Littlefinger will satisfy the most demanding of readers and leave you smiling with pleasure. To sum up this idea, there is nothing better than to let Tyrion's father express it in these simple terms: \\"Some battles are won with swords and spears, others with quills and ravens\\".<br /><br />The second aspect of the series that is a true delight is Martin's willingness to let go of characters, and by this I simply mean: he kills them without remorse! Some people may find this to be a negative point, since you may become attached to a character and the author kills it when you thought he was going to be the hero of the story. But I find this extremely refreshing and makes the books even more interesting for me, because the author keeps us on our toes and constantly wondering what the next surprise will be.<br /><br />Finally, I enjoy the non-linear aspects plot, with the author jumping around from one character's viewpoint to the next. In this installment, besides alternating among characters and locations, he goes a back and forth in time due to the long time span of some events, but the action it is still easy to track and enjoy. Besides those characters I already mentioned, this novel deals mainly with Arya Stark, the youngest sister of the king in the north (Robb), who is on the run from Joffrey's claws; Sansa Stark, the oldest sister, who is still trapped in the castle from which her sister escaped, Catelyn Stark, the mother who is desperate to get her daughter's back, Jaime Lannister, Tyrion's brother who is the real father of king Joffrey and not his uncle, and many others colorful characters.<br /><br />Martin has created and developed an amazing setting for his story, and the situations that he continues to present keep us constantly engaged and eager to know what will happen next. With the recent release of \\"A Feast for Crows\\", some of the storylines that are left in suspense in this novel will be resolved, but since this new book deals only with events in the south, we will have to wait until the next installment to know what is going on in the north. One thing is clear to me, as long as George R. R. Martin keeps them comingI will keep reading them.hem coming I will keep reading them.

B00004TS0E|3.0|The 1994 version of Miracle on 34th Street is a remake of the classic 1947 version.  It is known to be a great movie to bring holiday cheerfulness to everyone who views it.  It is about a little girl who doesn't believe in Santa Claus and then meets a white haired, jolly old man who says he is St. Nick himself.  It is a very cute movie to watch with family and friends. <br /> The 1994 version goes into more depth than the old version.  It also has a different ending.  I'm not a fan of how the '94 version ends.  I feel that it never should have been changed.  This might be a spoiler for anyone who hasn't seen the '47 version, but I enjoyed how all the mail sent to Kris Kringle (Santa Claus) was dumped on the judge's desk.  It was a very clear and cute ending.  I feel that the newer ending is kind of unclear.  All that it says is that everyone must believe in something or someone.   <br /> I also don't agree with the love scene in the new version. In the old version, the director successfully got away with excluding a love scene.  The attention was more toward Kris Kringle and Susan spending time together.  It seems that almost every movie has a love story these days and I feel that the love scene between Dorey and Bryan is very unnecessary.  <br /> If I were to recommend someone a good Christmas movie, Miracle on 34th Street would be a great choice.  Except, I would recommend the original 1947 version, but they are both wonderful choices.        <br />
B000A7S4B0|4.0|I first saw BRMC on tour with the Waterboys some years ago and was immediately captivated, having been a die-hard shoegazer fan in the late '80s. I ran out and bought BRMC then Take Them on Your Own. After waiting what seemed like an eternity, I bought Howl from Amazon without even hearing one song. I first thought I had the wrong group. However, after several listens, this album has grown very high on my list.<br /><br />I would say this album has it all - rock, country, blues, folk - everything U2 tried to do with Rattle and Hum.  Most important, the passion present on the previous two albums is very much alive. What a wonderful departure.<br /><br />As for the DRM, I run only Linux so have not noticed an issue.  I rpped the album to my hard drive in OGG format without a problem.

Throughout movie history there has been a long list of bad sequels which, more or less, is what this prequel was.  Caddyshack II, Godfather III, and Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey, all horrible follow ups to great films.  So naturally I was a little worried that the film Red Dragon was going to be just another flop that followed a great film.  Any movie that follows a great film like Silence of the Lambs has a lot to live up to.  Personally, I thought that the first sequel to Silence of the Lambs,  Hannibal, didn't quite achieve that, and neither did Red Dragon.  It was a decent movie, but not quite as shocking and suspenseful as the first.  Don't get me wrong it did have its share of shock value, but since it didn't come first I had already come to expect that.  I thought that the writers would take the time and effort to make sure that this film was as good if not better than the first two films, but clearly their work shows otherwise. <br />  All in all, this movie disappointed me for several reasons.  As I mentioned before, the lack of violence and shock that were so prevalent in the first movie and that I, as a fan of the films, had come to expect.  But mostly, it was the fact that this movie was nothing more than a film that was made in the eighties with a different title and better actors.  I've never been a fan of remakes and this film was certainly no exception.  <br />
B000B8QEZG|4.0|This is definitely the Madonna we've been missing, but didn't even know it.  No more politics, thank the Lord.  Though admittedly, most of the sound of this album isn't anything Kylie Minogue hasn't been doing for years overseas.  Oh well, most U.S. listeners will never know the difference.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|...it's so much better than I expected.<br /><br />I didn't remember watching the trailers as I started watching the movie.  As soon as the bar scene with River came on, it clicked into place - I wasn't supposed to see this movie, it looked *horrible* in the previews.  Thank goodness a friend of mine lent me the Firefly DVDs, I was excited and didn't even remember the horrible previews (who made them?!  Not the director, I would have to imagine).  It's really too bad that the little marketing there was for this movie, it was downright unrepresentative.  This western (that happens to be set in space) has everything going for it - *fantastic* actors, *amazing* writers, and complimentary (and not distracting) special effects.<br /><br />There had to have been some conspiracy to keep this movie down because it was perfect.
B000BCKFWK|5.0|While I'm thrilled they're releasing this with 2 discs and lots of extra's, I'm a little miffed they're double dipping!

Happy it's here, but mad they double dipped! Oh well!
0316168815|4.0|I think this book is very well written and the author makes the characters extremely accessible.  This is not however, light reading.  It is heartbreaking and at times I just wanted it to be over.  That said, I look forward to reading more novels by Alice Sebold for her profound skill in storytelling.
B00005JNX0|5.0|I had to buy this movie for my son; he is absolutely crazy about it!  He'd seen it before it came out on DVD; I wasn't too impressed by the advertisements, but once I'd seen it I really enjoyed it...but in my opinion the pengiuns & the (absolutely clueless!) King Julien stole the show! My son could watch this all day long...my favorite parts of the DVD was the Penguin Christmas feature & the \\"I Like to Move It, Move it\\" video! (Hey, couldn't help it; the music's catchy!)
0399236201|5.0|Stormbreaker is about a kid named Alex Rider. Alex's parents died when he was young, so he was sent to live his uncle. His uncle Ian Rider worked at a bank.  Alex is told that his uncle died in a car accident, because his uncle Ian wasn't wearing a seat belt. Alex knows that didn't really happen because Ian always wore his seat belt. He finds out that his uncle wasn't in a car accident, but he was murdered. His uncle was a secret agent. Alex is trained to be an agent like Ian. Alex mission is going under cover and stay with a Herod Sayle. He then finds out who killed Ian Rider. A lot of things happen to Alex while he is undercover. <br /> <br /> In this book Alex got to blow up an ATV. I think that would be fun to blow things. I wouldn't care if it was an ATV or not as long as got to blow something up. Another thing I liked was that he was able to swim under water without an oxygen tank for a couple minutes. What I didn't like was that it didn't tell much about Ian Rider. <br /> <br /> Someone who would like this book would be someone who likes adventure books. Another person that like this book would be someone who likes to read mystery books. This is a mystery book because Alex is trying to find out who killed Alex Rider. <br />

B00005JNEI|4.0|It has been a while sense I have watched this movie. At the time it was released, I drove over 100 miles to see it (as it was sold out locally).<br /><br />  It's still a thought provoking movie. Looking at current events and what was depicted in the movie, it is interesting just how on the money Moore was with most of his conclusions. Bush DID start this war, an unjust war that we are still in (Congress never declared war, BTW).<br /><br />  The extras on the DVD are very good and brings some of the info in the movie up to date. A good, solid film.
B000002UDB|4.0|This was pretty much started back when the Beatles were recording Sgt. Pepper. \\"Strawberry Fields\\" and \\"Penny Lane\\" were released as a single in Feb.1967. \\"All You Need Is Love\\" and \\"Baby You're A Rich Man\\" in July of 67, and then the rest were done over the next few months, and released a movie. This was all done under alot of pressure, and stress as manager Brian Epstien died of an overdose, and trying to step back into the limelight. Unfortunately, the movie was never show on television in America because the critics over in England felt it was horrible. I actually rented the movie one time, and didn't get past the \\"I Am The Walrus\\" segment as I just felt that it was too bizarre. The rest of the songs were slapped together hodge podge, and they are of pretty decent material. I found \\"Flying\\" and \\"Blue Jay Way\\" to be the best of the bulk of these sessions. I find \\"Strawberry Fields\\" to be my other favorite; I remember hearing it the first time in a Pizza Hut resturant in Sept. of 78. I meant to play \\"Penny Lane\\", but I accidentally hit for \\"Strawberry Fields\\", and by the end of the song I liked \\"Strawberry Fields\\" better. This was where the Beatles began reckless abandonment of Beatlemainia, and moving towards individuality.
B0001LJC2K|1.0|Let's just say it and be done with it. <br /> <br />Muse was not inspired by Radiohead.....Muse IS radiohead, at least they think they are. <br />My god, everytime this comes on I have to double check it because I just can't believe Radiohead is not in this band somewhere.  They get 1 star because there is no originality here....none. <br /> <br />If you like Radiohead, you might like Muse.  You see, I love Radiohead, but I hate this rip-off band with a passion because there is absolutely nothing new or different from Radiohead here.  Don't bother looking. <br /> <br />I guarantee one thing though, those who like Muse, also like Radiohead.
020530902X|5.0|This important little reference book was introduced to me as required reading in middle school by an English teacher who obviously knew her stuff.  I took it to college and used it as a reference tool for grammar and usage rules, and later I kept it on my bookshelf at work.  When I decided to write a novel, I re-read The Elements of Style as a primer.  Currently, I'm referring to it again as I'm writing academic papers in grad school.<br /><br />I have worn through three copies of this book over the years, and I'm sure there'll be several more in my future.  It has become one of the most useful books in my collection.<br /><br />If only all writers were required to read The Elements of Style ... what better writing there'd be in this world!  What I love about the book is that it practices what it preaches:  \\"Omit needless words!\\"  Everything you need to know about the basic art of better writing is in this wonderful little book.  Not a word is wasted.
0895260131|5.0|Do Moslems want to take over the world?  This book shows why the answer is yes for an alarming number of Islamic followers.  The counter question, don't most religions want to see the world converted to their belief system is also addressed here.  Christians want the people of the world to follow Christ, to be sure, however most Christians (all the main line denominations) don't want to live under a particular \\"Christian Flag\\".  We want our governments to be secular, religion protected by the state with religious freedom for all citizens.<br /><br />This idea of religious freedom, fought for by the first colonialists to North America and refined by the the states as they ratified the Constitution, shares nothing with the Islamic ideal, which is all people either being converted, subjugated or eliminated.<br /><br />This book goes over early Islamic history, including the life of Mohammed and explains how the religion of Islam is religion of war.  It shows how those that deny this and proclaim that Islam is a religion of peace are either changing the definitions of words or they have never read and understood the Koran (which is the case in a very high percentage of adherents).  The bottom line is that a high number of Islamist's want Islamic rule over the planet and they want it the same way Mohammed got and retained power, by force and by the sword.  This is simple and plain history, to deny it is either ignorance or trickery, and this book shows over and over again why.<br /><br />One of the cool features of this book are the Jesus v. Mohammed quotes.  Basically Jesus said turn the other cheek, love everyone and he died to prove his love.  Mohammed on the other hand said convert or subjugate and if that doesn't work, kill.  While Jesus remained single and served others, not amassing wealth, Mohammed took wives (some not even teens yet) and amassed wealth through raids and murder.<br /><br />Why this history is controversial is pretty basic, the Mohammedans, similar to other groups like Mormons (which also have a history of bloodshed), have to conceal or try to change the meanings behind what their leaders wrote and said because if they don't,  they either look like fools or bloody savages.  This book shows clearly and convincingly why this is the case, from the start of Islam, through the crusades and the twin towers right to the present day.<br /><br />Dismiss the spirit behind Islam at your own peril, there may be a few crazy Christians out there, but for the most part, they ain't hacking off heads, blowing up shoppers and flying planes into buildings.  And remember, when that Muslim tells you he's not like that, just remember, he isn't really following Islamic teachings then (which is a good thing).  And also remember, if just one percent of Islamic followers wants to kill you, that's some 10 million people worldwide.  Something to think about., similar to other groups like Mormons (which also have a history of bloodshed), have to conceal or try to change the meanings behind what their leaders wrote and said because if they don't,  they either look like fools or bloody savages.  This book shows clearly and convincingly why this is the case, from the start of Islam, through the crusades and the twin towers right to the present day. <br /> <br />Dismiss the spirit behind Islam at your own peril, there may be a few crazy Christians out there, but for the most part, they ain't hacking off heads, blowing up shoppers and flying planes into buildings.

1577312082|5.0|I really don't know how anyone can listen to Eckhart or read his books and not feel something. I wonder if the people here who gave such bad reviews really tried anything he suggests.<br /><br />Put you attention in the body for a while and see how it feels different than normal waking life.<br /><br />It really will work if you just remember to do it. It's easy to read a book or listen to a CD and say \\"that doesn't work\\". Just try it and see for yourself.<br /><br />Eckhart Tolle even says that some people won't find his book helpful if they aren't ready to do it yet. If you're not ready to actually do what he says then fine, but to come on here and say that his teaching doesn't work is just misleading. It's going to be very helpful for some and not for others. It just depends where you are in your journey.<br /><br />As for the question of \\"is Eckhart enlightened?\\", how can anyone know that or judge him? An enlightened person couldn't care less if people say he is or isn't enlightened.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|Not that long ago when Madonna appeared on the cover of GOOD HOUSEKEEPING, I almost choked on the bottled water I was drinking at the time. Thankfully, Mom Madonna still has some of the diva left in her and isn't hanging up her party hat anytime soon. Though her AMERICAN LIFE was pretty much beaten to a pulp by critics and even some fans, I have to admit I liked it a lot (especially \\"Nobody Knows Me\\") Even so...It's been a long time since I played a Madonna CD from beginning to end and loved it more with each listen! (I'm not ashamed to admit I enjoyed 1992's EROTICA as much as LIKE A VIRGIN, though the latter is far superior and is of fine 80s vintage.)<br /><br />There's no question that Madonna still knows her stuff, even if her voice is sometimes buried beneath lots of electronica. Six particularly strong pop songs appear here, a collection desperately needed in our current music world where good dance (or exercise) music is hard to find.<br /><br />Though I got a kick out of the entire ensemble and still find myself hitting \\"repeat\\" on the stereo, the following six are the tracks that got to my ears and feet the most:<br /><br />\\"Hung Up\\": Even with all its exposure from MTV to \\"CSI: Miami,\\" this song manages to capture the listener's attention right away and not just because of its techno beginning and ABBA sample (I'm easy for ABBA, something that I probably shouldn't admit.)<br /><br />\\"Sorry\\": When she sings the line \\"...I've heard it all before,\\" Madonna sounds wise, world weary and full of life all at the same time. Where many dance songs require a certain amount of joy before your feet want to dance, all Madonna asks is that you have enough energy. That's one reason CONFESSIONS affects me so much. You can be in a thoughtful mood and still want to dance your heart away.<br /><br />\\"I Love New York:\\" Okay, so the line with \\"dork\\" in it is pretty hard to swallow (Madonna a dork?) but she gets extra credit for going with the different here! Celebrate the silliness of that word and the rock n' roll edge throughout \\"New York.\\" The more I listen to this one the more I hear its brilliance!<br /><br />\\"Get Together\\" and \\"Jump\\" both share a certain lulling rhythm that made Kylie Minogue's hit \\"Can't Get You out of My Head\\" so appealing. The strongest, most Madonna-like moment of \\"Jump\\" takes place when she sings: \\"Are you ready to jump/get ready to Jump/don't ever look back oh baby/yes I'm ready to jump/just take my head\\"...It's so infectious you can't help but get up and move, especially with the underlying hand claps (Who among us, after all, can resist the age-old hand clamps of pop?)--You may never pine for \\"Vogue\\" again after hearing this one!<br /><br />\\"How High\\" is the perfect blend of 70s disco and modern synth. From the opening lines (\\"How high are the stakes/how much fortune can you make?\\") to its segue into the autobiographical (\\"I did it, just about everything to see my name in lights\\") \\"How High\\" lifts you off the dance floor and into the stratosphere where songs such as \\"Push\\" (a great song about having a higher power to guide you in life) continue to drive home the beat!!<br /><br />No matter which track keeps you going, there's no doubt that like all great dance albums, CONFESSIONS never loses its footing. Nowhere does it drag or make you want to sit one out on the sidelines. It's sort of fitting that it closes with the cynically spunky \\"Like it Or Not,\\" a song that captures Madonna's lay it on the line spirit!!l edge throughout \\"New York.\\" The more I listen to this one the more I hear its brilliance!    \\"Get Together\\" and \\"Jump\\" both share a certain lulling rhythm that made Kylie Minogue's hit \\"Can't Get You out of My Head\\" so appealing.

B0006DTZPC|5.0|While this is short playlist, you'll still love hearing Michael sing the holiday hits and you'll be sure to have it on 'repeat.'  I was lucky to be able to grab it while it was in stock.  I hear it's not available in stores in very many places.  If you come across it, grab it!

The browncoats are still going strong! <br /> <br />And despite terrible dvd cover art, I will be buying this movie immediately. What matters is what's inside, and what's inside is an amazing, fun, thought-provoking film.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|I think this the best system of a down album to date.  Mezmerize and Hypnotize show a true groth in the right direction.  Over time bands have to evolve in order to stay fresh and system has done just that.  From this point the sky is the the limit and evan though premature, I can't wait for the next one or the next tour.  If you are a system fan this album and Mezmerize are both MUST HAVES!

B000AGTPUU|5.0|What a fantastic story line, great actors, GREAT computer graphics...did I mention fantastic story line? I highly recommend this movie about the story of believing, not so much in Santa Clause but believing in yourself!! This movie will be or should be a Christmas classic, up there with It's a Wonderful Life and Charlie Brown's Christmas. I recommend this movie for children and the older kid's at heart. It's a wonderful movie for ALL ages!!!
B00004ZAV3|3.0|First note that every song on this album is excellent; I am not a tone-deaf Beatle-basher. The problem is with the assemblage of this compilation. First of all, the idea of a Beatles Greatest Hits Album of any kind is ridiculous. Greatest Hits albums are excellent, economical choices for bands whose music came was received primarily as singles, or whose albums contained a great deal of filler. However, when we discuss the truly definitive voices of rock and roll, compilations become unnecessary in lieu of the quality of the albums. Beatles' albums are not haphazhard collections of radio hits, but coherent works of popular art. Most of their songs are good alone, but they are tremendous in the context of an entire album. <br /> <br />The second major problem with 1 is that it is not even a good representative compilation. It contains no songs from \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" or \\"The White Album,\\" and only two from \\"Revolver\\" and \\"Abbey Road,\\" widely considered 4 of the group's 5 best albums. Instead, 1 draws heavily on The Beatles' early years, and these songs, good as they are, do not match some of the later work for artistic creativity. <br /> <br />With the advent of music downloads, 1 is completely obsolete. If you're interested in the Beatles, ask nearly anyone you know, and they'll be able to give their two cents on the band's best work. Download what others regard as the best songs, several from each album, or better yet, go out and buy the original albums. Then, if you so desire, burn a righteous Beatles mix. Chances are, it won't look anything like 1.
B000BBOUU4|4.0|I say that and still give it 4 stars. As I thought the new make on this movie was good but not fantastic. I mainly watched it because of Tim Burton and his creativity. Bright colors, odd sense of humor. So thus, I enjoyed the movie. I also liked Johnny Depp and I think he did a fantastic job but no one can replace Gene Wilder!! I suggest picking up the movie as there are a couple of things that are new (that I don't remember in the orginial). But don't forget to get the orginial as well! ENJOY the movie!!

0802130208|5.0|I will dispense with any plot summary and focus primarily on the heart of the book- Ignatius Reilly, a character not without precedent but one without peer. <br /> <br />Ignatius's medieval fixations are a valuable clue to understanding this novel. Despite being written in prose, and set in 20th century America, this novel is best read as a Shakespearean comedy. Indeed, many reviewers have already described Ignatius as Falstaffian, and that comparison is not without value. However, that is only a starting point. I feel delving into Ignatius's personality in more depth, rather than settling for a blanket comparison, is the best way to understand the protagonist of the novel. <br /> <br />A Confederacy of Dunces is not a happy novel. It is often extremely funny, but there is defintely a melancholy feeling underlying the whole text. This is uncharacteristic of modern comedy, where even in moments of tension the tone is still light. Classical comedies, in contrast, need only a positive ending, and can be dark in tone- I say Shakespearean because I admit that those are the only classical comedies I have read. <br /> <br />Why is the novel so sad? That is difficult to define. While Ignatius faces many problems, he is never in real danger of anything more than loss of money or dignity (both of which he has little to lose anyway). The pathos lies in Ignatius himself. Ignatius (and herein lies his uniqueness) is a compedium of the many unpleasant personality traits intelligent people are in danger of developing. Need proof? <br /> <br />We can start with the fact that he is overly proud of his education. He displays the smug love of his own knowledge that has led to his feeling superior to the uneducated masses around him. As other people haven't paid him the respect he feels he deserves, he feels like a misunderstood genius. I'm sure we've all encountered someone with an ego so large they attribute all their problems to other people's inability to understand them. This is only a partial list, but Toole does a better job showing then I ever could telling (and show, don't tell, is one of the building blocks of good writing). <br /> <br />While we may be annoyed when we meet people like this in real life, Ignatius is portrayed sympathetically. He clearly had great potential, and throughout the book Toole constantly reminds us that Ignatius has his Master's, is an educated man, yet has come to (latest plot development). We mourn Ignatius's wasted potential, at the same time we pity him. He wishes for a life with no challenges, which means he would never grow as a person (pun about his weight gain most definitely intended). <br /> <br />Here, at last, we come to the beauty of Toole's characterization. Despite his squandered potential, sad life, and miserable circumstances, these struggles are the only way Ignatius can grow as a person. Indeed, Ignatius does mature throughout the novel, but only slightly. He is too set in his ways, too far gone, to become a new man. It is to Toole's credit that he realizes this. Not only does he draw an absurd man with a true writer's talent, he accomplishes the much more difficult task of making him change over time without losing that realism. <br /> <br />Looking beyond the character of Ignatius, Toole's whole novel is exactly that- the absurd, the unlikely, the bizarre, drawn realistically, and with compassion. Although the book has slight flaws (and what book doesn't?), Toole has successfully created an unique character, then skillfully portrayed his life. In the simplest analysis, Toole has something new to say, and he says it well. What more reason could one need to read a book?
B0001AP12G|5.0|Y'all be hatin on Kanye West too much but I'm just hear to say this dude is better than 50 Cent, Tony Yayo, Baby a.k.a. Birdman, and Bow Wow. This dude can spit the truth and still the song will be tight. His debut album \\"College Dropout\\" is a great way for Kanye West to start. Cop this album if you haven't already.
B000AGTPUK|4.0|I found this movie to be a wonderful delight.  Tom Hanks did a wonderful job in the several different characters he played in this animation story of a child who has stopped believing in Santa Claus.  Besides the wonderful animation, which is a must see, the story begins with a young boy who has stopped believing in Santa Claus, and in an attempt to restore the boys belief in Santa Claus, A Train arrives at the boys house, (The Polar Express), and takes the boy on a magical train ride where the fun and magic begins.  Eventually after a long journey through the wilderness, and across many glaciers the train arrives at the North Pole only to find out that not even one minute has passed, which also makes the film a little more magical and mysterious.    But I think what really pulled this film together for me, and made it a wonderful delight to see, was how Santa sought out the one boy who had lost all belief in him, and gave him a present (a sleigh bell) which could only be heard by those who believe in Santa, and restored the hope and belief of a young boy.   I rate this film four stars, because of the wonderful animation, and the storyline.  A must see Family Film, which is safe for children of all ages.
0767812387|4.0|This movie is great. Vanessa Williams is not only beautiful, but you would think she has been competing in professional Latin dancing for real-she is very talented. Chyayanne also heats up the dance floor and is very charming-not to mention easy on the eyes. The dance scenes are HOT!! It is loaded with not only great dances, but great Latin music and likable characters. It is fun from beginning to end and will leave you wanting to hit the dance floor!!! <br /> <br /> <br />  <br />  <br /> <br />
B00009V7T2|4.0|Really, what can I say about this album?<br /><br />It took me so long to get my head round it and even now I don't think I can truly say I ever have.<br /><br />The guitars, vocals, drumming all add up to make a very interesting album, full of layer and depth and even feeling, if you can see through the layers.<br /><br />I don't recommend it to anyone who is a little un-adventerous with music, but if you are, buy it now!!
038551123X|1.0|Okay, in the interest of full disclosure, I'm not generally a reader of murder/suspense books. I picked this up because I thought the premise was interesting and read some decent reviews.  A serial killer who goes around killing other, \\"bad\\", serial killers.  Could be great, right?<br /><br />The premise is good, but the writing is just terrible.  I couldn't even finish it.  I get it -- the narrator (Dexter) has no real feelings but he can fake them really well.  He doesn't recognize/acknowledge other people's realities, only his own.  How do I know this?  Because the author tells me this (in pretty much these exact words) over and over again starting on page 1.  A little bit of \\"Show, don't tell\\" would have made a world of difference here.<br /><br />It's too bad, I really wanted to like it.
B000BOH8XW|5.0|Oral Fixation Vol.2 is an amazing album, one of Shakira's best, well I can't say this because they're all perfect and amazing so I can't determinate which one is the best one. <br />What I specially love about it is the sound mixture she does in this album, you can hear a piece of everything and I Love That! <br />1. How Do You Do ?: An amazing song, the music is really cool and the topic is a little hard to express, I think it is a song written to God it's great and it leads you to a reflection about it. <br />2.Don't Bother: The first single, awesome, it's a really cool song I think Shakira rocks in this one, it has nice lyrics and the melody is outstanding. <br />3. Illegal: Really good,she shines on this one with her amazing voice, the guitar sounds awesome (it's played by Santana), it's a cool song with nice lyrics. <br />4. The Day And The Time: \\"Día Especial\\" in English, I think is better in English, the sound is awesome. <br />5. Animal City: Really great sound! Different Music! Excellent Lyrics. Some critics to society I like that! <br />6. Dreams For Plans: It's great, a ballad, cool lyrics. it rocks! <br />7. Hey You: One of my very best favorites, the music is unique I love that kind of music like a Broadway musical it's great! <br />8. Your Embrace: The sound is similar to the \\"Dreams For Plans\\" one but as well as that one it rocks! <br />9. Costume Makes The Clown: One of my favorite, the chorus is so sticky I love it I can't stop singing it! Rock music! <br />10. Something: \\"En Tus Pupilas\\" in English like the original lovely I can't say which one I love the most! <br />11. Timor: Excellent, dedicated to that small country, I love that she talks about it, the problems the world is going through now. I love the lyrics! They make you think!   <br /> <br />In summary it is an amazing piece of art, I love each single song!  <br />I highly and strongly recommend everybody to get a copy now!  <br />Are You A Shakira Fan? <br />Go online to [...]/shakirarocks1
0525948023|4.0|I really liked the message this book offers.  He writes simply what all the other messengers are trying to say. BE PRESENT with yourself.  It doesn't make the pain stop, or the ego cease its function, but merely puts one into awareness of it without allowing your thoughts to carry you away into a non-existance \\"what if\\" mode.<br /><br />I think of the ego like a child. This kid is kicking and screaming to have what they want any way they can get it.  We don't usually allow that child to have his way, especially when you know it's not good for the child or others, so you don't take it too seriously. It will pass in a few moments. The mature adult dealing with this child may be seen as cold, uncaring, or even aloof. In reality and choice, they simply aren't going to get involved in that child's manner of behavior or expression, while still being quite aware of what's going on.<br /><br />So why would we judge the immature ego in ourselves and others as anything different?  Adults do the same thing as children, they just find more \\"acceptable\\" ways of dealing with what they want and don't want in life. Either way you slice it, it's all ego.  And Tolle is pointing out how we unconsciously allow our immature egos to take over and perpetuate through knee-jerk reactions, or contemplated 'what if' thoughts of what could or should be. Just be present, aware, attentive to your own self. (Self awareness) It keeps everything inside you in check, smooth-going, less complicated, clearer.  Why would you bother, you ask?  Because eventually we get sick of it and want the pain to stop.  We start to grow up.<br /><br />Tolle is gently explaining to us how to grow up. The \\"doing\\" is up to us.<br /><br />Furthermore, I didn't use to understand Tolle's \\"pain-body\\" euphemism.  After reading this book I began to get a clue.  I have noticed that when I am around negative people that they tend to make negative things happen around them, orchestrate negative reactions, or simple leave a \\"bleh\\" feeling behind or with them.  From what Tolle says, and it makes sense, that this is part of or IS the pain body spreading itself.  You can even notice it in yourself at times; looking to start trouble because we're miserable for a moment.  Again, if we are aware, we can choose not to feed it.  You'll find the misery pointless and a time waster.<br /><br />I figure it this way, we have at least 3 choices with almost everything we encounter in life.  We can get totally involved while submersing ourselves to satisfy some idea/belief that we want or need an experience, or we can be present without taking it personally, or simply walk away. But how can we know those choices unless we become conscious and  present with ourselves and see it as it is inside and out?<br /><br />And for you those who think Tolle is a \\"MAN\\", and all this is stemming from his male ego, try Byron Katie. She says the same thing AND walks you through simple steps of \\"how\\". A message is a message, and a story is simply a story; Just a matter of HOW one is willing to accept it.e leave a \\"bleh\\" feeling behind or with them.

B000BKDOCA|4.0|BRITNEY SPEARS <br />B IN THE MIX: THE REMIXES--- <br /> <br />U.S. VERSION <br /> <br />1---Toxic (Peter Rauhofer Reconstruction Mix Edit) 6:45: This is actually an remix edit, yet it lasts for almost seven minutes. However, this is a pretty good remix for someone like Peter Rauhofer. I was never a big fan of his remixes - the only one I really liked was his one for American Life (the American Anthem Part 2). This is quite a good remix, though, even if it isn't fantastic. If you are a fan of Rauhofer's remixes, however, this is a must-listen. 4/5 stars.  <br /> <br />2---Me Against The Music featuring Madonna (Justice Remix) 4:01: This one is weird. I must confess, I prefer the original version...ALOT. I'm glad Britney called Madonna back for this remix, as some of the remixes for this track haven't included Madge (like the one on the In The Zone DVD/CD combo). The music is very good, though I reckon the vocals are all over the place. It's not as good as the Toxic remix, but worth a listen. 3.5/5 stars.  <br /> <br />3---Touch Of My Hand (Bill Hamel Remix) 5:19: This one is loads better than the original version (originally from her In The Zone album). Bill Hamel really outdone himself on this one! This remix is actually the best out of the three we've heard so far. If you are a massive Britney fan, then you're really missing out here! Futhermore, if you're a huge fan of the song itself, it's another must-listen!! 5/5 stars.  <br /> <br />4---Breathe On Me (Jacques Lu Cont's Thin White Duck Mix) 3:55: Let's get this straight, right. It's Stuart Price remixing this, and he is a GENIUS. Seriously, this one's better than the version found on the Greatest Hits: My Prerogative bonus disc! It starts with Britney breathing heavily, and the music is quite tame, but it builds up eventually. Love this one! If you want to check out more from Stuart, check out Madonna's new album (he produced the whole album with her!!). 5/5 stars.  <br /> <br />5---I'm A Slave 4 U (Dave Aud  RQ0HNM6H5Z9L4Slave Driver Mix) 5:51: When this remix first started, it seemed a bit of a dissapointment to me. As soon as the dance music kicked it, I was rather hooked. I have to admit, though, it's nothing fantastic, or NOTHING compared to the FANTASTIC remix from Chris Cox and co. (Thunderpuss). That remix is by far better, but this one is fair. 3.5/5 stars.  <br /> <br />6---And Then We Kiss (Junkie XL Remix) 4:27: Very impressive remix of Britney's most recent song. The dance beat is fantastic and the lyrics are like your average love song, though there's some nice vocals from Britney. If you liked the remix of Outrageous from the bonus disc on her Greatest Hits package, you should be a massive fan of this one. Meh? I like them both, though this one is a DEFINATE improvement. 4.5/5 stars.  <br /> <br />7---Everytime (Valentin Remix) 3:25: Fantastic remix. Although it did appear on her Greatest Hits album, on the bonus disc (the exact same version), I love it. Valentin also remixed Christina Augilera's Beautiful a few years back, and these are both great mixes. I recommend you hear them both. 5/5 stars.  <br /> <br />8---Early Mornin' (Jason Nevins Remix) 3:38: This one is actually more laid back to something Jason Nevins would normally do (thump!, thump!, thump!). It's a fantastic remix, as it is, though. It could be improved slightly, though on the whole, I think I like it more than the original. If you like Jason Nevins, I recommend you hear this, because it's quite different to something he'd normally do. 4.5/5 stars.  <br /> <br />9---Someday (I Will Understand) (Hi Bias Signature Radio Remix) 3:46: Meh? I prefer the original. This one is still a nice remix, but if you liked their remix of Everytime - and believe me, their literally the same (you can't tell them apart!!) - you should be a big fan of this one. It's a nice remix, though, like most remixes on here, could be improved. 4/5 stars. <br /> <br />10---...Baby One More Time (Davidson Ospina 2005 Remix) 4:37: Thisremix fits into all genres: dancing, relaxing, housework, disco, party - you name it. That's one of the reasons why it's so brilliant. It's by far alot better than the remix made by Ospina before the Millennium, which was great in the first place. This is one of the best remixes on the disc, actually. 5/5 stars.  <br /> <br />11---Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know (Hex Hector Club Mix Edit) 8:15: BEST REMIX ON THIS DISC! Hex Hector are absolutely fantastic, and one of my favourite DJs. The full club mix lasts for two minutes longer than this one, and to get it you need to buy the Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know single, which is probably out of print :( Great way to end the album! 5/5 stars.  <br /> <br />Best remixes: Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know #11, and Touch Of My Hand #3.  <br />

0684833395|4.0|Catch-22 is an exhilarating comedy that pokes fun to the ultra-seriousness of our government and it's ridiculous rules. It gives the reader a chance to laugh at the very exaggerated truth that many soilders have gone threw. Heller brillantly uses the characters and their problems in life, the surroundings to tell the story. It's comedy mixed with the craziness is a delight for those who have a sense of humour.

B00005JMXX|3.0|Say what you will about the charachters, the weird science, or the silly wolves, but you can't deny that the day after tommorow knows how to destroy, freeze, or superfreze the world into a very chilly ice cube. <br /> <br />Inspired by the book \\"The coming global superstorm\\", the day after tommorow follows the idea \\"What if a new ice age happened this week?\\".  The story concerns a weather science guy as he tries to rescue his son, who's trapped in manhattan after a nasty tidal wave.  All the while, all of humanity must try to survive as temperatures plunge and earth essentially becomes an ice cube. <br /> <br />While one can debate the questionable physics of the movie (walking from Washington to Manhattan in a few days during a massive snowstorm, how warming up the planet causes an ice age, etc.), one cannot deny the incredible atmosphere and visual destruction the movie unleashes.  The movie's greatest strength is it's atmosphere.  One really gets the feeling that this really is the end of the world (at least for the northern hemisphere).  The destruction shown, the massive amounts of human life lost, the destructive weather, all of it adds up to a very effective and belivable atmosphere.  I'm not ashamed to admit that at times I actually felt cold while watching the movie! <br /> <br />The special effects are, as one would suspect, terrific.  The tornadoes, blizzards, all of it looks perfectly belivable and realistic.  The standout sequence occurs when the massive tidal wave barrels through manhattan in a scene that gives me goosebumps every time I watch it.  If you want a movie where you get buildings trashed by tornadoes, the british isles getting buried under fifteen feet of snow, and tidal waves washing through manhattan, then this movie is for you! <br /> <br />Like the effects and the atmosphere, the film also does a standout job audio-wise.  The music is very good and effective at creating a sometimes tense, sometimes haunting atmosphere.  The main theme in paticular, is very effective at conveying despair, yet at the same time, hope.  The sound effects do an astonishing job of conveying howling wind and freezing snow, all of it adding to and enriching the atmosphere of the movie. <br /> <br />But atmosphere and visuals will only take you so far.  What about the charachters, on whom the movie puts it's backbone on?  Regrettably, the charachters are not very effective.  All of the actors in the movie, major or minor, do a very good job in thier respective parts, but a lot of them are not very interesting.  We get two primary chrachters (the scientist and his son) and close to two dozen secondary charachters, most of whom have little to do.  It's a sad fact of movies that if you have a secondary chrachter on screen for a grand total of five minutes before he/she dies, you don't get emotionally attatched to them.  Such is the case with The day after tommorow.  I couldn't remember over 3/4th's of the charachters names except Sam and Frank (and only then becuase the father keeps shouting, \\"FRANK!\\").  Instead of names,  you have to go by, \\"Library guy\\" \\"Library woman\\" \\"Homeless guy with dog\\" \\"Government guy who argues with father\\" \\"Father's sidekick\\".  That doesn't mean that these side charachters are boring, per se, it's just that we don't really care about them.  The only real exception is the policeman, who has a small part, but is portrayed very well and very effectivly.  He was the only real charachter I cared about. <br /> <br />I really don't care about the bad movie physics here (In real life, the statue of liberty would have toppled over the moment the tidal wave hit it).  The way the movie does present the physics makes it look belivable, and that's fine with me.   <br /> <br />The biggest problem I have with the day after tommorow is it's pacing.  The first two acts of the movie are gripping and holds you attention very easily.  The third act however, falls and stumbles, failing to hold our attention as well asit did previously.  A big part of this is the fact that the climax of the movie (the superfreeze) takes place approximatly fifteen minutes before the end of the movie.  You've no doubt heard about the silly wolves sequence, and i'm sad to say that the wolves part of the story is very silly and pretty much pointless.  It would be much more effective if the wolves were replaced by starving, crazed humans who have lost thier mind.   <br /> <br />The emotional climax is a bit flat, not really bringing things to a satisfying end.  One rather unfortunate reality of this type of story is that there's no villian, no antagonist to focus all the negativity on.  Here the foe is mother nature.  So, how do you plan to defeat mother nature and win the day? (Hint:  You don't).  It is admittingly very tough to write an ending to a movie where your villian is the forces of nature, who cannot be defeated by lots and lots of guns. <br /> <br />But in the end, the movie is an excuse to go and experience a great atmosphere and see lots of destruction, not to see emotionally involving charachter stories.  The overall message of the movie, that we shouldn't mess with mother nature, is the main point of the movie, regardless of how we get there.  I have to say that it's message is conveyed fairly well, as it gets you thinking about how humans are polluting the planet and what the consequences might be. <br /> <br />So in the end, see the movie for it's effective atmosphere and special effects.  Don't go in expecting extremly involving charachters and a satisfying climax and ending. <br /> <br />Don't forget your snowshoes!
B0006399FS|3.0|First off, I must say that the \\"Josh\\" reviewer is seemingly a narrow-minded, right wing racist who should keep most of his short-sighted opinions to himself and his 'adoring wife'.<br /><br />That said, I must say that this latest effort from U2 is good, not great. For me, primarily, due to the lyrical style. Not their strongest compared to previous efforts.  Vertigo teases the listener to believe there's some strong, complex coming.  But it never really seems to arrive.  Musically, it is back to basics, which can be good thing. But the content lacks a bit in the telling.  I think Bono's been keeping too busy with other things of late.<br /><br />But still, they are one of the best bands out still.  At least MY mind is open!!!
0684824906|5.0|The subject of Abraham Lincoln has fascinated author Doris Kearns Goodwin for years as a working historian. Her credentials include the coveted Pulitzer Prize for NO ORDINARY TIME (a portrait of FDR and Eleanor) and works about the Kennedys and Lyndon Johnson. TEAM OF RIVALS is a well-documented work that chronicles not only the life of Abraham Lincoln but also those of his rivals for the Republican nomination for President in 1860. William H. Seward, Salmon P. Chase and Edward Bates served with Lincoln as members of the most unusual cabinet in American history. <br /> <br />Goodwin's first nine chapters deal with the life stories of these four men, with contrasts and similarities skillfully detailed. Their personal struggles and victories dominate each personality and groom them for life in the political arena. By the end of Chapter 9 Lincoln has been elected President, with national tragedy looming in the form of Southern state succession from the Union. Lincoln's ability to unite his rivals and assimilate diverse ideologies into his cabinet is one of the greatest stories in political history. <br /> <br />William Henry Seward is the product of an upper class heritage. Married to Frances Miller, the daughter of a wealthy judge, Seward acquires wealth, position and a mansion in Auburn, New York. Salmon P. Chase lives through the tragedy of losing three wives, seeking compassion from political friends like Edwin Stanton and eventually becoming the governor of Ohio. Edward Bates leads perhaps the most normal existence of the four political rivals; his wife, Julia Bates, remains loyal to him for four decades. The divisive Compromise of 1850 clouds the political stage for a decade and smothers all other national issues for debate. Bates is the only man of the foursome to strongly support the Compromise, which keeps Southern states in check for a number of years. <br /> <br />Seward is purported to be the unanimous choice of the Republicans in the 1860 convention. Lincoln's nomination is \\"received with general incredulity\\" on Capitol Hill. Bates is the first of the rivals to endorse Lincoln's candidacy. \\"While Lincoln worked to enlist the cooperation of all his rivals, he knew that the active support of William Henry Seward would be pivotal to his campaign.\\" <br /> <br />Following his nomination, Lincoln weaves a political masterpiece in his choice of cabinet members. Seward becomes Secretary of State, Chase is named Treasury Secretary, and Edward Bates is picked to be Attorney General. The meat of the book deals with Lincoln's uncanny ability to work through the difficulties faced when the South finally secedes from the Union and civil war ensues. <br /> <br />Throughout this turbulent time, these men solidify Lincoln's positions and stand beside him, though not without their individual differences. His ability to manipulate them to his cause and support the war effort is unequaled in our history. Dominant political geniuses in their own right, their combined strengths enhance Lincoln's resolve on numerous issues. Coupled with additional strong men of resolve and generals brought in to oversee Northern war strategies, Lincoln is blessed by his choices. <br /> <br />Goodwin's documentation is extensive. Nearly 90 pages detail sources used within each of the 26 chapters, sources for pictures and maps are listed in a separate reference sheet, and the book concludes with an epilogue. This fine author should receive a stable of honors for her latest achievement. Lincoln and his rivals come to life on these pages, political turmoil is chronicled with authority, and her use of resource material will certainly qualify this book as a choice for serious scholastic usage. TEAM OF RIVALS is recommended as a first-rate literary piece. <br /> <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Judy Gigstad

B000BP86OG|5.0|Wow. Wow! And did I mention WOW!! The Darkness is back to rock your ass off and ready to take control of the world with their sonically spectacular second album, ONE WAY TICKET TO HELL. . . AND BACK. No sophomore slump here. Produced by the legendary Roy Thomas Baker (Queen's producer), the new album is 10 songs of pure delight.  <br /> <br />It's all here. Catchy singalong hits in waiting (\\"Is It Just Me,\\" \\"Dinner Lady Arms\\"), crunching hard rockers (the title track and the you gotta hear it to believe it epic \\"Bald,\\" the world's first ode to reverse pattern male baldness, a truly spine tingling and hair raising rocker -- so to speak). Add good doses of singer Justin Hawkin's trademark hysterical lyrics, wild falsettos, great guitar works and soloes from brothers Justin and Dan Hawkins, plus some sitars, bagpipes and marching drums thrown into the mix. It all sticks and it all works.  <br /> <br />More standouts: \\"Hazel Eyes,\\" a high-pitched ditty about a sweet Scottish lass; \\"Knockers,\\" a killer groove oriented rocker about the wonder of boobs; a classic power ballad in \\"Seemed Like A Good Idea At The Time;\\" and the catchy and hilarious as hell \\"Girlfriend\\" and \\"English Country Garden.\\" What an album! Phenomenal! Can't wait to see these guys live on our shores again. Rock and roll is saved. Long live the Darkness.

1580084621|5.0|There is a balance that a Thai cookbook has to decide on, the extremes being authenticity and Western-ability. Many books on Thai cuisine favour the latter approach. Things may be easier, ingredients are usually simplified and selected to be more readily available. The cost: taste--its not the 'real thing'.    Thompsons book is unabashedly of the authentic school: he makes no bones about this in the preface, warning that its intent is to capture Thai haute-cuisine and difficult cuisine. If you have access to the ingredients (which seems to be getting easier and easier) and follow the recipes the food is stunning and will pass muster with Thais and long time residents of the Kingdom. The writing is lucid and the recipes well set out.   As a bonus you also get some insightful interludes and discussions about the evolution of various dishes, the Thai culinary approach, and insight into the make-up of the Thai meal.
B0006399FS|1.0|U2 is so overrated.  They're are the epitome of a \\"hipster\\" band.  People listen to the just to say they listen to them half the time.  Their music is uninspired and weak.  It's been the same story for 25 years, and honestly, if I may say so... Bono, knock the crap off.  You aren't a politician, quit pretending you are, and how do so many people take him seriously as a political figure?  While I am in no way in opposition of his politcial views, he takes it to the extreme, as well as makes piss-poor music.

B0000508U6|2.0|I honestly do not understand the Coldplay phenomenon.  Chris Martin has taken Radiohead's \\"High & Dry\\" off of the Bends album and made an entire sound off of that one song.  There is a major difference between being influenced by someone, and making music that is a direct copy of music made 10 years ago.  Coldplay is insanely stale, the only reason I gave this album 2 stars rather than 1 is due to the sheer fact that \\"Don't Panic\\" and \\"Trouble\\" are not half bad.  The rest of this album grates my nerves.  It's a piss-poor attempt to be the next Radiohead, as are the other subsequent albums.  As said before, this is Radiohead-Lite.

B000002UB3|2.0|I've never understood the fuss about the Beatles.  Ever.  After growing up with it, my parents listening to it, some of my friends listening to it, and each and everyone one of them being very defensive when I tell them I don't like their sound.  I don't care if they brought about pop music as it is today, I don't care if they influenced a lot of bands today, I don't care about any of that.  What I do care about is whether they can make a compelling and interesting album, and unfortunately thus far I have not found it.  Ringo Starr is a mediocre drummer.  There have been plenty better in the past 45 years, but everyone raves about the Beatles once more.  The Bass as played by Paul McCartney (Overrated in his solo career as well) is lacklustre and uninspired.  The vocals throughout the entire thing are annoying at best, I hate their voices.  Too floaty, not very melodic.  And the lyrics are just tacky throughout.  The only saving grace on the entire record are the guitar solos scattered throughout the album.  That is the only reason Abbey Road gets 2 stars rather than 1.  \\"Best Album Ever\\"?  Please.  The Beatles are horrible, and entirely overrated.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|When I first watched CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, starring Johnny Depp, I admit that I was immediately taken aback.  Having appreciated the original portrayal of the inimitable Willy Wonka by Gene Wilder, Depp's portrayal at first came across as way too bizarre for me.<br /><br />But then I watched it again and again and again and the magic of Tim Burton's vision of the story, Danny Elfman's masterful music and Depp's portrayal of the legendary Chocolateer absolutely grew on me.<br /><br />Moreover, Burton's production runs more smoothly than the original, filling in many blanks that were all too apparent in the 1970 production.  I must admit as well that, while the 70's film did some creative things by way of special effects that were possible at the time, Burton's film is a special-effects marvel.  This is especially true when it comes to the treatment of Wonka's Oompa Loompas.<br /><br />Yes, the original film is still a favorite but the new one should find an honored place right beside it in your movie collection.<br /><br />THE HORSEMAN

It's a very good recording of a very good concert (with maybe the best recording ever of \\"Money,\\"), but not quite as good as the \\"Delicate Sound of Thunder\\" CD, which has most of the same songs.

B00079018K|1.0|I just heard this album last night... it's truely awesome i must say. catchy riffs along with some interesting electronic motifs here and there.  the music itself is good, yes... but the copyright protection on the cd is ridiculous.  i am an musician myself and to me this is complete record label fascism.  screw the record labels for trying to make another buck by putting this protection on the cd to make more people buy it.  the goal of any musician should be to get as many people listening and loving their music as they can, regardless of whether or not they actually own the cd.  spreading the word about a band is so much more valuable and truely important than cd sales for any musician.  if you have more people who enjoy your music (even if they didn't buy the cd), the next time you tour will bring those people in (and then you can make your oh-so-important money off of them then).  realize that the even though the music is good, stop trying to simply make money and actually become a real musician.

B000000WFF|5.0|The Spice Girls are the greatest girl group of all time! They were fun they were sexy and they were great role models. Spiceworld marks the girls second album and final album together as a quintet. Sadly they didnt make it past the release of \\"stop\\" as a single with Geri intact. Geri Halliwell dropped out before the final single from the album was released and before the girls finished touring the U.S. Much to my dismay when I saw the girls in concert ginger-less. This album though is equivelant to the greatness of Spice and reminds me of the 80's classics of Madonna. The girls improved on there harmonies and polished up there song writing making this great cd that everyone should own! <br /> <br />SPICE GIRLS - SPICEWORLD <br />1. Spice Up Your Life - The first single off the album, this song has many inspirations from salsa and dance music. There are not many solos and is more like the Spice Girls theme song than an actual pop son. 9/10 <br />2. Stop - This 50s-60s inspired song has Supremes influence written all over it. The song is extremely catchy and fun to listen to. This was the Third single from the album and the first single from the girls to NOT hit #1 in the U.K. 10/10 <br />3. Too Much - A great pop ballad. The second single from the album, this song has great vocals by most of the girls and is a great Spice classic. One of there best. 10/10 <br />4. Saturday Night Divas - A very catchy song that takes a while to get into, but once you d you cant come back! 9/10 <br />5. Never Give Up On The Good Times - An uplifting disco-ish song that gives nothing but positivity. A great tune for the car. 9/10 <br />6. Move Over - A very sassy, sexy song. The song got a lot of flack becuase it was featured in their pepsi commercial. The lyrics are great and its lots of fun to listen to, like most Spice songs. 10/10 <br />7. Do It - Another uplifting song. Great vocals and lots of fun. 9/10 <br />8. Denying - A great R&B song that is sexy and sassy all at the same time. The spice girls have great harmonies on this track as well. Mel B proves her own talent well in this song particulary. 9/10 <br />9. Viva Forever - The last single from the album and the last single that featured all five girls providing vocals. This is a brilliant ballad, the harmonies are immaculate and the vocals are brilliant. The song is beautiful and haunting. Another Spice Girls Best. 10/10 <br />10. Lady Is A Vamp - An extremely fun, jazzy sort of song that pays tribute to all those pop icons of the past such as James Bond, Charlie's Angels, and Jackie-O. The fun is a great showy way to end the album. 9/10 <br /> <br />SPICE GIRLS FOREVER

B00000AFDW|3.0|I have been a Kiss fan for YEARS. I supported them and defended them for years. Although a little confused over the departure of Ace and Peter in the early 80's (like most kids my age), I gave them a fair shake. When Kiss went public with Lick It Up, the first album to feature them without makeup, I thought they finally had the chance to write and record material as musicians rather than performers. And I was right, year after year, album after album they never failed to compose great tracks for an undying metal world. Then...all they hype about a full-blown reunion with Ace and Peter became a reality with the MTV Unplugged release and a reunion tour. So what was next? A new album with Ace and Peter of course. Man, us Kiss fans were drooling over the idea...the day had come. I bought Psycho Circus the week it was released. My reaction?...well..... <br /> <br />Let's be straight up and honest here. The \\"reunion\\" album SHOULD have BEEN MUCH better. Sure, Pcycho Circus has a few great tracks (the title track being the best...), but the majority of it should have been filed away. This album is the result of two egomaniacs assuming that the songs THEY have chosen for the album are the best way to go..and I can see why they feel that way...to a point. <br /> <br />Although Ace and Peter are songwriters in their own right, they haven't quite written any memorable tunes on their own (save for Ace's EXCELLENT solo record during the Kiss days....) Paul and Gene on the other hand have polished their craft to near perfection over the years. Ace and Peter bailed on them, and they kept on truckin'. But the problem here is the majority of the songs are luke warm. <br /> <br />Phycho Circus is THE best track on the album, and very Kiss, with Paul Stanley's trademark vocals at an alltime high. <br /> <br />The next track Within is another great one featuring Gene's raspy true blue rock and roll voice, complete with backward guitar bursts and a solid deep, dark beat. <br /> <br />Track three is Pledge...which is also a great number and fits just fine on the album...another example of those great pipes courtesy of Stanley. <br /> <br />Into the Void is an Ace Frehley composition that, with help from Stanley, is the second best track on the album. Interesting enough, it was almost \\"canned\\" due to Simmons' lack of interest in the song. But Stanley and Frehley both stood strong and thank God for that...cause as I mentinoned, this is a strong, superior track to MANY of the others. <br /> <br />Next follows We Are One...which is the first one that should have been left off the album. While not necessarily a BAD song, it doesn't belong on the album and should have been saved for Simmons' latest solo effort. <br /> <br />You Wanted the Best had potential...a LOT of potential, if it had a different drum pattern. This track showcases vocals from all four members which gives the track a LOT of character. <br /> <br />Raise Your Glasses is another that had potential. The chorus portion of the song has some great chord voicings and the melody of the actual chourus is fantastic....very classic Kiss...but....the verse portions show symptoms of The Elder...an automatic \\"scrap\\" into the trash can... <br /> <br />Iv'e Finally Found My Way is a song written by Mr. Stanley and a couple others for Peter Criss to sing. While a decent track for Rod Stewart's latest indulgence, it does NOT belong on ANY Kiss album.  <br /> <br />Dreamin' is another example of a great chorus with a horrible verse melody that causes one to lose interest immediately. <br /> <br />1'000 Years is the final offering on the album courtesy of Gene Simmons. This is a perfect close for the album and is very effective in doing so. This one truly belongs.  <br /> <br />Although it failed to rank as a classic, the album sounds excellent. The guitars are rich and carry the album much of the way, the drum sounds are wonderful, the bass is deep and rich and the vocals are right on top, like icing ona cake. But too much polish and \\"so-so\\" songs make Psycho Circus a \\"listened to it a few times, but that's about it\\" album. Mr. Fairbain could have been the other reason (God rest his soul...). Listen to Aerosmith's later material, Van Halen's Balance and you can see a pattern. This album might have been much better had another producer been utilized. But he was at the top of the game with all the hits he produced with Aerosmith, I can't blame Kiss for giving him the torch. <br /> <br />Now, we have a band that is living on the legacy they created more than 30 years ago; with a different line up and still using the makeup. I feel like many of the fans do. They should either pack it in, OR take off the makeup and just make another album... with the latter in mind, at least they would represent what they truly are... a great rock and roll band!
B000001GQU|4.0|DG has two version of the Verdi Requiem from Fricsay, both in mono, and I suppose they've chosen to release the 1953 one over the remake from 1960 because it is generally considered more gripping and better sung. Fricsay takes the opposite tack from Giulini--there is no veil of reverence drawn over the music. In general, tempos are on the fast side (the Tuba Mirum goes at breakneck speed), and the soloists avoid any trace of sanctimony. As a result, this performance holds one's attention by its dramatic thrust while being the least Italianate I've ever heard (the tenor goes virtually sobless throughout the Ingemisco. Bravo!)<br /><br />The sonics are a bit tubby, the bass drum is a mile away, but the vocal soloists are close-up and clear. They aren't of equal ability. Maria Stader has a bright, lyric voice, rather in the vein of Gundula Janowitz, and a very secure technique. Mezzo Marianne Rodet has a full, plummy sound and sings just as securely. The men are weaker: tenor Helmut Krebs bawls right into the microphone at times (he is lyrical and secure in the Ingemisco, however), and bass Kim Borg can sound too sepulchral. But they work well as a team, and the RIAS forces, both orchestra and chorus (supplemented by the St. Hedwig's church choir), sing with musical conviction.<br /><br />You won't mistake this recording for a religious experience--it's refreshingly secular from beginning to end--but Fricsay's approach is powerful enough to have stood the test of time.  (BTW I own both the older budget issue and this newly remastered one but cannot tell much difference in sound between them.)
B0009HLDFU|5.0|I haven't listened to the actual music yet (in fact, I don't usually listen to music), but the copyright protection alone makes this two-CD set worth owning. Kudos to the band for inventing this copyright protection and convincing RCA to use it on all future Foo Fighters albums.
B000003FPN|5.0|How did he do it? Fritz Reiner was mean-spirited and uncomuniative with his musicians. He didn't even bother to move to Chicago during the period in the Fifties when he conducted the CSO. Yet in retrospect he presided over a golden age of performance and recording. Almost without exception the CSO's records for RCA, most in excellent Living Stereo, have survived as first-rate and sometimes first-choice in everything Reiner conducted.<br /><br />This controlled, magisterial Dvorak 'New World' is no exception.  There's nothing Czech about it--it's an international, virtuosic interpretation given to us in wonderfully detailed, natural sonics. Really, there's no reason to own another CD of this work unless you are in pursuit of the peculiarly Czech flavor imparted by Vaclav Talich in Prague. Czech conductors make the Scherzo a more earthy furiant, and Czech woodwinds have a rustic tang. The CSO floats on a cushion of effortless technique and perfect ensemble. Reiner's reading is dramatic but warm, lyrical and incisive by turns.<br /><br />His pupil Leonard Bernstein made his own, more exuberant New World some years after this one but without a shade of Reiner's refinement and discipline. I can't claim to have any particular interest in this symphony, which I left behind some time in college, but I still appreciate the absolute quality of Reiner's performance.
0312305060|5.0|I experienced The Hours backwards. I saw the movie and fell in love with it. Then I read the book a couple years later. As much as I loved the movie, the book is far more powerful and subtle. In an amazing feat, the actors were quickly replaced in my head by the characters so beautifuly described in the book. Some books get a lot of hype because they deserve it. This is one.
B000000OMP|4.0|From what I have read in a couple of rock guides this album was finished in 1983 with Mick Moody and Mel Galley on guitars. It was later re-mixed for America, at which point Moody left and former Tygers Of Pan Tang/Thin Lizzy guitarist John Sykes joined the band. Sykes had recorded the excellent Thunder And Lighting with Thin Lizzy in 1983. I am not sure how much input he had on SIN but I remember he was the only guitarist to appear in the Slow N Easy video. Anyways, I have heard every Whitesnake album and this one is their best. The riffs are good, the solos are melodic, the choruses are catchy, and the rhythm section is tight. The production by the one and only Martin Birch is very clear and robust. I like every song with the exception of just a couple tracks so I won't bother going into each one. Just get the album if you don't already have it and enjoy good early 80s hard rock. Four and a half stars!

0060839872|5.0|It took a long time to write a review for this book. I generally try to write them within a week of finishing. It gives me time to absorb what I read yet it remains fresh in my mind. For some reason, this took a full 2 months before I wrote this review. That doesn't mean I forgot what I read, far from it. This book is so full of valuable discussion that it would be impossible to forget much of what it talked about. After all, the content here is heavy enough to maintain a cult following 30 years after it was first published. <br /> <br />Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is quite a good book. I don't know how else to start this review, other than to say exactly that. It's a classic that sat on my pile of books for years and years (and years - really, it was that long) before I picked it up. That's a shame, because this is something I should have been picking up again and again throughout those years. More than likely a timeless classic, Zen stays in touch with all levels of reader despite taking on a very mixed subject matter.  <br /> <br />A philosophical journey brushed with Buddhist undertones, this is a mysterious autobiographical adventure where Pirsig jumps head first into a slowly moving story which delves in and out of the mind of the narrator. Focusing on the issue of value, Pirsig attempts to ferret out the core of quality which drives dinner conversation across the face of the Earth. What is good? What is bad? How do we assess elements of this nature which fit into these good and bad boxes? <br /> <br />Truth and value, pillars of our social institutions, come under the scrutiny of Pirsig in the pages of this book. Challenging illusions we delude ourselves into believing, the text offers numerous questions and commentaries which lead the reader to question many things they may have previously taken for granted. <br /> <br />Blending Eastern and Western thought, Pirsig walks down a well-trodden but poorly paved road that many in the West try and fail to comprehend. That doesn't mean Pirsig understands it any better (or worse) than others who have ambled down this same path. It merely means he walks down it, and lends space to both schools of thought without wholly selling out and decrying one as superior. An impossible stance to take for almost all who try. <br /> <br />At times the book does bog down in slow meditative conversation. I don't think it detracts enough to make the book less than excellent. But it is something to consider when going into it. Those expecting Earth shattering revelations will need to step back and reassess what they expect from a book. Much of the text is meant to be consumed and ruminated upon. Reading 100 pages in a day is a sure way to misunderstand most of it. You would do yourself a favor by limiting the number of pages taken in any one day to less than 10. Here is a book to promote thinking. Take the time to do just that. <br /> <br />This book can (and should) appeal to any variety of reader. However, it will likely appeal more to those who actively want to better themselves and their lives, but not in the typical American manner of throwing a fist-full of cash at it. The idea is foreign to many in a land of cash-based happiness. Pirsig does not address this. I merely bring it up to preface who might enjoy reading this. I imagine the Conservative base will not take kindly to the book. Likewise, people beyond a certain age (is that Thirtysomething these days?) will likely be less concerned with a lot of the ideas here, believing they already have all the answers they need. I strongly assert that any person from any angle can get a lot out of this work. <br /> <br />This is a book I plan on reading again. I have cautiously ordered his sequel, Lila, because this book was so good. I can't expect it to be nearly as good. But it goes to show how much I enjoyed the first one. Needless to say, this is highly recommended reading.
B000BP86OG|1.0|I despise the Darkness immensely.  The lead singer sounds like a girl on helium and the music is recycled Queen.  I thought we left these rock and roll cliches behind 25 years ago! If you're into milquetoast rock with feminime vocals, then get this album.  Otherwise, check out Madonna's amazing \\"Confessions on a Dancefloor\\" instead.
B000BYY0RY|5.0|I too took two of my friends all the way from San Francisco to London to see this show.  Imagine our surprise to find out our show is the actuall one on this DVD!!!  My friends were fans of Ms. K but not HUGE fans.  This show changed them.  They could not stop talking about it.  To see their eyes glazed over and their jaws drop was worth every penny.  They really only knew her newer work (Light years to present) but the performances. lighting, costuming, and of course her voice kept them so entertained.  highlights for me were i beleive in you, the spanish baths, and of course \\"Somewhere over the Rainbow\\"  This is a must have artist!

B000002TQV|5.0|Yes, I love \\"The Bends.\\"  And the Rolling Stones.  Simultaneously.      I never really got into Radiohead during the \\"Pablo Honey\\" period.  I liked \\"Creep,\\" but I didn't really understand what Thom Yorke & the boys were trying to accomplish.  Although I loved \\"There There\\" from \\"Hail to the Thief,\\" I disliked most of \\"OK Computer\\" and never appreciated \\"Kid A.\\"  In fact, I totally ignored \\"The Bends\\" for ten years.      Ladies and gentlemen, that was a HUGE mistake.  I'll admit I missed out on a masterpiece.  From the opening chords on \\"Planet Telex\\" to the triumph of the title track, this album remains, to my mind, the most accessible of Radiohead's efforts.  Yes, I'm sure many diehard fans felt \\"The Bends\\" departed from Radiohead's true sound, and it did.  But the songs compensate for this departure.  \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\" is understated, but beautiful.  Coming from someone who normally listens to Queen and AC/DC, that says a lot about the quality of the album.    The lyrics speak volumes without becoming preachy.  I love \\"Bones.\\"  Words don't do it justice - listen to it and you'll see what I mean.  In fact, when Thom Yorke declares on the title track that he \\"wants to be part of the human race,\\" it sounds as if he's the spokesman for every outsider and misfit the world has ever ignored.      Get this one, even if you're not really into Radiohead.  At the very least, you'll see how diverse and creative a band they are.  ~LBS
B000BOH8XW|4.0|Oral Fixation Vol. 2 finds Shakira going back to her original pop-rock roots, leaving behind the eclectic mix of Latin, tropical and pop beats on \\"Fijacion Oral Vol. 1\\" and radio-friendly \\"Laundry Service.\\" With her trademark yodel and breathy vocals, this is definitely one of her strongest albums, Spanish or English, to date. The first single \\"Don't Bother\\" is definitely  not a stand out by any means, and does not define the sound of this album. Like most of Shakira's efforts, this a album is a seemingly random mix of sounds and moods, and \\"Illegal\\" with Carlos Santana, is a haunting melody accentuated by Shakira's strong vocals. The album's best tracks can be found in \\"Animal City\\" - a brilliant experiment in pop rock, with Shakira at her eclectic best, and \\"Timor\\" - a fast paced dance floor filler. English translations of dance tracks from Fijacion Oral Vol. 1 actually improve on the tracks (somehow) and \\"The Day and the Time\\" is one of the most brilliant tracks on this well rounded album.  <br />With almost no filler, this is probably Shakira's best effort since the ground-breaking \\"Donde Estan Los Ladrones?\\" <br /> <br />

0765348780|3.0|Like many others, I started to read Gardens of the Moon at the insistence of friends, who described his writing and fantasy series as at least as good, if not better, than George R.R. Martin and his Song of Fire and Ice series. I think this is a flawed comparison. Erikson draws as much on his own imagination and traditional \\"high fantasy\\" or \\"epic fantasy\\" as he does from authors like Glen Cook or Martin. Erikson definitely shares Cook's focus on military matters, but unlike the Chronicles of the Black Company, which follows a band of mercenaries for hire, Erikson's sweep includes a whole assemble of Empresses, nobles, thieves, military men and women, assassins, mages, gods, and more...and he flavors it with bits of poetry, history, and politics of the fantasy world. This is where he splits with Cook or Martin. And might be his undoing as well. It's simply too much for one book, even a 657-page one at that, to handle, and too much for me. <br /> <br />Many of the problems lie within the giant cast of characters, their interactions, their subplots, and Erikson's narrative style. I couldn't help but wonder if Erikson had fallen into the (Robert Jordan) trap of thinking bigger is better: there are 92 or 93 characters listed in the Dramatis Personae at the beginning of the book. While I'm thankful that Erikson provided it, I think it's a bad sign. After a few hundred pages into the novel, the characters  started to seem like faceless actors in an extended play, stomping onto the stage, shedding a fake tear or mouthing a sweet soliloquy, then tiptoeing off of it, for a repeat performance in some distant age. Eventually I couldn't keep track of characters, even main characters such as Whiskey Jack and Paran, because of the lack of time spent on them. Simply, words and time were spread too thin on too many characters. Martin's writing avoids this by spending at least a chapter or a couple chapters told from the viewpoint of a character, so that you can become used to the thoughts and actions of that viewpoint character, which adds a kind of shading and coloring to the story. However, Erikson often jumps between a dozen characters within a chapter, sometimes spending no more than a few paragraphs on a few, giving some idea about their thoughts and actions, but the lack of focus and familiarity make it harder for the reader to sympathize, much less know what is going on, with the characters. Also, when I started to forget plot and character details, it started to hurt their characterization. Whiskey Jack, Paran, and others never really \\"grew\\" or came off as anything else as military types. I've known military men all my life, and static is one thing they are not. <br /> <br />I recommend this with some reservations. Readers of Glen Cook, Robert Jordan, and some other authors will find a gold mine in Erikson's work, with its focus on world building and military action. It is better written than either Cook's or Jordan's works. However, this emphasis on military action above all, with some flimsy political, romantic, and betrayal intrigues thrown in, will probably not captivate long-time Martin readers. Instead of a hearty stew, they may be looking at several servings of cabbage soup.
0385513755|2.0|Like Michael Crichton, Dan Brown knows a hook when he sees it. Then, using his minimal talent, serves it up in a very run-of-the-mill mystery thriller. But again, it's not the writing that counts here (poor), or the plot (poor), or the characters (poorer still), or the dialogue (could it get much more pedestrian?), it's the hook. The hook, of course, is the search for the Holy Grail. It's the Priory de Sion, an idea already easily exposed to be false in books of readily available scholarly repute. (For instance: \\"The Da Vinci Fraud\\" by Robert M. Price.) It's the possibility that Leonardo painted clues to his heretical beliefs in his paintings. Now, this might have a basis in truth. Unlike Brown, Leonardo was a talented artist, a sublime artist...he was also gifted in so many ways he seems almost superhuman. And it is true he had no love for the Catholic Church and the teachings of that church. But the church paid him for his work, and so he did it. But stuck with doing it, he used his commissions to make comments on what he actually believed. The Last Supper is the perfect example of this. Brown takes it to ludicrous lengths, but Leonardo did mean to say that \\"John\\" to the right of Jesus is Mary Magdalene. His portrait of her in close-up is tender, delicate, stunning, and patently feminine to any unbiased eye. If you want to really get to grips...not with basically unimportant ideas about French bloodlines (who cares if 2 thousand later a million French people are distantly related to Jesus and Mary Magdalene; does this mean they KNOW something?)...but with a thrilling book about the Magdalene, you really ought to read \\"The Secret Magdalene\\" by Ki Longfellow. First rate book, first rate hook.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|This is a movie that I loved for many reasons.  It's sad, funny, and heartwarming, and has a great soundtrack.  Because it has all these qualities, I find it frustrating that the Director/Writer made some poor choices that I think hurt the movie. <br /> <br />On the positive side, there is a wide range of love stories, great acting, and a fun Christmas theme.  My personal favorite is the aging rock star storyline, mostly because Bill Nihy is hilarious.  I also like the way there's inter-racial relationships in the movie, and that they're treated as nothing out of the ordinary. <br /> <br />     (Warning - the rest of my review contains some plot details)  <br /> <br />But some of the stories could have been so much better, which to me is a shame when this movie had the potential to be one of the best.  In the story with Colin Firth falling for his housekeeper, there was definitely chemistry there, but for him to sweep her off her feet and ask her to marry him so quickly (especially when they didn't speak the same language) was silly.  Another mistake (though not as significant) was having the housekeeper's father keep putting down her over weight sister, which was meant to add humor to one of the scenes.  This was intended as comic relief, but to me it just came across as mean-spirited and not funny. <br /> <br />I also thought the story with Liam Neeson and his son (who recently lost his mother in the story) could have been written better.  The movie shows very little mourning on the boy or dad's part, even though the mother just died recently.  It tries to make it seem charming and cute that the boy's real reason for feeling sad is because he's in love, instead of grieving from losing his mother.  The only time they seemed to express their loss was the day of the mom's funeral.   Even the Dad is checking out an attractive lady by the end of the movie, even though his wife just recently passed away.  If I could rewrite that story, I would have at least had the mom/wife pass away a year ago, instead of so recently.  This would have made their behavior more believable to me. <br /> <br />The Hugh Grant story was charming and cute, although I don't think they allowed enough character development.  To me they didn't show enough of the woman's personality for me to feel like I knew her and wanted to see them end up together.  I think it would have helped if they had another scene or two showing her being loving/kind to others (or with some other admirable quality), instead of using her humorous swearing habit or naivity to make her stand out.  In general I guess I would have liked to see a little more substance behind their attraction for each other. <br /> <br />There are a few other quirks I would have changed too, but overall I still like this movie and think there are some great parts (some sad, some uplifting).  I recommend seeing it, but without young kids because there's quite of bit of nudity in one recurring storyline, and several with adult themes.  I just wish a few of the plot flaws were corrected so I could love this movie and include it in my favorites.
B000BOH8XW|5.0|I feel this album as Vol.1 shows maturity and digs deeper with issues/conflicts we go through in our lives. Betrayal, society, love, etc. Although she is seen as a pop artist, her love for rock is seen throughout bringing back retro rock sounds and mixing them with her own style.
B000BP86OG|1.0|This album isn't great at all.Nothing like the first one.This album is one reason why they are broken up.Well why the lead singer,guitar player left.1 star is what I give it.

B000BO0LKY|1.0|This poor gal is washed up and worn out. What happened to the days of \\"Music Box\\" or \\"Day Dream\\" where she was a vocal diva? Very few could sing like her. Now, we're forced to hear this monotonous, cookie-cutter crap that any moron with a microphone could put out. Can she still sing like she used to? Or, has she lost her voice like Whitney (there's another sad story). Note to Mariah: drop the hoochie-wanna-be hacked hip-hop horse crap and remember the music that put you where you are. What a waste of talent (if she still has it).
B000BPCCZA|5.0|I haven't actually had time yet to look at the DVD, but the CD is amazing.  I have been a SOAD fan from the beginning, have every album, and I can't say enough about this CD.   <br /> <br />As far as the extra $3, check around for where you buy it.  I don't think I'm allowed to promote stores on here, but I shopped for this CD at two different stores on the same day and found a price difference of $5 between the two stores, so it's definitely possible to get it for a regular CD price if you know where to look.
B000BJS4SU|4.0|Three years ago, I never thought I would be saying that John Mayer has released the best live album of the year.  However, our boy upped his game and actually sounds like a legitmate musician.  Granted, his guitar prowess has always been evident in his music, but on Try! he is free of all the pop producers who have hindered his past offerings.  As for the album proper, \\"Who did you think I was\\" is an appropriate opener, with lyrics that poke fun at his image.  There's a flawless cover of Hendrix's \\"Wait til tomorrow\\", as well as a surprisingly non-irritating cover of Ray Charles' \\"I Got a Woman.\\"  The new material is all enjoybale, as well as the 2 songs that appear on his studio albums (This version of Daughters is MUCH better).  The best track, however, is the finale, \\"Try.\\"  Great melody, and Mayer's enthusiasm is genuine.  Pick the album up!  It is the best live album I've heard in quite some time.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Shaun Of The Dead is definitley one of the best zombie films of all time. I can see why George A. Romero loves this film, because it's full of laughs, gore and great characters. <br /> <br />Simon Pegg {who also wrote this film with Edgar Wright} plays Shaun, an aimless TV salesman who lives with his jobless lazy friend Ed (Frost) and his hard working friend Pete {Serafinowicz}. Shaun's life really goes down the tubes when his girlfriend Liz {Ashfield} breaks-up with him after so many empty promises and do nothing but go to the Winchester on their dates. <br /> <br />Shaun decides to sort his life out and do his best to get Liz back. However, his plans change when London is being overrun by zombies. Now, Shaun and Ed must rescue Shaun's mom {Wilton}, his stepdad {Nighy}, Liz and Liz's roommates David {Moran} and Dianne {Davis}, and head to the Winchester for shelter until the this whole thing blows over. <br /> <br />Shaun Of The Dead is a must-see for anyone who wants to have a good laugh and a good scare. If you haven't seen this, you should check it out soon. Definitley one the best films last year and it's sure to be a classic. <br />
055380457X|2.0|In less than ten years, Google has built a very successful business around its search engine solution - achieving the unusual combination of very high revenue growth and high net margins.  There also is no doubt the company's vision for where it shall go in the future is unusually broad and far reaching.  This makes Google a great candidate for the right author to write a great book about its rise to prominance.  This unfortunately is not the book.   <br /> <br />I attempted to read the book through, but resorted to scanning it instead.  For anyone who knows how the internet works (and does not work) there is far too much hype and cheerleading in this book.  The book lacks balance, it lacks critical examination, and it lacks objectivity.  These are significant flaws, but it does deserve credit for delivering a reasonable chronology of how Google started and evolved to the point where it has captured the impressive market position it has today. <br /> <br />If you are new to the topic of understanding how a search business functions and are looking for a basic Google chronology, the book is probably fine - as long as you look past the cheerleading.  If you are already up on what search related businesses most likely can (and can not) achieve, this book is worth skipping.

B0006A9FKA|5.0|Destined to be a true cult classic!  Very original!  Much of the dialogue has already woven it's way into our local pop culture (joining Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Napolean Dynamite as oft quoted situational responses). <br /> <br />The movie features characters you really do care about (despite the fact that they are pretty much lovable losers), excellent actor chemistry, a well spent special effects budget (watch for the \\"girl in the garden\\" scene), some hilarious slapstick scenes (I'll never listen to Queen again without thinking of this movie), and a ton of Romeo-esque Zombies! <br /> <br />The language may be off-putting to some (we did set out to count the \\"F\\" word usage recently but ran out of fingers, toes, arms, legs, etc. to keep track on about two minutes into the movie.) <br /> <br />Be sure to watch the \\"surprise\\" ending!
0898159156|5.0|This book is one of the best I've read for carnivorous plants. It has background information on plants, as well as detailed information about the different species' general requirements, information on different growing settings, how to set up those settings, what to plant each kind of plant in, what NOT to plant each plant in, what you can fertilize/feed your plant with, and plant pests that commonly bother carnivorous plants and how to deal with them. The book also contains many quirky comments such as \\"(I am not suggesting you feed your plants humans, since this is highly illegal...)\\" and \\"Some CP's will accept...even chocolate (female plants).\\" It is a very fascinating and useful book!! A must-have for carnivorous plant lovers!
0553801503|5.0|For starters: This is a 4-star book by Mr. Martin's own standards, but easily a 5-star book in comparison to any other contemporary fantasy author (or, indeed, to most contemporary authors period). Lest you be dismayed by the slanderous fools who would dare suggest that this book marks a Jordan-esque slide into mediocrity, rest assured that the overall quality of the book remains extremely high. Having read it through carefully, I was unable to find a single typo or instance of objectionable prose. The thing that makes this book less appealing than the previous ones in the series is that the pace of the action has slowed. Whether this was necessary or not is up to debate, but I would suggest that if George Martin could not find a way around it in five years of effort, then it must be a necessary evil. Please remember that even Tolkien's masterpiece included a \\"slower\\" middle chapter, and that the first three installments of this series have raised the bar so high that it must inevitably come down. I say, better here than in book seven.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|Got one of these for my birthday... honestly, it is nothing more than a noisy toy. Firstly, it is not very effective - you have to run the darned thing back and forth, back and forth,  especially with cat hair, laundry detergent, etc. It somewhat works on perfectly flat surfaces, depending on what you're trying to sweep, so forget tile floors, natural stone floors, door jambs. Forget using it on a rug; also gets tangled in rug fringes. Make sure you keep it level, too, or else all the mess you just swept up falls back out again. Frankly, it is much easier just to take out the dustpan and broom.

0345308239|5.0|Reading Tuchman these days, she seems eerily prophetic.  The War in Iraq is classic folly--the pursuit of policy contrary to a nation's self-interest.  The leaders of the U.S. would do well to study it carefully. The book is for college-level readers, it's not easy stuff.  However, it is well worth the effort.<br /><br />There are so many classic lines in this book!  A sampling of some of my favorites:<br /><br />\\"Mankind, it seems, makes a poorer performance of government than of almost any other human activity.\\"<br /><br />\\"No experience of the failure of his policy could shake his belief in its essential excellence.\\" (Said of Philip II of Spain, but it fits George W. Bush to a T.)<br /><br />\\"Folly, in one of its aspects, is the obstinate attachment to a disserviceable goal.\\"<br /><br />\\"The wars of the League of Cambrai over the next five years exhibit all the logical consistency of opera librettos.\\"<br /><br />\\"...it should not be supposed that honor and dignity are better served by persisting in a wrong measure once entered into than by rectifying an error as soon as it is discovered.\\"  (From Benjamin Franklin.)<br /><br />\\"In the search for meaning we must not forget that the gods, or God for that matter, are a concept of the human mind; they are the creatures of man, not vice versa.\\"<br /><br />As Tuchman points out, folly does not consist only in going ahead with pointless wars.  Tuchman also calls it folly when we insist on economic growth when such growth is demonstrably using up the basics of life on our planet.  I agree!  Tuchman doesn't mention Social Security or Medicare and their runaway costs, but the inability to address these programs rationally looks like folly to me. Do we really want it said of our age \\"after us, the deluge\\"?

B0001FR3IQ|5.0|halle berry is a great actress. most of the movies she stars in arent the best but she does hold her own.  lately since monster's ball has she had such power and ability to deliver a powerhouse performance, which she does in this amazing bone chiller GOTHIKA. <br /> <br />halle plays a doctor that ends up in her institution after a crash. they believe that she killed her husband. so she has to prove to everyone that she did not do it.  so there are a ton of plot twist and turns that will get you zapped into the picture. <br /> <br />the ensemble is remarkable as well: robert downey jr, penelope cruz, & charles s. dutton. they all performed very well in the movie.   <br /> <br /> <br />i recommend this movie to anybody that loves thrillers. and halle berry in a movie wouldnt hurt as well. <br /> <br />5 out of 5 stars: brilliantly done... <br />
B000BP86OG|5.0|When the Darkness recorded their debut album, \\"Permission to Land,\\" they were fresh off the British pub circuit and limited on money and time.  The album was recorded quickly and cheaply; they played stripped-down classic rock and roll.  The mixing on the album left something to be desired; the music itself was good but the overall recording quality was muddy at best.   <br /> <br />The same problems do not plague this record. <br /> <br />The album is painstakingly recorded.  An expanded recording budget suits the Darkness well.  They are a band known for their bombast, and it runs wild with heavily overdubbed vocals, exotic instruments (pan flute at the beginning of the album, sitar, strings and lush keyboards) and harmonized guitar solos.  As previous reviewers have noted, the Darkness draw a large part of their inspiration from Freddie Mercury and Queen.  Therefore, this album doesn't necessarily break any new ground.  However, this album blows most current music out of the water for one reason: the Darkness' music is fun.   <br /> <br />In a time when nu-metal are emotionless and \\"emo\\" bands lament anything and everything, the Darkness are a breath of fresh air.  This is not to say that there is anything wrong with the aforementioned bands, besides the fact that entirely too many exist.  The Darkness, meanwhile, are a band known for catsuits and rock 'n' roll excesses.  This album is a good distillation of the fun-loving tendencies of the band.   <br /> <br />Take, for example, \\"Knockers.\\"  The name itself is cheeky, and the lyrics follow suit.  For the entirety of the album, the Darkness stick to a tried-and-true formula.  There are the hard rockers (\\"One Way Ticket,\\" \\"Bald\\"), the power ballads (\\"It Seemed Like Such a Good Idea at the Time,\\" \\"Blind Man\\") and the light-hearted romps (\\"Hazel Eyes,\\" \\"Knockers,\\" \\"Girlfriend\\"). <br /> <br />In the end, this album rocks.  If you dislike operatic and sometimes excessive falsetto, look elsewhere.  Otherwise, this is rock album to own.
1400082773|5.0|In Barack Obama's \\"Dreams from My Father\\" I discovered a fascinating brain and an accepting mind that came to terms with his dual inheritance.      He provided us with an insight of the African-American experience, of the hopes and dreams of the people, of the realities they confronted and of their failures. In his inspiring appearance at the Democratic convention, Obama emerged as a rising star in the American political scene, a relatable figure with a strong personality. His speech was very moving. The fact that this book was written before Obama gained so much political popularity, seems to be the reason it is so authentic, unlike many of the autobiographies we read.     This book, is the lyrical, unsentimental, and compelling memoir, of the son of a black African father and a white American mother.  Obama searches for a workable meaning to his life as a black American. It begins in New York, where Barack Obama learns that his father--a figure he knows more as a myth than as a man--has been killed in a car accident. The sudden death of his father inspires an emotional odyssey-first to a small town in Kansas, from which he retraces the migration of his mother's family to Hawaii, and then to Kenya, where he meets the African side of his family, and confronts the bitter truth of his father's life.  There he reconciles his divided racial inheritance.     This is one of the most well written memoirs I have ever read. At some points it reads so much like a novel that I stopped to check the cover and make sure there was no \\"as told to\\" or other writing credit. The prose is lean and lyrical - while occasionally the   themes are repetitive, overall I loved the circular nature of his exploration of life, race and class. I appreciated the honesty and integrity of his thoughts on black culture and the struggle to define blackness and appreciate life in the US. I think he exposes a lot of the most painful truths about race in this country, while offering hope and reason - rather than condemnation - to both black and white.    I agree with other reviewers who have indicated that the book does feel unfinished. He did not spend much time discussing the people in his life that are and were very supportive (mother and grandparents) but I saw two reasons for this: First, the book is   unfinished in the sense that he is also \\"unfinished\\" and what it does cover is a sense of opening, discovery and closure around a complicated relationship with a parent that existed primarily in his own impressions.     Which brings me to reason #2: the unresolved relationship with his father fueled much of his early life choices. It feels only natural that these two stories be told in tandem. Now that he is a senator and much older through experience I would be curious to know how the telling of his life might change. As he indicates in the forward of the new edition - with so much distance between that experience and the life he's lived between Kenya and \\"now\\" there is much in his life that has to do with the impressions others like his mother and grandparents made. I suspect that it was rewritten to encompass more of his life, those other areas might balance the struggle to \\"find\\" his father and himself in those early years.     All that is to say: don't let his \\"preoccupation\\" with an absent father steer you away from this book. It in no way feels self indulgent or as an \\"open wound.\\" Instead, I found an inspirational journey and a thoughtful exploration that made for a quick read!     Barack Obama graduated from Harvard Law School in 1991, where he served as the first African-American president of the Harvard Law Review. He has worked as a community organizer, civil rights attorney, and law professor. Since 1997, he has represented parts of Chicago's South Side in the Illinois General Assembly, and he is currently the Democratic nominee to become the junior U.S. senator from Illinois. He lives in Chicago with his wife, Michelle, and daughters, Malia and Sasha.   =========================  Review by Stephen Rivers  For more visit us online
B00005JMAH|4.0|Let me just say this is a relatively well put together movie and Alfonso Cuaron does a great job directing this movie.  This third installment in the series, although not as gripping as Cuaron's \\"Y tu mama tambien?\\", gives a new look to the harry potter series with a darker and more formidable look.  Cuaron focuses more on the characters of harry, hermione, and ron, rather than trying to blow the audience away with amazing special effects.  Harry Potter will always sell, but this movie does a good job keeping with the books without making the movie 3 1/2 hours long at the same time, not cutting out anything of great importance.
B000002MTU|5.0|Okay people...listen up.  This album is as one review put it \\"what Clapton wanted to do his whole life.\\"  This album is not supposed to have tracks that sound exactly like the original.  If you're pissed off at that, don't listen to it.  Next on phrasing.  One review stated that his \\"phrasing is terrible.\\"  To this review, I ask if you know what phrasing is.  As a collegiate music student, I have a good idea of what it is, and Clapton has an even better idea that I do.  He's been playing the blues for longer than I've been alive, and I trust that he has an excellent concept of phrasing, and this album shows it.   <br /> <br />Third, a review stated that the album sounded \\"too overproduced\\".  If you read the liner notes in the CD you would have read that the entire album, minus two tracks, were recorded LIVE in the studio, meaning that it was cut in one take without any overdubbing.  Try again. <br /> <br />Clapton did not mean for this album to be the best in the history of the blues, he meant it to be an expression of what was going on in his life at the time.  This CD does this, in his vocals and playing.   <br /> <br />\\"From the Cradle\\" is one of my favorite Clapton albums.  It shows control, excellent vocals, superb guitar playing, and an excellent example of how emotion can be put into music.  This album is worth every cent I paid for it five years ago when I bought it.

I think they felt Motley Crue did something  great a year before (although they formed after TS) with Shout At The Devil and not a lot of men were willing to do the same................until Twisted Sister. And not having enough, they hired Tom Werman on the production.<br /><br />Following the theory \\"One hit wonder\\" (which in this case is absolutely wrong), this have happened to a lot of bands over the years. Why?<br /><br />1) MTV: Very clear, right?<br /><br />2) Radio Stations: They keep fighting with the videos, but they are as guilty destroying good bands as MTV.<br /><br />On the megasuccess \\"We're Not Gonna Take It\\" it was pretty obvious that it was going to be a hit. If you keep playing a song on the radio over and over again sooner or later it'll become a hit, on this case the song was very good and even the grandparents start to like'em (pretty much the same that happended to KISS a few years back). I remember in 1984 or 1985 that I was fooling around changing the radiostations and 3 of them were playing \\"WNGTI\\" at the same time. So there is no surprise that a lot of pressure appear after this album.<br /><br />Same happend to STYX (MR.

In the case of TWISTED SISTER is not right cause \\"I Wanna Rock\\" and \\"The Price\\" made it on the Top 40. It's pointless to pick this band, even if you don't like it.<br /><br />Now, to the recording. What happended on Stay Hungry is kind of the same formula they have been using over the years but Dee Snider found the way to make it a little bit more commercial-friendly, maybe with the help from Tom Werman and the record company, but he made sure he wasn't going to step back now that they were on the safe side (or at least that's what they thought).<br /><br />Stay Hungry is a straight Heavy Metal trip if you skip the 3 radiofriendly songs. Don't get me wrong, the songs are great, but you can sense the songs are not what they were trying to do.

0061015725|4.0|This is a story of technology run amok.  In this case it is the narrator's wife's company that fails to control adverse outcomes.  This is also a tale of a two-career family since much of the couple's domestic life is portrayed. Jack's wife is the vice president of a nano manufacturing company, although nano is now a bad word to investors since so much had been promised in the past and not achieved.  Jack is a temporary house husband since he became a whistle blower in his own organization and has been deemed not a team player.  He had handled a bevy of programmers working in distributed processing,  and had found that all was not well when he undertook additional tasks in the security area.  He had trained as a population biologist and had sort of fallen into computer work.  Jack Forman has three children, Amanda, age nine months, Eric, age eight, and Nicole, age twelve.  He refuses to interview for jobs in Texas and New York since he believes his wife doesn't want to move.  He becomes a consultant at his wife's company when it is evident there is a problem, and since he knows the code he may be useful.      The facility is located in Nevada and the problem has to do with swarming.  Jack understands predator-prey relationships.  Angry predators do not lose focus.  Assembly lines move at the rate of one part per second.  This is called the build time problem.  Since nano-manufacturing has to be much more efficient, it is convergent assembly he is told.  The architecture is fractal.  Technologies are a form of knowledge.  They evolve, they mature.  The company is using bacteria to crank out their molecules.  It is genetic engineering, not nanotechnology.  An employee of the company claims it is a hybrid, a bit of both.  Jack is called upon to work at the company because there are runaway swarms.  No one else can deal with them.  Furthermore, the cloud has been self-sustaining for days.      The staff discovers gamma assemblers, used to break down carbon, have causedall the memory chips in their cars to turn to dust.  Obviously self-assembly is occurring in the desert from improperly vented bacteria and assembly pieces, or at least this is Jack's working hypothesis.  The swarms are reproducing.  Functionally, they are alive. How Jack unravels the problem and exterminates the swarms makes very exciting reading.  His personal travails on the domestic and romantic front engender reader identification.
B000BBOUU4|1.0|but I just couldn't.  I kept an open mind during the beginning of the movie, but the movie kept getting darker and darker.  Very disappointing to my husband and myself.  My daughter loved it however... but she didn't grow up with the Wilder version.<br /><br />I would NOT say that Johnny Depp did a bad job... I just did not care for this version of the character of Willy Wonka.
B0007OCG4W|3.0|2004's \\"Closer\\" was directed by Mike Nichols, and it has a lot in common with his legendary 1971 film \\"Carnal Knowledge\\" (which stars Jack Nicholson).  Unfortunately, \\"Closer\\" isn't as profound as that earlier film.      Frankly, \\"Closer\\", although an interesting movie, is frustratingly hollow.  It has kind of a go-nowhere plot, with characters demonstrating baffling, erractic behavior for reasons that make basically no rational sense.  That said, each of the four main characters here are desperate, as well as emotional wrecks.  There are indeed a number of gripping scenes, with particular thanks to Clive Owen for his excellent portrayal of the sexually-obsessed and morally bankrupt dermatologist Larry.  Jude Law is also solid as the charming-on-the-surface but self-loathing obituary writer Dan.      The weak link in the chain, as far as the acting is concerned, is Natalie Portman.  She delivers an annoying, unconvincing, forgettable performance as a stripper supposedly named Alice Ayers.  The fact that she was nominated for an Academy Award doesn't speak highly of either the Academy or the current state of high profile movies.    The movie loses additional points for its prominent use of the absolutely horrible, pompous, pretentious, and predictable Damien Rice song \\"The Blower's Daughter\\".  This song is featured basically in its entirety at the very beginning of the movie, a terrible way to start things off.  As a worthless \\"bonus\\" feature, the DVD release features the music video for this excruciating and unimaginative song.    Overall, \\"Closer\\" is a good, watchable film, but it feels undercooked and ends up being disappointingly unsatisfying.
B000002NJS|4.0|Ok, while Ray of Light may be an unfair comparison to Pink Floyd's Dark side of the Moon, Pet Sounds from the Beach Boys, or Beatles Psychedelic songs that we all love, Madonna's material on this album ASPIRE to that greatness.  I like the mood it sets...space odessy like sounds with a bit of mystery,  along with great beats (the ambiance makes you feel good). I think it's one of her best albums where her voice works well with her music......and for the first time ever, I actually agree with the critics......her singing lessons from \\"Evita\\" really paid off on this album. She's singing at her best and her material feels more mature too.<br />Songs that catch my attention (besides those well known hits off this album): Substiute for Love, Swim, and Nothing really matters.<br />Ray of Light is quite unique. It leaves me longing to hear more of these types of songs from her......and that's when I know it's a good album.
B000BGH22W|5.0|When I bought this soundtrack, I hadn't seen the movie, nor had I noticed that it wasn't John Williams.  So, when I put it in my CD player, I was angry that it wasn't the same music.  I decided to put it aside and watch the movie to see if it made the music any better and it does!  Patrick Doyle puts together some wonderful pieces that really should be listened to with an open mind because they're really quite good.  Don't discount this soundtrack because John Williams didn't do it.  See the movie first, too.  There's a few streams from John Williams music, but 98% of it is new.  It's still very good however if looked at with an open mind because John Williams isn't the only good composer out there.  True, it might have been nice to stick with the same composer, but the director chose Patrick Doyle because he'd worked with him in the past and liked him.  Doyle has some other very good soundtracks as well.  Just give it a chance.  If you listen to it and are planning on hating it, you will, but if you listen with an open mind there's good chance you'll like it (especially if you liked the movie).
0670033375|5.0|We just finished listening to the book on CD on a 10 hour round trip this past weekend. (We finished 6 out of 8 of the CDs in 10 hours, and the last 2 at home). <br /> <br />I am not a PHD.  I'm simply a 50 year old computer guy, married, with no kids, and a small extended family.  So, the future of the planet is not essential to us, but we still find a strong desire to spread the word that everyone from 7th grade up should read this book, as \\"required reading\\" (or listening).  Ok, it is a bit long winded, but so what.  That makes it pretty thorough. (The pace of the CD is actually very fast.  I think the book, for me, would probably be a hard read). Are there some mistakes?  Probably.  But so what again.  That's not the point.  Nit picking.  It's design is to make us think and make us realize that what happens to us will not improve due to the government or technology, but by the public demanding that the right thing is done, or else!   <br /> <br />Some of the reviews here belittle the conclusions and suggestions, and proclaim, \\"It can't happen here.\\"  Baloney. <br />I hope they are right.  Because this little experiment we are playing with our planet, just in the past 100 years, is not easily reversed.  If this petri dish of a planet fails and collapses, you can't just rinse it off and start again.  That's it.  Over and out.   <br /> <br />So, should we continue in an indifferent fashion with heads in the sand, or learn how we can spread the word, and take public action to stop the insanity? <br /> <br />I don't have to believe everything written in the book to know how bad it's getting.  Take a 5 minute drive with your car window open in any major metroplex (gag).  Or try snorkeling in any US body of water.  How far can you see?  Then, try the same thing in China.  Yikes! <br /> <br />If your boss said, \\"Hey Bob.  We're moving your desk into the mens room at Yankee Stadium, ok?\\"  Bob wouldn't like that, right?  So, why do we want to live in a world the mimics that same mens room? <br /> <br />For the sake of your children and their grandchildren, it's now or never.  Some of the information in the book is also very helpful to understand what positive actions you can take to not be a part of the problem, but instead, a part of the solution. <br /> <br />
B000B7HZXM|1.0|Only Blue Skies is nice in this album..the others are so oversung..so poppy..
B00004RF9I|5.0|Paddy Chayefsky's 1976 film, NETWORK, won critical praise, audience approval, and several nods from the Academy, so that should indicate to anyone that this film is beyond brilliant. Chayefsky's searing indictment of broadcast television, and the news programs specifically, still rings true nearly 30 years later.  <br /> <br />Powerful performances by William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Peter Finch, and Robert Duvall keep the fierce satire going with nothing less than inspired performances. Sidney Lumet's direction is flawless. (Has this guy ever directed a bad film?) Punctuating the outlandish humor is the gut-wrenching poignancy of so many of the film's scenes. It's just too bad that none of the real television networks took note from this film; and Paddy Chayefsky might be rolling over in his grave, if he were to see the cable news networks of today. <br /> <br />Still, this is truly a groundbreaking film that must be on everyone's \\"must watch\\" list.  <br /> <br />P.S. -- The NETWORK trivia quiz at the end is a lot of fun.

B0006VIE4C|5.0|When Star Wars Episode III came out, I was advised to see one of the original movies before going to the new one. I wasn't that excited; I wasn't really a science fiction fan. And who really cares about a bunch of spaceships getting shot up and tall guys with capes and shiny black helmets getting decapitated by light-wand swords, anyway. <br />What I didn't realize was how much more the original Star Wars trilogy was than that. <br /> <br />\\"Whatever,\\" I thought. It was bound to be entertaining. So I willingly watched A New Hope. I finished it grinning from ear to ear. <br /> <br />I made up a new expression- don't judge a movie from its weapons (although lightsabers ARE really cool). Star Wars Episode IV was officially my favorite movie ever. <br /> <br />It was the characters that I liked so much. They're complex. Although Star Wars really is just another battle of good and evil, the twist is that nobody is just \\"nice\\" or \\"mean.\\" <br />I immediately loved those endearing sidekicks: R2D2, the stumpy little beeping robotic toddler, C3PO, the nervous gold protocol droid who won't shut up, and Chewbacca, that \\"big walking carpet.\\" <br />Han Solo is so arrogant and stubborn, but at the same time, lovable. Leia has the famous \\"just because you just rescued me doesn't mean I can't help you shoot the villains\\" attitude. And though Luke might not seem to have the immediate obvious personality of the other two, he has a likeable thing about him that makes you feel so horrible when bad things happen to him. <br /> <br />For those that don't know anything about Star Wars, I will explain that a Jedi is, first of all, a good guy, a member of a group that basically fights against the Empire (the bad guys) to save the universe. The Sith is a sort of dark Jedi. <br />The Force is a power that everything has, which can do just about anything that, to put it simply, a ghost could do. It can lift things, move things, squeeze things, all of that. The art to being a Jedi or Sith is touse the force to your advantage. <br />Droid is short for android, which is a robot. <br />A lightsaber (don't tell me you don't know what a lightsaber is) is basically a sword, except the blade is made of light. It can be turned off and on easily, which is useful because of its sharpness. It wouldn't be any good to go stabbing yourself with your lightsaber all the time. <br /> <br />The plot is fairly simple. <br />Young moisture farmer Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), who lives with his Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru on the barren desert planet Tattooine, has big dreams. He has heard of the accomplishments of his late Jedi father, Anakin Skywalker, and he finds out that an Obi-Wan Kenobi (Sir Alec Guinness) taught him. Luke realizes that he has a neighbor named Ben Kenobi, and he is curious, so he decides to go see if the Kenobis have any relation to each other. <br />Luke finds out that Obi-Wan and Ben Kenobi are the same man. Obi-Wan promises to teach Luke the ways of a Jedi and the ways of the Force. After Luke's aunt and uncle's home is bombed by the Empire, Luke has no reason to stay- he has been sent on a mission: he must rescue the Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher). <br />With the help of the droids R2D2 and C3PO, and also smuggler/pilot Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and his partner Chewbacca, a big, furry, howling Wookiee, and a lightsaber, Luke Skywalker rescues Princess Leia from the Death Star, a planet-sized ship belonging to the Empire, and faces many dangers, including Darth Vader. <br />That famous seven-foot-tall masked, caped individual is probably more robot than man, but it's hard to tell. His skill with both a lightsaber and the Force are almost impossible to beat. <br />Though Luke has many dilemmas along the way, the young hero is learning. He will be more than ready for training with Jedi Master Yoda in Episode V. <br /> <br />Anyway, I would DEFINITELY recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch it. From my experience, people who watched Star Wars either loved it or hated it, so I am not guaranteeing anything, but one bit of advice would be this: if you are watching it for the violence, weapons or the special effects, watch Episodes I, II, and III, but I thought that these were lacking in personality and humor, as well (Anakin doesn't smile once in all of Episode III). Episodes IV, V, and VI are stuffed full of character and, though suspenseful at parts, have comic relief quite often. They may not have the best special effects by modern standards, but try to imagine that this is 1977. These were new concepts then. <br />These classics sucked me into the world of Star Wars (or should I say the universe) and I was glued to the screen the whole time. I was sad when the main characters were, and happy when they were. I think that George Lucas did a tremendous job with the original trilogy, but just lost momentum for the last three. <br />I still think Star Wars is one of the most amazing movies ever made, if not THE most amazing movie ever made. If you are considering watching it, I will say that it was nothing like how I expected, and I hope that you feel the same way. <br />Star Wars didn't gain the title of a classic for no reason. It is loved by the country, and if you look hard enough, you can find little bits and pieces from it in modern culture. <br />I hope you enjoy Star Wars Episode IV. Good luck and use the force!

B000001EAQ|5.0|Well, well, well.  I have finally arrived at POPmart, where the irony is served straight up, with a twist.  Perhaps U2's most maligned album, right up there with Rattle and Hum.  I shall initiate this review with a theory that I have read in other places, the U2 3-Album Cycle. I will place POP the the end of the final 3-album cycle.<br /><br />1)Boy, October, War---A friend of mine called this \\"Boy, Teen, Man.\\"  A somewhat linear beginning for the band, as they bring innocence and wonder on BOY, discovery and (religious) thunder on October, and greed and plunder on WAR.  Each album maturing from the last.  WAR is U2 finally going back to their punk influences after being \\"rootless\\" on their 1st 2.<br /><br />2)Unforgettable Fire, Joshua Tree, Rattle & Hum---Again, 3 albums that have a definite connection to another.  Another WAR would have pigeonholed the band's \\"sound\\", so they go back to another \\"beginning\\" for them; a more mature \\"European\\" album.  Joshua Tree sounds like the blend of WAR and UFire, making the sound more expansive while the songs more compact.  The logical conclusion of this 3 album cycle is a \\"live\\" album, and one where U2 goes back to roots they never quite owned, American music. (Note: UABRS, another U2 \\"live\\" album, came out after WAR).<br /><br />And Now the final 3 album cycle<br /><br />3)Achtung, Zooropa, POP<br /><br />Having cleared their creative decks twice, U2 followed the Rattle and Hum bombast underground, where they meant to \\"dream it all up again\\", another beginning, if you will.  But this time, their beginning was the end and everything in between, as U2 created arguably their finest ALBUM (i.e. beginning to end) Achtung Baby.  In many ways the manic energy level was akin to BOY; U2 were on fire.  They followed it up mid ZOO TV Tour with Zooropa, setting a very chill and fluid mood after the giddiness and grandiosity of Achtung baby.<br /><br />U2's POP was U2's first studio album in 4 years.  They had redefined music and concerts, cut a swath of flash and fury across America, and catured it all on ZOO TV: Live In Sydney, argualby their best concert video.  But now, they slowly emerged in early 1997 as ironic hipsters, a little jaded and a lot more mature.  They announced their new album/tour by playing a show at K-Mart.  They were tossing out names like Portishead, Prodigy, and Theivery Corp. as turn-ons. They announced that their tour would be one of a kind.  Judging off of ZOO TV, what else could the boys do to top that?  Had U2 gone techno? What's \\"space junk?\\"  What can we expect?<br /><br />The best.<br /><br />From the intro to \\"Discotheque\\" you can tell the boys have fun on their minds.  The edge fades in a great guitar intro, almost a reverse \\"Streets\\" riff, but thicker, with more funk and attitude.  \\"Do You Feel Loved\\" showcases Bono's falsetto at the end, while Edge both chimes and chars the guitar with fire and ice.  Perhaps the song that most detractors point to as U2 gone \\"techno\\" is \\"Mofo.\\"  This not quite surprisingly, is the best rock song on the album.  Thge Edge launches one bent note into the stratosphere over an unbelievable Adam-Larry groove.  Then at the midpoint, Bono pleas to hear his mothers' voice from beyond the grave as the music stops, then; just as quickly, the groove turns on again.  The first of two true ballads on this album, \\"Angels\\" is a great number about doubting your faith and God. The other ballad,\\" Staring at the Sun\\" is propelled by Edge's guitar sound and great lyrics from Bono.  Now the album takes a twist towards \\"Last Night On Earth\\", a manically ferocious rock song with the loud refrain \\"YOU GOT TO GIVE IT AWAY\\", a song addressed to a woman strung out and party-hungry, maybe having danced to \\"MOFO\\" earlier in the booze-soaked night.  This song had the same effect \\"The Fly\\" did in AB.  Now Bono seeks penance in the slower-tempoed rocker \\"Gone\\" as Bono declares \\"Goodbye/You can keep this suit of lights\\" an obvious reference to his rockstar status; more specifically the characters he played on the ZOO TV tour.  Another dense musical gem.  Next song \\"MIami\\" another song often brought up with disdain by those who felt U2 went \\"techno\\".  This song does sound like a B-side at times, but in the context of the album, it fits perfectly.  Bono compares Miami to a woman with some pretty funny lyrics \\"Miami! My mammy!\\" but it is also the sound of a lost soul looking for a place to go no matter how bad it is for him when he gets there.  Same goes for \\"The Playboy mansion\\"  a bit of funk blues guitar from Edge opens the doors to this song, as Bono states \\"We'll go driving through that pool/It's who you know that gets you through/the gates of the Playboy Mansion.\\" Still hasn't found what he's looking for....The album starts to crowd in on itself with the slow ballad \\"Velvet Dress.\\"  A wonderful bass line from Adam sets the tone for this song, a plea from Bono to his lover.  Then midpoint, Edge's guitar kicks in a very original way.  Next song \\"Please\\" Bono's update on Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" but with another great groove from ADam and Larry and a beautiful guitar riff by Edge.<br /><br />U2 has taken their fans to the edge of hell and the brink of heaven over the last 3 albums, and now POP collapses under its own weight and we are left with Bono pleading for Jesus' return in \\"Wake Up Dead Man\\".  As he sought to close his eyes at the end of AB with \\"Love is Blindness\\", as he sought redemption through Johnny Cash in \\"The Wanderer\\", Bono seeks to close this chapter of U2 by singing through what sounds like a broken nose, as Edge's melody is an insistent call above. \\"Jesus help me/I'm alone in this world/and a f***ed up world it is too.\\"  What a way to end an era for the world's greatest band.tus; more specifically the characters he played on the ZOO TV tour.

B00004X01U|4.0|Let's start off by saying that \\"Music\\" is a classic single. It belongs alongside such hits as \\"Holiday\\" and \\"Vogue\\" and contains that old Madonna magic. While there isn't another single like this on Music, the followup to 1998's brilliant 'Ray of Light', the album does hold the same spark of those good old days when Madonna wore fishnet and gyrated her way in the hearts of millions. It was 2000 when Music came out, and she is a slightly different Madonna. Where 'Ray of Light' was packed with introspection and slick, squiggly beats, 'Music'isn't quite so serious in either one. It's effortless, but at the same time maintains a charm not found on most modern pop records. \\"Music\\" is the best example of her \\"Lets just dance\\" approach, giving way to the slurping, dizzying \\"Impressive Instant\\". There are vocoders galore, and while they do seem a bit too much in some places, on tracks like the chilly, \\"Nobody's Perfect\\" and the almost menacing robo-slow \\"Paradise (Not for Me)\\", the digital effects work in a slinky, sneaky kind of way, allowing for those all important catchy hooks to set in. \\"Amazing\\" feels like a twin sister to \\"Beautiful Stranger\\", but the psychadelic guitar swirl is irresistably delicious. Even in her most stripped down, primitive ballads, \\"I Deserve It\\" is downright pretty, and while some rhyme schemes in the rootin tootin \\"Don't Tell Me\\" are cringe-worthy, it justifies that cowgirl hat she's been wearing these days. This song would make anyone want to dust off their  dancing boots. While all the songs have their own special something, it is \\"What it Feels Like for a Girl\\" that is the show stopper. It's glossy, it's sophisticated, it works so well, you can hardly believe Madonna has been crafting gems like these for two decades. For all those in doubt of her skills, 'Music' proves she's still got some spunk in her spurs. Did I make too many cowgirl references?
B000BGR0OM|3.0|Okay, the best part about this second hits collection is that all the songs are digitally remastered, that it includes \\"17 Again\\" and \\"I Saved The World Today\\" from their last cd \\"Peace\\" and that it includes two new tracks, \\"I've Got A Life\\" and \\"Was It Just Another Love Affair?\\", Dave and Annie's first music together in six years. Also, on one disc you have 19 songs and 80 minutes of music for good value, plus the lyrics to all the songs are included.<br /><br />Now the bad part. There really should be an ESSENTIAL Eurythmics compilation consisting of two discs, so as to cover all the hits plus all the great album cuts. For example, this compilation left out \\"Never Gonna Cry Again\\", \\"Take Me To Your Heart\\" and \\"Belinda\\" from their 1981 debut \\"In The Garden\\". Take your pick of songs from their 1982 sophomore effort \\"Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)\\". The only tracks included here are the title track and \\"Love Is A Stranger\\". Same could be said of their third album \\"Touch\\". There were other great songs on that album. There are no tracks from their soundtrack album to \\"1984 For The Love Of Big Brother\\". They ought to include \\"Sexcrime (1984)\\", \\"Julia\\", \\"For The Love Of Big Brother\\" and \\"Doubleplusgood\\".<br /><br />There were other solid tracks from 1985's \\"Be Yourself Tonight\\" such as \\"Conditioned Soul\\" and \\"I Love You Like A Ball And Chain\\". 1986's \\"Revenge\\" is sufficiently covered. \\"Savage\\" is woefully under-represented leaving out \\"Beethoven (I Love To Listen To)\\", \\"I've Got A Lover (Back In Japan)\\", \\"Shame\\" and \\"Brand New Day\\". For some strange reason there are NO songs from 1989's \\"We Too Are One\\" album. They should include \\"The King And Queen Of America\\", \\"Don't Ask Me Why\\", \\"Angel\\" and then there's \\"My My Baby's Gonna Cry\\", \\"How Long?\\" and \\"When The Day Goes Down\\".<br /><br />While we're at it, why not include some solo work like the Annie Lennox/Al Green 1988 cover of \\"Put A Little Love In Your Heart\\" or \\"Love Song For A Vampire\\" from 1992's \\"Dracula\\". There are some good Dave Stewart solo tracks as well from his four solo albums. Why not include Annie's \\"Why\\", \\"Walking On Broken Glass\\", \\"Little Bird\\", \\"No More 'I Love You's'\\" and \\"Pavement Cracks\\".<br /><br />All I'm saying is that this could have been better for fans and for casual listeners. There are no extensive liner notes or chart information included in the booklet. As it stands, \\"I've Got A Life\\" is great, but too bad it won't get the radio play it deserves, and \\"Was It Just Another Love Affair\\" is good retro-seventies r&b fodder. So, let me be clear, the Eurythmics get five stars, but whoever put this compilation together receives three stars for lack of effort grade. I should give an F grade to lack of research and conciseness. With all the fad being two disc, career spanning hits collections these days, this was a great error.solo tracks as well from his four solo albums.

B000BP86OG|5.0|So here we go again as \\"The Darkness\\" bounce back satin jump suited and rocking the tiles from the roof. Some advancements have been made and applied particularly in the production stakes with the legendary Roy Thomas Baker at the helm which sharpens the whole experience nicely in the guitar and multi-vocal layering departments, can I hear you yell Queen? Sure the comparisons are inevitable.<br /><br />I definitely think this release has much more to offer song wise with no filler. At times a little darker than \\"Permission\\" and hinting of battle scars experienced personally and band wise it makes you want to explore the songs a little further. The simple brilliance of the song writing is still intact. Just listen to `Dinner Lady Arms' for growth and then try getting it out of your head, a delightful ELO style hybrid. \\"Knockers\\" for the fantastic couplet of  `and I love what you've done with your hair / oh yeah' magic!<br /><br />\\"Seemed Like a Good Idea At The Time\\" is a power ballad complete with strings and key changes abound and a relatively restrained vocal. \\"Hazel Eyes\\" is a winner with its swagger and kilt twirling Celt story telling theme. You take the high road and I'll take the low road, but no middle of the road for these guys a ripsnorter that is hard to take too seriously. Then the darkest offering in \\"Bald\\" an epic feel much like a Metallica's `One' or perhaps Queen's `Bohemian Rhapsody' but around the very important issue of a man loosing his hair through the aging effects of balding and the denial that the wig being woven is for him, its for a friend. Seriously this is not serious and brings a smile to the face. But it should be noted that it's a monolithic slab of rock just the same.<br /><br />\\"Girl\\" sounds like Status Quo mixed with Edison Lighthouse and is a fun summer pop song, a little light relief in the latter stages. \\"English Country Garden\\" is fun set down on the farm amongst the hay and the tale of a girl who passes her time in the pleasurable ways until she grows bored and moves onto the next boy after leaving the previous one spent.  It contains nice boogie style piano and gallops along at a frantic pace. \\"Blind Man\\" is heart felt and obviously means something to someone known to the band but can be related to anyone left alone after losing a loved one. Very Queen-like but the brass section is a nice touch.<br /><br />So there we have it another great release and despite the addition of strings, synths, sitars and Roy Thomas Baker its still the great song writing and fun that makes this band well worth visit number two. No case of the dreaded sophomore album here. Buy with absolute confidenceeasurable ways until she grows bored and moves onto the next boy after leaving the previous one spent.

B000BB1MI2|2.0|I really, really, REALLY wanted to like this film.  Johnny Depp is an amazing actor, and Tim Burton is a friggin' genius.  So when I sat down with my friend to watch it, we had high hopes. <br /> <br />The set design, costumes, music (Danny Elfman rocks!)are great and all have that Burton-esque manic uncomfortableness we have come to love.  And Johnny Depp gives a crazy/creepy aspect to Willy Wonka, which is exactly what I would have wanted, although with the caveat I mention below. So why didn't I like this film? <br /> <br />It's hard for me to say exactly.  Part of it is that the script seemed to drag in places.  Part of it was that I didn't care about the characters one way or the other; Charlie himself comes off so saccharine sweet, but in a way that didn't fit with the creepy hyper-cheerfulness of the rest of the flick, that I WANTED something untoward to happen to him.  Willy Wonka, while appropriately creepy, also came off more as a petulent, bitchy little brat, rather than as a mad genius / eternal kid.  And the little oopah-loompa songs, while a tip of the hat to the original movie, were juvenile. These are some of the things that bothered me.  Any one or two would have been OK, but the combo of all these and more doomed the film.  Clearly, this film is not for me. <br /> <br />The DVD itself is fine; clear picture, clear sound.  I must admit I was so disapointed by the film I didn't bother to watch the extras, if there are any.   <br /> <br />Like I said, I really wanted to like this movie, but for me it was missing that intangible something that makes Johnny Depp a great actor, and Tim Butron a genius film maker.

0553801503|2.0|<br />Final Assessment: aFFC, 4/10 for 4 thrilling Dorne chapters (aGOT, 9/10; aCOK 7/10; aSOS 10/10)  <br /> <br />I found A Feast for Crows such poor quality reading material, I can hardly believe George R.R. Martin's name on the book. Is the prose rich? It sure is, GRRM doesn't disappoint in that department, it's the subject of his prose which fails to move in the least.  <br /> <br />It would appear George R.R. Martin can no longer discern the forest from the trees. He tells us the story has grown on its own accord and the pages and chapters we find in this book are somehow \\"necessary\\". A story growing on its accord is a sure indication of pumping the reader with pointless, worthless content. The subject material contained within 680 odd pages of this book could be summed up by a few sentences.  <br /> <br />This book clearly forces stories where there are none.  <br /> <br />The book invites the reader to read 680 or so pages of inane, mindless drivel for something to happen. Nothing ever does. A classic case of epic fantasy syndrome.  <br /> <br />All in all, filler material and the first sign of an anecdotal epic fantasy disease in a series bereft of it thus far: inflated books that continue to no end but to fill the space in the pages. A Song of Ice and Fire hasn't grown on its accord; it's grown because GRRM sees the profit in stretching it out mercilessly.  <br /> <br />Zero build-up with zero payoffs, and nothing really happening. Another sure sign of a filler book.  <br /> <br />GRRM tells us that despite his novels fitting into a larger series, he likes to have each novel with an independent beginning, middle and end such that they stand on their own. This book can't stand anywhere, much less on its own.  <br /> <br />We waited 5 years for... this? Here's to hoping the next book is nothing like this one. I say it will take over 2 years to release (2-to-1 odds on it). I'll give you 100-to-1 odds if you pick under 2 years!  <br />

B000002J09|5.0|I'm going to be real with everyone. I'm not a hardcore rock fan. I'm barely a softcore fan for that matter. I'm more into r&b and jazz. However, even a 24 year old man can't resist the power of Zeppelin's music. Rather than go into a repetitive explanation of why I think they're the greatest rock band ever, I'm going to have my say as to why this one of the greatest rock albums ever recorded. <br /> <br />These are the following steps that makes up the stairway to a classic. <br /> <br />1. THE SONGS ARE A LOT TIGHTER ON THIS ALBUM; <br />   On previous albums, Some of their songs tended      <br />   to be a bit excessive in a way where there were too     <br />   much fat around the meat of their compositions (for     <br />   example, That long pause in \\"Whole Lotta Love\\"      <br />   and a even longer pause in the song \\"How Many More  <br />   Times\\"). While the songs are classics, I feel the long  <br />   pauses kind of takes away from the edge of the       <br />   compositions. I don't find that to be the case with any of  <br />   the tracks on their fourth album.  There are no long pauses  <br />   in any of the songs. The songs are all killer with no      <br />   filler to take up unnecessay space in the  <br />   songs. <br /> <br />2. IT'S THEIR MOST WELL ROUNDED ALBUM; <br />   While their previous albums tended to be focus on primarily  <br />   one style for the most part, this album is a variety of  <br />   styles with music and inspiration coming from a variety of  <br />   angles. In every song you hear something new and find that  <br />   they come up with same high quality results they have with  <br />   their previous albums.  It provides a ton of versatility  <br />   and proved that Zeppelin wasn't limited to their  <br />   blusey heavy metal that has often been associated with  <br />   them. <br /> <br />3. A FULLY REALIZED MASTERPEICE COMPARED TO IT'S PREDECESSORS; <br />   What also makes this album especially great along with is  <br />   that it sounds like eveything they've been doing since thier  <br />   debut was finally perfected in one consitently mind blowing  <br />   platter. Through hearing the tracks on ther previous albums,  <br />   they were building a foundation for what this album would   <br />   become to be. However those albums are great in their own  <br />   right,they're almost one dimensional (which could be a    <br />   good or a bad thing depending on who you are).The  <br />   versatility of this album makes this it's most definitive  <br />   statement as a group. In other words, If any fan needed just  <br />   one album to know what this band is about, this would be the  <br />   only album you need.                              <br />    <br />That is the stairway to a classic. Some may frown at the fact that I called their previous albums almost one dimensional. But I'm only being real and besides, you can't listen to their three previous albums and this album and tell me that the sequencing and the songs are not at their tightest and most focused on album 4. <br /> <br />I'm sorry if this was a bit long but when it comes Zeppelin's music, I have nothing but a \\"Whole Lotta Love\\".
B000BB1MIC|5.0|Season Four fizzled for me.  Other than the last 4 episodes, I didn't really enjoy it.  (Of course, I own that one, too!)   <br /> <br />But season five?  Whoa, mama!  Season five is the best yet.  We finally see Rory turning into a person.  After having an affair with her (married) ex-boyfriend, we now see that she is not the naive teenager we came to know and love in her Chilton years.  Drama, drama, drama, drama is included in Rory's storyline.  She's growing into a regular college student -- you guys know what I mean -- and she's doubting herself.  Not a good thing, but ASP pulls it off beautifully!  And the LL relationship!  The one we've been waiting for for five long years.  It's wonderful to see them finally together.  ASP pulls off their rough patch in the second half of the season wonderfully.  This season is the best yet!  BUY BUY BUY!
B0002OERI0|5.0|The time must come when we suspend our preferences, prejudices, and principles and admit when we've been entirely blown away.  This album was written by a trio of f-word loving, America-hating punk fanatics.  Not my kind of music, I know.  but then I listened to the album, which my sister got a copy of off of a friend.  The title track is inflammatory and hateful, but must be impartially acknowledged as a very good song. <br />The title track is also the worst song on the entire album. <br />It is a work of art. <br />That's the only way to put it.  This album has heart and soul to it.  Every song ties into every other song, and you're constantly finding new meanings and images as you listen and relisten.  Layer after layer after layer unfolds before your eyes and blows you away. <br />The music itself is far from stock Green Day.  Gone are most of the punk themes, with the possible exception of the \\"St. Jimmy\\" and \\"She's a Rebel\\" tracks.  Instead, what you have is fresh and new music from a band that frankly seemed set in its ways, while simultaneously acknowledging their past and the other greats.  And aside from the continual (and hilariously annoying) use of the f-word, the lyrics are provocative and interesting.  I'm convinced that the album tells a story, and I'm still searching for the full thing.  And while I loathe to give a five-out-of-five to the album that gave us American Idiot, I feel I must. <br />So.  Five outta five.  A must-own.
1878424319|5.0|i was very skeptical when i picked up the book. i had read books with similiar promises to help you succeed in life. but none of them ever REALLY helped me. This book though, from the first chapter caused me to think deeply about my life and what i was living it for.  <br /> <br />With four simple agreements and some very entrancing stories this book has changed my life forever. I will never be the same person I was when I picked the book up. And believe me you, the change was for the better. Now I no longer have any major stress about anything. I don't try to please other ppl as a goal. And one of the major changes of mine, is that I now no longer allow what anyone says about me affect me because I now realise that it has absolutely nothing to do with me, as whatever they feel is due to their own dream and way of thinking. <br /> <br />I can only hope that more people will experience the power and love this book can bring. <br />
0060977493|2.0|I was required to read this book for my college-intro to lit class. i could see right away why my teacher had picked this book for our class to read; it was full of political and historically important events and being that my teacher a extreme liberal and history teacher he loves reading about those sorts of things. <br /> <br />I however did not like the book. I felt there was alot of things that could have been left out.  the book could have been condensed into half of what it is now and would have been more meaningful and had a stronger conveyance of what the author was trying to get across to the readers. After reading the novel i couldn't really see what the author was trying to get at. <br /> <br />The way the author wrote; disjointed and in tiny snippets of random information made it seem as if she had no conviction and wasn't even really interested in what she was writing about. I believe the reason for this was to try and show some foreshadowing but she could have more effectivley expressed this by organizing her thoughts a bit more and not writing in such a disjointed manner. <br /> <br />To some her phrasing and the way she worded and structured her sentences was lyrical and beautiful but I however was extremley bored with it.. i wanted to put the book down after about the first meaningless chapter but since i was required to read the book had to force my self through the book. The author made it seem as if she was dancing around the issue by fluffing up the story with random and otherwise meaning less details. <br /> <br />i have heard rumors that the booker prize is based largley on what political views the author has as a person and how the author has incorporated those views into their literary works.  if those rumors are true then i can see why she got the award. Other than that i was astounded that such a novel would recieve an award. <br /> <br />I would not have given her an award for this novel over my dead body; she lacked conviction and the ability to capture the audience because of her dis-jointedness and the fact that she skipped around the subject. <br /> <br />I would highly suggest that if you are not required to read this novel that you stay away from it. it was a very disappointing read.
B000BJ7BCK|3.0|A fun family film that the whole family will enjoy. I like family films that are good for adults as much as kids and this is one of them. The story is a good combination of the Incredables and Harry Potter. The story is fun but at times it drags on and has some corney moments but it's a disney family film so who cares. The visuals are good and the direction is also good. The acting was good but not great I liekd Kurt Russel but founf the Kelly Preston could of had more it was like she was just there. Overall the film was fun for the whole family and I would like to see some sequals becouse it would be fun to see more adventures from Sky High.
B00005MP58|5.0|I have seen/collected all the Pride and Prejudice DVDs and VHS productions as well as seeing the current release - where Judi Dench absolutely shines, but the balance of characters were left wanting. No other production I have seen compares to the insight given to Jane Austen's characters. Although Lawrence Olivier is touted as the best Darcy, I believe he perceived and played the role with an excessive amount of aristocratic behavior. Darcy was landed gentry, not titled. The A&E/BBC production stayed true to Ms. Austen's writing. And did not change either Darcy's or Lizzy's classic speeches in the proposal scene - not true in the new theatrical release. Also to the credit of this production is the close adherence to the social mores of the time - absolutely not true in other productions. I believe this production is tribute to Ms. Austen and I wish all would see it.
B000BJS4SU|4.0|I have to admit that, yea, I had the Room for Squares album, thought it had a few catchy tunes, but I didn't like it enough to buy any of this other records.  So one day I thought, \\"Ah, I'll check this one out.\\"  And I have to say wow, it's got some good stuff.  Not all the tracks are catchy, but I don't really believe that was the point.  Mayer's voice is very smooth and yet, raspy at the perfect times, I love it.  I'd have to say that \\"Gravity\\" and \\"Vultures\\" are my two favorite tracks.  It's nice to hear the Trio's version of \\"I've Got a Woman\\" and \\"Daughters.\\"  This is a great album if you're looking for something to relax to, or a low-key get together with your pals.
B00005JO1J|4.0|It's brash and bold.  It's a celebration of life and yet it is also the tragedy that is AIDS invading a small community of East Village young people in the late 1980s.  Adapted from the musical which has played on Broadway for ten years, this is a film that puts the viewer in a time and place that is no more.  New York has changed.  And the lifestyles depicted are a curious remnant of what used to be.<br /><br />The cast is great.  All eight of the leads do fantastic jobs.  In spite of the fact that everyone is singing and dancing all the time, there is a gritty realism in every scene.  And each cast member is so different from each other that it is easy to see them as individuals:  the transvestite and his lover; the fledging filmmaker; the guitar playing songwriter; the fiery woman with both male and female lovers and her upscale lesbian lover; the heroin addicted exotic dancer.  And then there is the yuppie sellout who has come to collect a year of back rent.  It's a sad and strange and yet joyful story.<br /><br />The music wasn't memorable.  It was basically a backdrop for the storyline and the deep characterization.  I didn't care because I got caught up in the story.  My eyes stayed dry though;  I didn't feel a real emotional connection. But I was left with an appreciation for the people who brought the play first to the stage and then to film.
B000002JAX|5.0|I discovered this CD by accident in a store, never having heard of Madeleine Peyroux before. I've listened to it many times since, and it's one of my favorites. There isn't a song on this CD I don't like. Ms. Peyroux is surely channeling Billie Holliday.
0895260131|3.0|I bought this book because I wanted to read a different perspective on Islam, and that is what I got.  I was under no illusions that it would be a completely unbiased view, since the writer is a former conservative columnist and the book says its a favorite of the \\"Conservative Bookshelf\\" on the back.  But the world is not black and white, and this book doesn't have to be all right or all wrong - and I don't believe it is either.  It raises some valuable points, but it goes overboard at times as well.  You should never read this book by itself - if you are truly interested in the topic it should be part of a broader, diverse reading list.  Listen to all of the perspectives, think critically, and come to your own conclusions...but you shouldn't take this book as the \\"gospel\\" (no pun intended), nor should you dismiss it out of hand as hatred and bigotry.  It's got something to contribute to the discussion if you come into what is an obviously and understandably emotional issue with an open mind.
B000BJS4OY|4.0|Great music.....But there is only 1 true CD, the other 2 are DVD's. Specificlly the one with the \\"live\\" performance on plays in your DVD Player.  My wife wanted it for her car, and no luck.<br /><br />Just so you know..
0451457994|4.0|In the background Clarke introduces us to an advanced civilization that helped Earth's \\"dumb\\" apes evolve millions of years ago into modern humans by teaching them how to kill prey.  I'm fascinated by these mysterious characters lurking in the background.  They, like us, evolved from ocean slime, then into intelligent, self-aware carbon-based beings like us, then into machines, then finally into states of organized energy.  Then the reader is suddenly translated into modern times.  Humans, developing powerful artificial intelligent life, are at the cusp of taking the next evolutionary leap.  This, post-Darwinian evolution, is what 2001 is REALLY about--all of the conflict between humans and their AI life forms is just a side topic.  Unfortunately for me, this side topic makes the bulk of the book, which is definitely enjoyable on its own to be sure, and makes sense of the movie.    On the other hand, a book I recently read and strongly recommend, Beyond Future Shock by Alaniz, picks up where Clarke coldly left off.  Like 2001, it is a strong science fiction book.  Starting in WWI, tracking the lives, romances, struggles and triumphs of several infant Germans who will live through WWII, the Cold War, and into the age of youth cocktails when these \\"kids\\" are in their late 90s, Alaniz tracks the science behind the coming transhuman age with masterful, subtle \\"Clarkian\\" writing.  He also tracks the potential perils, and the problem of Luddism and religion versus science.  As you sink deep into Alaniz's powerful imagery, you will find yourself thinking about mankind's various potential fates in the coming few decades: some horribly dystopian some reasonably utopian. Singularity (read the new book by Kurzweil) will soon be upon on us.        For me, Alaniz has finished with genius what Clarke only touched upon in 2001.  I am fully sastisfied at last.    Paul
B000BO0LLS|5.0|This is the better re-release of \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" beacause it come with the bonus DVD including the 4 videos for \\"It's Like That\\", \\"We Belong Together\\", \\"Shake It Off\\" and \\"Get Yor Number\\" <br />But if you already bought \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" original release, I would suggest downloading the extra tracks and you can easily get the videos off MTV or the net. <br /> <br />1. It's Like That - The first single of the CD, It's a classic RnB sound, I couldnt believe it was Maraih singing when I 1st heard it on the radio! It's one of the best track on the album 8/10  <br /> <br />2. We Belong Together - This is the 2nd single, and it is a beauty. Its a beautful ballad, the best track on the album 10/10  <br /> <br />3. Shake It Off - A mid-temp song, sounds like the type of song that Beyonce/Destiny's Child would sing. The hook is very catchy 7/10  <br /> <br />4. Mine Again -This is a ballad, sounds like a song that she has done in the past, the vocals are great, its one of the better track 8/10  <br /> <br />5. Say Somethin' featuring Snoop Dogg - Another RnB track, sounds a bit like a Justin Timberlake track, but it has the Mariah Carey flavour 2 it! 6/10  <br /> <br />6. Stay The Night - A well sung song with good vocal range. It has a great chorus 7/10  <br /> <br />7. Get Your Number featuring Jermaine Dupri - This is one of the best tracks, the hook sung by Jermaine Dupri makes this track hot. 8/10  <br /> <br />8. One And Only featuring Twista - This SHOULD be the next single, its hot hot hot. The 2nd verse sounds like an old Destiny's Child hook.....I luv this song! 9/10  <br /> <br />9. Circles - Another ballad, does sound a bit like \\"Stay The Night\\" and \\"Mine Again\\" 6.5/10  <br /> <br />10. Your Girl - This song takes some getting into....But now I luv it! Moving more into the pop-ish sound 7/10  <br /> <br />11. I Wish You Knew - Another great song. Sounds like a song from the early 90's.....I like the way Maraih interacts with the audience 8/10<br /> <br />12. To The Floor featuring Nelly - This track is a club track. Sounds a bit like a Justin's track \\"Like I Love You\\" 6/10  <br /> <br />13. Joy Ride - Another ballad, sung softly....6/10  <br /> <br />14. Fly Like A Bird - A gospel track with Mariah hitting those wonderful high notes. 7/10  <br /> <br />15. Don't Forget About Us - The new single, its a tender track, the film clip isnt much but I still luv it! 8/10         <br /> <br />16. Makin' It Last All Night (What It Do) - This is a catchy track feat Jermaine Dupri, the lyrics are hot, very much an RnB track 8/10  <br />        <br />17. So Lonely (One & Only Part II) - The 2nd part of One & Only...Its a great song but I think it could have been better if Twista didnt sing as much, it has that Destiny's Child fast pace singing style like the \\"One & Only\\" 8/10 <br />         <br />18. We Belong Together Remix featuring Jadakiss and Styles P - This is the best remix Ive heard in years...its a fast pace remake and it doesnt make the track sound so sad! It's a fun version.....10/10  <br />
B000BM6AVA|5.0|Much better than Mesmerize! Mesmerize to me came off a little annoying at times and not as consistant as this. This album beats the crap out of Mesmerize. If only System could fuse this style on this cd with the drumming from Toxicity and the energy and perfection from their first release, then we would basically refer to this album as GOD. But i dont even know why im talking about that because that has nothing to do with anything. Trust me if you liked Mesmerize you should adore this and if you didnt like mesmerize you may very well like this gem.
B00005JOHI|4.0|This is a beautiful version of the classic Jane Austin novel Pride and Prejudice. the actors and actresses are beautiful and the English countryside glows golden at sun rise and sun set. There are three aspects of the film that I will point out tht make it wonderful entertainment. <br /> <br />First, Elizabeth Bennett is one of the great characters in English literature. Here she is played as more impulsive than Jennifer Ehle plays the part in the great BBC version. For example, beautiful Kiera Knightley plays Elizabeth as young, playful, and inclined to romance, as evidenced by her reactions to Mr. Darnley at the country house dance at the beginning of the film. Jennifer Ehle pays Elizabeth Bennett as more reserved, more mature, and more sphnix-like. The strength of Elizabeth Bennett is that she is witty, intelligent, considerate, and willing to change her mind. It is this last quality, the willingness to changer her mind, on which much of the film revolves. Elizabeth's first impression of Mr. Darnley was that whereas he was rich and handsome, he was also arrogant and prideful an maybe even a little cruel. Eventually, through a series of mishaps and interactions, she begins to see him differently, seeing his strenghts and compassion and convictions and most of all, his love for her despite the tensions and misunderstandings they undergo.  <br /> <br />The scene where Darnley proposes to Elizabeth despite his low regard for her wild family and her poverty was wonderfully played in this film, with Kiera Knightley firing back at him that his poorly worded proposal of marriage was the height of insult to her and her family.Yet these two weather this upsetting event and go on to love each other greatly as they further discover each other's best qualities. Isn't this what love should really be about? Shouldn't we move from erotic first impressions to deeper appreciation and understanding of each other? <br /> <br />Second, Darnley is well played here. Colin Firth does such an exceptional job in the BBC version that it was hard for me to warm up to another Mr. Darnley, but this actor gives us a version of Darnley that is more mysterious and less aristocratic than the Firth version.  <br /> <br />Third, Jane Austin creates a charming world full of odd, delighful, endearing, and yet realistic characters. Jane Bennett is the height of beauty and sweetness, no wonder Mr. Bingley falls madly in love. Mr. Bingley is as silly as he is rich, however he is sincere and is a perfect match for Jane. Mr. Bingley's sister is wonderfully played and I loved the line she speaks at the country dance where she wonders when the guests will stop dancing and chase pigs. Lydia Bennett is such an empty headed young women, not realizing how her elopement could ruin the reputations of her sisters. Mr. Collins is such a fool, basing his self worth on the whims of his wealthy benefactor, Lady de Bourge. Judi Dench plays a great angry scheming Lady de Bourge. Mr. Bennett says in the book: \\"God placed us here on earth to laugh at our neighbor's folly and for our neighbor in turn to laugh at ours.\\" This line wonderfully represents Austin's philosophy which she brings to all her characters. <br /> <br />The acting is super and truly romantic, the English countryside is beautifuland moody, and the novel actually can be revealed in a short two hours, which I could not believe until I saw it.
B00005JO1P|4.0|Film biographies are always a bit tricky, in my opinion.  I always find myself wondering which parts are \\"true\\" and which parts are rearranged, condensed, combined, etc.  For example, in WALK THE LINE, there's a terrifically dramatic scene near the end when Johnny Cash proposes to June Carter.  The circumstances of the proposal are almost TOO perfect, from a storytelling / dramatic standpoint.  Did it really happen that way, or did the filmmakers take liberties because the truth would have been less cinematically interesting?  At least, when I watch fiction, I know it's all made up.  And when I watch \\"non-fiction\\", I know liberties will be taken...I just don't know where.    That aside, WALK THE LINE is a pretty satisfying film bio.  First of all, Joaquin Phoenix is terrific.  He doesn't really look like Cash...I always thought Cash was a big man...Phoenix is not.  But we forget these surface dissimilarities almost right away, because Phoenix embodies the character in more important ways.  He creates a full-blooded character.  And the fact that he sang the songs himself is pretty amazing.  Again, his voice isn't a dead-on copy (he can't quite as low as Cash), but there are enough times when a particular phrase comes out EXACTLY like we remember that the viewer is completely satisfied.  It was great to hear some older Cash songs that I had forgotten I knew.  Reese Witherspoon, as June Carter, gives her best dramatic performance yet.  She has one great scene when she is shopping in a small general store in some town they are touring through.  First, she meets some admiring fans and her manner in being perfectly lovely to them while still cutting their conversation short is terrific, and moments later, she is confronted by a clerk who heartily DISAPPROVES of June's recent divorce...and Reese's face is wonderful to watch.  We see her shame and a smidge (just a smidge) of anger...and her response (well written, but REALLY well delivered) is great.  This is a time beforeeveryone went around being sarcastic / ironic, and her reply is genuine and non-ironic and painful and totally appropriate.  There are times in the film when Reese's generic \\"perkiness\\" comes through a bit more than I would like...but overall, she's quite solid.  Phoenix should certainly get an Oscar nomination...Witherspoon is slightly less deserving, in my opinion, but I wouldn't put up a fight if she did get nominated.    One thing I really like is that the film plays out a lot of its drama right on stage.  The concert scenes are fabulously believable.  There's great singing and playing of great music, there's totally believable banter (I don't mean the banter is believable...it's totally \\"staged\\" for the audiences, but it feels exactly like what would have been delivered to audiences of the `50s & early `60s) and there's a LOT of subtext being played out.  Whether it's the looks Johnny gives to June as she waits off stage, or their chemistry when they sing together...you almost get all you need to know about their relationship by how the shows go.  When Johnny reaches rock bottom with drug use...we see it on stage.  When he's totally enamored of June, we see it on stage.  I love that the film makes this choice with its storytelling.    I also want to mention a great supporting turn by Robert Patrick (X-FILES, TERMINATOR 2) who plays Cash's father.  I don't think his part has Oscar written on it...it's not that showy.  But Cash's father has a HUGE influence on Johnny, and Patrick plays him strongly enough that we can palpably feel how Johnny is affected by him.  It's a critical role, and Patrick nails it.  After TERMINATOR 2, his roles on film haven't always been the best.  I hope this gets him some juicier material...Agent Doggett will always have a soft spot in my heart.    The movie isn't perfect.  I felt the Folsom Prison concert was just a bit of a dramatic letdown.  Yes, this is a famous album and famous moment in Cash's career, but the film tries to make an awful lot of it, and then they don't actually show us much of the show.  Also, the inevitable closing titles, when we are told in a few superimposed words about the rest of Johnny and June's lives are quite brief and uninformative.  Those two went on to rather amazing careers for another 30+ years.  The care and devotion they were shown in the film is quickly tossed aside in a few glib summary statements.  I think everyone in the audience would have happily sat and read a bit more...especially with some great Cash music in the background.  But these quibbles aside, it's a very entertaining movie and I would give it about 4.25 stars.
B0000024K1|3.0|This album has some good potential, but is ruined by Flava Flav's voice, similar, imo, to The Rated R ruining Thug Life Vol. 1 with his terrible little kid voice.  Is Flava Flav 9 years old on this album?  I will give It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back a few more listens and then update my review, but I would not give this my recommendation right now:  I am very disappointed with it.  Not sure what to say here, but if you want some late 80s rap check out Eric B and Rakim, BDP, or Big Daddy Kane instead.
B000BOH8XW|5.0|I was deeply touched by Fijacin Oral Vol 1, the first volumen from 2 Shakira released earlier this year. The lyrics were sweet & full of emotions and her voice got so much better I was amazed. Now she give us Oral Fixation Vol.2, the second volumen from her new work. So different from Vol 1 still so rich in music and poetry. Every song is different, a different feeling, a different beat. I didnt like her english debut album at all because I felt like she was selling herself out but with these 2 new albums over this year she really proved me wrong. Fresh & good music all over this record. You wont a find a catchy song as \\"La Tortura\\" here but sure you got plenty of anohter options here. Go get this album, your ears wont regret it! Bravo Shakira!  <br /> <br />ps. If you like Oral Fixation Vol.2 you should get Fijacin Oral Vol 1. Its in spanish but if you appreciate good music you dont have to understand every single word but just feel it.

0393317552|3.0|On a recent trip to Central America; I got a chance to visit the ruins from the Aztec and the Mayan civilizations. Visiting this site one is quickly reminded of the utter destruction and sins committed by the western nations. The bestial rage of the conquering rabble can be seen in each of the acts designed to eternalize the conquest. The Aztec caste has long since vanished as a dominant power; their stone blocks enigmatically; impervious to the ravages of time. The white troops sacked the already defeated city; attacking the monuments with un-brindled fury. They unified the greed for the gold that covered the walls; in perfect representations of the sun god; with sadistic pleasure of exchanging the joyful and life-giving symbols of a grieving people for the bereaved idols of the joyful people. The temples were razed to their foundations or their walls were made to serve the ascent of the churches of the new religion.  At that time I was quite curious over the reasons for the disparities in the civilizations.  Why? The west had an advantage and achieved glory; leaving the proud cultures of America was sidelined.  <br /> <br />The answer to the question lies in this text. The answer, almost too clear and believable, is the luck of the draw of natural resources. The Eurasian continental landmass was the winner of the biological draw in two crucial ways.  <br />1. Most domesticable crops and animals  <br />2. Largest contiguous size of similar climate  <br />Having the larger number of domesticable species of plants and animals the Eurasians were able to over time develop their agriculture; employing the animals to undertake manual labor. Another advantage the Eurasian enjoyed were the expanse of the continent in the horizontal (east-west) direction; in comparison the Americas being aligned in the vertical (north-south) plain.  This ensured similar climates for a stretched region on the (East-West) axis. The development of agriculture gave rise to concentrated population; since habitants did not have to travel for long distances in search of food. The creation of cities; economy; trade politics; philosophy and technology evolved with the concentration of people in a small area.  <br /> <br />Diamond places plenty of evidence in supporting this claim. As in the text he describes the vestiges of technology enabled the Maori invaders from New Zealand sequester the Maoriori of Chatman Island. Interestingly both had the same ancestors separated from one other for a century.  Within the century the Maori tribe who had better climate; domesticated animals were able to harvest; create technology; develop methods of warfare. On the other hand the Maoriori tribe with severe climate and landscape; having no domesticated animals retained their hunter gatherer society. These limitations enabled their conquest. Further he discusses the Austronesian expansion into the Pacific, the Chinese expansion into Southeast Asia, and the Bantu expansion into sub-Saharan Africa, engulfing the pygmy and Koisan peoples. In each case the story involves a group of people who from a later point of view seem aggressive, conquering large areas of land and subjugating the previous inhabitants, if any. In each case, Diamond tries to show us that the same factors were at work: a superior set of crops and land-use techniques, leading to population growth and territorial expansion.  <br /> <br />Towards the end of the book, Diamond at last addresses an obvious question. His arguments for expecting Eurasian dominance over Africa, America, and Australasia leave us asking why Europe and not China, India, or the Middle East, has ended up dominating the world. Here his reasoning becomes less convincing. He suggests that China was too integrated, that its geographical connectedness made it too easily unified under stultifying dictatorships, whereas Europe had just the right amount of geographical fragmentation (Britain, Spain, and Italy are all walled off by mountains or seas) to keep power divided among competing regions of roughly equal strength, while allowing ideas to flow freely among them.  <br /> <br />This seems like a stretch. Taiwan, Japan and Korea are geographically separated from China, but shared with China an oriental reluctance to engage with the rest of the world. Also, these finer geographical features only become important after the development of organized states, at which point one would expect cultural factors to play some role as well. As we zoom in on specific areas in recent times, we have to abandon Diamond's large-scale scientific explanations, which discard cultural factors by averaging them out over large areas or long times.  He also fails to explain how the culture and civilization which surpassed Europe's in terms of technological advancement; architecture and art till 13th century; began to be surpassed with the one from Europe. <br />
B0000524CY|4.0|BAD SEED(1958) IS BETTER..AND WAS FIRST!!!    But ''THE EXORCIST'' is still a real good film..the amount of DREAD in this movie is very unsettleing and the scene's with Raegan are some of the most clasick in any horror movie. But I do find it boring at moment's(BAD SEED DID NOT BORE ME!) and plus this is a little bit more fantasy than BAD SEED!!    See it..but make sure you see BAD SEED as well!! you will like BAD SEED more if you like older movie's better!!
B000B7BRMM|5.0|Diana Krall manages to takes a healthy handful of Christmas chestnuts and polishes them lushly and lovingly. \\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\\" proves just how rich and robust her voice can be, while \\"Winter Wonderland\\" shows off that playful, jazzy side. (Not many imported singers can get away with promising \\"to frolic and play the Canadian way.\\" Anne Murray who?) Music that's naughty ... and nice.

B000BJS4SU|4.0|Good Grief, <br /> <br />I've read some of the reviews and a lot of people seam upset by the change in style (bluesy), if so this cd was not for you. Others seem upset that Mayer doesn't sound as good a SRV, who said that he was trying to beat or immitate him? A note to all you blues fans, if you really love blues then you would like more people to hear it and enjoy it too, right? Well, John Mayer and Johnny Lang and Kenny Wayne Shepherd are all helping bridge the gap between Rock/Pop/ and blues, and because they can fit the radio \\"mold\\" they can get more air time. Frankly if you are a hardcore blues fan, why are you listening to John? He is an established POP SINGER, and has blues influences. <br /> <br />That said, if you are a Mayer fan and haven't heard his live stuff, this will be a pretty wicked tranformation for you. If you haven't heard On Any Given Thursday yet, I suggest you buy that first (it has a lot more blues influence but is still poppy enough that it shouldn't turn anyone off- it is by far one of my favorite cd's). If you like his live cd \\"Thursday\\" better than his studio stuff, I would say you have a better chance of enjoying this cd. This cd has a raw sound compared to the rest of his material. If you thought that \\"Thursday\\" was a step in the wrong direction, I would advise you to save your money. There are great songs and some of them are very poppy, but overall, if you don't like \\"Thursday\\" you are likely to be someone that prefers a studio touch-up quality, and will probably not see the beauty of a live recording. Fans of blues, the stuff is tight, grooves pretty hard, but leans on R&B as well. The riffs are hotter than ever, the vocals are even edgier than his past live recordings, and yes their are many hints of SRV and maybe even more hints of Hendrix in his voice. <br /> <br />1. Who did you think I was - 5/5 Heavy, groovin song. Cool Lyrics  \\"Am I the one who plays the quiet songs?\\" This song explains the rest of the album. This is the music he loves yet this stuff doesn't fit the radio \\"mold,\\" so now he has produced a record on his own in order to make the music he loves. <br />2. Good love is one the way - 5/5 Great upbeat pop song with a great riff and good lyrics <br />3. Wait untill tommorrow - 4/5 Good song that has Hendrix-esqe style and has one particullar guitar/drum line with a break that reminded me of Dave Matthews style (1:10). <br />4. Gravity - 5/5 a quiet song that may get studio production and end up on the radio. May be my favorite off the cd. Sounds a lot like the stuff off \\"Thurs.\\" <br />5. Vultures - 5/5 One of the best white-boy R&B songs ever recorded. This song is old school, and it's hot! You NEED to hear this song! <br />6. Out of my mind - 3/5 Sweet solos, but John's voice wasn't made for this stuff. I gave it 3/5 because of the solos. <br />7. Another kind of green - 5/5 a nice song with a more \\"heavier Things\\" feel, but a little more technical. <br />8. I got a woman - 3/5 different sounding happy blues,r&b mix <br />9. something's missing - 5/5 I love this song. Remember, a 5 guy band reduced to 3, they pull this off very well. <br />10. Daughters - Ok, when I bought \\"heavier things\\" this wazs the only song that I didn't really love. Somehow this is the song they chose to kill on the radio. 3/5 caus i don't like it. 4/5 otherwise <br />11. try - 4/5 probably the hottest guitar work on the album. <br /> <br />
031286504X|5.0|...it's a novel about the human persona. Any fan of the Twilight Zone knows the name Richard Matheson. His stories have been made into episodes and was a major influence on Rod Sterling with stories such as \\"nightmare at 20,000 feet\\" and \\"little girl lost\\". His novels \\"Hell House\\" and \\"A Stir of Echoes\\" have been made into memorable movies.<br /><br />\\"I Am Legend\\" seems to me to be his best out of all his works. The book deals with the familar examples of what a vampire is but with an atomic age twist. The story is not centered on vampires but on the loneliness of one man and the effects of isolation from contact with other humans has turn his mental and emotional instincts off.<br /><br />Inside the story the character remembers what it is like to be a human again and we see what has turn him into the hermit we first meet thru flashbacks. But the most important part of the book is the twisted ending that Matheson is famous for.<br /><br />Less then two hundred pages but worth the money. You will never look at vampire novels the same way again.
020530902X|5.0|I was first required to buy Elements of Style as a college student. As is usually the case, I grumbled about buying what I considered yet another unnecessary book taking what little money I had .<br /><br />It turns out this was one of the few books I didn't immediately try to sell once I completed my course. Years after I graduated, I still find myself using it as a refresher as I do a lot of writing. Although it's not on the curriculum, I encourage my students to buy this book. The authors explain how to write in simple prose that everyone can understand. It's a little book compared to the big English volumes they have to carry around but I tell them it's the best money they'll spend in their college career and beyond.
B000BM6AVA|4.0|Now that we've heard it all you gotta wonder precisely what the whole point of the whole 'Mezmerize/Hypnotize' scheme.  It seems obvious, paying twice for a double album that actually coulda fit on a single cd anyway.  But if you got them right when they came out you probably only paid like 9 bucks for each of 'em, so the monetary difference ain't much of a concern.  Still I think the consumer came out a little behind, not because we paid too much but because we got more than we needed.  Simply put, when SOAD needed to come up with 20+ songs in a single session they came up with a few more clunkers than usual. (A problem typical of most double albums and pseudo double albums)  So, finally meandering to my point, 'Hypnotize' has 3 lousy tracks.  'U-Fig' is mostly just bland and uninspired, other than the chorus which is truly grating. (Though it's worth noting that I'm in the minority on this issue, as most people seem to enjoy that piece of crap.  In fact I seem to have received psychic comeuppance for my denouncing of the track as I just poured soda all over myself.  Back in a sec) Sadly, 'U-Fig' is quickly overthrown as the most irritating SOAD song as we arrive at 'Vicinity of Obscenity' and 'She's Like Heroin'.  Here SOAD's goofiness gets the best of them and they churn out to hideous novelty songs for those who can't distinguish between what's catchy and quirky and what's simply annoying and ridiculous.<br /><br />Still, the other 9 tracks are good, often great.  They retain the greater sense of melody they found with 'Mezmerize' and incorporate plenty of harmonies, which I feel really augment their sound.  Many hate Daron's singing and while he is annoying at times I think he's mostly acceptable and, again, works very well while harmonizing.  The instrumentation is strong and energetic and though they aren't really a Nu-metal band the instruments still largely just provide a base for the vocals.  There are a few neat riffs, but this ain't a thrash album or anything like that.  'Attack' is what you need from an opener, very energetic and driving though it still has SOAD's trademark sudden starts and stops. 'Dreaming' is perhaps the strongest track, with a great epic, harmonious chorus and strong dynamics.  'Tentative' is the next best thing, huge and emotional and apocalyptic.  'Holy Mountains' is the most ambitious, multi-faceted thing here.  Not every instance of it works, but it's very good overall.  They get a bit more emotional at the end, with the simple power-ballad 'Lonely Day' and the closer 'Soldier Side'.  This last one is perhaps a bit melodramatic at times, but they pull it off anyway and it's a fine capper to the whole project.<br /><br />Still, it shoulda been only 1 album.  Lop off those 3 track I mentioned here and combine it with 'Mezmerize' minus 'Old School Hollywood', 'This Cocaine....' and maybe one more relatively mediocre track of your choice and you've got the best SOAD album of their career.  But 'twas not to be, and it's not like anyone is making me listen to those tracks, so I suppose it's no huge loss.<br /><br />Lastly, the way the packaging of these albums is supposed to combine is lame, but whaddya expect.nything like that.

B000BP86OG|2.0|I was REALLY looking forward to this CD.  PTL was fantastic, and worthy of all the \\"salvation of rock\\" praise people were slathering all over it.  It was as if Boston, AC/DC, Styx, and Van Halen all got together for an afternoon to jam, and we were lucky enough to hear it.  The potential of this band was awe-inspiring. <br /> <br />Then came \\"Ticket\\"....oh, man...where do I begin? <br /> <br />It's as if we're witnessing the self-destruction of guitar-driven hair-metal rock once again, only as a microcosm encompassed in the span of two albums and one band. <br /> <br />It's shocking how much they've sabotaged the expectations of the audience with this album.  I'm reminded of Mr. Bungle following up their first album with the cacophany of \\"Disco Volante\\".  It's almost as if they're intentionally giving the finger to everyone that bought and recommended PTL. <br /> <br />AC/DC, Van Halen, and the decent members of Boston and Styx have left the jam session.  They were replaced by ELO and Queen circa 1984.  Just a nightmare, really. <br /> <br />The only decent tracks that develop on the potential shown in PTL are \\"One Way Ticket\\", \\"Dinner Lady Arms\\", and to a lesser extent \\"Hazel Eyes\\".  The rest are rubbish. <br /> <br />If you want a CD that lives up to the promise of \\"Permission To Land\\", check out \\"Popsicle\\" by Diamond Nights.  Same feel, great rock, less falsetto (but still there on a few tracks).
0307276902|5.0|I read James Frey's almost surreal semi-detached account of HIS experiece with the life altering monster of addiction. Addiction is an ugly and merciless thing no matter what personality becomes its victim--Frey's account is just exactly that, 'his' account, his pain, his perception--written with a raw honesty and near unconcern that reminds me of the writings of Albert Camus (The Stranger), winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1957.<br /><br />  A Million Little Pieces contains a powerful amount of emotion, once removed....it takes a natural flair for the art of writing to write in the first person in a 'detached steam of consciousness style' without losing the emotional power of the writing. I think Frey is not only a survivor, but a talented author as well.<br /><br />  and as for the posts that address his story as a bunch of hype...I saw no hype. I saw many elements of addiction, such as denial, resistance, self deprecation, anger toward others and hopelessness...but the writing style Frey used allowed us to see those things for ourselves instead of having it labeled and annouced by a narrator. As for being in rehab with Judges and Mobsters...what would you expect to find in an uppper class, highly effective rehab center with a price tag, that I am sure is out of bounds for the common man?<br /><br />GREAT book. I am glad it exists, it can help many.
0380789035|3.0|\\"American Gods\\" starts off pretty derivatively (it reminded me a lot of Douglas Adams' \\"The Long Dark Tea Time of the Soul\\"), with a few Old World gods trying to scrape by in a modern world where scarely a soul believes in them anymore.  The story of \\"What-happens-to-gods-when-no-one-believes-in-them\\" is an oft-told tale -- a little too oft, perhaps -- and that's pretty much the gist of what's going on in \\"American Gods.\\"<br /><br />Nevertheless, Neil Gaiman makes a refreshingly interesting variation on that old theme by introducing conflict between the Old World gods, who no one believes in anymore, and the Modern World gods, who everyone started believing in when their old gods faded away.  Enter the modern, \\"American\\" gods: the God of Internet, the Goddess of Television, the God of Cancer, and so on.<br /><br />The problem I had with \\"American Gods\\" is that the Modern World gods -- the refreshing and original characters -- are mostly ignored, popping up only occasionally to do and say villainous things.  Instead of exploring the new Pantheon of Modern Gods, including the nerdy, teenage God of the Internet and the seductively corporate Goddess of TV/Media, Gaiman focuses on Old World gods who have been the subject of warmed-over fairy tales for millenia. Frankly, they just aren't that interesting anymore, even when they're living in low-rent, Chicago 3-flats and grifting change from truck stop cashiers.<br /><br />Suffice it to say that, when I finished \\"American Gods,\\" I felt like I'd read a good story told from the perspective of the wrong characters.  I kept waiting for Gaiman to open up the world of these modern, American gods and goddesses, but it never happened.  Still, there are some compelling twists and turns in this book. The good guys and bad guys aren't always who or what they seem to be, and Gaiman's subtle references to their traits and identities make for some interesting follow-up \\"Googling.\\"<br /><br />I recommend \\"American Gods,\\" but not strongly.  If you haven't already read \\"The Long Dark Tea Time of the Soul\\" by Douglas Adams, I recommend you check it out, instead.ot strongly.

B00003CXA2|2.0|Normally I wouldn't bother to write a review for a film of this sort, but I find it so damn irritating that I've gotta say my piece, though I'll bet many others have said approximately the same thing.  From a sheer entertainment standpoint the film isn't too bad, at first.  Forrest goes on adventures, they are passably amusing.  The second half of the film is incredibly dull and all that sh*t with his stupid hippie loser girlfriend is unbearable. Also, though there's no denying that Hanks is an extremely good actor I'm not especially impressed with his performance here.  Everyone seems to think that affected, gimmicky performances are the most impressive thing, but I don't buy it.  Hell back in 6th grade there was this semi-retarded chick that I used to imitate for my friends and lemme tell ya my performance was spot on AND hilarious. Gimmie an Oscar, I rule the acting I do.<br /><br />But what I really hate about this movie is how it's such a major example of the baby boom generations love affair with itself.  Chuck Klosterman summed up the problems with them pretty neatly and I'm gonna quote him as best I can from memory: 'Baby Boomers are convinced that they are the most important generation ever.  THEY ended the war, THEY had things they believed in.  There is nothing more pompous and condescending than a nostalgic baby boomer.' I wish I had the exact quote, but that's the gist of it, and he goes on to note how baby boomers are obsessed with how revolutionary they are and yet they inherited the establishment and ended up keeping pretty much everything the same.  And it's not just that it's about the generation.  That's not necessarily a problem it just reeks of the whole 'God are we amazing attitude'.  I've heard it all before and I'm not interested.  However, if you're a narcissistic baby boomer, knock youself out.<br /><br />Grade: D+
0393327655|2.0|It is of course true that sacred texts are the most dangerous there are. If one wants to do something truly evil, one needs the aid of Scripture. As Shakespeare points out, the Devil quotes Scripture. Yet what other foundation is there for humankind? While we need to trust in reason, in science, and in our basic humanity - we have also seen these sources distorted and dangerous. <br /> <br />The main point of the book - that we need to question other's faith - that it does matter what our neighbor believes - is a vital point- absolutely essential to our survival. I would hope for a more nuanced work, one that distinquished between faith that encourages and builds community - rather than one that divides .
0671027387|2.0|Okay, I enjoyed \\"The DaVinci Code\\" for what it was, despite the glaring, gigantic plot hole that everyone HAS to be ignoring (you can't have characters criticizing the historical accuracy of the Bible, and then treat \\"The Last Supper\\" as if it were a polaroid of the event!).  That said, I went gradually back in time with Dan Brown, through \\"Angels & Demons\\" and finally through \\"Deception Point\\", and it's like watching evolution in reverse.  I can understand why Brownies would say that \\"Code\\" is his \\"best book ever\\".  It literally is, but that's damning with faint praise.<br /><br />\\"Point\\" shows that Brown has found a formula, and he intends to stick with it, through hell, high water, and despite the gender of his main character.  You can pretty much guarantee that if he devotes more than 30 pages to two characters, and they don't have some physical or social disability, they're going to wind up in bed together by the final page.<br /><br />Brown also has a bad habit of setting up situations that he takes explicit glee in telling you are IMPOSSIBLE to escape from...and then faster than you can say \\"Deus Ex Machina\\", the main characters escape from that very situation.  I thought Robert Langdon plummeting from the sky over the Vatican was Brown at his most ludicrous.  That was only because I hadn't yet seen him produce a submarine for no other reason than to save him from the frigid corner he painted himself into.<br /><br />Gah!  It's been over 6 months since I read the thing, and it still annoys me.  If you still intend on reading the book, just treat it like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie....turn off your brain, and enjoy.
0156027321|4.0|I found this book fascinating and by the end completely believable. I found myself wondering if it could be true even though the concept was far-fetched.   <br /> <br />I admit to finding the first part a bit insidious and put it down for a bit, but Yann Martell is crafting needed knowledge for the rest of his story.   If you are having trouble getting through the beginning - push through - it is worth it.  Interestingly enough - I went back and reread through the first part after I had finished.  The elements fit together wonderfully for this fascinating survival tale. <br /> <br />I don't think that it made be find God - but I loved that Pi's faith to love and believe led him to see the beauty in all the religions he found.  He found the essence of each and practised them.  Jux-positioned is the science of nature - the behaviour of animals including humans.  A very interesting fun book to get wrapped into.   <br /> <br />After finding the start a bit tedious - I couldn't put it down.

B000B8QF14|5.0|You had to figure that Green Day couldn't let their biggest year, 2005, pass by without some sort of celebration. Their great come-back album, 2004's \\"American Idiot\\" was not only massively successful and dominant over the radio, but was easily the most interesting and inspiring piece of music to come out of that year as well. So, in comes \\"Bullet In A Bible,\\" a DVD/CD set that covers Green Day's biggest show to date, a two-day concert at the National Bowl in Milton Keynes where they played to over 130,000 English fans.<br /><br />The concert/documentary runs at about two-hours long, and spliced in between each song are interviews and behind the scenes footage that document Green Day's rise back to the top and the nervousness that comes with playing to such a large crowd. As far as the performance, the boys are on top of their game. I saw them back in April, and let me tell you: it was the best concert I have ever been to, and I have a hard time imagining any concert I go to in the future being that good. They play roughly the same set that they did for the U.S. \\"American Idiot\\" tour, with a few differences. One noticeable omission is their popular cover of Queen's \\"We Are The Champions.\\" \\"She,\\" \\"Maria\\" and \\"Knowledge,\\" the song where they bring fans onstage to play, are also missing as well. But what is here is superb. The band blows through nearly the first half of the \\"American Idiot\\" album, saving \\"Boulevard Of Broken Dreams\\" for the encore, and then gets into some choice older material such as \\"Longview\\" and \\"Minority.\\" \\"King For A Day\\" is fused with a cover of \\"Shout,\\" which is just brilliant (although Billie skips the floor-humping here that he did for us). The final song, \\"Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life)\\" has Billie Joe going solo with an electric guitar and freshening up a song that got played to death in it's day. It was worth buying this set just to have that version on the audio-CD that is included.<br /><br />My only gripe with this performance/documentary is Samuel Bayer's direction. I love his videos, especially all he's done for Green Day, but he overdoes it with his direction for the concert. The cameras dart around way to fast, and he inserts so many unneccessary and distracting effects. He complicates something that should have been fairly simple and straight-forward: letting the viewer watch one of the best acts of our generation. But the fact remains, this is Green Day at their best. This concert is a monster, and they pack so much energy into each song, it's hard not to be moved. I was a little disappointed that more \\"American Idiot\\" stuff (i.e. Music videos, making-of) wasn't included, but I'm sure that stuff'll surface one day.l Bayer's direction.

After listening to John the Revelator and Damaged People along with the rest of the album my enthusiasm is back and I am in love with David Gahan all over again. Dave Gahan's tracks fit into the album just as well as Martin Gores work and I hope this new balance of power within the band will let them continue touring and producing new music for years to come. I was so excited by the album I jumped onto Ebay and bought my first concert ticket since the Exciter tour !
B00008DDXC|4.0|This, the second Harry Potter, manages to reclaim the technical excellence of the first but is not quite up to the same standard. Part of this is because more of the book is left out than was the case with the first film. Partly, this is because of necessity. You can almost never do a complete book adaptation. Something always gets lost. The first was notable for how well it succeeded in this respect. The second does well also, it just doesn't do quite as well. I suppose the other reason is that I just loathe snakes. <br /> <br />This story involves snakes. Especially, it involves a basilisk, the king of serpents, whose gaze can kill. This beast has as its mission to kill all those not of pure blood in the magical Hogwarts academy. This goes on as Lord Valdemort, the evil wizard, makes another bid to come back and achieve power. It is Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione who can put a stop to all the nonsense.  <br /> <br />The magical effects are wonderful. So too is much of the cheeky repartee. While this one can be suitable to people of all ages, some of it may be a bit intense for the youngest of viewers. It is also contraindicated if you despise snakes. I do, but managed to enjoy the film anyway. <br />

076790592X|5.0|This moving story shows us the enduring bonds that sometimes exist between teacher and student.  Morris Schwartz was a retired professor stricken with ALS (Lou Gherig's Disease), who was interviewed on ABC's Nightline program about death and dying.  Former student Mitch Albom, now a sportswriter in Detroit, saw his old professor on TV and flew out for a visit.  Albom then returned every Tuesday for months, and he movingly describes each visit.  The visits were not merely social; a major part of each Tuesday was an educational seminar on life, death, love and loss.  These lessons continued every week despite Morrie's inevitable decline.  The affectionate bonds seem to grow with each visit, and the dying professor never lost his humanity, passion for teaching, humor or kindness.  <br />   <br />This readable tale is not a happy one - the author details Morrie's painful decline in addition to his enduring wisdom.  But this is a remarkably inspiring book, one later made into a movie starring Jack Lemmon and Hank Azaria.   <br />

These guys definitely are not Creed, but they have a somewhat similar sound to their music. At the same time, it sounds kinda different and more melodic than before. The new singer can hit a higher range, but I like Scott Stapp a whole lot more. When I first heard this cd, I thought it was cool, but not anywhere close to Creed standards. The cd has grown on me tremendously and it gets better every time I hear it. Myles is a great addition to the more melodic sound. Scott Phillips has his best work yet on this cd and Mark Tremonti is incredible as always. They can't quite live up to Creed, but they still are amazing.
B00003CXI1|4.0|Adapting a book for a film necessarily requires some adaptations and changes. These are usually for the worse. This film is an exception. Compromises have been made but it has been splendidly done. Most of the story from the book has been carried over and the work has been done in a creditable fashion. This is particularly nice in that a fantasy film is particularly difficult in this regard. <br /> <br />The story is of a young man who is unaware that he was born a wizard. After the death of his parents, he was raised by relatives who detest him and have tried to keep him from learning about his heritage or even knowing that there is any such thing as magic. The magic community has not forgotten him, however. The young man has a past and famous parents. He is also the only person ever to have survived a fight with \\"he who must not be named\\". He did this at the age of 2. Now, he has been accepted at an academy for wizards. His eyes are opened to numerous possibilities and soon he is involved in solving a mystery. Things are not all as they seem at the Hogwarts Academy. Foul things are happening and young Harry Potter is determined to figure them out. That in itself constitutes an education. <br /> <br />This is an extremely entertaining film for kids of all ages. It is well done and will appeal on different levels to people of all ages. <br />
B000023VR6|5.0|People please, stop comparing this album to \\"The Chronic\\". Everyone that has ever written or reviewed this album knows about the classic. It changed music forever, and for more details and reasons go to my review on it. But enough about that album. The topic of discussion here is his nineteen ninety nine album \\"2001\\". It had many hits, and a feature in all but one song, including other legends X-Zibit, MC Ren, The Lady Of Rage, RBX, Snoop Dogg, and many more. Some of the hits on this album were \\"The Next Episode\\", \\"Still Dre\\", \\"Forgot About Dre\\", and \\"Xxplosive\\". Yet, The biggest hit on this album was probably \\"The Next Episode\\", but that song(as great as it was and is), is only 2:41 seconds. That, if you do not already know is an intro, or very short for a regular song. It features the great Snoop Dogg. The versus on the song make up for the lack of time. Here are some reasons you should pick this up.     -This is one of the best West Coast albums out. Any fan, come pick this up with a bunch of other good albums out there like \\"Eazy Duz It\\", \\"The Chronic\\", \\"Straight Outta Compton\\", and more.    -Chances are you like atleast a couple rappers that are featured on this album, considering there are I believe twenty-one songs with features. Many familiar in his past albums.    -Dre had some of the best beats ever, if not the best. He is indoubtedly the best producer of all time, followed by Suge Knight.    -Dr. Dre changed the hip-hop world, by producing, and rapping, and anything else. He helped it to get to where it is today. Do him a little favor and check out this album, if you like it, get it.    Well, I hope this was helpful, and persuasive enough to get you to atleast check out this album. Speaking of checking out, peace.    -PIRATE
B000BJS4SU|5.0|This album was great a nice departure into Blues by a rising, hot star. John Mayer is an extremely talented guitar player, having seen him live several times I can attest to this. This album is not as radio friendly as his previous efforts, but you can't deny his wanting to explore what he likes. Mellow, enriching and fun.
0694003611|5.0|My two sons wore this book out and now my grandaughter has worn one out so I'm getting a replacement along with The Runaway Bunny.  The repetition, rhythm, and calming of this book have been favorites of all the little ones in our family.  Now baby sister is getting old enough to want to hear \\"Moon\\".
B00003CXXP|4.0|I began watching this DVD with low expectations.  I had heard negative reviews and typically don't go in for movies with a fantasy-based or sci fi premise. <br /> <br />I was caught completely off-guard by this movie.  About 1/4 of the way through I was complaining about how intense it was, 1/2 way through I couldn't look away from the screen and by the end, I was weeping and contemplately how otherwordly the love felt for a mother can be. <br /> <br />It's been a very long time since I've watched a movie that touched me so deeply and I watch DVDs at least 3-4 times weekly. This is a very eccentric and very personally-experienced film.  Unlike nothing else I've ever seen.  It not only suspends disbelief, it obliterates it and sucks you into the experience of the central character in an almost uncomfortably seductive way. <br /> <br />If you can remember what loving your mother was like as a child, I cannot imagine you would not be affected by this film. <br /> <br />
B0002YLC24|5.0|It's often the \\"little movies\\" that hit you the hardest.  \\"Before Sunrise,\\" the first collaboration between Ethan Hawke, Julie Delpy, and Richard Linkater (now of \\"School of Rock\\" fame) was a classic 90's \\"indie\\" film.  Jesse (Hawke) and Celine (Delpy) meet by chance and spend a day and a night in Vienna together.  After one of the most romantic 24 hours in cinema history, Jesse departs for America, but they plan to meet at the same train platform in 6 months. <br /> <br />\\"Before Sunset\\" takes place 9 years later, and Jesse and Celine meet by chance in Paris.  Unfortunately (mild spoiler alert, but this is a spoiler that makes \\"Before Sunset\\" work), due to circumstances beyond their control that reunion didn't occur.  So Celine and Jesse have a few hours to spend together before Jesse has to fly back to his life in the States.  Using the same basic technique of filming Jesse and Delpy as they walk and talk as the first movie, \\"Before Sunset\\" catches lightning in a bottle once again. <br /> <br />What makes \\"Before Sunset\\" so poignant is how well Delpy and Hawke inhabit Celine and Jesse -- these are career-defining roles for both of them.  It's important to note that Delpy and Hawke share screenwriting credits on this movie with Linklater.  Their conversations unfold so effortlessly, so charmingly, that nobody can doubt that we are watching two soulmates reunite, and quite frankly it's a wonder that Hawke and Delpy didn't become a Hollywood couple, there's so much chemistry between the two. <br /> <br />But Celine and Jesse are nine years older, and there are deep currents at issue in \\"Before Sunset.\\"  That perfect night in Vienna 9 years ago may have been romantic, but it left a lot of scars, too.  Celine and Jesse explore the depth of those wounds after their conversations move beyond the awkward polite reunion phase.  For two souls whom we have only seen on romantic outings, they have both spent 9 years being pretty unhappy, and that's a shocker. <br /> <br />A fantastically written and wonderfully acted little movie (clocking in at a mere 80 minutes, counting final credits), \\"Before Sunset\\" is a perfect bookend to \\"Before Sunrise.\\"  As wonderful as \\"Before Sunset\\" is, you absolutely must see \\"Before Sunrise\\" first.  Thankfully, it ain't a chore -- it's a pure pleasure.   <br /> <br />All in all, a must-see for any romantic.
B0001KZM3O|1.0|In my opinion this is the worst album released under the Pink Floyd name. In the 70s Pink Floyd had become known as a band who could create songs with thoughtful lyrics and great melodies. This was because albums like Dark Side of the Moon, Meddle and Wish You Were Here were collaborations between all the band members. On these albums Waters started to show how great he was as at writing lyrics, but the melodies were put in place by the rest of the band, especially Gilmour, because they were great musicians. Even the best songs on The Wall were collaborations between Waters and Gilmour, and The Wall is a good concept.  <br /> <br />The Final Cut seems to push the concepts in The Wall that one step too far. It is well known that songs rejected from The Wall were put on The Final Cut, but Waters had alienated himself from the rest of the band (even Gilmour) and included these songs anyway. One may ask, if they weren't good enough then why are they good enough now, and if you listen to the album you can really only conclude that they are not good enough.  <br /> <br />I think the main difference in the production of this album is that Waters had stopped listening to everyone else in the band. He had already forced Wright to leave, but during the production of The Final Cut he finally alienated Gilmour as well, and it seems to me that Gilmour had always been the valve that stopped Waters from taking things that step too far.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, this album is dreadful because of Waters over-inflated ego. Roger Waters finally quit Pink Floyd after this album and followed The Final Cut with a string of mediocre solo albums. <br /> <br />In conclusion, I give this album 1 star, because I can't give it no stars.
B0002Y4T92|3.0|If you love all things guitar then you won't go wrong with this DVD. Great sound, good visuals, huge variety. But the strength of variety is also the greatest weakness.<br /><br />In some ways you do not want to criticise as there really are some superb tracks on this double DVD. The frustration for those like me who couldn't be there is that we missed so much. You can't help noticing this during the DVD. I saw Pat Metheny being hugged but didn't hear a note from him, as others have noted the great Dennis Chambers on drums, yet we don't see him while he solos and we hardly see the maestro, Steve Gadd. I suggest too diverse a range was attempted to be captured for the 2 disc DVD. I don't want to see two ZZ Top numbers at the expense of not seeing Jeff Beck. Why three tracks with Joe Walsh and only one of Larry Carlton? As much as I enjoy Vai, this track seems so out of place. This DVD should have rather just been a blues/Clapton DVD rather than an uneven hotch-potch.<br /><br />Overall, I'll keep and enjoy this well recorded DVD, but there will always be a little frustration of what could have been. If you want a taster of the variety of guitaring on show then this will not disappoint.
B000BP86OG|2.0|One Way Ticket certainly lives up to all the hype and promises but is a very different album to PTL. The guts of the band have been ripped out and the edges smoothed over - no more AC/DC style `Balls-Out' rock and roll riffs - Justin has swapped his Gibson Les Paul for an Ibanez Jem and various other Steve Vai effects boxes - and the Roy Thomas Baker (producer) layered vocals (classic Queen) are impressive but as Justin has chosen to sing 95% of the album in falsetto rather than just the occasional line it sounds as if they have got Kate Bush, Barry Gibb, Jeff Lynne, Pinkie and Perkie and The Chipmunks amongst others in to sing the backing vocals! <br /> <br />The title track \\"One Way Ticket........\\" is a great song however the horrible effects laden guitar solo (no its not really a choral sitar) provides a glimpse of what is to come.  <br /> <br />Both \\"Knockers\\" and \\"Is it Just Me?\\" are brilliant tracks, the new `smoother' Darkness at their best. \\"Knockers\\" is reminiscent of classic ZZ-Top and \\"Is it Just Me?\\" in my opinion is the best song on the album, even if they have nicked the chorus riff from the opening bars of Thunder's \\"Dirty Love\\". Unfortunately, the guitar solo is a bit of a let down - it sounds as if a teenage `guitar god' has just learned the `tapping' technique and is demonstrating it to his parents! <br /> <br />\\"Dinner Lady Arms\\" is an excellent rock ballad with a classic Darkness guitar solo - so far so good.  <br /> <br />Then it all goes wrong; someone lets the orchestra into the studio. \\"Seemed Like A Good Idea........\\" is a fully orchestrated, over the top, horribly weak `pop' ballad, you are praying for a screeching guitar solo to save it all but when it comes it is so mixed in with all the violins you almost miss it. This is a bid for Christmas No. 1 which should then be resigned to the pile of all other forgettable Christmas No. 1's.  <br /> <br />\\"Hazel Eyes\\" - Where do I start? - This has been played live a few times and the sheer raw edge and exuberance of the live performance made the song acceptable. Here it is presented complete with layered guitars and vocals and over-dubs, orchestra, bag-pipes and marching band - Euuuch! Although the opening of this song is probably 48 guitars carefully overlaid to perfection by Dan Hawkins, it has been so polished by Roy Thomas Baker that it sounds synthesised - the aforementioned teenage guitar god practising his scales plugged into an Eventide Harmoniser.  <br /> <br />\\"Bald\\" resurrects the album from this run of overblown pop-rock, it is a dark and fairly heavy song quite daring for the band; almost Metallica - Black, but with classic Darkness guitars and vocals.  <br />The less said about \\"Girlfriend\\", the better! It starts off like a Status Quo - Stock, Aitkin and Waterman collaboration then gets worse - the orchestra appears again sounding very much like the backing of \\"Loco in Acapulco\\" by the Four Tops. As for the song itself, I think it was rejected by Chesney Hawkes when he was putting together his \\"I am the one and only\\" Album and the keyboard solo in the middle sounds as if it is being played on Rolf Harris' stylaphone! <br /> <br />\\"English Country Garden\\", again aired live a few times is presented here in full orchestral glory. Piano driven, Andrew WK style, this is an impressive version of the song, but more British Whale than The Darkness. <br /> <br />\\"Blind Man\\", a fully orchestrated ballad with only a hint of heavily synthesised guitar at the beginning and end, deals with the story of a family friend prematurely losing his wife - a lovely gesture but not right for a rock album. This song comes complete with brass band and Queen-style layered vocals unfortunately layered and synthesised to the point that it sounds more like Freiheit's \\"Keeping The Dream Alive\\"  <br /> <br />So, all in all, a great album, but perhaps not for fans of the Darkness. The Hawkins brothers are like kids in a sweet shop trying out all the gadgets and gimmicks theirnew found fame has afforded them. I hope that they are sick, get over it and that the next album is produced by the likes of Mike Clink who locks them in a room with two guitars (Gibsons of course), two amps and a four-track recorder. Please release a live album lads, so that we can hear these songs stripped down to their bare necessities! <br />
0515125024|4.0|Lee Child's lethal anti-hero Jack Reacher can't help being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  In \\"Killing Floor,\\" Reacher just happens to wander through a small Georgia town that is home to the criminal mastermind who killed his brother.  Gritty detective work and hard-boiled violence ensued, and several corpses followed in Reacher's wake.    In \\"Die Trying,\\" Reacher once again stumbles across a diabolical criminal.  By being at the wrong place at the wrong time, Reacher finds himself kidnapped at gunpoint in Chicago along with a beautiful young woman, Holly Johnson.  As everyone except the kidnappers knows, Reacher is more than capable of handling himself, but so is Holly . . . and she has even more surprises in store for both the kidnappers and Reacher.    The fiendish criminals of \\"Killing Floor\\" have nothing on Child's newest creation, the fabulously obese, brilliant, lethal militia leader Beau Borken.  Borken leads a few bands of anti-everything militia nuts in remote Montana, and he has grand designs for exploiting the kidnapping of Ms. Johnson, who is more than connected to several Big Players in the U.S. government.  Unfortunately for Reacher, he is collateral damage, and unless Reacher plays his cards exactly right, there's nothing stopping Borken from putting a bullet into the back of his head . . . a chore that Borken enjoys more than a little bit.    Lee Child brings his hard-boiled style once again to the fore as he describes the pell-mell kidnapping and the government investigation as well as Reacher's various exploits (he's the last man one could imagine taking this kind of treatment lying down).  While Reacher gets several chances to demonstrate his ability to outfight, out-think, and out-kill his opponents, Child also writes chilling scenes where even the indomitable Jack Reacher gets terrified out of his wits.  Many \\"thrillers\\" come across as flat and dull despite the hype - this isn't one of them.    \\"Die Trying\\" may not get five stars (like Igave \\"Killing Floor\\"), but that's the nature of sequels.  We dive a bit deeper into the Jack Reacher legend, and the book is indeed a page-turner, but the novelty of \\"Killing Floor\\" isn't quite there.  But if you are a fan of \\"Killing Floor,\\" and there are legions of us, you're going to be a big fan of this book, and Child shows no signs of flagging.  Check it out.
B00005JO17|1.0|I saw Chicken Little a few weeks ago and I was not impressed at all.   <br /> <br />The plot was not very interesting, there were few humorous parts, and halfway through the movie I was squirming in my seat waiting for it to end. <br /> <br />I do not recommend seeing this movie, I had high hopes....and that was all that they were. <br />
B0002WYS6S|5.0|Whilst prog rockers maybe surprised at how metal this is, and metal fans will be surprised at how prog this is, DreamTheater fans already know how incredible these musicians are live!<br /><br />Although I do enjoy DT, up till now I couldn't be labelled a hardcore fan. This is DVD may well change that status as it blew me away - an entire concert demonstrating what Dream Theater at the peak of their abilities can do.<br /><br />I love watching live music and this DVD is most beautifully crafted and meets all my requirements for 5 stars! i.e. Long instrumental breaks with the camera following the person playing the solo! (Don't you hate it when the drummer plays a brilliant fill and the camera man zooms on the vocalist who is not even singing. Well, this fortunately doesn't happen on this DVD. Instead you have the option to watch their instrumental through multi-angles on Disc two.)<br /><br />Clearly Dream Theater have projected their creative and hard-working ethic to the production values of this DVD. This recording has been carefully thought through, even to the placing of the cameras for excellent closeups for each member. The DVD is full of positive surprises and features; the range of song material to the ability to show the lyrics on screen.<br /><br />For those who have woken up a decade after he was already one of the world's greatest prog-rock drummers, this DVD is a Mike Portnoy showcase. Disc two has all the extras including the Portnoy solo and the Instrumedley - which allows you to focus just on Mike for a monstrous drumming display. That doesn't mean there is no solo drumming in the concert. Far from it! You're in for a surprise as the keyboard drum battle during 'Beyond this life' is like an added drum solo. I found this the highlight of the opening barrage of 3 songs - Rudess and Portnoy seem to have such fun and Portnoy gets to inventively show off what every little cowbell, percussion and timbale sounds like on his enormous double set of drums. He really shows how musical he is as he copies Rudess's keyboard lines on the kit.(Of course a few blizzards of bass drum bliss are effortlessly displayed throughout!)<br /><br />The first twenty minutes of this concert are some of the heaviest moments of synchronised Dream Theater mayhem; the end of 'This Dying Soul' shows the most frighteningly fast unison lines of Petrucci and Rudess. Mesmerising! Portnoy is so solid as he segues from one time signature into the pounding grundge time midway through 'This Dying Soul' - makes you want to bounce with La Brie as well. As La Brie states 'We have one hell of a show coming at you, this evening'. At this stage of the concert you're only two songs in and sixteen still to come.<br /><br />As on any DT creation you'll see why Petrucci is arguably the most technically gifted rock guitarist in the world today. Combined with Myung, Rudess and their powerful vocalist, La Brie, this is a tight, professional bunch. If you like intense, inventive music that requires repeated listening, this is wonderful value - brilliant!as he copies Rudess's keyboard lines on the kit.(Of course a few blizzards of bass drum bliss are effortlessly displayed throughout!)

B00005JOHI|5.0|Superb casting, outstanding scenery, well designed period settings and a brilliantly written novel by Jane Austen comes to life making this a block buster winner and one of the hottest films this season. The film is likely to garner several well deserved Academy Awards ... I love the realistic country scenes and the opulent wealth of the era as depicted in this film. Keira Knightly is charming and dazzling as the intelligent and articulate Lizzie who is transformed within this film, becoming the butterfly that arises from her unique chrysallis. Matthew MacFadyen is the perfect Mr. Darcy, a darkly handsome introspective, intelligent gentleman ... who is easily misunderstood.<br /><br />Keira Knightly is an outstandng Elizabeth (Lizzie) Bennett, with her well chiseled lovely porcelain facial features, beautiful large brown expressive eyes, lovely swan-like neck and gorgeous brown hair, often worn pulled up and back, with tendrils framing her face. Her clever articulate observations and quips are very memorable throughout the film as she challenges the quietly brooding and handsome Mr. Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen). One memorable scene is when the guests of honor, Mr. Bingley, his sister and Mr. Darcy arrive in the ballroom, the dancing and music stop as the people part to each side, like a zipper being unzipped. Mr. Bingley happily joins in the dancing and socializing but both Miss Bingley and Mr. Darcy remain aloof, quietly commenting on the differences between living in the city and country. It is quite obvious they feel  superior compared to the locals. Mr. Bingley laughs and smiles as he dances with Miss Jane Bennett (Rosamund Pike). Her mother, Mrs. Bennett (Brenda Blethyn,) is delighted by this good fortune. She is actively seeking a husband for Jane who is of marriagable age and the eldest daughter of five.<br /><br />During an intermission Lizzie over hears Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy discussing Jane and herself. Mr Darcy describes Lizzie as \\"tolerable\\" but essentially not his type. This phrase will eventually come to haunt him, as Lizzie repeats it to him  later during an encounter. Based on this event, she develops preconceived notions about Mr. Darcy's character and manners. She makes no secret of her feelings about him to her family.<br /><br />Jane pays a social visit to the Bingley's country mansion and becomes ill, requiring her to stay as an overnight guest for several days until she recovers. Mr. Bingley can not hide his joy at having such a pretty and desirable house guest. Lizzie visits her sister during the illness and encounters Mr. Darcy and Miss Bingley. She engages Mr. Darcy in several verbal duels and cleverly exchanges challenging words, demonstrating superior skill and prowess in the intellectual game of quoting poetry and verse. Both Keira Knightly and Matthew MacFadyen perfom their roles superbly ...<br /><br />While Mr. Bingley was falling in love with Jane and quietly making his feelings known, his sister suddenly closed the manor house and persuaded him and her entourage to return to London. It is obvious she wanted to sever the budding relationship between her brother and Jane, before it became serious. Essentially, Miss Jane Bennett was viewed as a social inferior. About this time, the Reverend Mr. Collins came calling on the Bennetts, with the intention of marrying one of the daughters. He lived on an estate owned by Lady Catherine, who required him to find a wife before she would finance a parsonage and church for him. Lizzie captured his attention but she outright rejected his proposal. Following this refusal, Mr. Collins offered marriage to Charlotte their young housekeeper, who accepted him. Lizzie could not understand why Charlotte would marry Mr. Collins until the realities of Charlotte's situation sunk in. Charlotte explained he had a stable profession and provided her a home which was a major improvement from her current situation. Lizzie slowly awakened into adulthood, recognizing many unpleasant facts of life. The scenes went from comedy to almost tragedy as different events unfolded in the lives of the Bennett family. The importance of social position and wealth in selecting a life partner was clear and evident.<br /><br />It never dawned on the Bennett's that the sudden departure of the Bingley's was meant as a snub, a refusal of Miss Jane Bennett as a fiance. The Bennetts had high hopes of relighting the match and sent Jane to visit an Aunt in London in hopes of meeting Mr. Bingley. About this time, Lizzie was visiting Brighton with her relatives when she took a tour of Mr. Darcy's residence which was open for public viewing. She met him unexpectedly in the garden and received a declaration of love which took her completely by surprise. She immediately dismissed it and rejected him ...<br /><br />Jane returned from London without having established any social connection with Mr. Bingley. Lizzie returned from Brighton, in an unusual emotional state, a totally confused frame of mind. Unknown to herself, she was battling unresolved feelings for Mr. Darcy. A family crisis arose when Lydia, the middle daughter, had run away with a soldier. This scandal would ruin the Bennett's chances for marrying off Jane and Lizzie to good families. Help came from an unexpected source: Mr. Darcy had known this soldier in the past. Mr. Darcy's father had treated the soldier nearly like a son. Due to nearly similar circumstances involving Mr. Darcy's sister Georgiana, he rescued Lydia from her shameful situation by setting them up finanacially and ensuring Lydia married her soldier. When Lizzie heard of this matter, she remained in a deep quagmire for having rejected his overtures of love, she was awakening to the true nature of his character and discovered herself attracted to him. The resolution to Lizzie's emotional conflict and the rematch between Jane and Mr. Bingley is what makes the book and this film so popular. Jane Austen's classical writing via this new film adaptation provides a creative twist to the eternal conundrum which young ladies and young gentlemen of every era and generation must face and resolve anew for themselves.<br />Erika Borsos (erikab93)asant facts of life.

B000068CNX|5.0|My Top Ten Favorite Episodes -  <br /> <br />This season is so good that it is hard to pick a top 10 list because of so many good episodes. Some episodes that didn't make the list would be high on some of the top ten of the last seasons of Friends. Probably the best season overall because of Ross & Rachel being together (later seasons screwed up by having them apart and dating others but occasionally getting back together and eventually having a daughter together still not as satisfying as season two's take on their romance). Disk 3 is almost perfect as far as great episodes go. Not one episode on that disk is a let-down. <br /> <br /># 1 - The One Where Ross and Rachel....You Know - This episode gaves fans what we wanted all along, Ross & Rachel on their first date. On top of that Monica & Richard (Tom Selleck) hook up as well and Chandler & Joey get the new chairs and a big screen tv. One of the best episodes of the series let alone this season. <br /> <br /># 2 - The One Where Eddie Won't Go - Hilarious episode. Eddie is very funny as the insane roommate of Chandler. Having Chandler & Joey reunited was a nice touch. The girls having empowerment leads to comedy when Rachel tells Ross something funny. Eddie is the show-stealer here and was missed after this episode. The episode also showed how Joey & Chandler living together led to great comedy. <br /> <br /># 3 - The One Where Ross Finds Out - Funny episode when Rachel is out on a date she drives him nuts because she is stuck on Ross. Rachel gets drunk and calls Ross leaving a message about how she is over him. A hungover Rachel the next day can't remember she left the message until Ross calls home to check his messages. Show has the best ending of the series when Ross & Rachel finally kiss for the first time. <br /> <br /># 4 - The One With The Prom Video - The first flashback episode to when Monica was fat, Rachel had a bad nose & Ross had his curly hair & mustache. Showed all the characters that Ross truly loved Rachel even back in her highschool and his college years. Phoebe's lobster story was funny and sweet. <br /> <br /># 5 - The One with the List - Ross gets himself into trouble just when it seems like he and Rachel are about to hook up. He can't seem to decide between her and Julie when Chandler and Joey suggest making a list of her good & bad traits. A great episode for Ross & Rachel being sooooo close to being together but he messes things up. <br />  <br /># 6 - The One Where Joey Moves Out - Funny episode for Joey licking a spoon putting it back without washing it and his story about soap. Emotional when Joey moves out making you think just when you think the show is stable and reliable anything can happen.  <br /> <br /># 7 - The One Where Dr Ramoray Dies - Joey's character is killed off when he makes a remark about making up his own lines. Eddie seems stranger as Chandler's roommate. Joey & Chandler miss each other but can't bring themselves to admit it to each other. <br /> <br /># 8 - The One With Two Parties - The cast was top-notch here as they had to go between the men's & women's apartment to keep Rachel's parents away from one another. The men were at their best (especially Ross in dealing with Rachel's stiff dad). Joey kissing Rachel's mom to distract her from her ex-husband leaving was also un-expected and hilarious.

0425098478|5.0|It's easy to belittle this book for its endless platitudes, but the fact remains that its advice - if shallow - is rock solid. Every manager thet reads this book will be rude about it, but very manager SHOULD read this book and, despite their predictable rudeness, will go away with some simple and valuable points that are worth remembering. When I first read it (back in the Middle Ages sometime) I hated it, hated its style and hated the sense that I was being patronised. But I have found, over the years, that its message has stuck and that its fundamentals do apply to the real world of management much more than many \\"worthier\\" tomes.
B000BOH8XW|5.0|its about time she makes music we can understand am so glad she is geting back to her roots music in englash that we can understand
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|the first real, new, full release since the GODLIKE Toxicity, Mezmerize does nothing but disappoint.  it's catchy at first listen. but give it couple more listens and you'll be sick of it.  i've been a long time SOAD fan and i must say that this is the worst release yet.  especially with Hypnotize now released.  Hypnotize is the second half to the 2005 SOAD opus and it puts Mezmerize to shame.  Most of the songs on Mezmerize don't even have verses, they are just the same choruses repeated over and over again. <br /> <br />The one exception on this album is Question! this is a classic and i can never get enough of it. <br /> <br />Another problem is that it has only 10 tracks, and only 9 of them are songs! thats really disappointing. BUT as a loyal fan, own it. add it to the collection.
B000002HMH|4.0|I write this after spending the day listening back over the albums \\"Metallica\\", \\"Load\\" and \\"Reload\\". And hearing them again after a gap of a number of years I can appreciate them in ways my teenage self probably could not. <br /> <br />\\"Load\\" alienated many of Metallica's fans due to its fairly radical change of approach. Instead of the ramming-speed thrash of their early days or the pounding crunch of \\"Metallica\\" we find songs that contain heavy influences from rock, blues and country music. Obviously this came as something of a shock to many. <br /> <br />Speaking from a personal point of view however I feel that \\"Load\\" and \\"Reload\\" represent some of Metallica's best work to date. After the touring schedule of \\"Metallica\\" they were a band at the peak of heavy metal fame. And to my ears the music of \\"Load\\" sounds like a band who, feeling that they no longer needed to \\"prove\\" themselves to the world, wanted to kick back and make music that they would love to play and give them the oppertunity to air some of their more mature musical influences. <br /> <br />As always James Hetfield pens a good story in each of his songs, and this album contains some excellently crafted music. Lars Ulrich, never a particularly great drummer, sounds like he is genuinly getting into the flow of the music on this album in contrast to the rather contrived beats on \\"Metallica\\", and even picks up the brushes for some softer moments in \\"Mama Said\\". And in a change from the norm Kirk and James interchange lead and rhythm duties to great effect. With Kirk contributing some excellent bluesy rhythms and, as anyone who has heard \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" will know, James can truly wail when he lays down a lead. <br /> <br />My only complaint with \\"Load\\" is that it is quite a long album, so long in fact that they had material left over from the sessions to release \\"ReLoad\\". But all the songs on offer are first rate work. \\"Load\\" is very much a grown-up album, and far superior to the more recent \\"St Anger\\" which to my mind sounds like the soundtrack to a mid-life crisis. Hopefully Metallica recover from this stage soon. In the meantime, give \\"Load\\" a try.
0679720200|3.0|L'tranger is Camus' most linguistically straightforward and seemingly accessible work, yet translating its startlingly simple French into English is not a straightforward task. This translation is diferrent to that with which I grew up (published by Penguin as \\"The Outsider\\" in the UK, with the same translation being sold as \\"The Stranger\\" in the US), but no better. Both are, in many ways, very good, but neither really gets what Camus was saying in French. I suspect this is partly because simplicity and clarity of expression have been mainstream in English for generations, while such an approach taken by a pied noir Frenchman (already known as a bizarre philosopher among the chattering classes thanks to the \\"Mythe de Sysiphe\\") was actually pretty revolutionary. <br /> <br />A wonderful novel, one that is seemingly easy to translate, but one that really must be read in the original. <br /> <br />Translating this book is like translating a haiku. Not something that the smart would attempt.
B000BJS4OY|1.0|It's like there's only 2 songs in disc 2 that worth AT LEAST a listen..the rest of the tracks sucks until to where to suck!<br /><br />Whole album is so full of crap!!!<br /><br />30th Anniversary???how do you sell?
B000024D4R|5.0|i'm pretty sure that my title pretty much wraps it up.  Pink Floyd is one of the greatest bands ever assembled! <br /> <br />this album is too often overlooked in the Pink Floyd discography because of the great success of Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, and The Wall.  But i definitely like this more than The Wall.  It's a tie with Dark Side and Wish You Were Here for my favorite by Pink Floyd. <br /> <br />Pigs on the Wing (parts 1 and 2) are nice little caps on the ends of this double ended roman candle of rock. <br /> <br />Dogs is a 17 minute classic with great vocals by Roger and some great guitar work by Gilmour.  the synthesizer sounds of dogs barking is chilling and amazing. it sounds sooooooooo good! <br /> <br />Pigs (Three Different Ones) is awesome.  \\"ha, ha, charade you are\\" what else can i say? <br /> <br />Sheep is another epic symbolizes us regular Joes being the sheep who are prayed upon by the dogs and taken advantage of by the pigs.  just awesome. <br /> <br />BUY THIS ALBUM!!  do Floyd a favor and give this album the recognition it deserves.
B000023VR6|5.0|Dre you really came back on this one Good Beats Good Featured artist and all Dre you have proven your legacy with 2 of 3 attempts I never heard the Aftermath album and I dont need to times was bad at that point and time but anyway This is a good album <br />Lyrics 8.5/10 Beats 12/10 (if you're wondering why I said 12 of 10 just listen to this constant head bobbing check it out) <br />
B000BM6AVA|5.0|System of A Down once again brings an exceptional release with HYPNOTIZE, the second half of the double album MEZMERIZE/HYPNOTIZE.  The production by Rick Rubin is excellent as always with crazy driving guitars. The songwriting is just as polished as MEZMERIZED, though there is the lack of a hit say the caliber of \\"B.Y.O.B.\\" which did very well on the pop charts.  I like the fact that System of Down thinks outside of the box rather than just being like everybody else.  They are in an elitest group that I consider to include The Mars Volta, Coheed & Cambria, and even NIN. One positive thing that I like particular about this album is the humor on such tracks as \\"She's Like Heroin\\".  I just love their who approach.<br /><br />My favorite songs are \\"Attack\\", \\"Kill Rock & Roll\\", \\"Dreaming\\", \\"Hypnotize\\", \\"She's Like Heroin\\", and \\"Soldier Side\\".  Very well done.  There is no need to elaborate any more. SOAD is doing so many things right that it is hard to find anything to complain about.  My biggest downer against them is that they should've released MEZMERIZE/HYPNOTIZE as one album.  For 36 Minutes and 39 minutes respectively, the album is just priced a bit much seperately.  Where quality is concerned, this for me is one of the best rock releases of 2005, easily.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|Mariah Carey has been in the music industry for a very long time now, and ever since she came out any and everyone is craving over the most Unique voice every created by God. Mariah Carey is by far the most unique singing Female on the face of this earth, god has definately sent an angel with one of the most beautiful voices ever.<br /><br />The Emancipation of MIMI, is definately one of mariah's best albums...She is doing alot of Promoting for her album, and Her name carries alot of wieght behind it.<br /><br />The Emancipation of MIMI track Review:<br /><br />It's Like that(10/10)-The First single off the Album, and definetly the song, that when I first herd it I was going to get her album! Major Props to Jermaine Dupri from Producing this Club-Banger track, that will definately help mariah sell alot of albums. Great Song, and a great Party song!<br /><br />We Belong Together(10/10)- The second single from the album, I heard this song about a week before the album came out, and I was like OH MY GOSH!!! I was counting down like every single hour until her album came out. This is the perfect second single off the album, and it also had a very good video to go with it. She looked very beautiful and professional to make the video just as beautiful as the song is, by far one of my favorites on the album, I would never skip this track...Never!<br /><br />Shake it off(8/10)- Definately not one of my favorites, but it is an amazing track. Not the best, but nevertheless amazing, and extremely catchy. I like the chorus alot and everything. Wouldn't be dissapointed if this wasnt the next single, but there are better songs on the album.<br /><br />Mine Again(10/10)- OH! MY! GOSH! I have never in my life, never heard a song like this!...I got goosebumps all over my body after I heard this song, Mariah's voice is the strongest I have heard in awhile.

I love the beat, and snoop dogg added his flow to the song, it is just a nice song to listen to on a nice mild summer night,riding in a convertable..lol! It is just a fresh new song, with a fresh new beat. That could appeal to all listeners, young and old..definately one of my favorites.<br /><br />Stay the Night(10/10)- Wow KANYE WEST HAS DONE IT AGAIN! Kanye West is definately one of the more talented song Producers. He made this song sound like a Jackson 5 song, or an older group song. It is just amazing! and Mariah's voice is so Nice and Sensual on this song. Another summer night's song..Just amazing! Probably my second favorite song on the album.<br /><br />Get your Number(9/10)- This song is definately a a partying song, and is something you could dance to. Not mariah's bet vocals, and not the best on the album, but it is a great! song nevertheless. When I first head this track, I had no clue who was singing the chorus, because I didn't look at the back of the Album case, but when my eyes saw it was Jermaine Dupri, I was really suprised! I never would have thought..It was rteally suprising, and a suprisingly good produced song he made there..definately a good partying song.<br /><br />One and Only(10/10)- This song sounds definately sounds like a mariah song, and Twista just adds his fast cool Flow to the track, which just makes it even better. Definately a great Mariah song, with beautiful sensual vocals one again..one of my favorites.<br /><br />Circles(10/10)- This is by farmy favorite song on the album. I love the message it gives and I absolutely love! How she sings this song, I could keep this song on repeat all day, and never get tired of it all, it is just pure Amazing, and Mine again is definately up there with this song, and that is by far the two best songs on the album!...Great Job MARIAH!<br /><br />Your Girl(10/10)- This song is definately the most creative, Melodic and Catchy song on the album. Once I heard this I was like wow this is extremely catchy, and I absolutely love how she sings this. It's the shortest song on the album, coming in at a wopping 2 minuts and 46 seconds, but it is all good. The song is fine just as it is, and I would add anything or take anything from it.<br /><br />I wish I knew(10/10)- This song sounds like she did a live performance on stage, and it is awsome! I love live performances and that is why I absolutely love this song, it has beautiful lyrics and definately shows off mariah's strong sensual vocals, while she is hitting those hight Notes toward the end off the song..Definately one of the best from the Album.<br /><br />To The Floor(9/10)- This song really took time to grow on me!...I personally think Nelly is a little annoying, and it took me a good Two weeks to like this song, because I heard this song a month before the album came out, and I couldn't even listen to one bit of it, now it's a really awsome party song with a banging beat. It is a really nice song, that will probably take some time for most people to like...Just give this one time, and you'll see how good this song is. I also Love Mariah's high note at the end!<br /><br />Joy Ride(10/10)- Wow! This is avery nice song, that I heard almost didn't make it the album, I wonder why it wouldn't it is a very nice song, and a great song to fall asleep to, it is very sensual and strong and very nice lyics, and a great song, and I love mariah's long note at the end..it was superb!....Just Excellent!<br /><br />Fly Like a Bird(10/10)- This is a great way to end the Album,and let metell you, this is the best gospel song I ever heard..lol. It is an excellent song, and very melodic and catchy. An excellent song with Beautiful lyrics. I hear it is Mariah's favorite song, and I don't blame her at all for that decesion.<br /><br />Don't Forget About Us(10/10)- This is Mariah's 4th single of of the album, and is possibly my favorite song from her!  I absolutely love this song and it reminds me of Always be my baby, it is just a really good song.  Jermaine Dupri is a very talented producer and mariah's voice in the song only makes it better.<br /><br />Makin' it last all night(what it do)(10/10)- This song is also awesome!  I love everything about, it.  The song samples alot fo other song, but mariah puts them in really good melody with the beat that was produced by jermaine Dupri once again.<br /><br />So Lonely(One & only part II)(10/10)- I first heard this song on Twita's album,but this one featured on the re-release is better.  It adds an extra verse by mariah and also a few other small changes that makes it better, I really like this song, and it should be the next single.<br /><br />We Belong together(Remix)(10/10)-Definately not better than the Orginal.  But is very good, it was only available as a computer download at first, but I am happy that it made the Re-release because it is very good, and the High Note that Mariah hits at the end is on-point and sounds well with the song!<br /><br />176/180= 97% which is an A..there ya go folks!

B000BP86OG|4.0|The Darkness are back with a vengeance! After striking the world with their first album \\"Permission to Land\\" it was quiet around them for a while. Occasional rumors about Frankie Poulain leaving and Justin starting a solo-career licked our ears, but that was all. After two years, they have returned and are ready to slap modern rock in the face and rock your socks off.<br /><br />I flung the CD in the stereo, pumped up the volume and lay on my bed. After a short silence I heard sniffling, grunting almost, and I knew it. This was the new Darkness album. So typical to open with that full force that is \\"One Way Ticket\\". Silly lyrics, power chord riffs. Then the solo came and I had to listen twice before I came to the conclusion they were busting a solo on a sitar... So they've started to experiment with instruments. Bagpipes, piano, tambourine, violin, they all came by and proved to be really fresh with that old Darkness sound. A great surprise.<br /><br />80's rock is still the biggest influence on these glamrockers. Queen elements come back in a lot of the songs, which is exactly what we need today; skillful music. The drums keep a basic rhythm most of the time, treating us with a nice break from time to time. The guitars are still rocking hard with catchy riffs and over-the-top solo's. The biggest change must be the bass, since they replaced Francis with Richie Edwards. The bass appears to be more present now and it sounds fitting, listen to the song \\"Girlfriend\\" and you'll definitely notice.<br /><br />The lyrical side of the Darkness is still amazing. They tell us all we need to know to laugh, to cry and to agree. Sometimes silly, especially in the combination with the falsetto voice, but that's not all, girls and boys. They managed to really seize me with the song \\"Seemed Like A Good Idea At The Time\\", a true ballad about sincere heartbreak.<br /><br />All I can say is that they pulled it off again. The album features high-pitched voices, gut-busting sitar solo's, rockballad's and songs about turning bald... All I can say is check it out, because it's definitely worth your 14 bucks. Also check out the new vid, it's hilarious.solo's, rockballad's and songs about turning bald... All I can say is check it out, because it's definitely worth your 14 bucks.

B000AYEL1A|3.0|Since I was a projectionist for this film on its lengthy original run (yes, in the late 70s films would play in the same theatre for MONTHS at a time), I dare say I have seen this film, in pieces and its entirety, more frequently than practically anyone. So believe me when I tell you that as vanity projects go, this is one slick piece of 70s crapola! Babs as a ROCK singer? HEEHEEHEE. Her opening numbers are apparently set in some alternate universe where 35-year-old Broadway belters are considered rockers (well, Babs DOES sport an hilarious Afro!). It goes downhill from there, with Kris K looking hunky as hell but not very believable as Jim Morrison (Elvis apparently wanted very badly to play that role, vetoed by that SOB Col. Parker - now THAT would have been memorable!). SEE Babs in nearly every foot of film! SEE Babs utilize every camera filter known to 1976 technology! SEE Babs in close-up at every possible opportunity! RUN to get the Judy Garland version for an example of superb directing, photography, acting and scoring! DRINKING GAME: down a shot of your favorite alcoholic beverage for every fuzzy, filtered closeup of Babs! You won't make it through the film, making this the best drinking game ever! Oh yeah, if you're not a gay male or a hard-core Streisand freak, forget about this overwrought mess entirely.
1400031362|1.0|Read the sample pages on Amazon...this junk would never have been printed in a non-PC world.  The writing is clumsy, preachy, and ultimately uninteresting.

B00005JOHI|5.0|PRIDE & PREJUDICE is a handsomely mounted production, moodily filmed with a pervasive dark texture of visual expression about it. It is quite a visual presentation of the story where dialogue is left unspoken and the power of the images both animate and inanimate speak for themselves. That is not to say that the film goes on without dialogue, but rather quite the opposite. The many exchanges of dialogue are witty, brilliantly structured, eloquently spoken and presented with an economy of style that is concisely intelligent. This film with its intricately mounted visuals and words does an admirable job of bringing this literary work to the screen with all the constraints inherent in the medium of the cinema. Director Joe Wright also did a more than commendable job of representing the two main characters. Keira Knightley gives an awe-inspiring performance as Lizzie giving her great insight of the human condition. Lizzie though impetuous at times has a gift of rationalizing human behavior with a certain sense of reality offsetting loftier romantic ideals thus making her a young woman of keen intelligence.  I truly enjoyed Matthew MacFadyen's performance as Darcy. He seems a young man tired and perplexed by convention but knows no other way to conduct himself and is trapped by his by his social status but more importantly by his own upbringing. Matthew MacFadyen's does an exceptional job conveying this. Awkwardly trying to emote his inner feelings he does more to alienate Lizzie than win her affections. MacFadyen's Darcy is truly a man misunderstood. Only through good and anonymous deeds can the true nature of the man prevail. I think this is a very good film rich with artistic fervor yet embracing all that is good of the human spirit.
B00000AD94|5.0|\\"Wow.\\" <br /> <br />That should be one of the first thoughts after listening to this album. This is Spock's Beard's debut album - their first in a long chain of progressive rock masterpieces. Incidently, it's also one of their best. I believe it to be their most random - in that, it jumps from one concept to another very quickly. If you've not heard Spock's Beard before, think the Beatles, if they had a severe case of A.D.D. <br />Now, I'll go through each song. <br /> <br />01. The Light 10/10 <br />Their first of many epics. I'm not going to get too much into it, but it's a wonderful way to get into progressive music. A piano introduction, then - Boom - the song consumes you. <br /> <br />02. Go the Way You Go 9/10 <br />Another, more straightforward progressive rock song. Also wonderful, and it's a great way to separate two huge epics. A good song in it's own right. <br /> <br />03. The Water 50/10 <br />23 minutes of perfection. A song of extremities - from the gospel choir in many of the acoustic passages, to the hugely aggressive 'FU' part. One note. If you cannot take a little bit of poor language, don't listen to this song. Yes, there is poor language, and to me, thats no big deal. But it's used tastefully - it's to mimic us. Us when we're angry, mad, aggressive. I don't care how righteous you are, you're guilty of this. Back to the song - it's simply one of the greatest songs ever recorded. The last part - 'Reach Up to the Sky' - is absolutely breathtaking. It's arguable whether or not Neal Morse has had a more emotional passage thus far into his career. Perhaps the second part of 'Flow'... Even still. Amazing song, worth the price of three of these albums. <br /> <br />04. On The Edge 10/10 <br />A near-7-minute prog rocker. Another highlight. This is a favorite at concerts, and probably the closest to an anthemic rocker Spock's Beard has come to. A great way to close out the regular album. <br /> <br />05. The Doorway (acoustic live demo) N/A <br />It's anice bonus. It's not the full song. But it's a nice jam-sounding live excerpt. I do think I'd rather this album end with the 'On The Edge' note, though... <br /> <br />Excellent album, and the start of a whole list you can describe as that. Buy this immediately.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This is my first time writing about a movie because I wanted to let others know what a wonderful, clean and moving movie this is.  I have been a fan of Elizabeth Gaskell since seeing \\"Wives and Daughters.\\"  I always thought \\"North and South\\" would make a great movie and am so pleased with this version of it.  The movie is magically filmed and composed to transport you along with the characters to this strange, new textile town in the north of England.  Just as I love Jane Austen for her witty dialogues, I enjoy Gaskell for her deep, well-developed characters.  All the characters in this movie have a depth to them to create a realistic, complex story. I enjoy watching this over and over as I have \\"P&P\\" and \\"Wives and Daughters.\\" <br />    This movie is fun, sad, informative, clean and downright fabulous!  Please see this movie, tell your friends, and support such family-friendly films.
0671027387|5.0|Dan Brown, but without the Pope?  EGADS MAN!!  I thought 'Deception Point' was far better than 'The Da Vinci Code'.  I found this techno thriller to be hard to put down and thought provoking.  I tried my best to solve the mysteries within the novel, but Brown tricked me every time.  Brown uses short chapters that keep the action moving and make it easy to find a stopping point, but you'll be hard-pressed to actually do so.
B000B7HZXM|1.0|yucks..how can he still be a recodring artiste? his voice is so edited by the music box..bet he can't sing live..it's so obviouse to people with sharp ears..goodbye Rod! you've one less fan..ME!!!!!!!
B00003CXBH|5.0|This magnificent work is an admirable evidence of the multiple possibilities of facing the elusive character of the truth is what it beats you more.<br /><br />We have a Spanish Jesuit in search of conversion; on the other side of the coin we have a hunter slave whose nasty behavior is an act of instinctive reject. But as I told you previously, the truth is a capricious lover. When Spain decides sell the colony to Portugal this mercenary fights bravely against the common aggressor, and then suddenly we tend to accept him. This fabulous picture, far beyond its intrinsic virtues, such as memorable photography, superb cast and splendid edition work focuses around the unevenness of the so well know absolute statements. Who is the bad guy and who is the good guy? Is the human justice or divine justice which must prevail at the end of this dispute? Are you able to accept the violence in name of God and reject another kind of violence, because of the truth must impose, but what truth: yours or the enemy `s true?<br /><br />Admirable film that still remains shining with radiant energy.
B000B8QEZG|2.0|Te return of Madonna is bad. I like Hung Up but i have spent 18  for only one song (Hung Up) the others songs are too dance and every Dj around th wrold can do it an maybe better than this cd. <br />Sorry
0553801503|2.0|It is not up to the standards of the rest of the series and is even totally boring in some places.  Maybe what should have happened is that the two books should be ONE book with some editing and ego trimmed.  I am upset that I wasted my money on a hardcover, and I loved the other books in the series.  I've rarely been so disappointed.
B000BOH8XW|5.0|Shakira is back to sing in English, i like so much this new Album. The lyrics and the music are great! I think that her music is better than the era of Laundry Service, i'm very happy to have bought this amazing album. <br />Congrats to Shakira.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|Mezmerize is, of course, a masterpiece. Upon listening to it, I had my doubts that they couldn't possibly top it. Wrong. Everything about this album is outstanding. The riffs, the bass, the vocals, the drums, the production, everything is perfect. Going back to the vocals, yes, Daron does get a fair share of vocal time here, but a little bit less than on Mezmerize. I personally can't decide whether I like Serj's or Daron's voice more. They're both equally great. This album is perfect for those who agree with me, because about 50% is sung by Serj; and 50% by Daron. So basically, it's the best of both worlds. If you bought Mezmerize and love it but don't already own this album, go out and buy it. You'll most likely adore it even more. You may not like it at first. If you don't, give it time. It's sure to grow on you. Below are my ratings/comments for each individual song:    1. Attack: System start out strong, as this is undoubtedly their heaviness song they've ever written. A perfect opening track. It even has death metal blastbeats! 10/10  2. Dreaming: A great song, but the songs ahead quickly overshadow it. 8/10  3. Kill Rock n Roll: The chorus of this song is incredibly catchy. Funny vocals from Daron. 10/10  4. Hypnotize: The most melodic and mature song on the album. Great song, but a poor choice for a single. 9/10  5. Stealing Society: Yeah! Alright! Like Dreaming, not the best song on the album, but still good. The only song on the record that features the \\"F-Word.\\" 8.5/10  6. Tentative: An emotionally serious song about bombings...10/10  7. U-Fig: Quite possibly my favorite. The first time I heard this song, I was literally cracking up, it's that funny. The subject matter isn't, it's just the way Serj sings that makes it a hilarious song. 10/10  8. Holy Mountains: Yes, this song does slightly resemble Ariels. Only difference is, it's better. Longest song on the album, clocking in at about 5:30. 10/10  9. Viscinity of Obscenity: Every System album has at leastone crazy song that stands out from the rest, simply because it makes no freaking sense. For Hypntoize, this is Viscinity of Obcenity. 2nd favorite. 10/10  10. She's Like Heroin: Following in the footsteps of VOB and U-Fig, another really wierd and quirky song. 3rd favorite. 10/10  11. Lonely Day: The most Daron-dominated song on the album.(Serj only does backing vocals.) To me, this song is about a day when you contemplate suicide, and there's no one there to try to talk you out of it. Good song, but it could've been better. 8/10  12. Soldier Side: The full version of the intro on Mezmerize, an extremely emotional and compelling song. 10/10    Once again, if you love Mezmerize but haven't gotten Hypnotize, be sure to give it a chance. Keep your eyes on these guys in the future, because it's apparant after listening to this album that SOAD will get better and better with every new release.
B000BP86OG|5.0|The Darkness might possibly be the most innovative band out on the scene today. Their first album was absoultaly fantastic...but this one....well all I could say was Yes! 'One Way Ticket' is exactly what true rock fans want to hear from their bands, something fresh to make our jaws hit the floor just as hard as the first time we heard them. The boys bring the loud and melodic sounds of Arena Rock back with a vengence. The use of instruments are as innovative as Rush, the vocals have the power to resurect Freddie Mercury from the dead. And who doesn't love the hair metalesuqe use of spandex? No reason to rank any songs because they are all awesome, but I can almost guarentee that 'Hazel Eyes' will be played at least twice the first time you hear this album. BUY IT! HEAR IT! LOVE IT TO DEATH!!!
B0007O38F8|5.0|This is a truly fenominal album, there are amazing tracks such as \\"Jus a Lil Bit\\", \\"I'm Supposed To Die Tonight\\" and \\"Piggy Bank\\" and then there are other tracks which are also mashin tunez such as \\"Gunz come out\\", \\"Get in my Car\\" and \\"Outta Control\\", out of the 22 tracks on this CD i'd rate 11 as amazing, 6 as Good and 4 as Okay, Overall an amazing Album and if youre a fifty fan this is obviously a must. <br /> <br />Rich (A.K.A Lil G)
B00005IC2H|5.0|Thoughout our history, music has been a key role in development in cultures and even language in some. Sigur Ros has developed this in a nature that even the few can understand. Today's music seems as it was pumped though the opinions of what people expect to hear, rather than the true essence of music. Sigur Ros has compiled a traditional blend of instruments that seem to work tirelessly in a secluded environment of pure bliss. This is the type of music that just hit's the listener in the heart. I've first heard them long ago, and was astounded of their perfection of crystal clear collage of music. This is it at the finest detail.     A few friends refer this as the detail of a stream flowing or perhaps a slow walk in the woods, something that distracts you from mainstream pop and new-age hits. This is the type of music that will guide you off the path of life, handing you a shovel to dig your own trail. I view this as just life, laid out onto a music chart, allowing you to peer into it's bold lines and allow you to see the hidden music that lies within. So being evenly & generously distrubited that you'll wonder if Mozart himself isn't sewn into the instruments they play on.    For you to purchase this album, you're making a gratified step into the world of music played as finely as it can be produced. It draws some to cry over the beauty they experience, for myself though, it creates an aurora of soul that just simply kisses my ears.
0307276902|1.0|This entire book makes me think is that James Frey is a self-important ass, who has a very poor writing style.  I work at a prominent substance abuse facility, and have been in treatment myself.  It pains me that substance abuse and dependency patients are reading this and thinking that this is their rehab Bible, because if you behave the was Mr. Frey behaved you would be booted out on your ass.  Withdrawals or not, physical or verbal abuse towards other patients or staff cannot be tolerated. For all these comments about how truthful and upfront this book is, you are naive if you think that this memoir is anything other than very bad fiction.

B00005NKKY|5.0|Bookends came out during the time of concept albums, right about the time Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band came out. <br />I wouldnt call this a concept album but it does have theme. <br />It starts out with the Bookends theme played on the acoustic guitar and turns into a production piece with Save the life of my Child. <br />America is next as the tempo shifts in another direction. <br />Overs and Voices of old People goes back to the theme as we listen to old people share their thoughts. <br />Bookends theme is repeated. <br />We then go to the hit song from the 60's Fakin it and then Punkeys dilema. <br />Mrs Robinson is next and taken directly from the soundtrack of the Graduate. Hazy Shade of Winter that has been covered by a few groups is next and the finale is At the Zoo. <br />This CD is very solid from beginning to end and is probably their best CD ever.

0767834739|5.0|A RUSH OF NON-STOP ACTION-Lou Lumenick,The New York Post <br /> <br />FANS OF THE GAME WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE-Shawn Edwards,FOX TV <br /> <br />This movie is pretty good.I thought it was better than part1,because is has more action.I recomend this movie if you liked the first movie or if you like the game.I am gonna talk about the dvd aspects of this 2 disc special edition dvd. <br /> <br />                     IMAGE: <br />The biggest problem is black level,as darker scenes often look muddy and a bit grainy. Putting both widescreen and fullscreen transfers on the same side of the disc has also resulted in higher instances of digital artifacting than normal. <br />  <br />                   SOUND: <br /> <br />If there is a reason to watch this movie,its the sound design,which really shines in DD 5.1 mix included here. I dont know if its because its only audio track and has thus been given more room to breathe or what,but this is one of the liveliest mixes I've head in quite some time. The front soundstage is very wide,with dialogue always coming in clearly from the center and excellent panning and directionality across the mains.The surrounds are active throughout,whether they're carrying echoes of gunfire,the moans and shuffles of zombies,or the annoying numetal soundtrack. Check out the showdown with the lickers in the church early on for a good example of what I'm talking about: As the creatures crawl around on the ceiling,stalking their pray,the mix track their progresses from left surround to right surround and into the front channels.Very Impressive. <br /> <br />                    SPECIAL FEATURES: <br />Full Motion menu with music <br />Scene Acess with 28 cues and remote access <br />1. 2 Original Trailers <br />2. 9 Other Trailers <br />3. 20 deleted scenens <br />4. 9 Featurettes <br />5. 3 Feature/Episode commentaries by director Alexander Witt,produvers Paul W.S.

B000ASATYO|4.0|No, This is not a massive 4 disc set, but the 4 hour Doc that was on the laser disc IS on the DVD, as its on the other side of the disc. I would have prefered a 2 disc set, but hey, I will take what I can get. Wont bother reviewing the movie, as many others already have. DVD-****  Movie-*****. Real Rating 4.5 Stars
0765340798|2.0|Like so many others, I did not expect this series to equal or surpass the original Dune series. <br /> <br />I have been quite pleased with this series until now, enjoying the opportunity to view the world of Dune from a new perspective.  Watching Herbert's universe take shape has actually been quite entertaining. <br /> <br />This particular book, however, falls short.  The writing feels forced and rushed, the dialog completely inane, the characters stripped of any complexity.  The villians are stupid and easily manipulated.  The characters make rash decisions with vast, universe-shattering consequences but do not even pause to do a bit of soul-searching for the benefit of the by now befuddled reader.   <br /> <br />The sentences are often redundant and obviously barely edited, if at all.  The book is readable, but the poor writing intrudes constantly. <br /> <br />If you're a follower of the series, you might rent it from the library to find out how the conflict ends, but I'm not sure it's worth the 7.99.  (To add insult to injury, my copy, at least, is poorly printed.)
B000B8QEZG|2.0|Hey there everyone, listen - that scraping sound you hear is the sound of a last gasp attempt at ploughing the depths of pseudo-nostalgia to make a quick buck.  Or could the sound actually be Madonna's whiney voice, still faking emotional torment and pain after all these years rather than expressing any real feelings of her own?  Rather than being controversial as many have misjudged, Madonna is actually the epitome of tedious entertainment.  This new album is a milky confection, a hodge-podge of recycled cliches and techno bleeps.  If the truth be told, Madonna is more akin to a centre-right political party than a serious pop artiste - offend no one, and just tentatively go with the flow to ensure your survival in changing, challenging times.
6301966562|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies from the 80's.  The soundtrack alone makes the movie.  I love the duet between computer and cello.  The movie should be released on DVD in the US.
B00005JO20|5.0|This Movie's release date has not happened yet.  There is not one review by the press online for it at this point.  Press are the first to have a crack at a movie.  Do not believe any reviews of this film until about December 13th.  It will be released to the general public (the people who write reviews on Amazon)on December 14th.  Sorry to break it to you.  Hope this helps.
B000BP86OG|5.0|I can't believe the guy below me.  Madonna is a walking cliche, doing the techno bit.  Yeah, we haven't heard that before.  I've been listening to The Darkness over on myspace.com, and let me tell you, it is breathtaking.  This band has taken their Queen influences, added some AC/DC, and their own sensibilities to create an album that no one else could have made, and that's the highest compliment I could give them.  It can't be recycled if it can't be reproduced by another band. Coldplay?  U2 rehash.  The Killers? Pick any moody 80's band, and you couldn't tell them apart.  But the Darkness are their own animal, and it's so refreshing to hear something different.  Yes, you can hear the Queen influence a lot, but The Darkness have taken it to the next level.  \\"Is it Just Me?\\" should be an instant classic. Actually, the whole album should be a classic. It's only the second time in 10 years that I've been able to listen to an entire album in one sitting.  Actually, I've listened to it about 10 times from front to back.  A magical, wondrous album.  forget what you think music should be.  Forget that MTV/\\"I'm so serious and brooding\\" crap.  Pick of something different.  Something fun.  Something like One Way Ticket to Hell..And Back! And one note to you people who can't wait to attack this band because of Justin's vocals, think about Chris Martin's vocals in Coldplay.  Like a warbling cat.  He can't even sing falsetto very well, but there he is, doing is all the time.  And you stuck up \\"music buffs\\" eat it up.  Get a sense of humor, and get a better ear for music!
B000BOH8XW|5.0|The question with Shakira is this.  She is cute, but can she sing?  Can she really contribute something good to the music world.  Well, yes and no.  Can she contibute something?  Definately.  Her sound on this album is adding something to the music landscape.  It is definately different from the R&B pop world we currently live in.  Way to go!  However, she is also contributing to the continual objectifying of women.  Men are happy she is.  It seems most women are glad she is commfortable with her sexuality.  Whatever the case, this has been going on forever in the music industry, and always will.  madonna has made an entire career of showing more and more of her sexuality to sell record after record.  But Madonna also puts out some dang good music.  Does Shakira do the same?  I say yes.  She has some great music on this album.  Surely enough to catch the publics attention again, and surely pop enough to find it's way on the radio.
B000028U0Y|5.0|Whoever says that the music industry is worse off with having the likes of Johnny Cash in it well then the music industry is better going to complete shambles then.   No talent?!?  Well, Ms. Natasha, John R. Cash was making \\"killer\\" music back when your grandparents was in school, so go back and listen to your idols Clay Aiken and Lindsay Lohan and that crew because anyone who writes such stupid remarks about the Man in Black is testing the boundaries of freedom of speech.   For instance, I do not listen to or like Miles Davis per se, but do I go trash his CD's?  No.   I do not listen to the Luciando Pavarotti but do I trash his CD's?   Certainly not.  I know that there are people that like these artists so I somewhat respect that.   I do not look at the Amazon Top 10 and randomly pan any artist that I do not like. I have better things to do.  Because anyone who writes such stupid comments obviously has never heard the depth and atmosphere associated with this live outing at the Folsom Prison.  This is the most omnimous live album I have heard, actually listen to it Natasha, your opinions could change.
B00082IJ08|1.0|Who are these people giving this album 5 stars?!? Coming from the lead singer of Blur, I expected a lot more when I bought it. I had heard \\"Feel Good, Inc.\\" and \\"Dare\\" and loved them, and thought that the rest of the album must be of the same caliber. No, it's not. The rest of the songs are marginal at best. Honestly, I stopped listening after about the 2nd time through and essentially have a 2-song CD.
B00025ETIW|5.0|As an ADULT I will post an ACTUAL review of the album. I really like this CD because its fun, interesting, and different. In my opinion, the song writing is amazing, the music is good, and I think EVERY song on this Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge is GREAT! I loved this album!  <br /> <br />(I may get in trouble for this but I'm gonna say it anyway) <br /> <br />Everyone has a right to express their opinion. If you don't like the band or the CD you have a right to say so. However, no one has the right to insult or abuse other reviewers on a personal level. Lets all be mature about this and actually REVIEW the album without being completely nasty to other people okay?  <br /> <br />
0800177177|4.0|Bram Stoker's Dracula is one of those movies I simply must recommend.  The film is different in many respects to former iterations of the novel.  Instead of sticking with the horror formula, director Francis Coppola has intertwined the recipe with that of a tragic love story.  This new direction adds much needed life to the overused story and reinvigorates it. <br />From the beginning of the film the tone is dark and foreboding, relying on shadows, and dark colors.  The art direction is spectacular, with mouth dropping sets, lighting, and backdrops.  One of the first scenes which Dracula (Gary Oldman) is introduced to Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves), the foreshadowing of Dracula's true intent and personality come to life with his shadow, seeming to defy any natural law, leaves his body to commit horrific acts in the background.     <br />The story is superbly told through narration and the eyes of several main characters: Dracula (Gary Oldman), Dr. Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins), and Jonathan Harker (Keanu Reeves).  This is also one of the only letdowns of the movie.  The acting throughout the film is almost laughable.  Keanu Reeves plays one of the most uninspired and ill-rehearsed characters I have ever seen.  Winona Ryder as Mina Murray does not help out either.  In her attempt to display affection for Jonathan Harker, she comes off as prudish.  Gary Oldman's attempt as Dracula is admirable although long winded; the only person seeming to be a real actor and strong character in the film is Anthony Hopkins, as Dr. Van Helsing.  <br />Although for the acting, which is dismissible due to everything else shining of creativity and originality, the film is fantastic.  Bram Stock's Dracula takes views of previous versions and adds to them brilliantly.  I consider this film a must see for anyone remotely interested in the genre.  <br /> <br />
B000A59PMO|5.0|Alright so it is true that even though i a seventeen year old girl and mega t.v addict usually starts all series from the pilot on I first heard of veronica mars when channel surfing durring my religion one tree hill commercial break .I even admit I scoffed at the ads saying to check out veronica mars while one tree hill was on hiatus! but come summer loafing on the couch sick of oth reruns I tuned in to an episode of veronica mars ...and suffice to say I now bow down to it and even tho I feel slightly traitorus saying this considering I only caught like seven eps of the first season of vm and all the eps of the second so far ...IT IS THE BEST SHOW ON TELEVISION! It needs to stay on for at least hmm lets see forever! even tho I am religious when it comes to gilmore girls supernatursl oth and the oc and charmed ! I have never in my life been more excited over a television show as I am about veronica mars! I rave about it so often preaching about how great it is that even my sixteen year old sister finally said shes going to probably buy the dvds having never seen an episode! and If you value your tv time it would serve you well to put veronica mars on the menu!!! this show is televisions savior with its smart writing and quick wit strong charachtors and unwavering loyalty to the veiwers experience!
B000AA302U|5.0|I am a loyal Jamiroquai follower... when they have a new album I don't listen beforehand...I just buy.  I have yet to be disappointed and that includes dynamite.  Each album has its own feel and this one is just sooo good.  I wish Jamiroquai had more of a following in the States because people are often bewildered when I tell them that they are my favorite band.  To those that get it... this album will not disappoint.  I am constantly becoming obsessed with different tracks the more I listen...  Enjoy!

015603008X|5.0|Charlie is what you call retarted. He is fun and loving but stupid. One day he becomes much smarter and he and Algernon go on their adventure. This is one of the best stories I have ever read and it will touch everyone's heart. It is very long but full of suprises a long the way. Every minute something new and exciting starts and when it ends, well, a new one starts. Also, some other people come a long the way and make it better and more exciting. I totally love it and have read it more than 20 times. Totaly recomended!

B000001ESP|4.0|1981 was the turning point of music. Depeche Mode, New Order, Blondie, U2, Duran Duran and others topped the music charts with their hit singles that are now up in our attic, gathering dust. Rush, having just released 'Permanent Waves', was just discovering the wonder of synthesizers and reverb pedals! (As seen on Grace Under Pressure!) With their next album, Moving Pictures, they would show that they could fit into the synthpop scene just as well as Duran Duran themselves. <br /> <br />And I believe they did just that. <br /> <br />      The albums first song is, coincidentally, the band's most famous song. No, it's not 'Spirit of the Radio', guess again. If you guessed 'Tom Sawyer', then you're absolutely correct! The song had the right amount of synths to call it synthrock, but they didn't leave out the guitar...the most important part of Rush if you ask me. The song, as I see it, is a harsh attack on 'The Man'...I didn't really get it though, so I just enjoyed the ride through \\"Red Barchetta\\", a song that is described by Geddy in 'Exit Stage Left' as \\"A song about a car.\\" That car must have been one awesome car to get a song this...eighties! Peart's drumming is great on this song... <br /> <br />...but it's not until 'YYZ' that you get to see him at his greatest! I love this song so much, and I don't know why! It's an instrumental...but instruments have never seemed so powerful to me! Yes, I love this more than \\"Tel Aviv\\" and heaps more than \\"Tiger Tiger\\" (YES...I KNOW...). This song is just amazing, especially on 'Exit Stage Left'. <br /> <br /> The rest of the album is a 'love it-hate it' kind of thing. I chose the 'Love It' side, although their are a few minor flaws. 'Limelight' is a great song, but I think the guitar kind of 'overpowers' the bass...as in, I can't hear the bass most of the song. 'The Camera Eye' is a great song too. It's the only epic on this song and starts with the bounciest synths since Oberheim...or maybe it is Oberheim! I have nocomplaints about that one. 'Witch Hunt' is just creepy...too creepy. I love the guitar on this one, but the drums scared the crud out of me when I had the volume on full blast! Following 'Witch Hunt' is the closing song, 'Vital Signs', which has more synths! YAY! \\"Unstable conditions...a symptom of life\\" are the first lines, and great ones too! I like the beatbox on this song. <br /> <br />     Overall, I'd rank Moving Pictures as the second best album that Rush created during their 'Synth' period, topped only by the marvelous 'Signals'. I'd say that Moving Pictures is a must have for any Rush fan, and even if you don't like Rush but appreciate the eighties music, check it out. Who knows, you may like it. <br /> <br />A lot. <br /> <br /> <br />*THUMBS UP FOR MOVING PICTURES.*
0553801503|3.0|Like so many respondants, I've been a big fan of the series, and eagerly awaited Feast for Crows.   Sadly, this book is merely a draft--a very fine draft, but a draft nonetheless, which such an experienced writer as GRRM should have known better not to publish.  (Many writers do just that, though, under the pressures of publication and their own insecurities  - like Jordan - and midway through a series or a very big novel, they stall, backpedal, waste time.)  But in the normal course of writing, it is common to draft, say, 1000 pages for every 100 pages of finished material.  Then, when you're done with the draft, what you do is then step and ask yourself--Now, what's essential and what's not?  Where is the crux of the matter, and what's at stake for the character in such and such a scene?   Most writers find this stage of writing the most difficult and most important, because you often have to throw away whole chapters or even sections you might have spent months of even years on.  As IB Singer said, \\"You have to throw your babies in the trash.'  It's difficult, but is simply has to be done. GRRM certainly did this in his previous three books. And dad he done this for Feast, he would have seen that the bulk of the novel is completely unecessary.  As in the previous three books, he should have gone to the crux of the conflict immediately--a good book will be made up of conflict, then resolution, which in turn yields to a new conflict and new resolution, which in turn yields to another conflict, etc etc.   GRRM doesn't do this.  ALL the things at stake for Brienne -- her conflict/resolution - could have been handled in two chapters at most.  What was at stake?  She was merely looking for Sansa.  Thus really nothing is at stake for her, except in the climactic final two chapters.  Thus, GRRM should have simply gone straight to those chapters, incorporating the search into one of them.  Ditto for Sam.  It really should have started with him in the boat heading south.All the previous chapters were fillers.  In the boat, we could ahve learned via flashback about the babies and the old man.  And by the way the whole thing with the dragons is false suspense because we readers know all abotu the dragons--its' not suspenseful for us at all to watch the different minor characters speculate over and over about dragons adn whether they're real or not.  I could go on and on about the characters, but really, all of them could ahve been greatly condensed.  Cersei, who forms the bulk of the chapters, is hugely boring. She's crazy and cruel. Okay.  Now what?  I'd say 4 chapters at most for her.  A little bit more is at stake for her, because she has her crown and her son, so she has more potential conflicts/resolutions, but certainly not enough in this book to warrant so many chapters! The prophesy abotu ehr seemed tacked on and an afterthought and not really integral to her, but maybe GRRM has plans about that; but ok, don't waste so much time over and over on it, having Cersei ruminate over it constantly! The two final chapters are good.  Also, the detours into Dorne seem tangential and a waste of time; I guess we'll find out if they are.  And so on.  The entire book should have been about 200 max.  GRRM, if you're listening--PLEASE edit your next book!  It's too wonderful and imaginitive a series to ruin.  It's brilliant and has the potential to be the finest fantasy series ever written.  I really hope GRRM gets over his inhibitions and nervousness and just plunges in there and gets to the heart of things, as he did with his previous three books.
1401308201|5.0|In July 2005 I was on an unexpected and whirlwind visit to New York City and happened to buy a copy of the Original Broadway Cast recording of \\"Wicked\\". I came home to Oz (Australia, that is), listened to it a couple of times and fell in love with musical theatre again. <br />Today I received my copy of \\"The Grimmerie\\" in the post and I'm not sure who was more excited - myself or my two small children who have also fallen in love with \\"Wicked\\". The book is amazing for anyone who, like me, may never get to see it on stage (although my fingers are crossed that my time will come). I have read some complaints about what the book does and doesn't include, but I have none. Glancing through it simply makes me want to jump on the next plane to NYC and finally see it for myself. A great souvenir; if you're a Wicked fan you must own it!!!!
B000000OAH|5.0|It allways amazes me that this album didn't sell as well as the others. Like most of the early Queen albums, it has everything: rockers, ballads, weird multi-tracked constructions, ...<br /><br />If you like guitars and rock, two tracks on this album are outstanding: crank up the volume and listen to \\"Fat Bottom Girls\\" and \\"More of That Jazz\\". Awesome.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This album is so amazing. I can't stop playing it. My favorite songs are Future Lover, Jump and Get Together. What are you waiting for ? Get it now !!!!!
B000000OAN|4.0|I rated this release a '4'. Let me explain why:<br /><br />On November 22nd, 2005 Queen released a 30-year anniversary remix CD+DVD that is just amazing. If you are broke and can't afford the new version, fine, buy this one, but if you are a Queen fan, GET THE NEW VERSION.
068987474X|4.0|I was shocked to find that the person I loved was just not that into me.  Maybe it took a few pages of this book to spell out what I had already been thinking.      After reading this book, I realized that it could also strengthen a good relationship.  That may have been the best realization, is figuring out more what I want in a significant other.      Have you seen [...] or the guys from The View TV Show (you know Bonaduce, Clark, and Lopez)?  This book reminds me of their brutal honesty about what men really think.     I would recommend this book because it's good hearted and makes a lot of sense.  Are you curious about your relationship?  Want to know more about what he's thinking?  If you have questions, this book might shed some light!
B00005JMJG|5.0|I know that I might not be in the majority on this one, but I have to say that this is one of my top five movie favorites of all time.<br /><br />I loved this movie. I loved the idea of this movie, the acting in this movie, the way that both of those were framed and offered to the viewer. I love that this movie starts at the end and ends at the start. I love the visuals of this movie, the little details that you might not notice the first time around. I love that the books disappear when Joel tells Clementine 'bye' in her bookstore towards the end. I love the little loops that this movie makes, the twists and ties of things that seem so innocent, but that end up turning back and consuming themselves.<br /><br />Most of all, I love that this movie takes careful aim at the condition of being human and gives us all a second chance. I love that the writer decided to give Love itself an encore, a curtain call, a way to come back and make sure to make it work the second time. I love that this movie takes away all our hope, then gives back the seed of something new, something better.<br /><br />Aside from the raving lunacy I just put down...this movie is good. It offers us a possibility: erasing unwanted memories through science. It then takes that (non)existant science and asks questions about it, about the implications of it, about what our memories mean to us. Are memories something we should tamper with? Would we want to? What is the price of a memory? This is nothing new to movies, and there are other movies that deal with real world science, such as cloning, but I would argue that this one is more touching and close to home. This is something that could happen to any of us; not just through science either. With things like alzheimers and the like, the threat of losing our memories of ourselves and others is a real one. This is a movie to take an idea and really make you think about it. This is a movie that will make you cherish what fond memories you already might have.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is a must see.<br /><br />-LPght have. <br /> <br />Bottom line: this is a must see. <br /> <br />-LP
B000001EGE|3.0|Yeah, EJ's a great pianist. Whenever I hear this, it makes me wish that I had stuck with piano for more than six months. Oh well, onto the review.<br /><br />Honky Cat: 7.5/10. It could have been better, but there's too much electric piano (I hate electric pianos for the most part) and Elton's falsetto hurts my ears. But it is catchy, and clever.<br /><br />Mellow: 7/10. Would get more points if it weren't for the grinding fake organ. Generally I like organs, but this is an exceptions.<br /><br />I Think I'm Going to Kill Myself: 3/10. That's great for you.<br /><br />Suzie (Dramas): 5/10. Aaack! Not more filler!<br /><br />Rocket Man: 9.5/10. This is a great song. HOWEVER, I have to knock points off because of its title. \\"Rocket Man\\" sounds like something you'd call astronauts if you were in first grade. The dumb psychadelic sounds don't help much, either.<br /><br />Salvation: 5.5/10. Let the string of filler begin!<br /><br />Slave: 5/10. It continues...<br /><br />Amy: 4.5/10...and continues some more.<br /><br />Mona Lisas And Mad Hatters: 10/10. The album's best tune by a whole lot, very mature with good piano playing and acoustic guitar in the background. I also like how Bernie Taupin cleverly combined the first and second verses for the third.<br /><br />Hercules: 7.5/10. Good, clean fun. A nice way to end the album.<br /><br />Average: 6.45. Not a bad record. I'd reccomend it, all because Mona Lisas and Hercules aren't available on many EJ comps.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|I have bought some Mariah's cd's through the years and this year I bought the original release of \\"THE EMANCIPATION OF MIMI\\" because I found the first single \\"IT'S LIKE THAT\\" very good, but I never played the whole cd. Later I heard \\"WE BELONG TOGETHER\\" and found it even better than the first one. That song has been a very, very big hit reaching #1 for 13 or 14 weeks on Billboard's Hot 100. With that success plus the third single \\"SHAKE IT OFF\\" that peaked at #2, came this re-release of \\"THE EMANCIPATION OF MIMI\\" and that's when I started to listen to the whole cd. <br />With this new package you get a DVD with four videos (\\"IT'S LIKE THAT\\", \\"WE BELONG TOGETHER\\", \\"SHAKE IT OFF\\" and \\"GET YOUR NUMBER\\", which was released only in EU). The DVD also gives access through internet to the video of the video \\"DON'T FORGET ABOUT US\\" and never before seen interview of Mariah (I've only seen the 4 videos). I think that to have access to these features through internet is ridiculous but...  <br />The requirements that new need for these are:  <br />1. A computer with a DVD drive and internet access. <br />2. Windows 98SE or higher with Internet Explorer 5.5 or higher  <br />   or Mac OSX with Safari and Internet Explorer for Mac 5.0 or  <br />   higher. <br />3. Windows Media Player 7.0 or higher. <br />The cd features the same songs of the original version plus 3 brand new songs, including the heartfelt new single \\"DON'T FORGET ABOUT US\\" plus a remix of \\"WE BELONG TOGETHER\\" featuring Jadakiss and Styles P. Personally I like more the original version but the remix is not bad. <br />If you don't have the album, I really recommend it if you like Mariah or her style. Try the songs, besides the mentioned singles. \\"SAY SOMETHIN'\\" feat. Snoop Dogg, \\"MINE AGAIN\\", \\"CIRCLES\\", \\"TO THE FLOOR\\" feat. Nelly and \\"FLY LIKE A BIRD\\" and \\"ONE AND ONLY\\" feat. Twista. The whole album is good actually but I think that these are the highlights.  <br />
0553801503|4.0|Feast for Crows is a good book.  It's not as lavish or action-packed as its predecessors, but it's not supposed to be - the name is a clear indication of the purpose of this collection.  Many more minor (at least at the moment) characters are to be found here, vying with one another for scraps left by the fallout of the huge battles and manuvers we enjoyed in the previous novels.  Martin hasn't lost any of his narrative skills, and I continue to keep the faith with his ability to control the pace of the plot - after all, anyone willing to kill off main characters with the speed and perhaps even glee that he does shouldn't have too hard a time chopping off some of the dozens of open plotlines as they get too unwieldy.<br /><br />The real flaws in the novel are tied to the odd publishing tactic of only involving maybe half (or less) of the characters who had their own storylines in the prior novels.  Simply put, most of the characters included in Feast for Crows suck.  It's a matter of taste, but if you don't really like Cersei, Sansa, Jaime (who was cool once, but is useless now that he lost his hand), Brienne, or Sam (wha?) you are basically SOL.  Worse, Arya (one of my favorites) is in this book but only gets about 3 chapters which are well-written but involve almost no action, meaning she'll be nowhere to be seen in the next novel either.  Depressing indeed.  If you take Feast for Crows like it is:  a novel about the scattered leavings of war squabbled over by largely a group of secondary characters, you'll probably enjoy it in that limited scope.  Yes, we did wait years and years for a novel that is largely a placeholder while the main characters take a breather, but what can you do.<br /><br />A few other comments:<br /><br />-- I don't think the editing was bad in this book; Martin does repeat himself more than a few times (discussions of Pycelle's missing beard, endless references to the uselessness of nipples on a breastplate, etc.) but it's more of his typical tactic of having different characters ponder mutual events rather than just accidental repetition.<br /><br />-- Martin's weird fascination with rape is in full bloom here, with pretty much every female character major or minor either raped or threatened with it.  I can't decide if this adds to the realism of a medieval world or is just creepy.  Probably both.<br /><br />All in all, a Feast for Crows is better than most of the other literary fare out there, even if it spends most of its time dealing with characters that we previously thought just hung around to give the real characters someone to interact with.  Expect lots of politicizing, a little bit of magic, and no real fighting and you'll be on target.typical tactic of having different characters ponder mutual events rather than just accidental repetition. <br /> <br />-- Martin's weird fascination with rape is in full bloom here, with pretty much every female character major or minor either raped or threatened with it.

B000B8QEYC|5.0|IF I COULD BE WHERE YOU ARE <br /> <br />If you have ever lost someone and if you can appreciate an angelic voice, then this album is worth it for this song alone, the entire album is very good, its not enya's best, that title belongs to Shepard moons, but this is still a very good album. IF I COULD BE WHERE YOU ARE might very well be her best ballad ever, hard to say, but I fell in love with it. I am nearly afraid to share it with some friends of mine who would never otherwise hear it. The song will make you want to break down, if you have a soul. Music that has that sort of impact on people is powerful, and should be cherished, as should this album.
B000AY3KN0|5.0|These DVDs were obviously made with the best of care.  The contents are spectacular and you won't be disappointed.  It's amazing that over 70 years later that this still holds up to anything made today.  After watching the special features you'll know what I mean. For what went into making this movie it can certainly be considered the best movie of all time.
B000BGH22W|1.0|This soundtrack pales in comparison to the previous soundtracks composed by Williams. While not a bad work, it is not the same caliber as the masterful scores of the previous movies, Prisoner of Azkaban in particular. I personally am very disappointed in the choice to switch composers.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|THIS CD IS GREAT!! I LIKED ALL THE SONGS EXCEPT FOR \\"PUSH\\", I TAKE IT EVERYWHERE AND IN ALL FORMATS: CD, MP3, RINGTONE, THIS IS ONE OF HER BEST WORK AND AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF WHAT THE QUEEN OF POP IS CAPABLE OF, BEING ALWAYS #1, AND GIVING HER BEST IN ALL SHE DOES.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|1. The singing is a bit slow at the beginning, but it eventually works up to a very beautiful, meaningful song. 4/5 <br /> <br />2.This song annoyed me so badly, I don't even know why it's on the disk. 1/5 <br /> <br />3. Starts out slow, but Menzel's crystal clear vocals shine through in the end. 5/5 <br /> <br />4. Very entertaining to listen to, but also right on with the musicality. 5/5 <br /> <br />5. Throwing in the hint of foreboding saved this song from total boredom. 3/5 <br /> <br />6. A very LONG song, but well worth listening to. 5/5 <br /> <br />7. The music is good, but it's gets slightly repetitive and annoying. 3/5 <br /> <br />8. So sweet and saddening. Menzel reaches out to the teen girl's heart. 5/5 <br /> <br />9. Very well played and sung. 4/5 <br /> <br />10. Let's just say I'm very glad this song is short. 1/5 <br /> <br />11. Probably my favorite song on the entire cd. It starts out small and angry, then builds into one of the greatest climaxes I've ever heard. 5/5 <br /> <br />12. I'm on the fence about this one. It's good music-wise, but gets kind of boring. 3/5 <br /> <br />13. This song needs to be there to tell the background story, but I really wish it wasn't. 1/5 <br /> <br />14. Sweet and to the point. 4/5 <br /> <br />15. Every good musical needs seduction, and this song brings it all to the table. 5/5 <br /> <br />16. One of the best songs on the CD. Menzel's soaring vocals match the pounding music perfectly.  <br />17. Good music-wise, but not very entertaining to hear. 3/5 <br /> <br />18. A BEAUTIFUL song, that's well worthy of the number of graduations it's been sung at. 5/5 <br /> <br />19. A good combination of the songs, but kind of an odd way to end a musical. 4/5

B0007GAERG|5.0|I'm glad to see Mariah is back and actually singing again! I'm not going to stoop to the childish actions of the delusional Madonna fans who won't come to grips with the fact that Madonna can't sing. If you like banal dance music so be it. But leave Mariah alone. This album is by far her best album. The music is diverse and is very R&B heavy and she has kept the collaborations with rappers to a minimum which is great. Basically I like every song on the album and I can't say that about her previous albums. Its good to see her back and claim her spot as the most successful female singer! IF YOU'RE NOT A MARIAH FAN AND CHOSE TO BASH HER ON THIS SITE, ITS BECAUSE YOU ARE A LOW CLASS, CHILDISH, JEALOUS, HATER WHO SIMPLY DOESN'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO GO AFTER YOUR OWN DREAMS! GET A LIFE PEOPLE!
B000BJS4SU|4.0|Big fans of Mayer would have already known this transition of music genre was going to happen. I for one, am very pleased with the new John Mayer, and think this album is great. I always enjoy reading reviews that go over every song, so I'll do the same for this. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />1. Who Did You Think I Was  3.5/5 <br />Wish he wasn't promoting his album with this song even if it does explain his new self.  The song's a bit weak + short,don't like the chorus or lyrics, but strong guitar playing/drums.  I guess it helps get rid of his old sensitive \\"your body is a wonderland\\" vibe. <br /> <br />2. Good Love Is On the Way  5/5 <br />Great Song. Wonderful melody. John's voice is perfect for the song. <br /> <br />3. Wait Until Tomorrow  3/5 <br />Great guitar playing. Singing could be better. <br /> <br />4. Gravity  4/5 <br />Great slow song. Nice lyrics. Mayer's voice sounds best here. <br /> <br />5. Vultures  4.5/5 <br />This would be an excellent song if it weren't for Mayer's voice. I must admit, it's pretty excruciating when he goes for the high notes.  Even though, it's very catchy w/great melody and guitar playing. <br /> <br />6. Out Of My Mind  <br />Don't really remember this song. think it was pretty much all guitar. <br /> <br />7. Another Kind Of Green  5/5 <br />My favorite song from the album.  Fantastic lyrics.  Everything's perfect, from the voice to the guitar + drums. <br /> <br />8. I Got A Woman  4/5 <br />Great cover. <br /> <br />9. Something's Missing  4/5 <br />One of my favorite John Mayer songs.  Not as great live. <br /> <br />10. Daughters  3/5 <br />Always thought the lyrics were a bit naive, great melody though. In this album, this song seems to be the only one mayer didn't really put much feeling toward. almost sounds like he's bored. <br /> <br />11. Try  4/5 <br />Great song to end with. lots of energy. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Overall, the album is great.  The one thing I was suprised with was the sound quality.  Everything sounds very clear and you don't hear the annoying little girl screams like in Any Given Thursday.  It might be due to the fact that for most of the fans there, it was the first time they ever heard these songs. <br /> <br />What's also evident in this cd, is John's improved and impressive guitar playing.  If he keeps it up, he just might be the next jimi hendrix, eric clapton or stevie ray vaughn.
B000BP86OG|5.0|I'm 35. I spent years 10-thru-20 growing up in the 80s. When The Darkness' released \\"Permission To Land\\" in 2003, I listened to it over and over again, at 33 remembering how fun music used to be when I was 13. Now, on the day of their new release \\"One Way Ticket To Hell\\", I'm doing it all over again. I see no reason for issuing my critical opinion on each of the 10 tracks here. Would you really care anyway? After all, anyone reading this either loves The Darkness already, or denies that they do while secretely worshipping them. \\"One Way Ticket\\" is a lot like a concept album in that it's consistently fun to listen to. The concept is \\"fun\\". So buy it and have fun.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Love it, love it, love it! it's a damn shame what happened to this show, but at least there's this DVD collection. Serenity will also be out on DVD soon, too--thank goodness. Both these things almost make up for one of the best shows on TV being unceremoniously cancelled--almost.
B0002Z0EYA|5.0|I still can't believe this movie didn't get a single Oscar. It outclassed the winners in every aspect.<br /><br />This movie is an epic in every way. The scope, the historical value, the preservation of a timeless classic. There is an amazing scene in which one thousand Greek ships appear upon the horizon and seem to fill the sea. Believe me, if you have not yet had the pleasure of seeing Troy, it is worth it for this scene alone.<br /><br />Beyond that, the costumes are incredible. Seldom will you see so many extras wearing so much authentic armor in a film. It must have cost a fortune for the armor alone. The battles are incredible and extremely realistic.<br /><br />Brad Pitt does an amazing job playing the role of Achilles. His appearance, attitude, and fighting spirit are the epidome of the perfect warrior. His every move in battle is like a work of art. No energy is wasted and nearly every stroke hits its target.<br /><br />The fight between Pitt and Bana is awesome. I found myself moving side-to-side in the theatre, as if I were dodging sword strikes.<br /><br />If anything is dissapointing about this film, it is the tragic outcome, which is already written into the over one-thousand year old story. They don't call them \\"Greek tragedies\\" for nothing. I think the many one and two star reviews are unfair. Everyone I know who has seen this movie has loved it. You will too.
B00082IJ08|4.0|The single, Feel Good Inc, was outstanding, so I decided to purchase this CD. I really disliked the CD at first, (it's nothing like the hit single,) but on a second listen, I discovered a few tracks I liked. On a 3rd listen, I found most of this CD to be great. The CD just kinda grows on you. You probably won't like the CD on a first listen, but give it some time, and you'll discover a great CD. There are a couple of filler tracks, such as songs like Last Living Souls, (which has no hook whatsoever,) Every Planet We Reach Is Dead, (which is just dull, and turns into a bunch of annoying static noise at the end). Except for those tracks, (and a couple of other unmemorable ones,) this CD is great, and some of these tracks are excellent. The last 3 tracks seem to be telling a story, and are basically linked together, ending the CD on a very good note. Definitely a great, innovative CD, and probably not what you are expecting. (A couple more songs similar in style to Feel Good Inc. wouldn't have hurt, though.) Demon Days doesn't get the 5 stars because of a couple of annoying and filler tracks. Most songs on this CD, though, are completely worth listening to. You may not like it on your first listen, but give it a chance. These songs just don't let go.  <br />
B000B8QF14|5.0|What a spectacular performance in Great Britian to more than 60,000 people....... WOW. The visuals are great the sound is fantastic. The crowd just eats these boys up. Billie Joe puts on a stellar performance as with the rest of the band and back-up musicians. Most DVDs from groups these days have been showing interviews along with live concert footage. I guess that has been the trend for sometime and it really doesn't bother me that you can't split up the two on this DVD. This feature DOES NOT TAKE AWAY FROM THE PERFORMANCE. Don't want to see the band talking just skip ahead.....that's what I do.
B000002LCK|4.0|I was disappointed to find that a lot of the songs on Substance sounded pretty dated to me (I'm sure this isn't a problem for longtime fans). \\"Singles\\" contains more recent material and different versions of older songs that I prefer over the ones on Substance (Ceremony, Bizarre Love Triangle, the original version of Temptation). Note about Substance: \\"Mesh\\" is a typo, track 3 on disk 2 is actually \\"Cries & Whispers\\".
B0009RCPY8|5.0|Goes without saying:\\"Ghostbusters\\" is a comedy classic of the finest order for the supernatural/slime obsessed person in us all.It has that element that alot of movies like this tend to lack in today like-pure movie escapism.And the theme is the movie theme to END all movie themes to me-the ultra funky Ray Parker Jr hitting his serious paydirt at last!The cast is like a roll call of classic 80's comedians (missing only Eddie Murphy to make a complete picture) and they all shine their best,especially Bill Murrey as he haplessly begins falling for the lovely but haunted Dana (Sigonour Weaver)even as she is possessed by the freaky Zule,the gatekeeper.Almost know every line-Annie Potts is also hilerous!<br /><br />  I've never seen part two until this point and I must say it was right up there with the first.And I generally don't like sequals.But more slime was added and Dana now gets a baby who's to be kidnapped by a tyranical painting come to life.In fact the second movie may be more pure comedy then the original.The orginal had a few genuine horror movie elements-the second is a little more like an early version of 'Scarry Movie'.Somehow horror and comedy end up being a great mixture no matter how you cut it or (I can't resist) who your gonna call!
0553801503|2.0|George RR Martin claims that the format of AFFC is due to his desire to tell \\"all the story\\" for half of the characters rather than \\"half the story\\" for all of the characters. <br /> <br />If he honestly believes this, he's deluding himself. AFFC isn't \\"all the story\\" for half the characters by any stretch of the imagination. It's a tiny fraction of the story for half the characters - along with bits and pieces of story for a host of thinly fleshed out minor characters.  <br /> <br />Martin has broken with the format he has used for his three previous Ice and Fire books, which was telling the story through the points of view of several main characters. The format of the three previous books served to 1) give his main characters fully fleshed out personalities and 2) preserve a certain tightness and momentum to the plot. <br /> <br />In AFFC, suddenly Martin gives minor background characters point of view chapters. One of these characters has a couple of chapters devoted to her, but most have just one. As a result, AFFC has a rambling, disjointed, unfocused quality that the previous Ice and Fire books avoided. Since the reader is stepping into and out of the lives of these minor characters for just one chapter apiece, it is very hard for the reader to care about the characters' histories, or eventual fates. In short, much of AFFC feels like a collection of short stories that happen to take place in Westeros at the same time in its history, rather than a singular, cohesive novel. The point of view chapters for the minor characters are passable at best, tedious at worst. <br /> <br />Sadly, the chapters for the major characters do not fare much better. Cersei and Brienne are new point of view characters, and both are overly burdened with the responsibility of carrying AFFC on their one-dimensional shoulders. They just don't have much personality to them. I find the other main characters more interesting, but sadly they just don't have much to do in this book. Arya is my favorite character, and I thought that since she was in AFFC I would definitely enjoy it, but her chapters are few and far between. There are no real surprises. It's been said in other reviews, and it's true: not much happens. This is a book that feels like nothing but filler.  <br /> <br />Martin says that if we don't like the format, we can take a knife to it and combine it with the next book when it's published. I'm inclined to take him up on it, and in the process edit out a good 75% of this book, and hope that A Dance With Dragons has more of what made the first three books so engaging.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|First, a technical issue:<br /><br />Another reviewer was incorrect. This release DOES NOT contain the Sony DRM/rootkit software. Don't take my word for it, look at Sony's official list:<br /><br />Amazon doesn't like URL's but you can Google \\"Sony DRM albums\\" and find many resources...icluding Sony's own...that list the offending albums. This one is not one of them.<br /><br />Now:<br /><br />I am fortunate enough to have grown up on the Jersey shore, and knew who Bruce Springsteen was before 1975. I've followed his growth since then, and have seen him in a number of his tours over the year. I'm an unabashed, unapologetic fan, and he is the only artist of whom I own every title in their discography.<br /><br />So do this: watch the \\"Making of Born to Run\\" DVD first, and then listen to BTR again. In the car --where this album was meant to be played-- or by yourself. The eight songs on this album are damned near each one a home run.  Collectively they are an amazing piece of American music making that have stood the test of time.<br /><br />Then watch the Hammersmith concert video. And if you've been a fan for as long as I have, you'll certainly wonder where the last 30 years when and why Bruce and the band look so old:-)<br /><br />Just a fine piece of Springsteen and E Street history. You won't be sorry.
B000068CNY|5.0|... in my top 3 seasons of often beloved,sometimes hated but undoubtely one of the most influential tv series in 90's, Friends. There is also no weak episode in the whole bunch and those two which I consider the weakest (TOW Phoebe's Husband and TOW Five Steaks, An Eggplant) are still above average. Also this is the season where all main characters had given some kind of story arc which helped a lot in fleshing them out. We got here official start of Ross' and Rachel's relationship on one hand and Joey's and Chandler's friendship on the another, also Monica found her dream guy (one of the most appropriate recurring guest star Tom Selleck) and finally Phoebe started to look for her father during the second year. Of course, aside of this there were many other plots, main or side, which kept whole run fresh and unpredictable. Also this is the season full of guest stars which I personally don't mind excluding van Damme's cameo which I find quite embarrassing. On the opposite side stands Brooke Shields and particularly Adam Goldberg whose performance was hilarious. But the real reason why I found this year the best is that all episodes are filled with great gags, one liners, funny situations which are going hand in hand with storylines therefore are not purposeless, there is even some space for tears but never in the way you would say you're watching soap opera with laughs (that was my problem with some episodes in later seasons). So we got here more lively characters, precise scripts, really a big amount of great laughs and above all fresh main cast having fun being a part of it. All six were really enjoying portraying their characters and you'll know it. For me this is the hardest season to choose favourite eps from but those should probably be TOW Breast Milk (great western films send offs),TOW List (emotional and funny in the same time),TOW Prom Video (obvious choice, one of the most famous eps of riends ever, home video sequence and the execution of the result is perfect), TO After the Superbowl part 1 (Brooke Shields outdid herself also Marcel the monkey returns) and to round it up to five I choose TOW Dr. Ramoray Dies (Adam Goldberg is funny as hell in this one, Tom Selleck vs. David Schwimmer are great as is Dr. Ramoray's departure). I can't really say which season is the second best and which the third but because of all above I'm pretty sure I like this one the most. Nothing's perfect but this one's really close. 100 percent recommended!
B00003CXAW|5.0|This movie is totally astounding. A giant ape named King Kong, who rules Skull Island in the Indian Ocean is captured by a group of explorers and taken to New York (influence from 1925's \\"The Lost World\\"). He hates being in captivity and escapes, causing destruction and panic throughout the city. Kidnapping helpless Fay Wray, he battles mankind on top of the Empire State Building. There has been no film version of King Kong that has been this good. Few people still alive today got to see it in theaters. I wish I was alive then (without the Great Depression).

B0002B15WE|5.0|This really is a terrific action movie.  It's not perfect; I concur with another reviewer here who noted that in order to make the hero, John McClane, seem more heroic, they made the LAPD (except for Sgt. Powell) and the FBI look like hyper-aggressive morons, and it wasn't really necessary, as they could have been portrayed as competent law enforcement officers who just got outwitted by an adversary who did his homework and read their anti-terrorist playbook ahead of time, and so anticipated their every move.  A minor quibble is McClane's carrying a loaded gun on a commercial airliner.  I've been a cop for the last five years, and a detective for almost the last two, and I can tell you that unless you are on official business for your department, such as prisoner transport, for example, you are NOT going to be allowed to carry a gun aboard a passenger jet, badge or no badge.  In fact, until the passage of the National Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act in July of 2004, a cop had no more legal right to carry a gun in another state than any ordinary citizen did.  But this is the kind of detail most people probably wouldn't notice, and the writer was obliged to arm Officer McClane somehow in order to make it plausible for him to survive his first encounter with one of the terrorist hostage takers.  The rest of the movie is top notch, the action is gripping, the movie is fast paced and exciting, the actors are perfectly cast, and the hero, being human and vulnerable, was a refreshing change from the invincible quasi-superheroes that dominated action films in the years before \\"Die Hard\\" hit the theaters.<br /><br />Most people have probably never read the book this movie was based on, Roderick Thorpe's \\"Nothing Lasts Forever\\".  And most are probably also unaware that that book was a sequel to a novel called \\"The Detective\\", which was made into a film of the same name starring Frank Sinatra in 1968.  The hero's name in both novels, and in the Sinatra film, was Joe Leland.  I guess that didn't sound macho enough for the writers or the director.  There were a lot of other changes from the book as well.  Leland is a retired cop, and about twenty years older than McClane.  He's now a pretty highly regarded security and anti-terrorist consultant -- which makes it more plausible and realistic for him to have a gun, but the movie makers probably changed this not only to make McClane younger, but to make him more of an \\"everyman\\" than a highly trained anti-terrorism specialist would have been.  Given the superhero characters like Rambo so prevalent up to that time, this may have been a very wise decision for broadening the movie's appeal.  Leland comes to visit his daughter, not his wife (whom he divorced, and she later died) at Klaxon Oil's skyscraper in Los Angeles.  Unlike the movie which cut to scenes focused on both the terrorists and the hostages, as well as the LAPD and FBI outside, the book only follows Leland, so unless he's spying on the bad guys or fighting them, we don't know what they're doing at any given moment.  Also, whereas in the movie, the terrorists are actually just using terrorism as cover for a robbery, in the book, they really are terrorists with a political agenda.  Klaxon Oil is involved in corrupt dealings with the miltary junta ruling Chile.  Leland's daughter may, it turns out, be willingly involved in these corrupt dealings (at least Leland believes she is), and she gets her comeupance too.  Where McClane's wife was rescued, Leland's daughter goes out the window with the head terrorist (who is called Anton \\"Red Tony\\" Grueber, instead of Hans Grueber).<br /><br />But a surprising amount of the book made it into the film.  Most of the action sequences, from throwing a dead terrorist out the window to attract the attention of the police, to dropping a C4 laden chair down an elevator shaft, to taping a gun to his back for the final showdown were taken from the book.  So are many others.  Most of the characters from the book made it to the movie in at least very similar form to their book prototypes: good guy Al Powell, bureaucratic stuffed shirt Dwayne T. Robinson, savage Karl and his brother whom the hero kills, and even the slimy Ellis.<br /><br />Some things, however, are very different.  McClane is far more of a wiseass than Leland.  Klaxon Oil is changed to the Nakatomi Corporation in the movie.  As I've read elsewhere, this was probably done to reflect the concerns about Japanese companies buying out American ones that were really a big issue in the '80s, but the ironic result of this is that the 1979 book is less dated than the 1988 movie.  The Japanese economy is simply no longer the alarming juggernaut it appeared to be in the 1980s, and those concerns have faded into history, but \\"big oil\\" is as much of an ogre to many as it ever was.  The overall tone of the movie is much lighter.  Not only does McClane's wife not do a two-and-a-half gainer out of a high rise window the way Leland's daughter does, but the issues are a lot more black and white.  The movie terrorists (who are not really terrorists) are unadulterated bad guys.  The book's terrorists (who really are terrorists) have a legitimate reason to hate Klaxon Oil, and it's a reason that even Leland agrees with. However, as they are ruthless terrorists, they are still the enemy.  But it's interesting to note that Leland himself, after he kills the terrorists, fulfills their goal of throwing Klaxon's bonds, documents and money out the windows to the people below.  He does it because he regards Klaxon's corruption as the ultimate cause of his daughter's death.  In the book, of course, the terrorists have no such selfless aims.  And while some might decry this as Hollywood wimping out yet again and compromising the artistic intergrity of a film by caving in to public desire for happy endings, I personally regard this as an actual improvement over the book.  After all, there are any number of movies featuring terrorists as villains.  I think it was brilliant to portray thieves masquerading as terrorists in order to carry out their plan.  Think about it.  What better cover could there be in this day and age of terrorism for such a high profile and high stakes heist?  It's fiendishly clever when you think of it, and would cause the authorities to approach the entire incident from the wrong direction entirely.  Everything that they would thus be trying to anticipate would be wrong, and almost their every move thus miscalculated.  I think that was a great story idea, and it's part of what makes this movie so entertaining.  Action movies are all too often mindless, overladen with special effects, and formulaic.  This one was innovative and clever, balanced effects with great acting by a great cast, and remains as exciting and entertaining to watch now as it was nearly twenty years ago.s from the book made it to the movie in at least very similar form to their book prototypes: good guy Al Powell, bureaucratic stuffed shirt Dwayne T.

B000AGTPUU|2.0|I really didn't like this movie.  I wish I didn't buy it because I doubt if I will ever watch it again.  The movie seemed long and boring.  Almost an hour on the train seemed like forever.  There are better films out there.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|Back in the late sixties and early seventies Robert McNamara was a much hated man since it was widely believed that he was the architect of the buildup in Vietnam and therefore personally responsible for one of our country's most disastrous military engagements.  After all, he was Secretary of Defense under both Kennedy and Johnson.<br /><br />But there's a limit to what one man can do no matter how high his office, and that is especially true in a democracy with governmental checks and balances.  Moreover, according to the spin of this brilliant documentary by Errol Morris (director of the almost equally brilliant The Thin Blue Line 1988), it was really President Lyndon Baines Johnson who insisted on the buildup and slowly, like somebody inching his way blindly into a quagmire, get stuck in a trap of his own making.  Still McNamara, Boy Wonder, now a man in his prime, originally chosen by the ill-fated JFK to be Secretary of Defense, has some serious culpability, even though he is on record as telling President Kennedy in 1963 that we ought to get out.  By the way, being offered the job by JFK was an offer he couldn't refuse, even though he protested that he wasn't qualified.  JFK knew better.  Errol Morris shows this point cleverly by having McNamara say he hadn't yet agreed to take the job as he stood by JFK even as the President publically announced that McNamara was the new Secretary of Defense.<br /><br />Here then is Morris's technique: Robert McNamara, who at the time this film was made was 85-years-old, long in tooth and watery eyed, yet full of an acute sense of history and of his place in it, was put on camera as he was being interviewed.  Again and again the camera holds tight and close on his face and we can see that face asking for understanding, as an overwhelmed parent might ask of his children.  Meanwhile, juxtaposed between shots of the man were scenes from his past, B-29s taking off and dropping bombs on Japanese cities, and then jets from the Vietnam era firing rockets and tracers at targets on the ground, bombs falling, falling, falling, and bursting and bodies lying in the rubble.<br /><br />McNamara would explain.  He would justify himself.  Or he would offer no excuses.  There is the fog of war, he said, and the Vietnam War was enormously complex not just from a military point of view, but from a political and global perspective.  And there was always Lyndon Johnson who could never be persuaded to get out of the bog even as the slime rose to his waist and then to his neck.  Incidentally, as far as I can tell the phrase, \\"the fog of war\\" is a paraphrase of something Karl von Clausewitz wrote in his famous treatise On War (1833).<br /><br />Included in the voice-overs are recordings made in the Oval Office that were not available to reporters until recent years.  Listening to them, I was struck again and again at the Machiavellian personality of President Johnson as revealed in the verbatim tapes, and at the Iago-like influence of Robert McNamara at his side--Iago in the sense that he whispered in the President's ear, and in the fact that they shared confidences they did not share with others.  But Johnson was no easily-led Othello.  Instead, Johnson was his own man, a stubborn man, and while he listened eagerly to McNamara, in the final analysis he went his own way down, down into the quagmire.<br /><br />This is also in a sense a biography of the public Robert McNamara.  He talks about his childhood and his days as an undergraduate at Berkeley.  There is a shot of him as a young man at the stove of an apartment with his young wife.  There is his experience in World War II analyzing bombing effectiveness under General Curtis E. LeMay (who doesn't look good here), and then his phenomenal run at Ford Motor Company where he turned a floundering auto maker into a leader of the industry.  There is also his remembrance of the Cuban missile crisis in which he makes it clear that we were--holding his finger andthumb less than an inch apart--\\"this close\\" to nuclear war.<br /><br />McNamara comes off as enormously hard-working, brilliant yes, but with the modesty that comes from hard experience.  He seems confident that he did the best he could in a job that required everything he had.  He allows that he made mistakes and he reminds us that people in high places who make mistakes make mistakes that can have horrific consequences.  He now assures us that he knows war is the wrong way if it can be avoided since in the fog of war we all lose our way.  I would add that the logic of war always takes over and has its way with us, regardless of intention.  Once the dogs of war are let loose, they run and run and run until they are exhausted.  And only then do they come home.<br /><br />In addition to being an extremely informative and revealing portrait of one of our most controversial secretaries of defense, this is also a marvelous artistic achievement, a film carefully collaged, and sharply edited employing all sorts of archived media with a haunting score by Philip Glass.  Of course it doesn't tell us the whole story or anything close to the whole story, and certainly were Lyndon Johnson and Curtis LeMay alive today, they might very well tell it differently.<br /><br />What I liked most about McNamara here is his willingness to be mostly candid and not only admit errors, but to reveal some of the very human processes by which monumental decisions of state are made.  We can thank him for appearing in front of the camera and exposing himself so boldly for all the world to see.<br /><br />The Fog of War won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 2003.se\\" to nuclear war.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|I cannot stop playing this album.  It is one of the best things Madonna has done.  Very retro and very fresh at the same time.  The songs are all blended together like one continuous trippy track and yet they are all very distinct.  In these cuts you will here hints of the Jacksons, Tom Tom Club, Pet Shop Boys, Giorgio Moroder, Abba, Lime, Alice DeJay - but just hints as the songs are all distinctly themselves.  Great sonic fun!

B0001DI0FI|4.0|There is absolutely no way that a film can capture Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin Novels. I'm not sure any video medium could, but Peter Weir came as close as anyone could. Many of the best parts of the books are included, the visual effects and the sound design are superb. The acting is also very good. Russell Crowe, while not as tall and fat as Jack Aubrey in the books brings in a creditable performance. Paul Bettany, while not as ugly, short or irascible as Stephen Maturin in the books also does well. <br /> <br />The Surprises were well cast and costumed - a truly 18th century looking group that made the ship under Lucky Jack's command seem like the Surprise of the books.  <br /> <br />The things I missed the most in this film were Maturin's \\"other\\" activities, and it would have been interesting to see Jack ashore in contrast to Jack at sea. Two very different people.  <br /> <br />Again, Peter Weir did a good job of making compromises to bring the books to life and on this DVD's bonus features he explains some of the thinking behind it and addresses some of the hardcore POB fans' concerns rather well. <br /> <br />Perhaps a long miniseries on TV in the vein of Masterpiece Theatre might be more appropriate to bring this set of books to life. Perhaps not. In any event, if you like this movie, and have not read the books, You should consider doing so.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|Seems that hardcore blues fans are having a problem with this album.  Trouble is, this isn't and never was advertised as hard core blues.  Get over it guys, if a Stevie Ray Vaughan clone is what you are looking for, there is always Kenny Wayne Shepherd trying to immitate SRV in every way.  John is original.  Period.  Lyrically, he's better than 99% of blues writers out there.  Anyone questioning his guitar playing has never seen him live on stage with Clapton, Guy, Vaughan, B.B. King and other greats where although still learning, can hold his own. The guy has a ridiculous talent.  This album is rock/pop with a blues undertone, not straight blues.  He's not trying to be anyone but himself, which many fans are having trouble with because they WANT him to bring back SRV from the dead when he's doing his own thing.  Sorry guys.  Expand your horizons, pop in the CD, and pay attention to the great things it has to offer - including excellent vocals, unique guitar melodies, and a very good LIVE sound.  Keep it up John, go with what you love, and REAL music fans will be there to listen.
B000B7BRMM|5.0|Ho ho ho, what do you know... the two \\"it girls\\" of vocal jazz both released holiday CDs this year within days of each other... first it was Jane Monheit with the ambiguously titled \\"The Season\\"... then came Diana Krall's aptly named \\"Christmas Songs.\\" So who emerges victorious in this battle of the Christmas jazz divas?     The first thing to consider, of course: who has the most gratuitous glamour shot on the album cover? Diana's suggestive and/or very uncomfortable pose in some kind of lawn chair wearing a billowy shiny green dress (strategically revealing as much leg as possible) is a real contender... but Jane's heavily airbrushed/photoshopped snow bunny/nymphette get-up (complete with floating bubbles for no apparent reason) is the clear winner in this category.    On to the tunes... what does Ms. Krall have in store for us? No videos, for starters (unlike Jane's ill-advised \\"DualDisc\\" attempts) ... in fact, Diana's no frills approach pays off here with a surefire holiday hit parade backed by no-nonsense solid swinging arrangements performed by the Clayton/Hamilton Jazz Orchestra. Most tunes are of the light and fun variety, and the ballads are sentimental without being maudlin. The only \\"surprising\\" selections are the always welcome \\"Christmas Time is Here\\" from everyone's favorite Peanuts TV special and the thoughtful \\"Count Your Blessings Instead of Sheep\\" as a closer. Diana's subdued, effortless, and lightly orchestrated \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" is the perfect antidote to Jane's self-consciously melodramatic and over-precious version of the same song on \\"The Season.\\" Overall... no clunkers, no shockers, all cozy and cheery, just as a Christmas album should be.    Decision: Diana Krall over Jane Monheit by a (gentle) knockout... (see my Amazon review of \\"The Season\\" for more reasons why...)
0307276902|5.0|Contrary to one of the reviews written by a \\"pompous ass\\" himself <br />he totally misses the mark on the book.  It's of journey through hell by James Frey.  It is true; nothing is sugar coated; it's raw and emotional.  It is his experience and he tells it from \\"his experience.  That's the way he was when he was in rehab.  This is how it is in the real world of rehab.  It is a gut wrenching, emotional book of how one man beat the odds of rehab by not using the AA 12 step program.  He recovered by \\"choice\\" and if more people in the world excercised their decisions by \\"choice\\" it would be a better world.  I recommend this book to everyone that has an addict in their family or knows an addict.  It will give you a different perspective from the addict's addictions. I applaud Mr. Frey's choices. <br />Two thumbs up! <br />Shelley
B00005JO1J|3.0|I saw RENT live in all it's spectacular glory on the stage in 1999 and was overwhelmed with tears, laughter and elation at such a fabuous piece of art. I fell in love - and purchased the soundtrack the next day. Fast forward to present day - I was so excited about this movie coming out I was literally counting down the days. I wanted to fall in love all over again - but was deeply dissapointed. <br /> <br />I understand the challenge in bringing a musical to the screen. When I saw A Chorus Line on the stage I was moved to explore the world of dance. When I saw the movie I was literally dancing to my car. When I saw RENT on stage I was crying tears of joy as I left the theater and singing the tunes aloud. When I saw the movie I simply sighed. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, the performance everyone gave was superb. These are people with amazing talents and incredible voices.But honestly, if they had just done the performance on stage and recorded it I would have been so much happier. This would have even worked if it had been done in the same way an independant film is done. But this was all slick and hollywood and it really made me sad. The whole beauty of the musical seemed to be somewhat corrupted. I also did not like how lines sung in the stage performance are spoken in the movie - the answering machine messages lost their humor and other lines fell flat. There also songs performed in scenerios that were just not in compliance with the original script. Specifically, one scene is of a reception in a country club and that just WOULD NOT happen.  <br /> <br />Overall it was entertaining, but uninspiring in its adaption to the screen. But the message and heart and soul of RENT prevails and does come across.  <br /> <br />I do agree with some other reviewers that though the performances were stellar, these characters are supposed to be struggling early twenty-somethings and it was obvious these were mid thirty-somethings which did make the characters appear desperate. <br /> <br />If you are a RENThead, go check it out, but don't expect to be dancing and singing when it's over.
B00003CXAW|5.0|An original thought:  Carl Denham(Robert Armstrong), shameless huckster that he is who risks the lives of the unwitting for his own personal glory, should have took the bullets instead of Kong.  Instead, he gets to mouth empty platitudes about beauty killing the beast over poor exploited Kong's dead body.  The cops should have slapped the cuffs on him for putting the general public in harm's way.  Now that I've got that off my chest I can extoll the virtues of \\"King Kong\\".  This film is not only a technological marvel but an exciting edge of your seat adventure film.  This is a slam dunk with the convergence of great storytelling and excellent technical craftmanship adding up to a timeless masterpiece.  The creatures designed for this film by Willis O'Brien are so expressive and lifelike that they have more character than the human actors.  I'm hoping that Peter Jackson's upcoming remake has a fraction of the original's inventiveness.
0307276902|2.0|I usually trust Oprah's choices but this book was truly a let down. The story was interesting yet not that remarkable, I have known many that have overcome even greater odds and they have yet to acclaim fame from their experiences.  His style of writing can only be explained as bizarre, one must reread a sentence to realize the syntax really was intentionally meant to be read as though he was rambling, without any thought as to the fact that this story was meant to be read, it was not a monologue.  <br /> <br />If his point was to warn people of the perils of drug abuse, he missed the mark, if it was meant to inform people that you can meet an odd asortment of characters in rehab he succeeded, although he didn't tell us anything we did not already know.   <br /> <br />I am not sure if Oprah was telling the truth when she stated that she could not sleep until she finished it, perhaps this was because the writer was appearing the next day, However, it took me a week because it was not that interesting, but I paid for it so I might as well finish it.  The writer was far from courageous nor a hero, he was an everyday person who happened to meet the right people at the right time.  He did nothing heroic with his so called redeption, he wrote a book...end of story. <br /> <br />Even on Oprah's show he lacked personality, he lacked the ability to reach the audience with the message that addiction hurts more people than just just the addict.  Quite frankly I still don't think he cares that others went above and beyond to save him.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|I was the odd fan that did enjoy Depeche Mode's last to cds Ultra and Exciter..they weren't my favourites but I still really liked them, especially Ultra. So when news hit the airwaves last year around this time that the Mode were going back into studio mid January...well first of all I didn't hold my breath because as a long time DM devotee you learn to wait and see what actually happens..but lo and behold, they did.  <br />So on th 18th of October I was first in line at my local Best Buy with money in hand, way more excited than I should be at my age...lol...I remember getting into my car, putting the disc in, sitting quiet for about 10 seconds after the first song began and then screaming MY MODE ARE BACK! PLAYING THE ANGEL is pure Depeche Mode, back to the sulky lyrics, brooding sounds and quirky atmospheric strains. However, this time out? Mr. David Gahan has penned three songs instead of the entire cd being written by the underrated, underappreciated Martin Gore. Having been a huge fan of Mr. Gahan's solo cd Paper Monster I am thrilled to say his songs are among the best on the disk. The only fault I could find with Playing the Angel was Martin Gore's lyrics in a song or two where he seemed to go after the rhyme instead of having the song actually mean something. But again, being a long time fan I did understand where he was going with those songs. Macrovision started out not being a song I could wrap my grey matter around but after a few listenings to I came to have that be one of my favourite songs off the entire disk. All in all I have one thing to say DEPECHE MODE ARE BACK BABY! And today being the 29th of November, and me living in/near Chicago..I've got my tickets for their gig in my hot little hands right now and I'm as excited about seeing them live as I was 21 years ago!

0440237688|5.0|The Giver is one of the most amazing books that I have ever read. When Jonas felt pain, I too felt pain. Lois Lowry describes in such great detail that the reader feels as if they are the character. It's no wonder this won the Newberry! If you haven't already read it, DO SO NOW!!! It is appropriate for anyone over the age of about 10. if you're a fan of the Shadow Children or Left Behind: the Kids series' (as I am of both) then I promise you will LOVE this book! It's definitely one of the best I've ever read. If this review was helpful to you, PLEASE SAY YES! Please help me in raising my position on Amazon's site. Thank you!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I really wish that this movie had done better in the box office.  It has a great story, great acting, cool special effects, neato camera angles (especially the first shot of inside the spaceship Serenity... it is a continuous shot throughout the entire ship.)  Unfortunately, given the response of USA in the theater, I doubt there will be a sequel.  There should be though.  So, buy this video!  Buy ten!  Give them out as presents to everyone you know!  It's worth it.  PS.  Yes, they do use handguns.  With bullets.  In the far distant future.  Go with it.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This is a perfectly crafted album with all of the elements needed to keep it on repeat in your cd player. It has the signature soaring ballads... as well as those awesome R&B grooves we've come to expect from MARIAH. This album is VERY current in its delivery but also hearkens back to old school stylings. The lyrical content is SUPERB, the vocals are AMAZING and the rappers are far and few but VERY appropriate for the tracks they are featured on which is good. If you were never a fan of R&Bish/HipHopish music... than you might not find this album as addicting as I, and many others have! But if you are open to hearing great heartfelt R&B/POP music... purchase this album and prepare to be EMANCIPATED!!  <br />p.s. IGNORE all the 1 star reviews because they are from jaded madonna fans who are grappling with the fact that MARIAH has and will continue to supersede, outsing & outsell the FORMER queen of Pop!
0792841344|5.0|There are films shot for $2 and during a week, and somehow they captivate hearts of millions of fans. \\"Phantasm\\" is definately one of those films. Here young and extremely talented filmmaker Don Coscarelli created his own universe, his own world inhabited by gruesome dwarves, sinister embalmers, brainsucking flying spheres and last but not least - the evil Tall Man who brings havoc into small towns, robs cemeteries and turns the dead into his slaves. There are many directors and literary authors who created their own worlds: George Lukas (\\"Star Wars\\"), Peter Jackson (\\"The Lord of the Rings\\") and earlier so did J.R.R. Tolkien. But for me (as for many other horror fans) Coscarelli's world is closer and dearer.<br /><br />\\"Phantasm\\" is an atmopspheric and mysterious movie where you can't tell reality from a dream. It is very dark, dismal and melancholic. It will haunt you for years. Shot on a very tight budget it will impress you so much you'll be wondering how did it manage to do so. I still can't find an answer, all I know is that it still haunts me (for about 15 years). To me \\"Phantasm\\" stands among cult films like \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\", \\"Exorcist\\", \\"Omen\\", \\"Jaws\\", \\"Evil Dead\\" which immencely influenced the genre of contemporary horror.<br /><br />Just recently all four parts of \\"Phantasm\\" were released in one edition in Britain. I bought this 5-disc (5th disc is for bonus features) sphere edition and want to say it is phantastic. So wait a little, R1 DVD-players' owners, I'm sure Tall Man gets to America soon!
B000BOH8XW|1.0|Hey, Shakira, are you a singer or an actress? Do you make music or do you make videos? I doubt very strongly we would even be talking about this \\"album\\" if it weren't for her steamy bodacious video, in which Shakira, like Mariah Carey and Gwen Stephani, looks directly at the camera while writhing sensuously in 30-weight motor oil (Yuck!). Okay, she has an interesting voice and if she were serious about it, she might be a stylish artist with hit songs. But she wants to be TOO SEXY FOR HER SHIRT, and she just ends up being another flash in the pan video vixen. She even comments that she \\"wants to win an Oscar\\". Not a Grammy, a freaking Oscar! I especially HATE the part of the video where she \\"acts\\" like she's playing the guitar solo, which is offensive to every musician who practices hours upon hours to get good. POP MUSIC SUCKS these days, and Shakira is another reason to avoid modern music, and just re-purchase the hits from the good old days of ROCK!
B000ASATWQ|4.0|While Damian Marley has improved much with each album, and is showing a maturity nearly nonexistent on his debut album, and only showed up infrequently on \\"Halfway Tree,\\" it's really Stephen Marley who makes this album what it is. <br />It's Stephen Marley who crafted the watertight backing music, that mixes in everything from dancehall, R&B, pop to reggae.  <br />David (aka Ziggy) and Stephen have long been easily the most talented of the Marley kids, and that still hasn't changed. Stephen is making a name for himself as a producer. There's a reason why four of the tracks feature Stephen Marley as the lead vocalist. While Ziggy vocally sounds more like Bob, Stephen's style is more reminiscent of Bob's, and even people who surround the family say Stephen's personality is more like his father's. And that's what he brings to this album, his father's flavor. And just like previous Damian releases, this one's stacked full of guest artists, filling in the void because Damian, despite his improvements, still can't hold a whole album by himself. He needs the help of Stephen and numerous more talented guest artists. But as a whole, there's little denying the power/quality of this one. Reggae purists may not dig this, as this album is a rather commercial blend, but anyone who's been buying up the Marley kid records, namely those with Stephen on them, the path they're taking won't be a surprise. <br />But this album is not without missteps. Damian still seems to be riding his father's coattails, unnecessarily, by sampling the likes of \\"Exodus\\" or \\"Pimper's Paradise.\\" The same kid who shamelessly named his first album \\"Mr. Marley\\" and had a picture of Bob on it, doesn't need to rely on such recognition. He's talented enough to stop sampling Daddy's tracks. But until then, it will largely be Stephen's show, in which Damian is just a secondary artist, and yes, even on his own album.
B00004X01U|5.0|While I enjoyed \\"Ray of Light,\\" I feel \\"Music\\" is a tad more experimental and indicative of who Madonna is music-wise.  I can push play and listen to \\"Music\\" from start to finish whereas with \\"Ray of Light\\" I like the majority, not the entirety, of the album.<br /><br />I particularly enjoy \\"I Deserve It,\\" which is an autobiographical song if there ever was one.  Madonna has worked her tail off for over 20 years, an unreal amount of time when it comes to the ever fickle entertainment industry, and no one will ever convince me otherwise that she doesn't appreciate (and acknowledge) the support of her fans.<br /><br />The rest of the CD is Madonna at her experimental best.  She has always proven throughout the years that she isn't afraid to work with new producers and Madonna has a knack for working with producers who compliment her style just right and allow her to expand her pop music boundaries without going completely overboard or out there.<br /><br />Good stuff.  Highly recommended.
B00007AJGH|5.0|\\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\" single handedly changed the face of animation in live action films. The movie also introduced us to the hottest cartoon character ever (Jessica Rabbit). The movie is directed by innovative director <br />Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump, Back to the Future) and stars Bob Hoskins <br />as Eddie Valiant, a private eye who hates toons after one killed his brother. Anyway, Eddie is hired to take pictures of Jessica Rabbit in order to stir some jealousy in Roger Rabbit which will get him to perform better in a movie that he's working on. After Eddie takes the pictures of Jessica with Marvin Acme; Acme turns up dead and the first suspect is Roger. Well, Roger asks Eddie to protect him from the toon-killing Judge Doom (a virtually unrecognizable Christopher Lloyd) and unwittingly Eddie does. The movie is not only well done (animation and such), but it's actually pretty entertaining and funny. A-
B00063MBU8|1.0|This along with hoobastank is the worst ever album, by the worst ever band.... <br /> <br />How anyone can like this sh*t is beyond me! <br /> <br />Every single song is about some guy having a whine about how he hates his life.....the songs are written from the perspective of an 11 year old....but alas!! the average age of the band members is 25! HAHAHHA <br /> <br />PATHETIC... <br /> <br />if i could rate this a negative number .. id give it -100
B0002OERI0|4.0|It is clear that the Who, Beatles, Hendrix, Stones, Kinks, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd are classic greats of modern music. As for Green Day, whether they know it or not, much of what they do, has been done. In this case, they do it quite well. Hey, \\"The Kids Are Alright\\", and they are growing up. Enough said. It is nice that we have this free forum to voice our praise, or criticism of products, such as music CD's. Unfortunately, it is open to the immature individuals, such as \\"MTV Supporter\\" to voice completely useless and crass opinions.

Her voice is amazing a voice like no one else out there it is unique I love the way it sounds and the lil moans she puts on the end of some words like a yerning it give the words so much more power and emotion this is a MUST HAVE! My Favorite line is from the song \\"The day and the time\\" \\"Well we know how ephemeral life is Disillusion takes what illusion gives What's the use of make believe

I am a huge fan but this has pushed me over the edge, my morning wake up cd the drive to work helps me get it all together ever mix is better then the last her voice the beats makes you thinkin of the moves you will use when you hear this in the club. I would give it s 10 star review and not just because I am a fan or hers it really is a great gift to the fans and to people who thought she was just some trashy girl who is going out of control put this cd in sit back and listen and I promise you wont be in ur seat for long the furniture will be moved and you will be in front of the stero danceing with your own imaginary snake as she makes you her slave to this cd!

B000BW7QWW|5.0|Well as soon as I had heard that there was a movie coming out for the shortlived Firefly series I counted down the days.  My friends were patient with me as I probably drove them insane... 1 year to go...1 month to go...1 week to go...and when it finally came to New Zealand (well after it had opened everywhere else) their suffering was alleviated. <br /> <br />I watched and noticed a few differences from the series but hey no biggie.  Maybe it was just the movie theater but some of the dialogue was a little muffled - I'll find out with the DVD - but the visualisations were great - the ship and environments in the Wedon universe were done justice with a bigger budget.  <br /> <br />My only regret is that it was just a movie and I hope that the series will be picked up again or there will be another movie.  I can dream can't I...but until then I will have to content myself with the series and this DVD.   <br /> <br />To those that have watched and liked the movie but haven't seen the series - buy it, you won't be disappointed.  Everyone I have given it to liked it and were a little disappointed there wasn't anymore....until now :D
B00005J6UP|5.0|The Goonies is another great classic film from the 80's and i heard that they might be bringing them back for a sequel!!!!! When this one came out in 1985 it was a hit and it has everything from action to some romance to some great chases!!!! When a bunch of kids go exploring they come across a treasure pirate ship with treasures that will make the kids rich,but a mob wants the treasure too!!!!! Its a battle between the kids and the mob for this treasure!!!!!! Like i said before this family movie is great for a wonderful night with everyone and its also great to watch over again and again!!!!!
B000002UJQ|5.0|I had always been pretty lukewarm on Radiohead, usually sticking to Coldplay and the like. My friend was kindasorta into Radiohead, and I always heard people claiming Coldplay was derivative, and was curious to see to what extent that was true. I picked up \\"The Bends\\" and enjoyed it, but still didn't get the hype over Radiohead. Nonetheless, I pressed forward, and on a complete whim purchased OK Computer. I liked \\"Karma Police\\" at first, but didn't really feel the rest of the album. About two months after purchasing it, on the way to the airport I really listened to it. <br /> <br />Oh. my. god. <br /> <br />OK Computer remains a mainstay for me, no matter what other bands and albums are in rotation. It's one of those rare albums that morphs and shifts with whatever phase you're going through in life. Granted, it's not the kind of album that you put on before you party. Still, OK Computer mercilessly adheres to the listener, completely unshakeable. It's a record that, once you really get it, it stays in your system for a long time. My favorites include \\"Airbag\\", \\"Paranoid Android,\\" \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien,\\" \\"Karma Police,\\" and \\"Lucky.\\" \\"Lucky\\" may be my favorite, evoking a wide range of emotions from resigned to the ghastliness of a sterile, mechanical present but hopeful of the future nonetheless. I can't even completely dissect all my feelings when I hear \\"Lucky.\\" <br /> <br />This is one of the best albums ever. Period.  <br /> <br />And as far as Coldplay jacking Radiohead goes...I can't agree with that much. It's beyond impossible to truly parallel the unique, enigmatic genius of OK Computer.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I have to say i'm not a huge fan of Green Day and when i listened to this cd i think its the best that i have heard from these guys in a long time!!!!!!!!! I like some of their old songs,but with this cd you can feel the lyrics and they have greats songs on it!!!!!! They have tracks such as \\" Holiday\\" which is catchy and fun and then they have the low song of \\" Boulvard of Broken Dreams\\" and then their newest one which in the video talks about a love relationship and the guy ends up going to the army,but anyway that song is \\" Wake Me Up When September Ends\\"!!!!!!!! If you are a huge fan of this group then get this album and even if you aren't this album would be great in any music collection with a variety of music!!!!!!
B000002KHF|2.0|First off, I must say the album and the music itself is both a masterpiece in terms of art AND a great accessible pop gem for casual fans.  In fact, Moondance probably gains much of it's sales due to the fact that it contains songs that were popular and/or reached the charts at one point or another (Crazy Love, Caravan, Into the Mystic, Come Running) that were surprisingly not included on \\"The Best of Van Morrison\\" compilation.  Well, even though they are shocking omissions to that collection, I believe it is for the better as it draws more casual fans to purchase an original configuration studio album. <br /> <br />But, what bothers me is the poor nature of the CD release.  While Van's Bang Material and all the albums from Tupelo Honey to Poetic Champions Compose get the benefit of a remasters (Into the Music, Common One, Beautiful Vision and Inarticulate Speech of the Heart still have yet to see remastering in the US, but you can purchase them imported to get releases of those albums that are consistent to the surrounding remastered titles), Morrison's three early and most popular classics (Astral Weeks, Moondance and His Band and the Street Choir) are left in the dust on muddy sounding and poorly packaged `80s CDs.  <br /> <br />Perhaps it's not really a terrible sound and is passable, but when listened to before or after one of Morrison's albums that was remastered, one can immediately catch the lower volume and the sonic difference in quality. <br /> <br />Also, the packaging; The CD insert here is far from complete, based off the vinyl LP packaging.  The original included a fable from Van's [then] wife Janet Planet, as well as four b/w photographs, all were printed inside the gatefold interior and disappointingly not reproduced anywhere inside the booklet of this release. <br /> <br />So to summarize, a 5 star album just not done justice on Compact Disc. <br />
B000B8QEYC|5.0|The 'sound' of Amarantine is no departure for Enya, but it remains her sound and her sound alone. And as such, she continues to hone her craft, sharpening and tightening her sound as it evolves over time. Her voice here is sharper, clearer, angelic, youthful yet mature. There is a newness to this new disc, almost religiously spiritual and more personally emotional then earlier work. Less than a pearl, Its in the rain, If I could be where you are, The river sings, and Sumiregusa stand out strongest. The whole recording is over all fresh, powerful and radiant.
B000A2XC1C|4.0|Twenty years ago Alexander Salkind who masterminded the SUPERMAN movies decided to go all out with the Santa Claus legend.  The result is a magical, picturesque movie with lots of elf dancing and pretty scenery, with little coherence in its plot. But what the heck---David Huddleston is one of the best embodiments of the jolly old soul and John Lithgow chews up the scenery as the nasty toymaker.  It's a fun family film with a delightful score by the late Henry Mancini and even pixiie-ish Dudley Moore does okay.  It reminds us of the magic of believing and what the secular meaning of Christmas is supposed to be.
B000BL39G0|5.0|if u dont know Pac, just buy his best album, All Eyez on Me. This DualDisc version much more than the original (or the simple remastered) version, cause it features very good quality songs and videos...
B0000AQS6R|3.0|One can't help but laugh at the shenanigans Chevy Chase goes through in trying to ready his house for the Griswold Family Christmas.  While some gags are in questionably good taste, they are funny and Chase has a fine cast of supporting players including Randy Quaid as the redneck Eddie; the parents:  John Randolph, Diane Ladd, Doris Roberts and E.G. Marshall; and Julia Louis Dreyfus as the snooty neighbor.  This was one of my mother's (God rest her soul) favorite Christmas movies because she said it made her laugh, and I guess that's testimony enough to its enduring power.
B00003CXAW|5.0|I grew up watching this great classic and every single time had the same thrills over and over again, this one truly withstands the test of time, fascinating me just as much at 57 as it did at eight years old.<br /><br />When Armstrong first encounters a down-on-her-luck Wray, he offers her this magical job without revealing his true intent, and onboard the ship, he has her practice screaming in front of the camera, which moves one of the crew to ask: \\"What does he really expect her to see?\\" Chilling, foreboding moment...<br /><br />The journey to Skull Island on the ship really gets you worked up for the entry onto the island itself and the encounter with the Natives, the various monsters behind the great gate (used in the burning of Atlanta in GWTW) and finally, Kong himself.<br /><br />Robert Armstrong delivers the movie's sole humorous line when the Native Chief is taken with Fay Wray and wants to trade livestock for her, Armstrong says \\"Yes, I guess blondes are kinda scarce around here.\\"<br /><br />Once they get past the gate and into the jungle, things take off in a hurry. The trip by boat to another part of the island has one of the (still, to this day) scariest moments I have ever seen in any movie of the genre; a water monster that is truly terrifying. When I was a child, this monster really scared me witless.<br /><br />Eventually Fay Wray, what's left of the crew and Kong are delivered safely back to New York and it is at that point my fear of Kong changed to one of pity. The poor guy, taken out of his home, to a foreign environment, treated like a sideshow freak and placed in iron restraints, it was really awful to see. When, at the end, he is on the top of the Empire State Building, fighting off the airplanes, and loses the battle, I cried.<br /><br />And Armstrong's last line, the perfect summation of Kong's trials: \\"It wasn't the airplanes, it was beauty killed the beast.\\"<br /><br />GREAT movie, and fascinating to note Fay Wray only died last year! Born in 1907 and starred in one of the most famous films of all time...amazing.he most famous films of all time...amazing. <br /> <br />
B00008DDXL|5.0|This second installment in the immensely popular series once again delivers a world of fantastic magical proportions.  Most of the members of the original movie are back and once again director Chris Columbus weaves a tale of sorcery and danger for our young heroes.  Notable new faces include a bombastic Kenneth Branagh and a nasty Jason Isaacs.  With gorgeous sets, costumes and neat special effects, this movie should entertain all, even those of us who aren't Harry Potterphiles.  Good moviemaking, though
067144901X|5.0|\\"La la la\\" proclaims my 14 month old son everytime we bring out this book.  It is, by far, his favorite book & he brings it to me several times a day to read to him.  After having this book a few months, he now knows several animal sounds & can finish many of the lines in the book once started (The cow says...\\"MOOOOO!!!\\").  This is a very cute, silly book, that even my 3 and 5 year olds don't complain about.   <br /> <br />We like all of Boynton's books for their silliness & cute illustrations, but this one is our favorite.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|When I first saw the previews for this film I didn't really know what to expect.  I am not much into British humor, but I have to admit that I really enjoyed viewing this movie.  The comedy of the film was not way out there, but it was there.  It is nothing of the likes of Airplane or the Naked Gun kind of satire, but it does well in terms of being entertaining.  If you are looking for a light comedic movie, with a adventurous twist I would suggest Shaun of the Dead.
B000B7HZXM|1.0|Here's another untalented singer trying to pollute the music industry..this album says it all.. <br />Smile??!?!?!?dare smile somemore!?!?!?!!?You suck! Your music suck infact!
0553801503|1.0|this is a sorry attempt to stretch out the series to make more royalties from his publisher.  i would be shocked if he finished the series in six books as he originally planned.  i am very disappointed.  the genre and writing is very different from his first three novels in this series.
B000ASATYO|3.0|Edited review!  After finding out that yes, this release does have the full documentary from the laser disc, I had to edit this review.  I would probably still leave the 3 star rating, or maybe bump it up to 3 1/2 stars.  The movie is a 5-star film, but this should have been a 2-disc set.  I hate \\"flipper\\" discs, there are too many players that can not handle them properly.  Give me a 2-disc set and I'll pay a couple extra bucks for it.
B000001EXR|5.0|Some people accuse KISS of following trends like the in the late 70's (disco), in the 80s (hair metal, glam) and now this one (grunge) but the bottom line is it isn't 1976 anymore! How can you be innovative if you're lost in time some 3 decades ago?  You may say they're just trying to be like everyone else, but just listen to this album.  It's got such a heavy and dark feel to it, but there's no doubt that it's KISS!  Songs about sex, and partying, are no where to be found on this album, as they should be.  30 years worth \\"fun\\" rock, and it's about time they came out with something that has a little more soul, a little more meaning.  I think it's an excellent album and it shows how KISS can keep up with the times WITHOUT sounding like anyone else. Pick this one up,  you'll like it.
B000BO0LLS|3.0|I like Madonna and Mariah Carey, I loved the Emancipation of Mimi the orginal but I am just disapointed in the fact that she will rerelease 3 other editions of her already very succesful Emancipation of Mimi.  If this album was the orginal or hell with the 2nd release we wouldn't care, but that face is it is the fourth!  Mariah u always say u care about the fans well, before u release ur next album dont make no more rereleases and maybe we wouldnt be calling u a fat cash cow.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Mayer for a couple years now. When i first heard of him turining blues/jazz rock I was skeptical and somewhat disapointed. I downloaded a few songs and thought it was alright, but it wasnt untill i went to his show in Cleveland that i fell in love with the new john. He is doing his own thing now with great passion and fire. \\"Try\\" Is a must buy and possibly the best cd of the year.
B000B8QEYC|4.0|\\"Amarantine\\" is a another great relaxing album from Enya that we have so longily waited for.  FIVE YEARS!  Well finally is here and there is alot to say, but I will cut this one short buy it, you will not regret it she is amazing in every way on this album. Overall 4.5.
B00005JOHI|5.0|I'm so glad I saw this. One liners like, 'I'm bewitched with you mind, body and soul' just TOTALLY inspire! SEE THIS!
B0002TT0NW|5.0|This movie is dark , suspensful and funny all in one.  With the beginning of Harry and his family.  With the twist of Ron's rat being Peter, and was the real one who betrayed Harry's parents.  And that snape was wrong after all, that Siruis Black was innocent all along.  I feel that this movie is the best of the three, besides the fact the 1st set up the whole series.
B000BM6AVA|2.0|If you listen to the track \\"Vicinity of Obscenity\\" you will see that this cd is not what most would call quality music.  The fact that everyone is writing great reviews for this cd goes to show the decline of America.  This music is loud and senseless.  The words mean nothing to anyone, and they never will.  At first with Toxicity it was tolerable because it was done a lot better and the words KINDA made sense if you thought about them.  Saying things like \\"Banana banana banana banana terracotta banana terracotta terracotta pie\\" is stupid and why you people are liking this is pathetic.  Go listen to some Trivium or Mudvayne, they'll show you what music should be.  You know what, just go listen to anything except this album, because you'll be better off.  These songs are ridiculous and shouldn't have been made.  I'm pissed that I wasted my money on this album, and I recommend that you do NOT buy it.  Soldier Side is a pretty cool song though, but thats that only exception.  Other than that I'd rather listen to the unattractive member of Destiny's Child sing a solo album than hear this cd ever again.
B0006L16N8|4.0|With there multi platinum album \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" <br />with their big single \\"Speed of Sound\\" which is very catchy with great vocals and lyrics.   <br /> <br />\\"Fix You\\" and \\"White Shadows\\" are two personal favorties of mine, with their combination of guitar and high vocals.  I also like the songs \\"Talk\\" and \\"What If?\\"  This album has already been very succesful, hitting #1 and being 3x platinum, <br /> <br />I give this album and overall effect of : 4.5/5
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Anne Elliot, a shy, unassuming and unmarried \\"old maid\\" of 27, lives a quiet life in the country with her noble family, at Kellynch Hall.  That is, until the state of her family's finances (\\"You must retrench!\\") forces them to move from their lavish home in the country, to the not-quite-so-comparable comfort of Bath, in order to rent out their home (and get themselves out of debt).  The new tenants of Kellynch Hall are Admiral & Mrs. Croft, whose brother, Fredrick Wentworth, Anne had been engaged to at the tender young age of 19.  Anne had reluctantly broken off their engagement at her family & friends' persuasion, as \\"he had nothing to recommend him: no fortune, no connections\\" and her spirits were said to have \\"never been high, since...your disappointment.\\"  When Captain Fredrick Wentworth returns from 8 years at sea, with elevated social status and newly-acquired wealth, his appearance sparks a series of events in the lives of all the Elliot girls: Elizabeth, Mary & most of all Anne... <br /> <br />When I saw this film as a teenager with my mom & friend at an independent theater outside Washington, D.C., I came out with a sense that this was one of the better films out there.  That this was the type of film I had been looking for all my life: a wonderfully done, well-filmed, superbly-acted \\"period piece\\"...I must say that \\"Persuasion\\" was likely the start of it all for me.  \\"Persuasion,\\" which was then followed closely by Emma Thompson's \\"Sense & Sensibility,\\" had me hooked: I had been given the bait and I had fallen for it.  From that point on, I became a huge fan of period films: I have since consumed every well-known and obscure period film I could possibly get my hands on, but it all goes back to that first theatrical viewing of \\"Persuasion\\".   <br /> <br />The dialog is amazing!  The subtle ways that the Elliot family persecute Anne are beyond compare: I have never again to this day, seen such a brilliant exercise in underlying snubs & barbs: slight criticisms & faint scorns from Anne's family that are never rude or direct but are always subtle and seemingly innocuous (although they often cut to the quick).  Anne takes them so well, and clearly loves her family in spite of it all.  The scenes are beautifully filmed, the costuming well-done, and the scenery breathtaking.  The scene where Anne reads the letter is so touching!  And I must say the true-to-the-period ending scenes are simply wonderful: Jane Austen would have been proud!  <br /> <br />For those of you worried about family-friendly content: no need to worry!  There is little to object to in this film: there are very, very suble allusions to a possible liaison, so subtle that most never discover them.  There is a scene where a young lady falls and hurts herself; there is a little language: a few uses of d*mn, and little else.   <br /> <br />This quiet, unobtrusive, slow-moving, delight of film gem is well worth any time you devote to it: when watching for the first time, I would recommend giving it your full attention and not being too tired.  It is very mellow & quiet, and may take you awhile to get into, but will be well worth the effort in the end.  \\"Persuasion\\" would have to be one of my favorite period pieces of all time, along with \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" and \\"North & South.\\"  A definite must for any girl or woman interested in period pieces: this film is an utter delight! <br />  <br />
B000BOH8XW|4.0|Shakira sings english on this album and her lastest single and music video is \\"Don't Bother\\" of course a latin tune.  This to me is not as good as vol. 1 but the soul purpose she sings in english on this album is gonna make people want to buy it even more.   <br /> <br />The songs that appear on this album that were also on the previous album vol.1 are \\"Something\\" and \\"The Day and the Time\\" other great songs on the album include.  \\"Hey You\\", \\"Illegal\\" which features Carlos Santana, and \\"Animal City\\"
B00005MP58|5.0|First, the storyline: based on Jane Austen's most popular and beloved novel, \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" is the story of Elizabeth Bennet (Jennifer Ehle), one of five unmarried daughters, born to a somewhat lowly gentry family in Regency England.  Mrs. Bennet's main motive in life is to marry off her five daughters, and as they haven't much of a dowry (the estate is entailed upon their cousin, Mr. Collins), she stoops to subterfuge (and often goes beyond the lines of propriety), all in the hopes of securing good husbands (and hopefully rich ones) for her daughters. When two rich & eligible bachelors (Mr. Bingley & Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth)) enter the neighborhood, it sparks a whirlwind of events in the lives of each of the Bennet girls. Add to this mix Mr. Bingley's snobbish sister, Miss Caroline Bingley, Elizabeth's best friend plain-jane Charlotte Lucas, Darcy's imperious aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourg & daughter Anne, the regiments' dastardly Mr. Wickham, and a few others, and you have an exciting tale of romance won and lost!  <br /> <br />The Review: once in awhile a film comes along that makes you sit up & take notice: this is one of those films.  A lavish mini-series, a joint effort by A&E and BBC that originally aired in 1995 (in UK, 1996 in the USA), this remarkable adaptation is exceptional.  It has become not only the quintessential version of \\"Pride & Prejudice,\\" but also the quintessential period piece.  It sparked a world-wide craze for Colin Firth, Jane Austen adaptations & costume dramas, and led to a best-selling book \\"Bridget Jones Diary,\\" a movie version of the same, and a sequel!  P&P was adapted for screen by the magnificently talented Andrew Davies (Vanity Fair, Emma, Wives & Daughters, Daniel Deronda, The Way We Live Now, etc.), the dialog is astounding, the costuming is gorgeous, the scenery is spectacular, and the acting is beyond compare!  Every single character plays their part to perfection: I cannot think of a thing I would change!  <br />        <br />For those of you worried about family-friendly content: there is little objectionable content in this mini-series.  There is a scene where an unmarried man & woman are seen living together in an apartment (they are shortly thereafter married); there is no language that I could find.  This series is very clean overall. <br /> <br />I would certainly call this 5-hour mini-series the quintessential period piece of our age: it was incredibly well-adapted, and is touching & exquisite.  It ends as it should, very true to the spirit of Jane Austen: I would highly recommend this great series!   <br />   <br /> <br />
B000002LND|5.0|This half of her greatest hits but it is the best Madonna collection out there, also make sure you pick up GHV2 if you also want a taste of her lastest stuff , which is a greatest hits of her lastest albums.  Madonna is considered the Queen of Pop which is easily understood with over six #1 albums and selling over 250 million albums world wide. <br /> <br />I advice this  to any pop loving fan, if you haven't heard of Madonna , well you have been living under a rock and you need to explore the awesome world of Madonna.  Start with her two greatest hits collecitons such as this and GHV2.
B000002ZR7|5.0|Tatyana Nikolayeva was the greatest authority on Bach ever- plain and simple. This recording is just another proof of that fact.
B0002OERI0|5.0|With their big mega hit since \\"Dookie\\", \\"American Idiot\\" has been their best album to me. With opening out to the great rocker \\"American Idiot\\" and the great rock ballad \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" also \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" and a amazing nine minuite song.  To me \\"Holiday\\" right now is the best song on the album including with the song \\"Wake Me up when September Ends\\" along with \\"LetterBomb\\" and \\"She's a Rebel.\\"
B00004STOZ|1.0|Without the singlest doubt, Wanda Landowska wouldn't allow mr. Jarrett even washing the dishes for her, let alone play her harpsichord.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I am Madonna fan, and this album put it over the top with 12 non-stop dancable songs Madonna keeps her fans on the dance floor with this one. Her new single \\"Hung Up\\" is a great currently at #7 on billboards hot 100.  The album is currently at #1 on billboard.  But enough of that the album is what is really important.  Even if ur not a Madonna fan this album is for you, \\"Sorry\\", \\"Jump\\", \\"Push\\" \\"Future Lovers\\" and \\"How High\\" are great songs that stand out.  \\"I love New York\\" have lyrics that are against Bush and it is also great song to just listen too.  Buy this album you will not regret it.
B0000025HU|5.0|Best rock album ever? Probably not. <br />Without the singlest doubt though, the most important rock album ever- for multiple reasons.
B000BC8TBE|4.0|Mariah Carey gives us a dual disc of her already multi platuim christmas album back in the 90's which to me is a great effort. <br /> <br />This is one of the best christmas albums you are going to find out there and you are going to want some good Christmas music over the holidays or a nice stocking stuffer, this is the disc to spend your Christmas season on!
B00000K19E|5.0|...The next two movies absolutely SUCK. I won't cover what the Matrix is about, that has been done to death in other reviews. I will however tell you that I think the Matrix is the BEST sci-fi movie of all time (YES, better than Star Wars). When it hit the big screen in the late 90's to little fanfare, I went to see it. It blew me away. It was, fresh, original, had a staggering concept, good dialogue, great action, even great acting from the normally meatheaded Reeves. It was the total package for a sci-fi movie. When it was announced there would be two more, I waited anxiously...and waited...and waited...after what seemed like an eternity, the next movies hit the big screen... what the $%#?!?!  The next two movies are TERRIBLE, and TOTALLY wreck the magic the first one created. The second movie doesn't even move the story forward, you can jump right to the third one and understand what's going on. The hugely awesome ending to the first one becomes the biggest anti-climax in movie history at the start of #2 too. On top of all of this, #3 is completely unsatisfying, and leaves you wondering why you wasted those extra hours of your life. I wrote this review to warn everyone who hasn't seen these movies to watch the first one but DON'T WATCH THE OTHER TWO!!!  ....ok, ok, I know you will anyway, but just remember: you have been warned. On a side note, the first movie stands alone perfectly as a complete story. The other two aren't necessary at all, but watch them if you wish. I only watch the first one now and am much happier to pretend the other two don't exist.     The Matrix is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B000BKDOCA|4.0|Britney Spears has been known for great singles, and as most people say have the rest of her album full of filler.  Well, I never listened to her albums, untill her greatest hits and \\"In the Zone\\" which I thought was an album of all great songs. <br /> <br />Well, Britney gives a solid effort on the remixes on \\"Toxic\\" which is one of her better singles and some traditional favorites such as \\"Baby One More Time\\" and \\"Im A Slave For You\\" <br /> <br />\\"Me Against The Music\\" another great song with her and Madonna. Also some other great remixes are \\"Early Mornin\\" \\"Everytime\\" and \\"Touch Of My Hand\\"
B000BB1MI2|5.0|Ok, right off the bat.... I loved the Gene Wilder one. Who the heck couldn't like that movie? I had heard a lot of grumblings about the new movie, how people were stunned at how different it was from the original. After seeing it though, I can say this is a much better movie than the original. First, it is much closer to the book (which was the original source material for the first movie) in content and \\"feel\\". Second, while Gene Wilder was AWESOME in the first one, Johnny Depp plays an amazing and complicated Willy Wonka (Depp has to be one of the greatest actors of our generation, even though I am no fan of his personal opinions). While I have heard people complain that this Willy Wonka is a weirdo, folks, THATS THE WHOLE POINT. He's SUPPOSED to be! It makes perfect sense in the story. BRILLIANT acting by Depp.  <br />  Lets move on to the Oompa Loompas. I have heard complaints that its all the same guy and the songs suck. I totally disagree. While the original Oompas were cool as hell, these Oompas are just as great, and I think the 'look-alike' aspect of theses Oompas added a lot to the whole movie. The dancing choreography was pretty great too. The songs DO NOT suck, they actually are quite entertaining, its just that people love the originals so much they don't give the new ones a fair shake. I thoroughly enjoyed the song and dance sequences. <br />My final thoughts are on Tim Burton. I never really got why people like him, as most of his movies are REALLY BAD. Edward Scissorhands was good, but most of his others aren't. I can say that this movie is Burton's best of all. He does quite a good job with the direction, and even his signature dark and quirky sets work wonderfully in this one. <br />  This movie doesn't replace the original, it actually goes hand-in-hand with it. They are companion pieces, different takes on the same source material. Unless you are hopelessly addicted to syrupy sweet fantasy, give the new movie a try.
B00097DXZS|2.0|\\"All That I Am\\" is not all the I hope to expect, well quite frankly I would think he would retire instead keep trying to release more and more albums.  \\"Supernatural\\" was a great album but as all great albums are extremely hard to mimic or beat and in this Santana isn't able to that.  <br /> <br />Yeah, I will admit there are a few good songs on here such as \\"I'm feeling you\\" which is the only reason I gave this album a 2, also \\"Twisted\\" and \\"Cry Baby Cry\\".
0395389496|5.0|This story will be around for generations. This book fills the minds of children with magic and wonder. The perfect holiday reading adventure.
B00000634J|5.0|After my last disappointing review, I thought that I need to shape up and stop messing around. Anyway the CD.    This is the best John Lennon Greatest Hits, which is all on one CD. This is a new version of The John Lennon Collection from 1982 [Which includes a rare track, Move Over Miss L]. It includes twenty tracks from 1969 to 1980. Thankfully there is none of Yoko's songs and it just John Lennon from beginning to end.    It starts off with Imagine, one of John Lennon's great tracks and it all starts to form a great collection. It is at least an hour long, so you won't be disappointed. I didn't go mad and buy all his Albums, other than a few Albums.    I also own the DVD, which has lots of Special Features and Footage. So I say, if you like The Beatles, then get this.    Jake Potts
B000B7HZXM|1.0|He's talented..but this cd didn't showcase anything..it's so poppy..not my type...
B000BGH22W|5.0|Well to start off the review done by elizabeth is actually incorrect, John williams was not replaced he stepped down like he tried to do with Chamber of Secrets, But as for them choosing Patrick Doyle I believe it was time to change William's usually has beautiful light hearted and powerfully sad music while Patrick Doyle seems to excel at making more fancy and classic music along with darker and more frightening music as which all of these qualities are exemplified in \\"Voldemort\\" with this being the book in which everything changes it seems appropriate to have a new composer to make the change. Now hopefully Mr. Doyle will stay on for the next 3 movies because it is usually not beneficial when there is more than one composer change. Even in the movie I was able to tell the difference between Doyle and Williams, and for the die hard Harry Potter Theme fans who think its gone it may only appear twice in the soundtrack but in the movie it appears more than just a few times
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Others have done a good job of elaborating on tracks on this CD. I can only say its probably MY FAVORITE MADONNA ALBUM!...it's that good!   <br /> <br />She is poppy, fun, lyrical and honest.  She delivers the goods here on the Album versions and I KNOW the re-mixes will be AMAZING...what a GREAT 2006 will be!  JUMP, HOW HIGH and SORRY....will ignite the dancefloors all over the world! <br /> <br />Now to the non-believers: just listen to LIKE IT OR NOT....that says it all.
0553801503|5.0|Like many, I have been waiting for this book for years.  I have been watching the successive release dates be pushed back and watching his website for his latest news.  When he finally decided to release the book to the publishers as \\"finished,\\" I was rejoicing.  I picked the book up the day after the released and dived right in.<br /><br />The book is only part of the story.  It picks up with Cersei, Jaime, Samwell Tarly, Brienne, Iron Isles and Dorne.  You get a smattering of Arya and Sansa as well.  You only have a part of the overall story.  On the other hand, Martin does an excellent job of having the book tell its own story as well.  The last chapter knits neatly with the Prologue, giving you a sense of \\"Oh.\\"<br /><br />Some might say that some of the chapters are not necessary.  Other characters may have been included instead.  While I would have loved to seen more of Jon Snow, Bran or Daenerys, the plot threads were necessary for the story A Feast for Crows told.  In the end, A Feast is like a huge arrow pointing ahead.  It is pointing to King's Landing and events unfolding there.  However, the largest arrow is pointing to the East.  I will not tell you how they are pointing.  I would not want to spoil the book too much for you.<br /><br />I found the language of the book as masterfully done as any of those before.  I would not even call Martin long in the tooth.  Each chapter has a purpose and a revelation.  The story unfolds well.<br /><br />On the down side, I have to wait another year or two for the next book.  Yeah, he has a bit of it written already, but I definitely want to see what happens next.  Definitely a sign of a good book.<br /><br />Not for the faint of heart or those who love \\"happily ever after\\" stories, but it is an epic tale that I am following avidly.  A definitely must read for the fantasy reader.  The series would also work well for those who like historical fiction in a medieval setting.
B000ASATYO|5.0|Jimmy Lee James states in his November 29th review that there are no special features on this new Director's Cut DVD?? HUH??? Which disc did you watch??? The complete 4-hour \\"making of\\" documentary from the 1996 LD box set is on this disc, dual sides with the film (14 minutes longer and the same cut as the laserdisc box set, with Jackson commentary) on side one and the other side fully devoted to the extraordinary making of documentary that Jackson himself directed. How can anyone state they were \\"jipped\\" on special features when you have a 4-hour documentary, the longest even to this day appearing on any DVD? This DVD is a Peter Jackson fan's dream come true, especially for those who own or once owned the laserdisc box set and never thought they'd ever get a chance to see this fantastic documentary on DVD! Do yourselves a favor and get this disc - for all of you who've seen The Frighteners, relive the experience. For those who have yet to see it for the first time, you certainly won't regret seeing and owning one of the earlier films from one of contemporary film's greatest imaginations!
B000B8QEYC|2.0|Having being a fun of Enya since her early works, I can only listen to her new CD with mixed feelings. Although it containes some really beautiful pieces, it is still way too convervative. I mostly love her darker eerier stuff, but unfortunately Enya seems to aim more to the average listener with those white, childish, and innocent songs. Years ago it was time for Enya to switch gears to something newer, so right now she sounds greatly outdated.

0671578855|5.0|I have been reading sci-fi since I could read, and this is a total rarity a sci-fi comedy, with a wonderful plot, characters, the whole nine yards. I have lost track of how many times I have read this book, and re-reading it again always makes my sides ache, it so funny.Funny, romantic,a wonderful story, once again, READ THIS!!
B0007NMKB2|4.0|This album came out a year after the classic \\"You're Living All Over Us\\" and maybe it was too much to ask to surpass it. That doesn't mean 'Bug' is a bad album, not at all. It makes the Dinosaur JR with Lou trilogy complete. <br /> <br />The first song however might be the best of all the early Dinosaur work. \\"Freak Scene\\" is an indie classic that can rival with Pavement's 'Cut Your Hair' or even 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' <br /> <br />Everything is in order again, the sound is still murky but that's part of their sound back then. J's guitar sound is great of course. The sound is a little more varied and fresh, there's even an occassional acoustic guitar in there.  <br /> <br />Songs like 'Pond' and 'No Bones' remind you of the previous albums and 'Budge' seems to be the ultimate song showing the old but also the new Dinosaur that would later record 'Green Mind'. <br /> <br />Like YLAOM this album is like wine, it gets better over time and even though it might not get a Hall of Fame status, it's still really good.
B00005JO1P|5.0|Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon give impressive performances in this story of Johnny Cash and his long-time  love, June Carter.  Johnny grew up poor on a cotton farm, listening to June Carter and her family sing on the radio.  He married a girl from home, worked as a door-to-door salesman, and started singing, but his wife was jealous of Johnny's career and his time away from home.  He met June and was smitten, but they were both married; they continued to tour together for years, through June's second marriage and Johnny's terrible drug abuse.  June helped him kick his habit and later, Johnny proposed to her onstage.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the songs in the movie a lot; I was especially impressed that Phoenix and Witherspoon did their own singing and playing and made it look so easy.  Phoenix's Johnny is a tortured and self-destructive soul, and Witherspoon's June is spunky, kind, and mature. This is surely the best movie for both of them to date.  They have great romantic chemistry on-screen and their close-ups are intense! The supporting cast is uniformly excellent, especially Robert Patrick as Johnny's mean and unrepentant father.  I heartily recommend \\"Walk the Line;\\" it is an emotional roller-coaster of highs and lows, with a lot of entertaining music and two very likeable stars.<br /><br />Kona
B0002858YS|4.0|First off, this album absolutely rocks. <br /> <br />Nevermind the allegations that these boys riffed without remorse from their 'influences' (fruitfully, at times, I may add)...sure, the components are there, but they've been synthesised into something that's totally fresh and needed, like a shot to the arm of today's pop-rock/alt rock drivel. <br /> <br />So what if 'All these Things that I've Done' contains one of the most nonsensical choruses in pop history ('I've got soul/but I'm not a soldier')--it rocks and it's friggin' beautiful.  I haven't been blessed enough to see these boys live, per se, but I did catch them on PBS's Austin City Limits (of all things).  Boy, I gotta tell ya, when those gospel singers filed onstage with mics in hand only to belt out that forementioned silly chorus, I started leaking.  Really.  Friggin' beautiful, that's all I gotta say  (and no, I'm not being sarcastic). <br /> <br />From the '50s horror film synth phrase that should've been played with full effect with a therimin ('Smile Like  You Mean It') to the Morrisey-like delivery of  'Change Your Mind', to the Cure-esque synthcapades of 'Believe Me Natalie,' these boys are all over the place.  Good thing is, every patch of homage or subconcious sampling takes on a mind of its own and the listener is left with some mighty fine post alt pop-rock. <br /> <br />Trust me.  I hate new music (it's still 1993 in my head) but this one stands out, and stands tall.  Sure to satisfy both younger altie-types and older folk like me who've since lost faith in commercial music.
B00009W0U4|5.0|I heard about this movie from a friend and I am a huge fan of foreign films. What is so fascinating about foreign films is that they have so much more freedom to work with, Hence leading me to this beautiful film \\"Irreversible\\". Now Gasper Noe is a brilliant director, the way Irreversible is shot comes into play with the movie. In the opening scene, the camera work will make you feel dizzy, its similiar to merry go around and a roller coaster, so i didn't like that part not too mention i hate theme parks. Anyway Gasper Noe filmed the movie like this for a reason, just from the opening scene you feel very uncomfortable. Gasper Noe is successsful in maintaining this uncomfortable atompshere throughout the entire movie. Without giving too much away, the movie focuses on revenge and how it starts. As for the graphic scenes, hence, the brutal murder scene and rape scene are also shot very well. The murder is very graphic, does not compare to any American Film. It looks realistic. The infamous rape scene is also very graphic. I have seen many rape scenes in plenty of movies, such as Strawdogs, Showgirls, Leaving las vegas, last house on the left, you name it. What makes this rape scene important is the message it delivers and let me tell you Gasper Noe gets his point across. Since the movie is shot backwards, you kind of seeing it comming and know its gonna be bad. The real important message that Gasper Noe was trying to deliver is how time destroys us. One second you can be having the greatest time of your life and in another second you can be raped, humiliated and left for dead. The irony in this rape scene is that Alex played by Monic Bellucci was walking homr from a party when she was told by a prostitute to take the underground tunnel, Why?? \\"Because it safer\\". As a film critic like myself, this movie really shows how much American Film makers are limited. We tend to adjust to the overly sensitive. Unfortunately American Film Makers will never have this type of freedom, but we can rely on Gasper Noe to deliver beautiful films like these. Now heres my reccomendation, if you want to see a true-master piece, that is not going to hold back and really deliver what the director  intended to deliver then by all means rent this, but if you have a weak stomach and enjoy hollywoodized movies that apply to the overly sensitive then stay away from this one.om, but we can rely on Gasper Noe to deliver beautiful films like these.

All his tracks just soothe the mind and brings back memories of Bob. Khaki suit is one of the best reggae/dancehall tracks i have heard in a long while and all his other tracks spread a great message.

If you're \\"ready\\"...this is a great experience.
0345350499|5.0|this book changed my life. i have never read a book so rich in theme, plot, imagery, history, culture, and the aspects of life. fillied with love, hate, lust, anger, jealousy, duty, loyalty, and pain; this book touched me and there were many times i started crying just out of the sheer beauty of the story. this is my all time favorite book and i highly recommend it to everyone!
B0002OOUP0|4.0|I prefer this compilation over Disk 2 from \\"Forty Licks\\" for a couple of reasons.  First, there are fewer edited versions of songs.  \\"Beast of Burden\\" is the same edited version on both disks but \\"It's Only Rock 'N Roll\\", \\"Emotional Rescue\\", and \\"Undercover of the Night\\" are not edited here, unlike on Disk 2 of \\"Forty Licks\\".  Second, this collection includes the excellent \\"Waiting On A Friend\\" and the solid \\"Rock And A Hard Place\\" (though an edited version here).  Other songs included here but not on \\"Forty Licks\\" include \\"Harlem Shuffle\\", \\"Respectable\\", \\"Bitch\\", and \\"Hot Stuff\\".  The first song is a pretty decent cover, the next 2 are just okay, and the 4th song stinks.  This collection would have benefitted from having \\"Shattered\\", \\"She's So Cold\\", and perhaps one or two songs from \\"Voodoo Lounge\\" (you would have to change the '93 to '94 in the title, of course).  Overall, this is still a solid collection of 70's and 80's Stones Hits. <br />
B0007Y08QA|5.0|Christian Bale is an excellent actor who deserves much more credit that he receives from both the critics and views alike. I mean he started as a boy in Speilberg's \\"Empire Under the Sun\\" (watch it and be amazed at his acting skills even then) and starred in such groundbreaking roles as \\"American Pyscho\\", and yet he is often overlooked when great actors are mentioned.  This movie should move him up to the top of the list.  Here he delineates a character to such a powerful degree that sometimes I simply stared at the screen in disbelief.  I hardly recognized him at first, he was so skinny that every bone showed......please let that be the product of some Hollywood magic?  The storyline is eerie and compelling and recounted so many times here that I will leave it alone.  The dialogue is smart and every character is well played (even if Jennifer Jason Leigh has the downtrodden prostitute role down to a science).  Although I loved this movie and gave it 5 stars, I do have one complaint.  I felt this movie reminded me too much of another film (not going to name it outright & make you think the same thing other to say a Ed Norton vehicle) which affected my initial viewing to a point.  It had the same dark and brooding cinematography and the plot seemed to follow similar lines; however, upon another viewing I realized how original this movie was and how it stands alone as a great piece of filmaking.  You really do not want to miss this film.  This is definitely a movie that you will talk about with your friends.....or even strangers.
B0007GAERG|1.0|This album is so dull and uninspiring I would have fallen asleep listening to it if it weren't for the screechy, grating and annoying voice of this wailing banshee. I miss the style, elegance and finesse of the diva that was the Mariah of her Tommy Mottola days. Miss Carey has not, in my opinion, aged well.

I know we all get old but we don't have to get stupid. I thought you quit drinking? Oh well you can laugh all the way to the bank, after all George W.

0800177363|5.0|BEWARE: SPOILER ALERT!!  I am an enormous fan of Robert DeNiro's. He is one of the greatest actors of all time, in my opinion. However, sometimes both that reputation and the showiness of a particular part overwhelms all the other performers in a particular film, robbing those performers of notoriety that is well deserved.  This is especially true in Awakenings. DeNiro plays Leonard Lowe, a man who awakens from a 30 year coma, experiences life in 1969 New York, then tragically slips back into that coma by the end of the film. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences loves to nominate performances like DeNiro's -- namely those where the actor has to simulate mental retardation, physical disabilities, fatal diseases or other handicaps. Some of these nominated performances are truly deserving of recognition, such as Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot, Leonardo DiCaprio in What's Eating Gilbert Grape and Tom Hanks in Forest Gump. However, many of these performances are not, such as Jodie Foster in Nell (Janeane Garofalo did a devastating parody of her performance on Saturday Night Live) and Ali MacGraw in Love Story. DeNiro's performance in Awakenings is much more of the former than the latter -- he is always good and his performance in this film is no exception. However, to me, the truly great performance in Awakenings is by Robin Williams.  Williams plays DeNiro's physician, Malcom Sayer, a dedicated caring doctor who nonetheless is a shy, introverted loner who admits to Leonard at one point that he is &#34;not good with people.&#34; In real life, Williams is so extroverted and so manic that in many of his performances that personality leaks out and intrudes on the characters he plays on film. In Awakenings, however, he completely submerges that persona and is 100% believable as the almost hermit-like Sayer. The central theme of the film is that Leonard Lowe, who has lost so much because of his affliction, is nevertheless living his life with ten times the gustothat Malcom Sayer, who has no afflictions other than his shyness, is living his life. If Williams is not absolutely believable as Sayer, the film falls apart, no matter how believable DeNiro is at portraying his character's illness. Williams is a wonderful actor who uses his comic gifts and manic personality to great advantage in his best work -- e.g. The World According to Garp, Good Morning Vietnam, Good Will Hunting and Insomnia. However, this is Williams' first peformance where he is forced to completely submerge his own character and he succeeds brilliantly.  However, when the Oscar nominations were announced for 1990, DeNiro was nominated and Williams was snubbed. Indeed, when the film was released, all the friends I spoke with marveled at DeNiro's performance but didn't say anything about Williams. It's too bad. To be sure, DeNiro is excellent in Awakenings, but Williams' performance is a revelation.
B000BOH8XW|5.0|Yes this album can be considered as the english Donde Estan Los Ladrones?, Shakira's back to what she's really good at, Rock music! This album is more likeable than Fijacion Oral Vol 1 but I think Vol. 1 is unique and is more variable which makes it really good. This album is way better than laudry service. All the songs are amazing even the english renditions of Dia Especial and En Tus Pupilas. The standout tracks her are How Do You Do, Illegal featuring Santana, Animal City, Dreams For Plans, Hey You and Timor!    BUY this CD Now!
0767821769|1.0|Julia Roberts plays Ed Harris' young new wife. Susan Sarandon plays Harris' ex-wife. Ex-wife does not like new wife. New wife does not like ex-wife. Ex-wife's cutsey, but bratty kids make new wife's life a living hell. Ex-wife thinks new wife is a stupid bimbo. New wife thinks ex-wife is a nagging battle axe. New wife and ex-wife fight and yell at each other ad nauseum. How does the film solve this conflict? Ex-wife is diagnosed with terminal cancer -- everyone reconciles, ex-wife and new wife suddenly love each other ... the end. Nothing like a convenient disease-of-the-week solution in lieu of a well-written, plausible resolution to the conflict. This is one of the most cliched, saccharine and shamelessly manipulative pieces of garbage put out by Hollywood in the past decade. All of the acting talent in this film is wasted in support of a lazy, hackneyed screenplay that cheats its audience emotionally. If you like Julia Roberts, Susan Sarandon or Ed Harris, please see Erin Brokovich, Dead Man Walking and The Right Stuff and run screaming from this nauseating cinematic catastrophe.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|Possibly the finest debut film by a new comer ever. Richard Kelly delivers a brilliant film about a troubled teeneager named Donnie Darko.<br /><br />Donnie Darko is a trouble maker who has problems at school, home, and his emotional problems. In the beggining of the director's cut we find donnie lying in the middle of a road with his bycicle laying right next to him, we then see our first look at donnie, but he doesn't get freaked out about where he is, he just simply smirks like it never happpened. We then get an idea of what sort of person Donnie is. In the original version, as he is riding his bike back home we hear a song by echo and the bunny men titled 'Killing Moon'; instead we hear 'Never Tear Us Apart' by INXS. I'm not necesarilly reviewing the DVD yet but just telling you some of the stuff they took out and some of the stuff they put in, so moving on, we get extra classroom scenes where donnie is reading poetry and the classroom getting new books due to the banning of a book by graham greene containing a short storie about boys who wage destruction on an old man's house.<br /><br />In this director's cut, we also get small little things that make the movie more appealing, for example, when donnie is dreaming or waking up to find frank (the rabbit), we see a sweet visual of donnie's one eye with reflections and info on his eye, it's hard to explain, but I wont ruin anything else for you so I'll shut up about the extra footage onthe director's cut.<br /><br />Now the review:<br /><br />I've seen the original, so I reccomend you rent the original theatrical release version first to decide which one is worth more for your purchase. This film is about a troubled but brilliant young man named donnie darko. He is a trouble maker who has to see a psychiatrist due to recent brushes with destruction and various problems to why he does them. He is also a victim of a sleep walking problem to where he goes missing every now and then. One night he is told to wake up by mysterious voice, he then obeys the voice and follows it to where he tells him to go, he eventually ends up at a golf course where a giant bunny rabbit informs him that the world will end in the period of 28:06:42:12.<br /><br />While donnie is at the course his troubles begin to thicken when a jet engine lands in his bedroom, no one knows why or where it came from. Donnie then begins to start obeying what frank tells him to do, because he saved his life. So then the movie really starts to kick off when donnie starts finding out about the mysteries of time travel, frank, and if the world will really end in 28 days.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is surprisingly good, and has a brilliant cast of actors and actresses to pull off the brilliant characters of Richard Kelly's script. The directing and cinematography is awe inspiring with great directing and visuals.<br /><br />And as for the soundtrack, the music is mezmirising and absolutely brilliant, music and original score. So to sum it all up, I Highly reccomend this extraordinary piece of film to anyone who knows and enjoys good cinema. Enjoy.rious voice, he then obeys the voice and follows it to where he tells him to go, he eventually ends up at a golf course where a giant bunny rabbit informs him that the world will end in the period of 28:06:42:12. <br />While donnie is at the course his troubles begin to thicken when a jet engine lands in his bedroom, no one knows why or where it came from.

And where do they receive their training to perform such incredible feats as diverting runaway meteors on the way to earth or defeat monsterous robots attempting to destroy the city? At Sky High that's where!<br /><br />Join young Will Stronghold (Michael Angarano), son of Commander and Jetstream the two most famous and powerful superheroes of all, as he heads off towards Sky High orbiting high above the Earth to begin his freshman year at this training ground for tomorrows superheroes. However young Will is not as happy as you might expect. You see unbeknowns to his parents or any of the other future superheroes Will has yet to discover his superpower. Will he be able to follow in his parents footsteps and become a 'Hero' or will he be demoted to the role of 'Sidekick?'<br /><br />Put on your mask and tights and prepare for action. This is great family entertainment to be enjoyed by all. So release the superhero within and let the fun begin!<br /><br />'Sky High' features a great ensemble cast consisting of both knowns and lesser knowns. Kurt Russell gives a wonderful tongue-in-cheek performance as Steve Stronghold a.k.a. Commander. Kelly Preston really doesn't get to say much but does looks lovely in her Jetstream costume.<br /><br />Michael Angarano follows up his supporting role in 'Lords of Dogtown' with a strong performance in the lead role in 'Sky High.' Also worthy of mention are; Danielle Panabaker as Layla, Steven Strait as Warren Peace, Lynda (Wonder Woman) Carter as Principal Powers, Bruce Campbell (Army of Darkness & Xena) as Coach Boomer, Kevin Heffernan as Ron Wilson/Bus Driver and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as the beautiful but evil Gwen Gracen.
B000BP86OG|4.0|When I read that Roy Thomas Baker was set to produce the Darkness second album I was excited. Who'd be better a choice to produce a group that wanted to revive and update the sounds, style, musicianship and the fun of 70's/80's Classic Rock and Metal than the guy who crafted such great albums as Queen's \\"Night at the Opera\\", Journey's \\"Infinity\\", The Cars classic debut Lp and Cheap Trick's \\"One On One?\\"     While the choice of RTB was a very well chosen and inspired one, his big over-the-top production style leads to some mixed and unfocused results on the Darkness second album. Unlike \\"Permission to Land\\" the musical emphasis is now on the rock-pop side than the raw hard rock/metal side.    The title track is where the Roy Thomas Baker/Darkness union works perfectly. If you admired RTB's productions in the past, you will really love Track 1...\\"One Way Ticket\\" uses many of RTB's trademark production techniques and tricks for a knockout effect: 1) A dense drum mix sounding similar to the one on Foreigner's \\"Head Games\\" LP. 2) flanging effects from Journey's \\"Infinity\\" album. 3) And what could be the highlight of the whole CD - a HUGE mass choir of overdubbed Justin's screaming \\"...AND BACK!!!\\" (Queen!) at top volume. Despite a strange pan flute opening and sitar solo this is still a great track to kick off the CD.    \\"Knockers\\" follows, but despite some fine guitar and piano work, the one line chorus seems to be a letdown after several funny verses. Sorry it just doesn't seem to ignite for me, maybe it will with later listens.    \\"Is it Just Me?\\" is a upbeat Power Pop-Rocker very similar in tempo and style to \\"Growing On Me\\".  The harmonies and the \\"Ooohs\\" on the choruses are goosebump inducing. I hope this one is picked as the second single, it's my favorite track on this CD so far.     \\"Dinner Lady Arms\\" also has a great melody and another hook-filled chorus - but RTB's expensive production starts letting me down here - the band sounds a little too relaxed when they should be really rocking out hard here. Interesting use of Pete Townsnend-like guitar picking on the verses.    \\"Seemed Like A Good Idea At The Time\\" is an impressively written song with restrained singing by Justin. But the mix (the orchestra is too loud) drowns out all the guitars, leaving the song sounding flat and without any punch. The limp guitar solo and the huge production makes this song sound exactly like a 80's \\"Hair Band\\" ballad by Nelson - great if you like those kinds of songs, but not for me. If Atlantic decides to release this for a single, I hope someone gives a good \\"Rock Radio\\" remix and turn down those damn strings.     \\"Hazel Eyes\\" sounds like a unholy gangbang of Thin Lizzy and Zeppelin with Queen (naturally) on top. Nice use of UK folk influences with an interesting Brian May-like guitar opening. Lets see some of those Nu-Metal bands try something like this and make it work.     The joke of \\"Bald\\" will probably be lost on those Ipod downloaders who will never check out those lyrics. The genius of the Darkness is Justin and company can make you laugh and rock at the same time - not too many bands can pull that off. This song is really the only track where the Darkness truly equal the headbanging hard riffing of their first album.    \\"Girlfriend\\" is a total \\"360\\" from \\"Bald\\" - It's a simple and silly song showing off Justin's love for 70's bubblegum pop and...disco? A hot guitar solo would have worked better here than the cheap casio synth solo that almost ruins the whole song. It's the bomb of the CD.    \\"English Country Garden\\" reminds me of very much of Sparks' mid 70's Island records period - very hyperactive and a the lyrics are a real hoot!     Freddie Mercury and more Queen influences abound on the big closing ballad \\"Blind Man\\". This is a very pretty song but I agree with others it's a very strange, morbid and way too serious way to end this record. It's seems out of character for this fun loving party band (or on the other hand - it could be another one of Justin's musical put-ons).     To wrap it up, I'm a little disappointed in \\"One Way Ticket..\\" Though the group has expanded their sound while keeping their whimsy, humor and style intact they have smoothed down the rawness of their debut CD, replaced with a slicker production with over-ambitious arrangements on many tracks. On those songs, The Darkness would have been off better to keep things simple like they did on the first album than show fans and critics how clever they can be with RTB behind the boards.     Despite a flawed performance, this CD is still a very worthy follow up to \\"Permission to Land\\" for Classic Rock and Darkness fans. Maybe this CD will be the right \\"Ticket\\" to propel the band into the USA Top 10 for the first time. (update, it didn't)     Just be prepared to Rock a little less harder on this second trip. 3 1/2 Stars..

B000683VI4|5.0|This movie is absolutely breath taking! they couldnt have casted 2 better people to play Noah and Ally. This movie puts tears in my eyes every time i see it and that is many times. I introduce everyone to this movie and even men like it. Its just so beautiful and really touches you. I cant even explain to you how much this movie affected me. Just as much or more than Titanic affected me. Everyone should have a love like that and the actors had the best chemistry. It helped also that they werent that well known yet when they did this movie. It made it seem much more real and you felt like you were experiencing their love with them. The actors portrayed those characters with perfection! Girls fall in love with Noah and the guys fall in love with Ally. I think everyone should see this movie. It really makes you feel so many emotions and really put love and life into perspective. Definitely recommend this movie. It deserves more than 5 stars!  <br />I heard that Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams were dating in real life! How perfect!  <br />

B00005221M|2.0|This was among the top ten favorite movies and at the top of my DVD wish list.  Upon receiving the DVD, I popped it into the DVD player.  At first, while viewing this wonderful movie, I thought there was a glitch in the DVD since one of the very best parts was missing and part of the sound track was gone...a very beautiful and haunting song as the captives are marched away, pursued by their rescuers.  I finally figured out that the whole scene was gone, making the scenario very choppy and frankly, it ruined the rest of the movie.  I am VERY SORRY I ever ordered this movie on DVD.  I want my VHS copy back!!!  Since I gave it away, and not being an Indian giver (no pun intended), I am absolutelyn furious.  I advise anyone who is a fan of the original movie...DON'T waste your money on this poor example of a movie!!!
B00000K31V|4.0|eXistenZ is an exploration of reality and virtual reality, wherein characters run from realm to realm, landscape to landscape trying to beat a game they know not the goal of or exactly where it's leading them. Within that virtual reality game is more layers of virtual reality games, calling into question which reality they arrive from is the \\"real\\" one.<br /><br />Of course it's not spectacular at hiding the fact that it's not going to reasonably answer to a true reality, instead tossing the idea of whether it's real or a videogame into question even up to the end. I'm not even sure Cronenberg pretends that twist won't be there, it's so incredibly obvious in a sense it's kind of disconcerting.<br /><br />The problem with this film though is its base nature, in a sense. Cronenberg is questioning reality AND criticizing game play. Yet the same things that he uses to criticize gameplay makes him revel in it: the violence, the discontinuity, the lack of focus and in a sense, the pixellation even if there isn't such pixellation in the film. I have once heard someone state that Cronenberg's violence is actually a criticism of hyperviolence in media, but he hides that well with the fact that he derives such incredible pleasure in ripping new orifices into humans, animals, and amorphous piles of biological sludge.<br /><br />What IS brilliantly written and done about this movie is the use of videogame conceits (not being able to say exactly what you want to say during cut scenes, relative lack of surroundings or surroundings that don't make sense, only a few people around where it feels there should be many and vice-versa, all of that stuff) along with the motif of penetration. It definitely deconstructs the videogame reality in a way that's nauseating and absurd, but it does it even better by replacing videogame electronics with literal \\"pods\\" of biological matter that squirm and shift and are, frankly, disgusting to the one of the most horrifying degrees. For what it's worth, this film causes a reaction in you.<br /><br />But what for? It criticizes virtual reality, but it's a movie: it is its own virtual reality. It seems to criticize the banality of videogame plotlines and character design, yet it maintains that banality. It definitely seems to worry over whether killing a videogame character is more okay than killing an actual human being and how videogames can be confused with reality and cause people to not think about the consequences of their actions in real life, and yet I say again, it derives the utmost pleasure from ripping people, objects, beasts, things, and organisms into bloody shreds.<br /><br />So whereas it has a key focus of angst, it doesn't really do anything with it, not really. Only what it does do is present that angst in such an original way it can't really be denied its own moment of splendor.<br /><br />In a sense, it'd be much easier to just hate this movie for being gory and violent, because there's no good reason I can see for loving it and yet I can't disregard it as mediocre or bad. It'd be easier to simply not be able to take it, but since I can, there's nothing I can really do with it. I do believe it is a little excessive, it really didn't need to go as far as it went, but Cronenberg's intentions are so mixed up and confused I don't know if that was Cronenberg's flaw or Cronenberg's point, and I don't think there's really any way to figure it out except maybe ask him directly.<br /><br />--PolarisDiBt's worth, this film causes a reaction in you. <br /> <br />But what for?

0975991477|5.0|The Biology of Belief is one of the best books I have ever read. Bruce Lipton is exactly right when he talks about quantum physics and the unconscious mind being at the helm our our life. I teach stress management and I see this all the time. People caught up in their own unconscious beliefs holding them back, keeping them from attaining their hearts desires. Healing is within our grasp all we have to do is overcome our understanding of the western alopathic model, bring in new understanding of the interaction of wave forms creating havoc or wholness.  <br /> <br />Paul Haider--Author of \\"Relax Into Success\\"
B00003CXCT|5.0|I bought this boxset about a year ago now and have watched it many times over.  It  brings all three of the original films together in one amazing boxset ! The extras are fantastic and I watch them time and again.  The only one thing I would have like to have seen would be the option to watch the original films without the new add-ins that Mr Lucas felt he had to add to them.  But then I do love the new bits too so I shouldn't complain ! <br />This is a fitting boxset for an amazing trilogy !! If you haven't bought this it is worth every penny.  Buy from Amazon for a good price too !  <br />
0307263118|5.0|It is difficult to understand some of the criticism in the popular press about this book.  The complaint that \\"nothing happens\\" is valid if one is reviewing a thriller or a mystery where the purpose is the plot.  If one is reviewing a beautiful character study like the one Mr. Banville has produced with this novel, then such criticism makes no sense.<br /><br />In The Sea we have the story of Max Morden.  He has retreated to a house next to the sea where he used to spend childhood vacations to grieve for his wife who has recently died.  Interspersed with his memories of his wife's last days and his encounters with the current denizens of the house where he is staying are Max's recollections of his first childhood love and her rather strange family whom he met on a long ago vacation.<br /><br />That is basically it for the plot.  But it is such a story told so well with such sumptuous and evocative language that it is easy to lose oneself in the words.  It is very reminiscent of (though much briefer than) Proust.  Magnificently, he evokes the inner life of his character.  And if Mr. Banville occasionally shows off a bit with his vocabulary; well, it is easy to forgive him because he's not blatant or mean about his brilliance.  It merely seems to flow out of the story.<br /><br />It is also unfair to give short shrift to the plot of The Sea.  Though most of what occurs happens in Max's memories, the multiple stories are woven together well, the many characters are fascinating and the style gives the impression of almost a stream of consciousness.  In addition, Mr. Banville leaves some unexpected revelations for the end of the story that, in the hands of a lesser writer, might appear to come out of left field but, in this case, flow logically from the characters Mr. Banville has drawn.  This is an extraordinarily well-constructed novel.<br /><br />Booker Prize winners almost never disappoint.  This one certainly does not.  It is one of the best novels of the year.ar.
B00005JNTX|4.0|This is the film version of the Frank Miller Graphic novel and it shows. If you could take the graphic novel into the theater with you, you could read along. There are shots straight out of the book on the screen.<br />  It helps to be a fan of Frank Miller's work when you go see this movie. The movie has some great scenes and dialogue. Marv steals the movie, IMHO. Most of the movie is in black and white (as the comic). This is a beautiful movie to watch. It has a little Pulp Fiction feel to it as the stories intertwine (also, Bruce Willis is in the movie).<br />  The stories in the movie are all very gritty, violent and dark, mostly about people driven by revenge. A woman killed, a cop set up and jailed...not very hard to follow but made interesting by the way they tie together. All the acting here is well done and Frank Miller makes a cameo as a preist. Miller was given co-director credits and the way the movie mirrors the graphic novels, almost shot for shot, he deserves it.
B00005JOHI|5.0|It is my sincere wish that Jane Austen readers and non-readers  not miss a big screen viewing of Joe Wright's \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" because they let themselves be influenced by negative comments from the Ellen Jamesian sect of the Jane Austen society.  Particularly odious are those presumptuous enough to declare that Austen herself would consider the film a disservice.   Attempting to discourage potential viewers in this manner reveals not just a staggering conceit, but an utter cluelessness about how to read a film and about the power of a visual medium.      This film adaptation of Austen's classic is the first one to fully capture its essence within the economical and efficient package of a two-hour feature film.  And it does so in a technically proficient way (cinematography-production design-editing); with perfect physical casting, excellent directing and scene staging, and fine performances from the entire ensemble.   In isolation it is simply the best film ever made, but because it is not an original screenplay the critics have downgraded it a bit from A plus to A minus (their acknowledgement of the debt it owns to Austen).      Jane Austen once said,  \\"an artist cannot do anything slovenly\\".   Joe Wright's film is not perfect but it is the least slovenly in cinema history.  I was reminded of this by the film's treatment of Georgiana, Darcy's sister.  Georgiana was a minor but extremely important character in the book.  Elizabeth's point of view observations of Darcy's tender treatment of his shy little sister is how Austen shows Elizabeth's first realization that Darcy is worthy of her love.  Initially I was disappointed that Georgiana only has two brief appearances in the film, but on reflection I realized that the scenes had been staged and scripted so well that they said everything  needed about the relationship dynamics of the three characters.    The film successfully brings Austen's ironic (insert comic here) observations of character and manners to thescreen.  As the title proclaims, this story has a double theme, the pride of the aristocrat prejudicing the middle class heroine against him.  But as Elizabeth explains to her father in my favorite scene, she and Darcy are the flip sides of each other as her pride has long blinded her to Darcy's efforts to overcome the prejudice of his class to hers.    The film also captures the more critical macro element of Austen's novel, the idea of a generous humanness that can transcend the motivations of social class.  Society is imperfect and while the social order encourages foolish prides and mean prejudices, it also enables kindness, affection, and courage.  In the film's movement of events there is a modulation between vices and virtues in which the latter more than mitigates the former.  This was Jane Austen's primary \\"value\\" which I think  would have formed the basis of her judgment and ultimate approval of the film.    Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.
B000001ESP|5.0|Say what you will about Rush. Say that Geddy Lee sounds like a tortured cat. Say that Neil Peart needs to go on Ritalin. Say that no matter how difficult it is to play in 13/8, no one wants to hear the results. But please do not say that this album is anything short of a masterpiece of technical virtuosity and pop sensibility. <br /> <br />The title says it all. I can think of no album that matches \\"Moving Pictures\\" for the sheer excitement and velocity it generates. The band makes full use of the clean production and electronic effects that the studio affords to create the polished sound necessary to convey music of this nature. One can sense the joy that all three members of the band must have experienced while making this record; there is nary a misplayed note, but never does the record sound restrained or stagnant. <br /> <br />The excitement which permeates \\"Moving Pictures\\" begins with opener \\"Tom Sawyer.\\" As the song opens, one can sense the anticipation in Neil Peart's meaty time-keeping and Geddy Lee's confident lyrical introduction of the song's hero. The tension builds as Alex Lifeson enters, and Lee continues to sing until proclaiming that his \\"modern day warrior\\" is \\"riding out the day's events - the river!\\" and the floodgates open. Peart sweeps across his drum kit and a foreboding bass riff transitions to the temporarily stationary chorus. After the second verse, the song explodes into a bombastic celebration of instrumental prowess, as Peart adds tasty rhythmic variations to his beats, moving the band effortlessly through complex time signatures. A warm-up for things to come.  <br /> <br />The second song, \\"Red Barchetta,\\" is equally compelling, relating the tale of the joyriding in an illegal vehicle. As we listen, we feel as if we are in the car as it \\"eludes the eyes\\" of a Big Brotheresque government. We sense that the thrill of the drive is so great that it temporarily dispells the fear of the consequences of being caught. The song's gentle opening hooks, coupled with the fury of Lifeson's revving guitar and Peart's maniacal drumming create a truly dynamic listening experience. <br /> <br />Next is the brilliant instrumental, \\"YYZ\\" followed by \\"Limelight,\\" the album's crown jewel. The opening riff, mocking standard arena rock fare, soon gives way to a simple verse, transitioning ultimately to the calm, comforting and ethereal chorus and boasts a strangely warm hook, as it conveys the surreality of concert performance. \\"Limelight\\" is perhaps the best example of Rush's ability to marry lyrics perfectly to music, providing a brief moment of exhuberant living in the mundanity and loneliness of touring. Truly one of the greatest songs of rock and roll. <br /> <br />The remaining three cuts are similarly excellent. \\"Camera Eye\\" is an epic with comparative vignettes of London and New York, and \\"Witch Hunt\\" is a brooding warning against censorship. The final number, \\"Vital Signs,\\" successfully infuses reggae in a tribute to individualism. <br /> <br />With only 7 tracks, \\"Moving Pictures\\" is a remarkably concise album, but each track is nearly an album in itself. \\"Progressive\\" as it is, the album never abandons its pop qualities, making its math rock entirely accessible. A glorious celebration of life, the individual and motion, it remains among my favorite albums, listen after listen.
B000B8QEZG|2.0|The first song \\"Hung Up\\" is to me the classic Madonna sound that I wanted to hear.  This song is a great 80's feel dance song and is definately a five star song.  The rest of the CD sounds like the \\"Ray of Light\\" CD.  If you like the synthesizer sound than you will love these songs... if you don't then think twice before purchasing.  Once I heard \\"Hung Up\\" on the radio I assumed the rest of the CD would have the classic sound.  Hopefully there will be a Confessions II CD.
B000B2YQX4|3.0|With Goldfrapp, Kruder & Dorfmeister and Dave Clarke all adding their names to the highly regarded Depeche Mode Remixes album of 2004, it became blindingly obvious how influential the UK forefathers had been on the modern electro and dance scene. After a lengthy hiatus that saw Depeche Mode frontman Dave Gahan and chief songwriter Martin Gore go head to head with solo albums (Gahan's Paper Monsters was decent, Gore's covers album Counterfeit2 was a stinker), Depeche Mode have finally reconvened for the first studio album since 2001's rather unexciting Exciter. <br />Playing The Angel ain't no Songs Of Faith And Devotion (heck, it doesn't even have the abrasive industrial strength of Ultra), but Gahan, Gore and Andy Fletcher at least have the common sense to trade on past glories in lieu of moving forward.  <br />Although recovering addict Gahan puts his name to three of the 12 songs after two decades of Gore penning the Depeche Mode canon, his songs rarely match the quality of his more experienced bandmate. Gore still appears enraptured by the ideas of love, religion and temptation, with the results at their most effective on the single Precious, the reworking of the traditional religious tune John The Revelator and The Sinner In Me, which finds Gore seemingly expressing recovering addict Gahan's feelings by proxy. <br />As dark and Depechey as longtime artistic collaborator Anton Corbijn's sleeve designs, Playing The Angel is best summed up by Corbijn's subtitle for the album - `pain and suffering in various tempos'.
B0002OOUP0|4.0|Pretty good album, although it doesn't include all their hits it has plenty of good music to rock out to, good basic intro. album.  My only comment is that IT IS WAY CHEAPER AT TARGET!  They have it for $9.99, as was alot of the other items I purchased on my last big order.  I am cool paying comparable prices, but when all was said and totaled, I lost $ buying online at amazon.  I am sure I will still shop here but was just bummed that I got played thinking amazon had better prices.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Love it, a must for all the Madonna fans out there, and the ones trying to get in!! Thanks for another great album Madonna!!
B000B7BRMM|5.0|Look past the \\"I can't believe I ate the whole holiday turkey\\" expression and pose on the front cover...not classy at all, I hate to say. But, we're not buying a photo, eh?  <br /> <br />The smile is back in Ms. Krall's voice with this instant classic Christmas album. Yes, \\"Girl in the Other Room\\" was a bit depressing, but consider the time she was going through and make a note that it has been chronicled by that album. There's a lot of playfulness in not only her voice, but the superb piano playing that graces this marvelous CD. \\"White Christmas\\" is one of the best arranged of any that I've heard...and, I've got an extensive Christmas music collection, dating back to a stack of vinyls from my parents' collection from the 40's and 50's. Ms. Krall brings back the beauty of these old standards...no unnecessary frills, pure beauty, class and old-fashioned stylish jazz. <br /> <br />Whoever made the choice to include \\"Count Your Blessings\\" on this CD should be given an extra special Christmas present. A wonderful choice that reminds us all of what the season is REALLY supposed to be about. There's a sweet sentimentality in Ms. Krall's voice...just a hint sadness that will touch your heart.  <br /> <br />Folks, give yourself a present this Christmas and add this CD to your collection...you won't be disappointed.
B000B8QEZG|1.0|Terribly comercial and disposable. The kinda music you use to rest in the dancing clubs. If that was her comeback trial, it won't work.
0887307280|2.0|There's a few good ideas in this book. The best that a business should be thought of as a product you develop so that it can run without you. These good ideas could have been summed up in about 10 pages. Instead the author goes off on tangents that are 100% unrelated and he tries to show off how good he is at crafting literary prose in little fictional stories. VERY DISTRACTING. All the raving reviews could only be a hoax.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Let me just start off by saying that if you didn't like \\"ray of light\\", you may not like this record. It has that same sort of synth sound, you know what i mean? In any case though, one thing is for certain; this is one of madonna's best yet. If you're a fan (who isn't), you NEED to have this record in your collection. Don't download either, it's worth the $$$.
B000AM6MKU|5.0|This movie seems to be one of those you either love it or hate it but I think time will be on this movies side and will be a classic for years to come. The fact that the animation is not perfect with the children gives it a nice edge that I think works well for the dreamy quality of the movie. It gives the movie a more picture book kind of feel. The train scenes are stellar....you can feel the power of the polar express...the scenes with the ticket/wolves and eagle over the waterfall is worth the price of the dvd alone and is one of the most fantastic animation scenes I have watched. Tom Hanks really steals the show. He has the passion for the parts and will be a big reason why this becomes a classic. The scenes in the locamotive while the train is on the ice is fantastic. I don't see how anybody with a pulse in their body can't be impressed by the power of the polar express. I do agree that it is best watched with a youngster. Me and My 3 year old boy loved it and are happy that we will have this movie to share together for years to come.
B0006GVJEE|5.0|This film is one of my favorites for many reasons. Although it is an action movie with great action, it also has alot of emotion and feeling. I think many action films lack much of that sometimes. The story is classic but also has a unique twist. I would highly recommend it! Don't get the edited version. It's better to see fully.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Let me get this started by saying that at first I was NOT a fan of Muse and didn't want anything to do with them. One day I was watching TV and a video came on, and I listened to the music and loved it, and it was a cool video. I saw that it was \\"Stockholm Syndrome\\" by Muse, and I realized I had been a tool for not giving them a chance. The next chance I got, I went and bought Absolution and here's my song by song review- <br /> <br />1) Intro- Basically just footsteps and some guy yelling, only meant to lead well into the first actual song. <br /> <br />2) Apocalypse Please- Awesome song, starts off with Matt banging the hell out of a piano, playing a very eerie but cool piano part. Cool lyrics, cool song and I love the \\"End of the World\\" theme. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />3) Time Is Running Out- The closest thing to a pop song on the album, but still an awesome song. Some fairly cheesy lyrics early on, but a great, catchy song. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />4) Sing For Absolution- Absolutely bone-chilling, but also amazingly beautiful. I love this song. Great lyrics, beautiful piano playing and Matt really shows off his voice well in this song. 8/10 <br /> <br />5) Stockholm Syndrome- This is the song that turned me on to Muse. Fast paced, pretty heavy rocker. I love the lyrics, the guitar part, and the bassline. This song really blows my mind. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />6) Falling Away With You- Possibly the most beautiful and tender song on the album. The intro sounds almost like a lullaby, very nice lyrics though. Once the chorus comes around, everything explodes into an amazing earthquake of sound. Great song. 9/10 <br /> <br />7) Interlude- Ummm... kinda cool sounding, but not really a song... leads well into my personal favorite track on the album. <br /> <br />8) Hysteria- This song kicks off with a positively kick-ass, heavily distorted bassline. Great song, definately the best song on the album, this is the song that made Muse big in America, and this is as good as it gets. 10/10<br /> <br />9) Blackout- Gorgeous, classically inspired, slow, but powerful song. Very nice song, though it's extremely slow paced feels a bit odd after the psychadelia of Hysteria, but nevertheless, a nice addition. 7/10 <br /> <br />10) Butterflies and Hurricanes- Starts off slow, but really explodes later on, another stand out track, though for some reason it took a while to grow on me. Wonderful piano interlude right before the last chorus. 8/10 <br /> <br />11) The Small Print- Interesting lyrics, very cool guitar part. Good, solid, fast paced rock song. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />12) Endlessly- Entrancing, gorgeous ballad. Very powerful. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />13) Thoughts of a Dying Athiest- Cool subject for a song. I love it, another rocker along the lines of The Small Print. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />14- Ruled By Secrecy- My least favorite track on the album. It's pretty, but doesn't leave much of an impression. 6/10 <br /> <br />Overall, this is an amazing album. I never thought I would like Muse, but once I got this album, I HAD to buy the rest of their CDs. (I reccomend all of them) Matt has the most incredible voice of any guy in rock and roll today. He is also a brilliant pianist, and very talented guitarist. Chris Wolstenholme is one of my favorite bassists, he always plays exactly what the song calls for and Dom's drumming is always solid. This album is a must have.
B000BM6AVA|4.0|Guitarist Daron Malakian talked about how during this writing process for Mesmerize/Hypnotize they wrote sum 80 different songs. Unfortunately that kind of shows. These albums are both great but theyre lacking something on their debut and Toxicity. Its as if they should have concentrated on writing better a little more complex songs. These albums are great but could have been greater
B00005NWM3|5.0|I don't normally listen to rock anymore but after watching the Photograph video it prompt me to listen to their other songs.  I bought this cd and \\"All the Right Reasons\\" and I just love the sound of this guy's voice and the way the band plays guitars.  I can't live without their music now!
B000002UA9|4.0|this, their first album,isn't the greatest debut.it does have some classics though.the beatles are my favorite band and i firmly believe that they are the best band of all-time,but even i can admit that this isn't one of their best.
0380018179|5.0|Not directly, never met him, but his positive comments in Danse Macabre compelled me to dig up this 1970's mega-hit when otherwise I'd probably never have done so. This novel is among my favorite works of modern fiction. Despite its being set in Australia, it reminds me a lot of the very best in US southern gothic. The tale here is much bigger than the \\"priest breaks vows with fetching Irish girl\\" that so many seem to focus on. Sure, that's an inescapable part of the plot, but what really made this story for me was its sweeping scope. The Thorn Birds begins in New Zealand in the early 20th century and concludes, after spanning the world, in Australia in modern times. Between the points of its beginning and its ending, a reader trails along on a ride that covers all that is mighty in the human experience. It is the story of one family's unlikely climb from poverty to social heights, and it is the tale of a gifted cleric whose unique communion with God is not severed by the extremes of his far-from-amoral conduct. There is much to love in The Thorn Birds, and the characters are magnificently created by the brilliant Colleen McCullough. There is passion in this book, and there is the undeniably gruesome. Tragedy is always lurking and appears when it is least expected: or wanted. Above all else there is a statement here, I think I'm correct in defining, regarding the nature of human life, and how in the end not one of us can ever achieve our fullest measure by dwelling strictly in happiness alone. This was the best sort of novel, one like Gone With The Wind, or Lonesome Dove, that took me completely by surprise with the wonders of its heights and its depths.
0671015206|5.0|I think anyone rating this book poorly should note his or her age and net worth with their comments.  I believe very few 'millionaires' would rate this book as non-sense, a waste of time reading, or bad financial advice.   I have heard, and give merit to, the thought: \\"Only take financial advice from those that have a greater net worth than yours\\" -- generally speaking that is.  Yes, there are those that have made millions, went on to lose it, and perhaps made it back.  But that's not what this book is about.   It is about everyday people with ordinary incomes, working, saving (or not), spending (or not), conserving (or not).  It is about 'get rich slow'.  It is uneventful in technique but startling in facts and real numbers.  At times it is dry - listing statistics, facts & figures.  But there is a message in numbers.  A method where anybody, with any income, can put themselves and their family in a better future position than the 'average' person.  It is casework of how the reader can move to become financially 'above average'.      <br />
B000B5XOYI|4.0|While those of discriminating tastes may want to purchase their favorite Batman films separately instead of getting them all, it is kinda nice to have all of them in one set. It is a fascinating arc of how the franchise started off strong and then got progressively worse until Batman and Robin effectively killed it for eight years until Batman Begins came along. Each movie gets a souped up, special edition makeover.<br /><br />Each movie features a wealth of supplemental material including a theatrical trailer, Heroes and Villains mini-profiles (that mix clips from the movie with interview soundbites from cast, crew and pundits) and a multi-part retrospective documentary entitled, \\"Shadows of the Bat: The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight.\\"<br /><br />Batman features an excellent audio commentary by Tim Burton who kicks things off by addressing the criticism fans had back in the day that given his background he would make a movie closer to the goofy `60s T.V. show. He loved the show but wanted to go back to the original comic book and place an emphasis on the scary psychology of Batman. The filmmaker covers all the bases including the challenges of dealing with the studio, problems with the script and replacing an injured Sean Young with Kim Basinger on short notice.<br /><br />\\"Legends of the Dark Knight: The History of Batman\\" is an excellent look at the legacy of this enduring icon with the likes of Harlan Ellison, Frank Miller and Kevin Smith talking about what makes this character work so well.<br /><br />\\"On the Set with Bob Kane\\" features a brief interview with the man who created Batman. He talks about how he came up with the concept and gives the Burton version his approval.<br /><br />\\"Shadows of the Bat\\" is broken up into three parts and traces the development of Burton's film in great detail. Many of the major players in front of and behind the camera contributed new interviews, including Keaton, Nicholson (who is in fine form), Basinger and even Sean Young! Coupled with Burton's insightful commentary track, this is an excellent look at how the movie came together and the challenges it faced.<br /><br />\\"Beyond Batman\\" is comprised of six featurettes that explore all the technical stuff: production design, props, the Batmobile, the Batsuit and the music.<br /><br />\\"Batman: The Complete Robin Storyboard Sequence.\\" Originally, Robin was to make an appearance in a chase sequence between Batman and the Joker but it only made it to the storyboard stage.<br /><br />Finally, there are three music videos by Prince that are dated but interesting to watch nonetheless.<br /><br />Batman Returns features another relaxed commentary by Tim Burton who praises the cast and goes into detail about his intentions with this movie. \\"The Bat, The Cat and The Penguin\\" is a making of featurette done back in the day and hosted by Robert Urich. There is a definite emphasis on the three lead actors with some good on-the-set footage.<br /><br />The fourth installment of the \\"Shadows of the Bat\\" takes a fresh look at this movie. In a refreshingly candid moment, Burton addresses the criticism of too many villains in this movie.<br /><br />\\"Beyond Batman\\" features a collection of featurettes that explore various aspects of the movie, taking us through the incredible scale and scope of a production this size.<br /><br />Finally, there is a video for \\"Face to Face\\" by Sixousie and the Banshees. These veteran Goth rockers were the perfect match for Burton's sensibilities.<br /><br />Batman Forever features an audio commentary by Joel Schumacher. He still can't believe all the uproar caused by the nipples on the Batsuit. Amazingly, he claims that some Warner Brothers executives did not want him to cast Kidman because she wasn't sexy enough!<br /><br />\\"Riddle Me This: Why is Batman Forever?\\" is a promotional featurette hosted by Chris O'Donnell and done at the time of the film's release. There are the usual cast and crew soundbites that feature everyone gushing about the movie and their characters.<br /><br />Part Five of the Shadows of the Bat documentary features Schumacher, Kilmer and O'Donnell back for new interviews as they try and defend the choices they made for this movie.

B00006L7XQ|5.0|This is a review that I felt compelled to write since I saw the film \\"Walking the Line\\" starring Joaquin Pheonix as the man in black. I am heavy music fan, but country music doesn't really appeal to me. The only exception is this man. He is a genius. This album, his final opus, is one of the most interesting and melancholy of his efforts. My parents, both older and around during Cash's era, picked up this album the week it came out and bought a second copy for me, since I always liked his standards, \\"Walk the Line\\", \\"Ring of Fire\\", \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\", but my parents, both ex-folk singers, were blown away by this masterpiece.  <br /> <br />Some of the songs are not his, some are. All are fantastic in their own way because they are performed with such razor sharp honesty and gutwrenching love. His renditions are so unique and sad because that's what he was, but really this album is his last take about life before death. These songs are carefully chosen because the man is coming to peace with his own death. He knew his time was coming and these songs are his way of expressing the human condition, \\"The Man Comes Around\\" - Revelations. \\"First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\" - A song for his beloved wife. \\"Sam Hall\\" - A middle finger to all those who hated him. \\"Personal Jesus\\" - A nod to his baptist roots and his own relationship with religion. \\"We'll Meet Again\\" - His final, loving wave goodbye to us all here on Earth. You can go through all of them and see their connection with his remarkable life. All of the songs are so deeply raw and sung with that tinge in his own inimitable way and with the sadness and urgency a person has when a final moment is at hand.  <br /> <br />Here is a final performance, stripped down and brutally beautiful, of a weathered and long travelled man, full of feeling, mistakes and insight.  He's not in his prime but it's okay. He's just himself, old, cool, grizzled and touching. He lived an extraordinary and full life, and influenced so many great artists, even Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis. This is a must for any Cash fan but would be liked by many who only know \\"Ring of Fire\\". To those just reading reviews, take a chance on this one. It will definitely grow on you, like all of his other music. An instant classic.
0061015725|3.0|As with many Crichton books, this one has an interesting premise based on a few nuggets of science. When we finally get real nanotechnology working, it could well pose more threat than promise. \\"Gray goo\\" isn't really new territory for science fiction, but Crichton's depiction of the manufacturing process and software and biology background here are impressive and instructive. The \\"nest\\" where the nano-based creatures are reproducing is also impressive, though far less believable. <br /> <br />The novel is severely marred by the first-person perspective. There's no real character development, and the facets of the character that are shown are poorly integrated. Unfortunately here the narrator and prime actor is a perplexing figure, in many respects unreal, though Crichton tries hard. If he still loves his wife, why does he seem to have no regrets at the tragic ending he himself brings about? If he's so smart, why does it take him such an awfully long time in the book to see what is obviously going on around him? <br /> <br />And the plot itself has many elements that are hard to take seriously. Self-organizing nanoparticles are one thing, but the way they develop day by day with one behavior after another is quite unbelievable; even more so at the end when behaviors of another sort in cooperation with humans are revealed. What possible purpose would such a progression have for the organized nano-creatures? Crichton seems to be pushing concepts of evolution through selection pressure, but it cannot possibly work at anywhere near the speed he depicts here. <br /> <br />But the book is certainly an interesting read, and doesn't disappoint in the way of suspense and plot, despite the unreality of much of the situation that comes up. Not a bad effort, but it's not going to give me any new nightmares about \\"gray goo\\".
B00003CXBH|3.0|La pelcula, La Misin, fue muy fuerte y triste a la vez.  Los eventos de la pelcula son verdaderos y ocurrieron en Amrica del Sur en el ao 1750, en las fronteras entre Argentina, Paraguay, y Brasil.  La pelcula empieza con una escena de un sacerdote jesuita de mrtir encima de una cruz.  Las indgenas guaranes lo pusieron en el ri y en poco tiempo cay de una cascada grandsimo.  Cuando el jefe de la iglesia oa de este, mand otras jesuitas al pueblo donde la jesuita de la primera escena fue matada.  Una de las jesuitas, Padre Gabriel, se aventur a la selva y pudo convertir a las indgenas al cristianismo. <br />  <br />Por un tiempo las indgenas vivan en paz, pero finalmente los mercenarios y comerciantes de esclavos vino.  Entre ellos fue Rodrigo Mendoza.  Rodrigo estaba enamorado de Carlotta, una mujer de su ciudad.  l pensaba que ella estaba enamorada de l, pero en realidad ella estaba enamorada del hermano de Rodrigo, Felipe.  Ella le dijo esto a Rodrigo y l se puso enojado.  Fue loco cuando cogi a Felipe y Carlotta haciendo el amor.  Despus de atraparles, Rodrigo mat a su hermano.   <br />  <br />Despus de la muerte de su hermano, tena remordimientos de conciencia.  l se puso deprimido y no pudo hacer nada.  Padre Gabriel se encontr con Rodrigo y los dos pensaban de caminos en que Rodrigo podra compensar de su pecado.  Padre Gabriel trajo a Rodrigo a su misin a San Carlos y en el camino Rodrigo llev una bolsa de armadura pesada arriba de una montaa. <br />  <br />En tiempo, Rodrigo convirti al cristianismo y se puso un sacerdote jesuita.  l ayud construir y mejorar la misin de San Carlos.  Haba pocos cambios de los territorios portugueses y espaoles.  Un cambio, la misin San Carlos estaba el territorio de los portugueses en vez de los espaoles.  El jefe de la iglesia visit a unas de las misiones y decidi que las misiones no estarn protegidas de la iglesia espaol porque ahora estn en el territorio de los portugueses. <br />  <br />Los portugueses queran que las indgenas regresar a la selva y dejar de la misin.  Las indgenas no entendieron por que tenan que dejar de su hogar.  Decidieron que no dejarn sin luchando.     <br />  <br />Esta pelcula me pongo muy enojada y triste.  Quera llorar.  Cuando realic la realidad que cosas como ocurrieron en la pelcula todava ocurren hoy me pongo furiosa.  La pelcula me hizo odiar seres humanos.  No entiendo por que unos piensan que son ms importantes y mejores que otras personas.  Fue difcil para yo ver el maltrato de las indgenas.  Por la otra mano, me gustaba el cambio que ocurri en Rodrigo - fue como noche a da.  Este es un testimonio del poder de Dios.  Recomendara esta pelcula con certeza. <br />
B000BNTM96|4.0|This DVD is a must for any level of fan.  The fact that you get both a DVD and a CD of live material is worth the price of admission.  Good song selection on both discs with sound and video that's pretty decent as well.  My favorite is the bonus part of the DVD as you get to see other incarnations of the band at various times in the ever evolving QOTSA lineup.   <br /> <br />With this in mind I was a bit disappointed with the main DVD portion as I've been a bit bored with QOTSA on their last 2 trips to the DC area supporting Lullabies to Paralyze.  They've definitely lost their edge but hopefully they'll recover.
1593082010|3.0|It as a truth universally acknowledged that Jane Austen, in possession of a good novel must be in want of a reader.<br /><br />Undeniably one of the greatest authors in classic literature, Austen begins her classic masterpiece, Pride and Prejudice, with her renown truth. Ironic, amusing and romantic, Pride and Prejudice still offers many delights for the modern reader. Whether it's flighty Lydia, brooding Darcy or the imperial Lady Catherine, you can fall in love again and again with her diverse cast of characters.<br /><br />Pride and Prejudice is essentially seen through the eyes of Elizabeth Bennett, second in a line of five daughters, gifted with a dry wit and clever conversation. The novel primarily follows her and her sisters movement though the social sphere of the 19th century, though social climbing, manners, and the strict regulation of \\"proper behavior\\". When Jane Bennett falls for Mr. Bingley, the fur starts to fly and Lizzy and Jane are forced to fight for each other and for the men they love.<br /><br />While Austen's text captivates and seduces, this edition constantly diverts the reader with it's countless footnotes. While these could be beneficial to a reader unfamiliar with British Society, the definition of \\"Militia\\" and its explanation of the significance of Gretna Green bordered on insulting. Though the quotes and opinions on the text in the back of the book were interesting and refreshing, the sheer magnitude of footnotes (generally explaining something well-known or easily inferred) distract greatly from Austen's stunning success.<br /><br />While Pride and Prejudice in itself is a work deserving far more than five stars, this Barnes & Noble edition cannot qualify such a rating.
8408059688|5.0|We can rate books based on literary wisdom or entertainment, but rating this book for me is based on miracles. I got it on a two day flight to Lourdes-Tarbes in the Pyrenees and had no idea the book would reflect lots of the things we think are fiction. They are not. I have been with a person that listens to a voice, I have listened to that voice myself but moreover I was in search of the \\"happiness\\" that the book approaches in a simple but profound way. It is not a matter of rating a book with El Zahir, it is a matter of rating your own life. If you can honestly respond with an affirmative answer to the question \\"Are you happy?\\" then you should not read the book; for the rest of the world I would say it is a \\"must\\". <br /> <br />
B000B8QEYC|4.0|After listening to the entire album, and having every track ever released by Enya.. I must say that this album is not as pleasing as her previous releases.  HOWEVER, this album has several gems that are insanely stunning.  Ironically enough, the opening track `Less than a Pearl` is simply put:  AMAZING.  I absolutely love it. <br /> <br />The second gem on this album is deceiving, I didnt appreciate it until I gave it a careful listen -- `Sumiregusa,` is beautiful. <br /> <br />When I first heard `Its In the Rain,` I couldnt help but laugh as it has a slight Cranberries/Madonna similarity.  The song is nice though. <br /> <br />`The River Sings` shares some similarities to past work, but is still very much unique. <br /> <br />Even though I wish Enya would release more albums that are more similar to the first three, I still appreciate each and every release -- each album is special and has very unique tracks.  It doesnt matter if releases come every 5 years, 2 years or 10 years -- I am content.  The peace, emotion, inspiration and detail that Enya puts into their work is so amazing, it truly is artwork for me. <br /> <br />ps:  I just wish there were more tracks like Caribbean Blue, I dont think there will ever be an Enya track that surpasses that one.
B000B8QEYC|4.0|Like many people have stated before, Enya's music hasn't really changed all that much since she first started.  From THE CELTS all the way to her very latest AMARANTINE, she's pretty much stuck to the same formula, if you will.  For a longtime fan such as myself, that's ok with me!  For I've yet to become bored or tired of her music!  The timeless lush, spiritual, atmospheric melodies and harmonies that Enya and company produce still resonate with me after all this time.  The only thing different she's done for AMARANTINE is that for three of the songs (\\"Less than a pearl\\", \\"The river sings\\", and \\"Water shows the hidden heart\\"), she sings them in Loxian, a completely ficticious language that both Enya and her lyricist Roma Ryan created.  Also, \\"Sumiregusa\\" is sung entirely in Japanese.  Anyway, hats off to Enya for yet another masterpiece!
0517548232|5.0|\\"Economics In One Lesson\\" by Henry Hazlitt is a book with an appropriate title.  Within the first chapter, Hazlitt reveals the fundamental fallacy committed in the study of economics, the common mistake of seeing only the direct consequences of a proposed course, rather than considering the longer and indirect consequences of an action.  This is the one and only lesson presented by Hazlitt in this book.  Throughout the remaining chapters, Hazlitt applies this lesson to various economic situations such as minimum wage laws, international tariffs, government subsidies, war economies, government spending, inflation, labor unions, and government price-fixing.  Hazlitt presents specific examples of these various situations in which he applies the \\"one lesson\\".     <br /> <br />This book has been written in such a way that is free from technicalities while remaining accurate so that it can be easily read and understood by a reader with no previous knowledge of basic economic principles.  Hazlitt's claims remain logically consistent throughout each major issue discussed in the book.  Hazlitt expresses his points clearly and precisely while providing sound, deductive arguments to support his claims.   <br /> <br />In this book, Hazlitt discusses the most central issues of economics and explains them in such a way that can be easily understood by a reader with no previous knowledge of basic economic principles.  This book is very well written and very easy to read.  \\"Economics In One Lesson\\" is a book that I would recommend to everyone, from the professional Economist to someone who just wants to be introduced to the fundamental principles of economics.    <br />
B000BYA5GO|2.0|I guess this is supposed to be some inditement of the International Arms Market & Trade, when it can direct it's plot as it wanders around in it's own little world. Don't find fault with my opinion personally, I have no more agreement with the atrocities that occur on our dear Planet Earth than any other rational being, but this wandering fairy tale is a waste of time. From all the P-R Hype issued for this thing, I thought it was a comedy along the lines of \\"Deal of the Century\\", but, instead, it plays out as some kind of war story written by some Vestal Virgin from Vassar who, in her sheltered, RichBitch life, has never personally witnessed real violence, nor even seen, much less handled a real weapon! The writers evidently got all their technical information and most of their historical background from R. Lee Ermy on History Channel's \\"Mail Call\\" or from Soldier of Fortune Magazine!<br /><br />A die-hard Cage fan might want to see this not to miss something he appeared in, but, overall, \\"National Treasure\\" was a FAR GREATER entertainment value, as well as just as close to reality!<br /><br />Oh, by the way, INTERPOL is a STRICTLY intelligence-gathering entity, and does not have ANY ENFORCEMENT POWERS WHATSOEVER, much less fielding the SWAT Teams that appear in this fairy tale. If one does not believe me, go to their own website [...] and read it for yourself.<br /><br />Also, I just can't see ANYONE doing multi-million dollar weapons deals without at least half-a-dozen hardline armed & armored bodyguards to watch the cash & trash!<br /><br />If you want to see a REAL War Story, go see \\"Great Raid\\", a far greater example of reality. Otherwise, save your money, 'cause \\"Lord of War\\" ain't even worth the price of a matinee ticket. I almost asked for my money back!<br /><br />The ONLY reason I even gave this TWO Stars is the \\"surprise\\" ending, which, with the ending text, contains MOST of the truth and entertainment of this two hour+ visit to FantasyLand!
B000A3DFZE|2.0|Eric Clapton is my favorite musician.  Period.  So needless to say I always look forward to a new EC album.  It seems, however, that after winning a million Grammys for Unplugged, Eric has forgotten how to rock.  Don't get me wrong, I love some of Eric's acoustic work.  Unfortunately this album sounds like something an artist puts out when they are contractually obligated to put out so many albums, and the record company is pestering you for something...and you just want to get them off of your back.  Hopefully the recent reunion with Cream will inspire EC to return Back Home...to rock.
B0007OCG4W|4.0|I think the markedly mixed (and multiple) reviews for Closer underline what a classic it is - if it appealed to everyone, then it would just be another Harry Potter, and just as profound... <br /> <br />It's part-funny, part-sad to read the reviews slagging off the characters for their supposed shallowness - maybe it's just shallow me (and my friend) but we were both shaken by this unflinching and rather brave portrayal of modern manners. <br /> <br />To some extent I wonder if the critics protest too much... what are they afraid of I wonder? Or perhaps it's just me, and everyone I know, who can draw personal parallels. But then we are Londoners. New Yorkers would never act like that, surely?
B000001F3C|5.0|This is U2's third official commercial release and it's a gem.  A spectacular follow up to \\"October\\", the group's sophomore effort, \\"War\\" is the last of what many call the \\"first phase\\" of U2's long and glorious career, before we find the group moving in a different direction with \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" album that was to follow. <br /> <br />First off is the anthemic \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\".  Just pure power and energy.  Other classics (in my opinion) include \\"New Year's Day\\", \\"Like a Song\\" (don't know why, but never received any airplay), \\"Two Hearts Beat as One, and \\"40\\", the latter of which, even today, is played often to close out the group's live sets. <br /> <br />This is the album that put U2 on the map, in America anyway.  New Year's Day got heavy play on MTV back in the day (1983) as did \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\".  The group's popularity would then shoot through the roof.  If you don't have \\"War\\", go get it.  After only a couple of listens, you will rank it as one of your all-time favorites! <br /> <br /> <br />
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I love this cd.  If you loved the movie, you will truly enjoy listening to this cd.  My only complaint is the order of the music.  I wish they were in order.  Other than that, it's perfect.
B000001FA4|5.0|\\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" commences U2's post-\\"War\\" direction and what a direction it is.  It's first with production team extraordinaires Brian Eno and Daniel Lanios, this album includes some excellent cuts such as \\"A Sort of Homecoming\\", \\"Pride (In the Name of Love)\\", \\"Wire\\", \\"Bad\\", and the title track, \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\".  \\"Indian Summer Sky\\", which never received any airplay, is solid.  But there are some forgettable cuts like \\"4th of July\\" and \\"Elvis Pressley in America\\" that prevent me from rating this five stars.  All in all, a very solid release and one that should be added to your U2 collection.
B00005JO1G|1.0|This movie must have been directed and written by the Hollywood <br />America haters.  As a Marine Combat Veteran, I think this is a discracefull portrayal of our young men.  Of course, some producers like to portray things as they would like them to be rather then as they are.  Don't go see it!
B000AP04FG|4.0|This movie works very well as a comedy.  I was laughing throughout the entire film right up until the last spoken words.   <br />   <br />  Highly recommended for a good time!
B000B8QEYC|1.0|Unmistakably Enya! So much so that I've heard it all before in her earlier albums; every track reminds me of some track of her earlier works. Lyrics are generally childish. <br /> <br />I count myself as a big fan of Enya, but this is definitely not her best work. Not on par with \\"A Day Without Rain\\" or \\"The Memory of Trees.\\" Only memorable track for me is \\"Long Long Journey\\" and that, probably, because it reminds me so much \\"On My Way Home\\" (one of my absolute favorites). <br /> <br />Count me as disappointed.
B00000J2SR|4.0|It's disappointing that as I write this review, Bent Out Of Shape is only being offered used. After many years I've come to realize that it is one of the better Rainbow albums. Produced by Deep Purple/Rainbow bassist Roger Glover in 1983, Bent Out Shape made it to #34 on the charts thanks to heavy rotation of the video for Street Of Dreams on MTV. When I got the cassette I did not listen to it as much as I should have. But with a lot of formula music out there these days I find myself going back to 70s and early 80s rock. Anyways, there are several excellent tracks like Stranded, Drinking With The Devil, and Can't Let You Go (the other single with a great church organ intro). I also love the two instrumentals, Anybody There and Snowman! Both have great emotional melodic guitar from the master, Ritchie Blackmore. Snowman has a beautiful relaxing melody played on keyboards. Apparently both Richie and singer Joe Lynn Turner wanted to do another album together but due to a sly manager who wanted to see Richie back in Deep Purple, this never happened. They did do the decent Slaves and Masters (Deep Purple) together with Roger but that would be seven years later.
078681859X|5.0|I'm reading book 1 and 2 again while waiting for Ptolemy's Gate. Can't wait!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Serenity was an amazing movie.  I watched Serenity in the theaters not expecting much and I was blown away from the very beginning! So much of science fiction is such crap that it was a surprise watching a movie that was well thought out and had genuinely clever dialogue.  You can tell that a lot of love went into the making of this movie. This is what the new Star Wars trilogy should have been.
0553801503|3.0|Hmmm... mixed feelings. Is it a great book like the previous three or...?  <br /> <br />Like a lot of others I anticipated this book like no other before - almost weekly checking Martin's website for updates on the publishing date. To be honest: after 5 years I expected more and better. Clearly he has been at a loss how to continue and what to write to get where he wants to go (assuming he has some ultimate ending in mind already).  <br /> <br />What's wrong with this book?  <br /> <br />First of all, the decision to tell the whole story for half the characters in stead of half the story for all the characters was a bad one. Like everyone else I especially missed Jon, Dany and Tyrion. You can't help but wonder what is happening simultaneously with these characters. A Dance with Dragons will likely be more interesting if only because everybody's favourite characters are included, but we already know nothing much will happen in that book either - for instance: if anything would happen in the North (with Jon or Stannis or the Wildlings) with consequences for the rest of Westeros we would know about it. No news must mean nothing much happens.  <br /> <br />The fact that nothing much happens doesn't need to be a bad thing. There also where good things in this book, I'll get to those later. But I think if this one was edited a little more carefully, there probably wouldn't have been a problem incorporating these POV's with the missing ones into one complete book. Maybe I'll get the meaning of the Brienne storyline on a re-read or after reading the next books, but now I thought it was just boring. Once again someone (like Arya in book 2 and 3) aimlessly travelling the riverlands only to.... If the whole point was to show the whereabouts of some minor characters and ultimately to (re)start the zombie storyline - I could have done without it. But again: maybe I'll get the point later on.  <br /> <br />The choice to use minor characters as POV's and then only once or twice wasn't really a lucky one in my opinion. No character development, which was one of the strong points of the other books. Why use Arys or the Captain while Arianne is present or around as well? The same goes for the Iron islands; Martin should have chosen one POV and stuck with it. The switching around gives a little (and unnecessary) incoherent feel.  <br /> <br />Another thing which got to be a little annoying at times where the too numerous passages of houses, heirs, lineages, loyalties etc. Enough is enough! <br /> <br />What's good? <br /> <br />Martin's writing is second to none and you get drawn in anyway, despite any of the misgivings mentioned earlier. Unlike some others I especially liked the addition of Dorne  - I think it should have been explored (and 'exploited') even more. Being related to the Red Viper should have been clue enough, but I sure want to see more of the Sand Snakes and Arianne and characters like the Darkstar as well. We'll see where Quentyn is going and what is going to come of it... Lots of potential here! <br />  <br />Conclusion: <br /> <br />This is still a very good book by any standard, but in this series unfortunately it clearly is the weakest link thus far - therefore not four but three stars. Let's hope the story picks up again and it doesn't take a couple of years of waiting for the next book!  <br />

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly has a very goofy premise - a true space western that at times is part Bonanza, part Battlestar Gallactica (but without Lorne Green).  Yet the show works! <br /> <br />I recall stumbling on the show during it's original airing, and being a little put off by the overt space western theme.  Yet I eagerly looked for the show the following week..and the next...and the next. <br /> <br />Compelling characters are a Joss Weadon hallmark, and Firefly is no exception.  If you are only checking the show out now because of \\"Serenity\\" movie publicity, I think you will also feel the sense of loss of such a high quality show taken from us after too few episodes.
B000BO0LLS|1.0|it was horrible~~~i regret having bought this with my money...it was not worth it!!!
0553801503|2.0|After waiting a *horrendously* long time for this book to come out, I was sorely disappointed . . . It's a shame that Martin and the publishers have decided to sacrifice quality for the bottom line (as so many industries do these days).  Overall, the story is OK -- I finished the book in one week, often breezing through certain chapters just to get through them because the story was moving way too slowly.  I hope \\"Part 2 -- Dance with Dragons\\" is better and completes this truncated story.  It ends at an awkward point, not the usual cliffhanger that leaves one salivating for more.  When I had finished reading his previous book, I was in a hurry to read the excerpt from \\"A Feast for Crows,\\"  this time, upon finishing \\"A Feast for Crows,\\" I didn't even peek at the preview for the next book.  I think I'll wait until it comes out -- sometime in the next 5 years.  Then, I'm going to do what I did this time -- I will buy the book from B&N, and return it unscathed in a week so I don't contribute any money to this bottom-line obsessed industry.
B000AGTPUK|4.0|I do not believe that there are any books that are so sacred that they should not be made into a movie.  But I did have some reservations about bringing Chris Van Allsburg's delightful picture book \\"The Polar Express\\" to the big screen as a computer animated film for two reasons.  The first is that half the charm of the original are Van Allsburg's exquisite pencil drawings.  I knew there would be something lost in the transformation from black & white to color.  The second is that the other half of the story's charm comes from the simple story it tells and unlike the massive amount of cuts that had to be made to bring \\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\\" to the screen\\" writer-director Roger Zemeckis had to add a whole lot to the original story.  This risks losing the simple message in all the dancing waiters and train rides across the ice.  What I would have loved to have seen would be a half-hour television special, shown without commercial interruption, where CGI is used to preserve the look of the original (to wit, this generation's version of \\"The Snowman\\").<br /><br />That being said, this version of \\"The Polar Express\\" is delightful in its own way even if you do not find it to be as magical as the book.  The story is of a young boy who has reached the age of doubt, where he is about to decided that Santa Claus is not real.  That is when the Polar Express arrives at his door and he discovers he has a ticket in his pocket (not the pocket with the hole in it but the other one), a magical train that will take him to the North Pole to find out the truth for himself (when the train appears out of a cloud of steam and snow is the point in the film that best captures the spirit of the book).  The train is filled with other children and there are minor adventures to be had, both on the journey and when they arrive at their wonderful destination.  Tom Hanks lends his voice and ethos to not only the Conductor, but also the Father, the Hero Boy, the Hobo, Scrooge and Santa, which essentially makes him as much the narrator of the tale as several of the characters.  That is important because there really is a sense here of a story being told that is a key part of the dynamic.  Like most Christmas messages, this is one that has to be passed along each year so that people remember it and keep it in their hearts.<br /><br />I have no problem believing as a general rule of thumb that anybody who has not read the book would have no problems adding another star to their rating for this 2004 film.  The computer animation is pretty good and this will undoubtedly becoming a favorite for both the young and the young at heart.  Final note: I am coming to terms with the fact that you have to wait about a year for Christmas movies to come out on DVD.  Certainly this is the time of year to want to watch and buy such things, but it always seems strange to think that I was interested in seeing this movie a year ago.  Then again, \\"Miracle on 34th Street\\" was actually released on May 2, 1947, so go figure (but that is the official movie of Thanksgiving, even with Santa as a pivotal character).Santa, which essentially makes him as much the narrator of the tale as several of the characters.

B000AP04FG|4.0|John and Jane Smith (Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie) have been married for five or six years and are having some marital problems.  Their life has become routine and boring.  They've fallen out of love.<br /><br />What they don't know is that each of them has a secret.  In fact, it's the same secret.  Both of them are assassins who have been hiding what they really do from each other since the moment they met.  Their respective bosses have figured it out, however, and their next assignment is to kill each other, or become a target together.<br /><br />To be honest, I was intrigued by the premise, but really knew nothing else about the film.  I was almost turned off by the gossip surrounding the leads, but went with some friends to see it anyway.<br /><br />We loved it!  This is a black comedy with lots of action and suspense.  And great one-liners.  We laughed ourselves silly at the dialog from the very first scene.  The funniest scene by far was the scene where John and Jane were fighting around their house.  Their lines were exactly the opposite of what they were really feeling, but the actors did a great job of delivering the lines in a way that captured the absurdity of the situation.<br /><br />That's not to say the movie isn't without some flaws.  The beginning, while laying much needed background, is also a little slow.  And the climax is completely unbelievable.  Still, this isn't a movie to be taken seriously.  If you watch it looking for logic, you will be disappointed.  If you disengage your brain, you'll enjoy a fun time.<br /><br />The DVD features the standard stuff we've come to expect these days.  In addition to the movie, there are three audio commentaries with various members of the crew, including one with the director.  There are also some deleted scenes and a making of a scene featurette.<br /><br />Those looking for a logical, sophisticated action flick will be disappointed.  Those looking for a good time will be entertained.  It doesn't take itself too seriously, and neither should you.n't take itself too seriously, and neither should you.
B000BPCCZA|3.0|Since this is the Dualdisc version, I thought I should review the DVD side.<br /><br />Put plainly, its not worth the extra money. If you have a nice home entertainment system and have a great sound system for your DVD player, the enhanced stereo version of the full album on the DVD is nice, but the behind the scenes documentary is stupid, and I was very disappointed, and the videos for _BYOB_ and _Question!_ can be found on TV.<br /><br />If it matters at all, get the regular version for the album art on the disc.
B0000648WZ|5.0|This film is based on a good book from an excellent science fiction writer (Robert Heinlein).  The folks who worked on this movie deserve a lot of credit for a job well done.<br /><br />Heinlein was fond of exploring theories of alternate social organization in his fiction.  This film accomplishes the remarkable feat of remaining true to the original story - or at least as true as possible while turning out a good film.  Where the film departs from the book - the end result captures the spirit of Heinlein's work.<br /><br />If the notion of a militaristic future disturbs you, then this film should disturb you.  The future the movie paints cannot (and should not) be dismissed out of hand.<br /><br />Given how often good science fiction books are translated into lousy films - this is a brilliant bit of work.
B000BKDOCA|5.0|Thank You Britney!! This Album Is By Far A Really Good Remix Album. It's Really Fun To Listen To. I Think It Deserves To Be Promoted More Cuz It Is An Upbeat Album. <br />I Suggest Getting This Album... You Won't Regret It All I Promise!!!!

B00005JLYW|1.0|This movie is has so much s*** its unf***ing barable. It has so many over the top crapp-ass moments: Like the motocross scene is an embaressment to all action movies. For no reason that guy from even stevens is there (sorry dude I can't spell your name). And whats worst is they try to ease him in so it makes sense hes there but it doesn't. The women are secret agents but their half-naked in ever scene. If I wanted to see porn I'd go on the 9,000,000,000,000 plus porn sites. The only really atractive one is lucy lew (Sorry if I misspelled her name). The plots embarressing, the acters don't get the charectors, how they get the actual job done is stuiped. It sucks don't watch it.

B000286RZM|5.0|Nick, I was imediately compelled to respond to your review of this album and thoughts on John Frusciante and the impact he has had on your fresh mind of 15 years.    \\"At least once or twice during your adolescent years, you seem to lose hope. I know because I have\\".  I am 24 years old and think I have past those   \\"adolescent years\\" you speak of, and I still sometimes feel hopeless.  But I always have music and other forms of art to fall back on to reinforce that hope; it will always be there for us.  Like you, \\"To Record Only Water....\\" was the Frusciante album that I was first exposed to, through a close friend, and I haven't turned back since.  Unlike you, I became a RHCP fan after I discovered John's solo efforts.  I am responding to your post because of your age and location.  It gives me even more hope that there are not only other JF fans out there who I consider peers, but one's of a different generation and country!  Thank you Nick!  And remember, \\"The sweet, isn't as sweet, without the sour\\"
B000060MWU|5.0|Someone recommended getting the German version from Amazon.de. <br /> <br />I just checked that out... not only do that have the year 2000 German release available for 20 Euros, but there is a new 2005 release of the movie for just 10 Euros! <br /> <br />And we can't get just one US DVD release or even a decent Canadian release? <br /> <br />Of course the German ones are PAL format instead of NTSC. But they do include the original 5.1 English soundtrack and widescreen format.
B000B7BRMM|3.0|As a former jazz pianist I really appreciate the musicianship and voice quality of a true jazz musician -- Diana Krall.  I met her in Escondido in 2001 and was not disappointed -- she's not only a great jazz artist, but a very nice lady.  But, in recent years she's gone \\"commercial\\" as we used to say.  This album jumps around too much -- from full \\"dance band\\" orchestration to quiet ballads.  It's not Diana Krall, the jazz artist -- it's a well-crafted commercial offering for the general public.  It's OK, but it's not the Diana Krall that I prefer.
B000068TPN|5.0|I was three yrs old when the Vietnam War ended for America (1973).  But like everyone in my generation I grew up in its shadow.  A shadow very unlike WW2, which cast an aura of invincibility, unity, triumph and glory.  Instead, my generation came up in the Vietnam War's vicious, hateful, divisive politics that still dominate the national discourse today. <br /> <br />So to me, and the millions of others in their 30's and 40's, Vietnam is both past and present.  To understand today's political climate and ideological animus which drives it, Vietnam must be understood.  But before that, the experience of the men who fought and died 12,000 miles away in places most had never heard of, must be grasped.  And, as other reviewers here have noted, most \\"Vietnam\\" movies tend to concentrate on politics, propaganda or the just plain weird (to this day I'm still not sure what, despite its cinematic phantasmagoria, exactly Francis Ford Coppola was trying to say with \\"Apocalypse Now\\"). <br /> <br />\\"We Were Soldiers\\" eschews all three.  The prism through which Randall Wallace presents his film is the experience of Lt. Gen. Hal Moore (Ret.), Joe Galloway's and the officers and men of the 7th Air Cavalry.  Geopolitics and the macroview are irrelevant here.  As Hal Moore puts it, this is the story of survival, and brotherhood, under the most horrendous things man can do to man.  <br /> <br />As Barry Pepper's Joe Galloway, reporter UPI and co-author of the book upon which the movie is based, tells us, in a voice over at the end of the movie, \\"[The veterans of Vietnam] went to war because their government ordered them to... But[in the end] they fought for each other.\\"  And that, more than anything else, is what this movie captures more poignantly and realistically than any other \\"Vietnam\\" ever has or is ever likely to. <br /> <br />The camraderie of the battlefield is something only those who have survived it can truly understand.  Randal Wallace, the masterful, intensely human Mel Gibson (the irrational, ridiculously petty hatred of him that is expressed by some reviewers mars what are otherwise some good reviews) and the superb cast bring the brutal reality, fear, the blood, death, tragedy, dirt, and the sheer horror as close to the reality as a movie is ever likely to.  Just as \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" stripped World War II of the rose colored prism of Audie Murphy heroics (one is tempted to say \\"melodramatics\\") to reveal what was ultimately an ugly, horrible conflict, \\"We Were Soldiers\\" does something like the opposite.  The Vietnam soldier is FINALLY presented as neither war criminal (\\"Babykillers!\\") or only as a pawn of myopic, idiot politicians, obsessed with the quotidian (though he certainly was that) \\"kill-ratios.\\" <br /> <br />Everytime I watch this movie I find myself feeling deeply moved, the emotions nearly as strong as when I saw the Wall in DC in high school.  As I watched it with my father, who was too old for Vietnam, we both found ourselves in tears.  With stark simplicity this film brings the reality home of what it the was ultimately was about: the men who fought and died in it.  The men who were seared together in a bond of brotherhood that transcended the political, racial and religious divisions that were (and still are) rending our national fabric.  To the soldiers, as Galloway's narration tells us, what they became together was more important than anything else. <br /> <br />If \\"We Were Soldiers\\" leaves you with nothing else, it should be the penultimate image of the airport, where one 7th Cav vet pushes another, wheelchair bound, through the airport--with no marching bands, no crowds of of eager families, no TV news cameras to \\"hail the conquering heroes.\\"  The Vietnam veteran came home very much as he'd left it: quiet and unnoticed.  Though occasionally denounced & insulted, he was far often simply forgotten; he was an unwanted & visible reminder of the tremendous upheaval our society had endured.  The country wanted toforgot that and the easiest way was to forget him. <br /> <br />\\"We who have seen war will never stop seeing war,\\" Galloway tell us, and no movie can be anything but a pale echo of that reality.  But what a deeply moving pathos Wallace and Gibson bring to it! <br /> <br />There is an intangible quality this movie captures what few war movies, and no Vietnam movie, have ever brought tbeen able to do.  If Hal Moore himself, in one of the documentaries on the DVD, can say, \\"[This is] the first movie that gets it right,\\" what more needs to be said? <br /> <br />Watch the movie with awe and gratitude for it gives to the men who fought in the Ia Drang in 14-16 NOV, 1965, what Lincoln did for the men who had fought 102 years earlier at Gettysburg:  a monument so that we can \\"never forget what they [gave]...the last full measure of devotion.\\" <br /> <br />Wallace and Gibson give us a tribute to those brave young men (four of whom won the Congressional Medal of Honor during the battle) that \\"neither adds nor detracts\\" but presents it as closely as any work of art ever can. <br /> <br />I can never know what it was like to fight and die in that place.  I can never know, equally, what it was like to wait, anxious and benumbed, as the wives and families of the men of the 7th Air Cav.  To repeat, nothing can ever give these experiences of those men and women to those who didn't live through, but this movie finally allows me to understand, on some small level, what is was like to be \\"soldiers [then] and young.\\"
B000BOH8XW|3.0|I am a Shakira fan. When it comes to her music I never discriminate: Spanish or English - I like it all! Given the success of \\"Fijacion Oral, vol.1\\" I must admit that I was expecting a very similar, if not stronger, follow up. If you are considering on buying \\"Oral Fixation, vol.2\\" you might want to know that this is no \\"Laundary Service\\" (2001) or \\"La Tortura\\"-hit packed album. On the contrary, there is nothing on Volume 2 that would even remind us of the first volume's success, except the two songs \\"The Day and the Time\\" and \\"Something\\" which happen to be the English reincarnation of \\"Dia Especial\\" and \\"En Tus Pupilas\\" (from vol.1). Nevertheless, who's to say that you need a \\"La Tortura\\" to score a ground breaking album.....is it necessary? -of course not! Ultimately what makes Volume 2 a weak album is not the absence of any adrenaline pumping dance hits but rather the overabundance of melancholic and stylistically similar ballads. There are definitely some ballads on here that will move the most insensitive of people, but unfortunately quite a few of them are rather forgetable and mundane. Having said that, I have to comment that Shakira, despite the repetitiveness of some songs, does write her lyrics very beautifully; her lyrical abilities are far superior from many pop artists who claim to be serious performers. This is by no doubt a very intelligent lady, and her compassion for peace, love and hope are prevalent throughout \\"Oral Fixation\\". If I were Shakira, though, what I would have done with both Volume 1 and 2 is combine them and make one record; that way there's more of a variety and the listener does not run into the trouble of listening to very redundant sounds, rhythm and lyrics. In addition to all that, here is how I break down the album: <br /> 1) How Do You Do (10/10)  <br /> 2) Don't Bother (10/10) <br /> 3) Illegal (9/10) <br /> 4) The Day and the Time (8/10) English for \\"Dia Especial\\" <br /> 5) Animal City (9/10) <br /> 6) Dreams for Plans (7/10)<br /> 7) Hey You (7/10) <br /> 8) Your Embrace (6/10) <br /> 9) Costume Makes the Clown (8/10) <br />10) Something (10/10) English for \\"En Tus Pupilas\\" <br />11) Timor (10/10) <br />***Overall, \\"Oral Fixation, vol. 2\\": (7/10)

Do yourself a favor, though. Don't expect this to be a love letter. <br /> <br />There is some pretty rough stuff going on in this book. Don't be scared, Tony is there to lead you through it. He's not going to hold your hand, though. He's simply going to tell you the truth, plain and unvarnished. He assumes you're at least as smart as him, and for that be grateful. He doesn't dumb anything down, there's no time for that. It's a busy business and there are more important things to do that bottle-feed the slow. Don't worry, you can handle it. Breathe deeply and savor. <br /> <br />See, the professional kitchen is a catchbasin for those who simply can't (or won't) fit in anywhere else. Misfits, half-wits, the criminally insane, it takes a special breed of lunatic to put up with the face-searing heat, the constant abuse from on high, the interminable crush of humanity who simply must be fed. This book is for anyone who truly understands the phrase, \\"If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.\\" <br /> <br />Divest yourself of the image of a chef as a cute little fuzzy-wuzzy and grow up a little. Then you will be able to understand this book for what it is: the truth behind what goes on the the kitchen of your favorite eatery.

0553801503|3.0|There are the many issues with this only being half a book and all that good stuff, but the one thing that I found missing from this installment was any real sense of characterization.  In the first three books, Martin was extremely thorough in making sure that every single character, whether they were some far away lord or a peasant on the street, or a character whose POV we saw every few chapters, was as developed and well-rounded as possible.  Looking through the list of names at the end of ASoS, every single name I saw, big or small, there was a backstory I could remember somewhere in the back of my head.  Each one had loyalties to one house or another, some broken and some upheld, and they had relationships with other characters that, while not exactly relevant to the overall story, you could write at least a short story about if bored. <br /> <br />However, with AFFC, it felt like Martin just threw a whole lot of names in the mix, and frankly the only characters I cared for were Sam and Arya, and those for reasons held over from the previous books.  Brienne, she had conflicting emotions but none were particularly intriguing.  Jaime is plagued by a whole lot of ghosts, but the only time I found his character interesting was when Lady Genna questioned his lineage.  And Nymella Toland?  Who's that?  Why should I care about her?  It seems like he forgot his philosophy from the previous books in which if he introduced five characters on a page, he had better have five pages related to those characters. <br /> <br />I would say that the lack of characterization, more than anything else, contributed to the feeling that this book was just filler and that Martin cared as little about it as we do the Sand Snakes of Dorne. <br /> <br />But with characters like Jon, Dany, Tyrion, Sandor, and Bran in the next installment, I'm not too worried.  I just hope reading this one was worth the effort.

B000BB1MI2|4.0|I remember when I first heard they were remaking the earlier version, and I had mixed emotions.  There was so much potential and so much to live up to, I was worried whether or not they should even try to match the original.<br /><br />After seeing it in theatres the first time, I have to say I was disappointed.  Sure, the visuals were good, and Johnny Depp had a so-so performance as Willy Wonka.  Gene Wilder had just been burnt into my mental images of Wonka.<br /><br />After viewing \\"Charlie\\" on DVD, I must say, it is much better the 2nd time around.  With a little less hype, it was much more enjoyable.  Depp's Wonka is slightly edgier, and his comic-timing is pretty funny at times.  The \\"mumbler\\" line is simply hilarious.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend this as a purchase, simply to see Depp as Wonka.  I don't usually enjoy Tim Burton movies, but this is one of his better movies in my opinion.

0684824906|3.0|Kearns review of Lincoln's political wheelings and dealings is a good overview of what a political genius Lincoln was, but I felt it didn't give a true portrayal of the entire man. I found that Lincoln is a complex figure with many different layers, and I didn't feel I got that from reading this. For a better overview into the complete Lincoln, I'd suggest you read \\"101 Things You Didn't Know About Lincoln: Loves And Losses! Political Power Plays! White House Hauntings!\\" by Brian Thornton. Thornton's done his homework on this one, and I found out many things about the man I never knew, which surprised me since I had considered myself somewhat of a Lincoln historian myself.

B000ASSDVA|5.0|Finally available, and worth the wait.  I saw El Cid when it was released to theatres when I was 15 yrs old. The music is as spectacular as I remember; the sets, the costumes, the location filming are as gorgeous as I remember. Sophia Loren at her prime, Heston at his most noble, heroic and vulnerable. The quality of the DVD is not as good as today's latest computer mastered and restored issues, but this is obviously because no major studio has the courage to properly package and release it.  It was restored and re-released in the early 1990's with a hollywood premiere attended by the stars....then it disappeared. I say courage, because the movie tells the true but 'politically incorrect' story of Spain driving out their Muslim conquerors after 400 years of Moorish/Muslim occupation and rule.  Yes, Ben Yusef was the Bin Laden of 1080 AD, and Spanish men and women of courage and of honor gave their blood to stop his Jihad.  The opening sequence of the movie has Ben Yusef telling his warriors what every cleric/mullah/ayatollah tells their suicide 'martyrs' today when they send them off to kill the infidels: \\"we will conquer the world...go and kill for the glory and honor of Allah\\".  Such truth is too much for today's Hollywood Liberals, lead by the likes of Michael Moore and revisionists of history like Ridley Scott.  It is ironic (or maybe not) that Heston also stars in another revealing portrayal of Islam in 'Khartum'.  As for the technical quality of this DVD: it looks great on my 15\\" laptop, still great on my 27\\" conventional TV - and spectacular on my 56' widescreen JVC, which converts all signals to 1080 lines.  Only a few frames show blurred or fuzzy edges at this size- a video artifact probably - but does not detract from the impression and beauty...the sets - many actual locations - and the outdoor scenes are just beautiful.  I have shown it to several friends, some who never heard of it, and all were impressed. I just ordered a second copy for a gift, and highly recommend it. R. Anderson
B00004VVN9|3.0|At theaters when the sequences with the Brainstorm-apparatus unfold throughout the movie, the ordinary widescreen image streched to full Cinemascope widescreen (originated in 65mm) and stereo sound. The Laserdisc recaptured this experience. This DVD has the ordinary picture in widescreen and LETTERBOXING the special scenes so these are even SMALLER instead of wider. Also there is a 4:3 version where all scenes are 4:3. This film would deserve a special edition supervised by Mr. Trumbull.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|We all may look back on this one day as Madonna's swan song, the final hot-body triumph from our favorite mischief making girl. I went out one recent night to hit clubs in d.c. for the first time in a long time and the whole place was dead. yes, they bang on weekends, but mostly to rap, which ain't bad, but rarely grooves like the school Madonna comes out of. So here, on Confessions on a Dance Floor, she returns to the roots and, even if no one is out there bumping to this (they MUST be, though), it is not a risky move in any way. Why? Because the woman, when seriously motivated to prove something or make a point, has some of the finest cutthroat instincts of any entertainer in history. This album, people, scorches. Madonna has taken the best of the dance-oriented shimmer of New Order, pumped up the beat like it's 1976, and flame-broiled some of the best (and most listenable) dance tracks any of us have ever heard. She is trying to bring the late-night party back from the clammy hands of stone cold George Bush, conservative, war-riddled, earth polluted, globally warmed over haters all and their fear, anger, frustration, poverty, misery and just plain suckiness -- screw the right wing fascists trying to jam their sad world down our throats! We're all tired from the 9-11 fallout, agreed, but we're still alive, dammit, and it's time to take back the night from every single solitary mommy's club, say no to drugs program, AIDs monger, relgious fanatic and oppressor of all stripes, etc., you fill in all the rest of the blanks for me. Then strap on your shoes, get a little high, and head on out. Madonna, God bless you for giving us one of your very best at 47 years young. The whole damn thing is about freedom. Not manufactured propaganda, but real live freedom. This is that magical ideal melted down into a glistening, pulsing sweat off the porcelin skin that still shines and seduces and throbs at the touch. The next time you are feeling paranoid, miserable, watched, hopeless, try to find someone, anyone, and ask them to go dancing with you. And if you can't find a club, put this on in your house, loud, and make the party where you are. That's it, make the party where you are.
B00002Z83J|5.0|I lived in ignorance of Rory Gallagher for a long time until I read an article on him in one of last summer's issues of GUITAR PLAYER magazine.  He sounded like someone I liked so I searched up and down until I found this album.  I can't say I was disappointed! <br /> <br />It's a shame that Rory never caught on in the US like he did in Europe because this is a damn fine album.  With production from Deep Purple/Rainbow bassist Roger Glover and backing from Rory's seasoned touring band, Rory made an album that should've made him a star in America. <br /> <br />This is quite a diverse album.  \\"Country Mile\\" and \\"Secret Agent\\" are uptempo rockers while \\"Do You Read Me?\\" and \\"Jacknife Beat\\" rock at slower beats.  The title cut is blues with a jazz edge.  \\"Moonchild\\" is a minor key rocker in the vein of Glover's bandmate Ritchie Blackmore.  \\"I'll Admit You're Gone\\" and \\"Edge in Blue\\" are gorgeous, melodic ballads and the album ends with the acoustic rave-up \\"Barley and Grape Rag.\\"  The two bonus cuts are good, but seem to interrupt the perfect end \\"Barley and Grape Rag\\" provides. <br /> <br />I'm thankful I read the GUITAR PLAYER article and picked up this album.  Rory was an amazing guitarist, writer, and singer.  If you've never heard his music, give this CD a spin.  For those of us who have heard Rory Gallagher, pass it on...
B000B8QEZG|5.0|As a huge Madonna fan from way back in the 80's, I have to admit it was hard to dislike anything she created.  However, after trying desperately and unsuccessfully to like her last album, \\"American Life,\\" I was somewhat wary of how \\"Confessions\\" would sound.  All I can say is \\"Wow!\\"  She's back, and with possibly her best album ever.  I cannot stop listening to it, and there has never been a Madonna record I could just play continuously and not get tired of hearing.  Virtually any song (except for the final three in my opinion) would make an ideal single.  My personal favorites are \\"Future Lovers,\\" \\"Jump,\\" \\"I Love New York,\\" and \\"Sorry,\\" but they keep changing the more I listen to the cd.  For best results, crank this one way up and let the superior production take you away to another world.  Thanks, Madonna, for giving pop music yet another much-needed shot in the arm and showing us once again why you are indeed the queen of pop.
B000BM6AVA|1.0|This is garbage. <br /> <br />If you're looking for the same melodic flow in Mesmerize with songs like Revenga, Radio, Question, you won't find it here. <br /> <br />This album is nothing but obnoxious teenage angst noise, which is VERY disappointing following such a piece of art like Mesmerize.

B000BTC5LW|5.0|If you two (below) knew anything about Pink Floyd, you'd know that it has to do with legal issues.  IF YOU WATCHED the concerts closely before, and noticed that there have been these issues all along.  Have you ever noticed that when someone sings Roger's parts of Comfortably Numb, it is always done in a different way (except when Roger does it in concert), and ever notice that Dave NEVER plays Dirty Woman in concert when he sings most of the vocals in the studio?  He never sings Have a Cigar, etc.  Every little step Floyd takes is slowed down because of whiney Waters can't get over it.  Have you noticed that alot of newly released Floyd footage is limited to Roger and, for crissakes, Sid Berret? Calm down a little bit.  This ain't no damn Green Day or top 40 crap!
B00005JO1J|3.0|I was never able to see the musical \\"Rent\\" performed live on stage. This seems to be an ongoing trend with me. Every acclaimed musical that comes to town is always gone before I get a chance to see it. It took me almost a decade to finally catch \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" on stage, and then only because I was living in London and it was still playing there. So, I was happy to learn that a film version of the popular Broadway musical about a bunch of starving artists living in Manhattan's East Village would be made with many of the original cast members. It seemed a natural fit that Robert DeNiro would produce the project, a musical set on the mean streets of New York. Then more of the cast and crew were announced and my hopes began to deflate.<br /><br />The film is directed by Chris Columbus (\\"Mrs. Doubtfire\\", \\"Harry Potter 1 and 2\\", \\"Bicentennial Man\\") and produced by Revolution Studios. Danger, Will Robinson. Danger. Columbus has made a series of amazingly successful films, but that doesn't mean they were necessarily good films. \\"Harry Potter 1 and 2\\" were good films, but as we now see, the films in the series can and are so much better now that other directors have taken over. He tends to make more `family friendly' broad comedies featuring a well-known comedian (i.e., Robin Williams) and a `hook' (i.e., a man poses as a nanny to be close to his children during the divorce). Columbus doesn't seem like a good match with the material. Revolution Studios has produced an amazingly long series of just plain terrible films, stretching across every genre and engulfing many good actors in the wake. Their most successful and critically acclaimed film was Ridley Scott's \\"Blackhawk Down\\", but one film does not make up for even a small portion of the series of duds they have perpetrated on the public. \\"America's Sweethearts\\" anyone?<br /><br />\\"Rent\\", as a film, works, but much like the first two \\"Harry Potter\\" films, it doesn't transcend. I am doubtful that this musical will become a classic like the great musicals of the 40s and 50s, or even as well-remembered as the Disney animated musicals like \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" or \\"The Little Mermaid\\". But it is a good film.<br /><br />My main difficulty is that a number of the songs are difficult to hear, songs featuring the character Roger (Adam Pascal). Roger, a former rising musician, now living with AIDS, the product of a drug habit, lives with Mark (Anthony Rapp), a budding documentary filmmaker, in a run-down loft in the lower East Side of Manhattan. Freezing, hungry and frustrated, their landlord turns the power off on Christmas Eve, leaving them, literally, in the dark. When Roger sings a song, either alone, or to another person, the background music takes on an edgier, rocker mood, drowning out a lot of his lyrics, making it difficult to understand him.<br /><br />When any of the other characters are the centerpiece of a particular song or ballad, the accompanying music is much more musical-like, allowing the lyrics to be heard. It seems odd that one character's songs should be different from the rest and I am not sure why this was done, but it really detracts from the experience.<br /><br />\\"Rent\\", written by Jonathan Larson, who died shortly before the play premiered on Broadway, is a modern day interpretation of Puccini's opera \\"La Boheme\\", which was also the loose inspiration for Baz Luhrmann's \\"Moulin Rouge\\". Now, I know what I am about to say will make a number of people mad, but \\"Moulin Rouge\\" was a much better film. Even with all of the excessive editing and the loud shouting, I was able to understand every word of the music, the acting, everything. In \\"Rent\\", this simply isn't the case. Please keep in mind I am only comparing the films. I'm sure watching \\"Rent\\" performed live on stage is a completely different experience.<br /><br />The main difference between \\"Rent\\" and \\"Moulin Rouge\\" is that \\"Rent\\" was initially produced as an Operatic musical. From what I understand, the play was pretty much all music, all singing, and no spoken dialogue. Chris Columbus and screenwriter Steven Chbosky have added a little bit of dialogue throughout and this is not entirely successful. This dialogue may help establish the characters a little more, but it seems odd to hear so much singing and then have the characters speak a few lines of dialogue before returning to singing. The characters speaking in their normal voices takes you out of a world where everyone is singing all of the time, jarring you back into reality. Then when they start singing again, it takes a few moments to get back into the cadence of the song. It seems sloppy.<br /><br />The new addition to the cast is Rosario Dawson. Six of the other seven members of the cast originated their roles in the Broadway production. Dawson plays Mimi Marquez, a heroin addicted exotic dancer, and gives perhaps the most believable performance. She is the newcomer to the group and as we witness her character through their eyes, we see a more fully realized arch for her character. They meet her, learn about her, deal with some of her problems and then become close to her. She becomes attracted to Roger, which adds gravitas to his character as the recovering addict has to help Mimi with her addiction, bringing back memories of his own problems. It is Dawson's best performance in a few years.<br /><br />The other standout is Wilson Jermaine Heredia who plays the transvestite Angel. Wilson won a Tony for the same role on Broadway and he clearly knows his way around the character. He makes Angel more real than some of the other characters. At times, we feel empathy and sadness, and at others, we feel his joy for life. It is a real stand out performance.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is good. Anthony Rapp plays Mark, the budding documentary filmmaker who always carries a camera around, recording events as they happen to him and his friends. All of this footage is for a documentary he is working on, which he ultimately finishes and shows to the collected group. The camera has no microphone, so he seems to be making a silent documentary, using a jumble of pictures and images to tell his story. The finished project seems like a bad student project from high school, but maybe that's just me.<br /><br />Jesse L. Martin (TV's \\"Law and Order\\") plays Collins, a friend of Mark and Roger who returns to New York to teach and deal with his own case of AIDS. He meets Angel and they begin a relationship. His character is the least interesting to me, because he spends the majority of the film walking around smiling and laughing, because he is so happy in his relationship with Angel. His character experiences the least growth, making him the least interesting. Idina Menzel (who played the Wicked Witch in \\"Wicked\\" recently on Broadway), plays Maureen and does a good job with the role of the flirtatious Bi- former girlfriend of Mark.<br /><br />Because this is a musical, you expect a certain amount of the film to take place in interior settings, but Columbus stages many of the outdoor scenes on what appear to be sets as well. With the advancement of technology, it seems like it would be fairly easy to shoot exteriors in real locations. But Columbus apparently doesn't agree. At one point Roger travels to Santa Fe, and these scenes are clearly shot outdoors in real locations. They stand out like a sore thumb because they are so different from the rest of the film. Clearly, that is the point, but they don't appear to belong to the same film.<br /><br />\\"Rent\\" will clearly appeal to devoted fans of the stage version, but if you have never seen the stage play you may have some trouble accepting Columbus' interpretation of the material.tand, the play was pretty much all music, all singing, and no spoken dialogue.

0553213105|5.0|This is truly a classic, the book is the apex of Ms. Austens writing.  The characters are so vivid and they stay with you.  The heroine Elizabeth Bennett is such a modern thinker and she is resolute and always true to herself.  Ah and Darcy, he is such a great creation; at first glance, distant, shy, seemingly full of pride.  The way the book evolves into one of the great love stories in literature is wonderful, it's a jouney everyone should take.  Even if you have seen the great A&E version or the new Kiera Knightly version, you still should read the book.  Ms. Austen is a great writer and though the two afore mentioned films are well done, they still can't match Ms. Austens proes, it's such a shame she died so young and we did not get to see her writing evolve, to think she died in her thirties a spinster, I suppose it takes someone like that to write such an uplifting, romantic book and not be, dare I say, cynical about romance and waiting for that one love...maybe she found her Darcy after all.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|I am a huge fan of A7X and will always appreciate everything they do. However, they will never top \\"Waking the Fallen\\". This is one CD in my collection that I have listened to countless times and will probably have to buy another before the year is over. So many songs on this album touch me in a way most songs don't. If you bought \\"City of Evil\\" (which is very good, but very different) and weren't that impressed, please give \\"Waking the Fallen\\" a chance-it will never leave your CD player.
B000002UQJ|5.0|I just read AMG's review of this great album, and decided to write a much needed rebuttal. AMG's review paints this beautiful music as \\"mawkish sentiment\\" & \\"weak\\", and I've heard others refer to this music as \\"saccharine\\". The truth is, however, that these are well written, well performed songs about Love, joy, peace & understanding. Unfortunately, in today's world, these great qualities are sometimes written off as rubbish. Yet these are the very thoughts/feelings that make life worth living! I'm not going to review the album song by song because it is beautiful from start to finish. I consider this to be one of Paul McCartney's best albums since his days with Wings & certainly one of the best collections of songs by any artist to come out in 1993.  If you like Paul McCartney's work on records such as \\"Tug Of War\\", \\"Pipes Of Peace\\" or just about anything he's released in the 80's-90's then I think you'll like this one as well. Highly recommended listening, and well-worth the money for a truly high-quality album from one of the most talented recording artists of the last 40+ years!!! 'Nough said.    P.S. Someone rated this album one star quoting the opening lyrics to \\"Golden Earth Girl...female animal\\" & put the song down, but if you read all of the lyrics it seems pretty obvious that the song is about a beautiful bird or other animal(not a human being) enjoying the wonders of nature. Anyway, I don't know any young women who live in a moss nest LOL :-) Are there not \\"boy\\" & \\"girl\\" birds, deer, etc...?? Another neat part of this song is the \\"in eggshell seas\\" part which sounds just like \\"In Excelsis\\" from Christian hymns. Plus, one must understand that a major theme of this album is the exhortation to treat animals well. One last thought...the Wings song \\"Bluebird\\" must be a weird song, too...eh? Nope, it's a beautiful imaginative song about being in Love! Don't take lyrics out of context :-)
B0002VL0KQ|3.0|I love Celine Dion and her music, this is an album for some hard core fans.  Of course her beautiful voice saves the album alot, but there are still somes songs to give credit due when credit is needed due such as the song \\"Beautiful boy\\" and \\"Miracle\\" <br /> <br />This album is recommened for hard core fans,not the casual ones I personally enjoyed this album somewhat and I give it a 3.5/5 for Celine Dion.
B000BO0LKY|3.0|A great album by Mariah but to get value for money purchase the version with the bonus DVD..... <br /> <br />1. It's Like That - The first single of the CD, It's a classic RnB sound, I couldnt believe it was Maraih singing when I 1st heard it on the radio! It's one of the best track on the album 8/10  <br /> <br />2. We Belong Together - This is the 2nd single, and it is a beauty. Its a beautful ballad, the best track on the album 10/10  <br /> <br />3. Shake It Off - A mid-temp song, sounds like the type of song that Beyonce/Destiny's Child would sing. The hook is very catchy 7/10  <br /> <br />4. Mine Again -This is a ballad, sounds like a song that she has done in the past, the vocals are great, its one of the better track 8/10  <br /> <br />5. Say Somethin' featuring Snoop Dogg - Another RnB track, sounds a bit like a Justin Timberlake track, but it has the Mariah Carey flavour 2 it! 6/10  <br /> <br />6. Stay The Night - A well sung song with good vocal range. It has a great chorus 7/10  <br /> <br />7. Get Your Number featuring Jermaine Dupri - This is one of the best tracks, the hook sung by Jermaine Dupri makes this track hot. 8/10  <br /> <br />8. One And Only featuring Twista - This SHOULD be the next single, its hot hot hot. The 2nd verse sounds like an old Destiny's Child hook.....I luv this song! 9/10  <br /> <br />9. Circles - Another ballad, does sound a bit like \\"Stay The Night\\" and \\"Mine Again\\" 6.5/10  <br /> <br />10. Your Girl - This song takes some getting into....But now I luv it! Moving more into the pop-ish sound 7/10  <br /> <br />11. I Wish You Knew - Another great song. Sounds like a song from the early 90's.....I like the way Maraih interacts with the audience 8/10  <br /> <br />12. To The Floor featuring Nelly - This track is a club track. Sounds a bit like a Justin's track \\"Like I Love You\\" 6/10  <br /> <br />13. Joy Ride - Another ballad, sung softly....6/10  <br /> <br />14. Fly Like A Bird - A gospel track with Mariah hitting those wonderful high notes. 7/10  <br /> <br />15. Don't Forget About Us - The new single, its a tender track, the film clip isnt much but I still luv it! 8/10  <br /> <br />16. Makin' It Last All Night (What It Do) - This is a catchy track feat Jermaine Dupri, the lyrics are hot, very much an RnB track 8/10  <br /> <br />17. So Lonely (One & Only Part II) - The 2nd part of One & Only...Its a great song but I think it could have been better if Twista didnt sing as much, it has that Destiny's Child fast pace singing style like the \\"One & Only\\" 8/10 <br /> <br />18. We Belong Together Remix featuring Jadakiss and Styles P - This is the best remix Ive heard in years...its a fast pace remake and it doesnt make the track sound so sad! It's a fun version.....10/10
0553212419|5.0|I have the whole collection of the Sherlock Holmes, and they are my all-time favorite books.  There was never a better character, stories, or anything.  I personally think that the reason many people think they start out slowly is because you have to understand the basic facts or you'll be puzzled when he's in the middle of the \\"big deal.\\"  They start out calm and get more and more exciting, so by the time the climax comes, you're almost nuts to read it all and find out what was going on!  Anyways, this is the FIRST book I would buy for my fiction library.
B00005JLO2|2.0|Shekhar Kapur's vision of A.E.W. Mason's The Four Feathers is well done visually, but unfortunately much of the original story is lost to create a more fast-paced and action-packed plot. While the basic story is kept, many small details seem to have been needlessly changed. For those who don't know, The Four Feathers is supposedly about Harry Feversham, a man enlisted in the army. When Harry is informed he will be sent to war in the Sudan, he hides this information and quietly resigns from the army to be with his fianc, Ethne. However, life with Ethne is soon changed when he receives three white feathers from his army colleagues. Explaining to Ethne what he has done and that the feathers are a symbol of cowardice do not help Harry; in fact, she tears a feather out of her fan to make four feathers. Harry then sets out to regain the lost respect of his friends through helping them, in an ultimate goal to regain the respect of Ethne.    For the most part, only minor details are changed from the novel to the movie; for example, the way that Harry's friend, Jack Durrance goes blind, or the fact that Harry disguised himself as a Greek, not as an Arab. The change that seems most prominent, however, is the fact that in the film, Jack Durrance knows of Harry's resignation from the beginning. This subverts the whole quest that Jack undertakes to find out the truth in the novel. In addition, the entire `battle' between the warden of the House of Stone of Omdurman and Harry and Abou Fatma was created solely for action value in the film. However, despite this addition of action, the movie still seems to drag at points.    Films are almost never completely accurate when following a novel; that is why they are only based on them. However, as I've said, a lot of the changes made seem senseless. I would recommend this film to someone who has not read the book or who does not mind liberal film interpretations of novels, if they have an hour or two to waste. Those looking for a movieto keep them on the edge of their seats would be advised to find something else.
B000BOH8XW|5.0|This album is truly great and is her best English album to date.    I must be honest I expected this to be a Latin influenced CD and I was looking forward to that, But it is more of a pop/rock middle eastern type of vibe. It is definately a mellow album, most songs are slower paced than songs like \\"whenever, wherever\\" or like \\"la tortura\\" for example. However, this album is amazing regardless. It is a breath of fresh air into the English-Speaking market. It is a mature album with a somewhat foreign sound especially in songs like Timor and How Do You Do. I recommend this album to any Shakira fan. This has to be an epic album. Honestly I can't stop sing it! How do you do, Timor, Animal City, Timor, Something, Illegal, Don't Bother, Hey You, Dreams for... omg nevermind they are all my favourite haha!
B0009OPO0S|5.0|Shakira is defintley a great latin pop singer , in English and Spanish.  Personally I like the spanish album, due to fact she sounds so much better when she sings Spanish such as the awesome latin duet \\"La Tortura\\" and the great remix they give with it.<br /><br />\\"En Tus Pupilas\\" and \\"La Pared\\" start the album off with a bang great latin tunes and vocals by Shakira. \\"No\\" a great Shakira song on the album that you will just fall in love with.<br /><br />\\"Dia Especial\\" and \\"Dia De Enero\\" personally are my favorite songs on the album with \\"La Tortura\\" and \\"No\\" this album is the biggest latin release in a while pick it up!<br /><br />Overall Effect: 5/5
B000BJS4SU|4.0|If you're into the blues stuff, buy this album.  Some of it is covers such as Hendrix and Ray Charles but Mayer does it in his own style.  I'm glad we have someone such as John Mayer in our day and age where music just plain sucks and mainstream radio, pop, hip-hop rule over all where there is just no feeling to it.  It's all about sex and let's dance, etc, etc.  At least John's trying to bring something new to the table, in other words expose the Blues to people because people have a liking to him and he is an excellent candidate for representing such a style.  He is an incredible guitar player and has insipired me to pick up my guitar and pratice whenever I've got the time.<br /><br />[...]it's really a great CD and I could never finsd myself listening to the Blues and listening to Try! makes me want to go back in time and hear all these classic blues songs in their original form by the original artists and the people who brought along the style and turned it into somethin great!
0385504209|5.0|There is a reason why this book has stayed atop most of the best selling charts for almost two years. I read this book while on a skiing trip one winter and I couldn't stop talking about it. All day on the mountain all I could think about was getting back to the lodge and diving into this book. There are few books that come along like this; where you keep thinking about that next chapter whenever your are not reading it.<br /><br />YOU MUST BE AWARE OF DAN BROWN. I read this book first (out of all of Brown's others) and I think this is the reason why I enjoyed it so much. From what I hear the people who read his books last become frustrated with his writing style. The author become extremely predictable, his writing style is easy to pick up and the same throughout. If you haven't started any of Brown's books I would go with this one first. If you've read any of his others...I would wait a couple years before you pick this one up. I \\"learned\\" more about the Catholic Church in this one book than all my years of CCD. Be aware that all 90% of this is conspiracy, but who doesn't enjoy a good conspiracy now and then.
1580086810|5.0|What a phenomenal book. I like to think visitors to my home would flip through this while waiting for me to make them a hearty, slow foods dinner and the photos alone would provide conversation for the whole evening. We have no idea in this country how lucky we are. How wasteful. Every corner of this book is filled with statistics, catchy captions, lists and delightful international family recipes. There are also essays and longer texts detailing individual families and deeper food issues. But even the illiterate could aquire years of knowledge just studying the photos. And, I'll tell you what else, it inspires me to eat a little bit less at every meal.
B00005ASHM|5.0|The best way to listen to Pet Sounds according to Brian Wilson- is with a pair of headphones in the dark... that way you will hear every detail. It is the details within it it that make it so special.  And there is a lot here that will move you even beyond God Only Knows and Wouldn't It Be Nice- both PERFECT songs.  Wilson has created a wall of sound that is light years ahead of Phil Spector- and that is saying an awful lot. Brian's brilliance continued with Smile- complete or not- reaching absolute POP PERFECTION AGAIN with Good Vibrations and Heroes and Villains.  Lightening has struck multiple times in Brian's studio.  Having the tracks in stereo is VERY SPECIAL. We are still waiting for that experience with Good Vibrations and I Get Around (except for the live version from 1964).      I want to point out though that if you think that this is the only absolute materpiece from the Beach Boys though that you have a lot more listening to do.  There are tons of them.  Friends, 20/20, Today!, Smiley Smile (unfinished or not)- the list goes on and on.  These albums are so good and there are so many little known gems on them that I am starting to really think that the BEach Boys may have been even better than the Beatles.  And I am a HUGE Beatles fan.  If you want to be blown away get Today! and listen to all of the ballads... all sung by Brian.  Music doesn't get any better than this.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|Mezmerize had alot of songs that were catchy such as \\"BYOB\\" \\"Revenga\\" and \\"Violent Pornography\\"  Hypnotize is very similar to Mezmerize being very agressive with songs such as \\"Attack\\" and \\"Kill RockNRoll\\"   <br /> <br />System of a Down has always been known for their great song writing,and they really have shown it on these last to albums \\"Hypnotize\\" and \\"Mezmerize\\"  <br /> <br />The remain to hit #1 albums on Billboard because of their unique still in song writing vocally performing their songs.  With agression tone and sure madness.  If you bought any other Systeem of a Down CD, this is a great buy and a great follow up to \\"Mezmerize\\"
B000006O7C|5.0|Sketches (For My Sweetheart the Drunk) is the first posthumous release of the late great Jeff Buckley. The songs on these two disks were taken from what Buckley had been working on during the time of his accidental drowning. Most of the tracks were taped onto old Michael Bolton tapes in Buckley's in-home studio. He used electronics and his own musical talents to record; there was no one else there to aid him. The cover of the CD is really effective; it is a photograph of Jeff Buckley reflected through a mirror. Instead of this collection being Jeff's own, it is his work tweaked by friends and family in an attempt to make the album as close to what Buckley would have wanted.<br /><br />Disk One is probably the easiest to begin with if you want to like this CD. The songs are more polished; a few of the songs are included in lesser form on the second CD. However, this is the half that most people can identify with. Fans of Grace might surprised at the change in Buckley's style, but Buckley is Buckley. He's absolutely amazing.<br /><br />The Sky is a Landfill is obviously one of those songs Buckley wrote first as a poem, then a song. The lyrics are really beautiful and the message is strong. It could be used for a political movement; it is really good. The music that accompanies the lyrics is not as outstanding, so one might look over the song right off, but take another listen. I promise, with anything Jeff Buckley related, taking a second look is always rewarding.<br /><br />Everybody Here Wants You is a very feminine nightclub type of a song. One can just see the smoke and the dismal men at the bar staring at an attractive girl. It's really a beautiful little song, but it is certainly one of Buckley's most feminine on this set.<br /><br />Opened Once is a sad lament with some really gorgeous lyrics. It is short and quiet, a personal song.<br /><br />Nightmares By the Sea is an excellent catchy song with better than average lyrics. It seems to be a warning to young lovers and the damnation they face. It's dreamy and mournful but happy and beautiful at the same time.<br /><br />Yard of Blonde Girls was not written by Buckley. It is a slow, louder type of a song.<br /><br />Witches' Rave is a truly fun song, one you'll find yourself singing along to and bouncing to in the car.<br /><br />New Year's Prayer is an acid-trippy psychedelic song  with a persistent beat and wavy echoing vocals.<br /><br />Morning Theft is an excellent example of the uncharacteristic style of Buckley. He is able to change a song's mood right in the middle of a song making it progressively more gorgeous as it goes.<br /><br />Vancouver is an overlooked gem. It began as a long instrumental song, but with lyrics and Buckley's vocals became a million times more powerful.<br /><br />You & I is a haunting, somewhat disturbing song. There is an ominous hollow sound in the background as Buckley sings these strong lyrics. The result is raw but very emotional.<br /><br />Disk Two is much more raw than the first. This disk captures more of the energy that Buckley had live. Here is his with mistakes and all, just him and a guitar sometimes, or sometimes with a few other gadgets thrown in.<br /><br />Nightmares By the Sea is a repeat from the first CD. This version seems to have more effects done on the voice and the backgrounds; they seem less natural. This version is actually my favorite of the two because it seems more ominous which lends to the lyrics.<br /><br />New Year's Prayer is also included a second time. This one seems to have more echo but the lyrics are the same and there don't seem to be many differences.<br /><br />Haven't You Heard is a song that is practically shouted, but it is really good. It is lacking a bit in the music department; things are left to a minimum there.<br /><br />I Know We Could Be So Happy Baby (If We Wanted To Be) is certainly a work in progress. It has a very bare guitar sound and less than perfect vocals. However, this turns out to be quite effective.<br /><br />Murder Suicide Meteor Slave is hard to get used to, but it is actually enjoyable once you get used to it. The ending, however, is very, very strange.<br /><br />Back In N.Y.C. was not written by Buckley, and thank goodness. I can't get myself to like this song. It is very raw and very strange.<br /><br />Demon John is also a little difficult to get used to. It just seems to wander around aimlessly.<br /><br />Your Flesh Is So Nice is an incredibly funny song. It is really bare musically, but the words will have you in stitches.<br /><br />Jewel Box is a sweet little tune. The vocals and guitar are not perfect, but that adds to the song's appeal. When listening, one can just imagine Buckley sitting in front of a recorder with a guitar on his lap singing with a smile on his face.<br /><br />Satisfied Mind was originally a country song. This is a perfect example of Buckley's interest in all sorts of music. This one has a good message, that one doesn't have to be rich to be happy. It's a simple, sweet song, and a great way to end the set.<br /><br />Overall, Buckley fans will love this CD and new converts might warm up to him, but must be wary right at first and give Jeff his proper chance.is hard to get used to, but it is actually enjoyable once you get used to it.

B00006L3S3|4.0|The reissue (finally!) of the last 2 Lennon LPs (Sometime In NYC & Walls & Bridges) sparks an overdue review of this LP.  Three years have passed between this reissue and the aforementioned two (why so long?).  So I've had three years to digest this release (where does the time go?).  Of all Lennon's catalog, this was the one, IMO, that most needed and most benefitted from the remix/remaster.  I thought they did a good job of walking the tightrope of trying to preserve the \\"overall sound and mood\\" of the original mix and trying to get rid of the muddy overall sound when doing it.  That's quite a lot to ask.  Personally, I would have gone back to the multitracks and gone for the crystal clarity that we got on the Lennon Anthology, but it wouldn't have sounded at all like the original Mind Games LP.  So I am, overall, very happy with the compromise they came up with.   <br /> <br />The songs on this set were always strong, just obscured by the production.  Though not totally berift of rockers, it's the mid-tempo and slower songs that really shine here: Mind Games, Aisumasen, I Know, Out The Blue, One Day, Intuition & You Are Here are all really great songs.  Tight A$$ is the one really great rocker; Meat City, Bring On the Lucie and Only People feel like filler, though listenable filler.   <br /> <br />Now that the sound of the LP has drastically improved, it lets these songs claim their (over) due as possibly the best set of songs in Lennon's catalog. <br /> <br />It could be Lennon's best album.  It doesn't have the standout tracks like Imagine or Woman, but it's now a very consistant work.  If it was craftsmanship, it was craft of the the highest order.
B000AGTPUK|4.0|I became entranced with Chris Van Allsburg's book The Polar Express while working in a bookstore during college. For those who don't know, Allsburg is also the author of Jumanji and Zathura, both of which have been brought to the big screen.<br /><br />My 7 year old son has been a train fanatic for years, so when we heard that The Polar Express being made into a movie, we were thrilled! My husband, son, and I went to the theater to see the movie and absolutely loved it.<br /><br />The animation is unique (I've not seen anything quite like it and we own a LOT of CGI/animated DVD's!), the colors are vibrant, and the story is both whimsical and meaningful. I especially like the idea that each child had partial words punched into their tickets--indecipherable until they learned a particular lesson while on the journey to the North Pole.<br /><br />The songs are beautiful as is the soundtrack. \\"Hot Chocolate\\" is a rousing song sung by waiters who transformed an ordinary traincar into a magical \\"cafe\\" for the delicious treat.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are NO extras on the single Disc DVD save the theatrical trailer. Scene Selection is available as is choosing English, Spanish, or French--either spoken or in the form of subtitles.<br /><br />After watching the entire DVD twice (my husband just bought it 4 hours ago!), my son is now watching it for the third time--now in Spanish. What surprises me is that the Spanish actors sound very, very similar to the ones in the original. Even the whiny, nasally know-it-all keeps his chracteristic voice!<br /><br />If you don't mind the lack of extras, the single Disc version will do just fine. It's available in wide screen and full screen. My only complaint--and this is why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5--is that it had NO insert in the front cover. No pamphlet, no booklet, no coupons--nothing! I can't remember a time where I've gotten a family-oriented DVD and it not have a booklet on the inside!<br /><br />Retaining the mystery and the magic, The Polar Express is an excellent film in the spirit of Van Allsburg's book. It will be well-loved by train enthusiasts, kids-at-heart, and those who believe.Retaining the mystery and the magic, The Polar Express is an excellent film in the spirit of Van Allsburg's book.

B000000P17|3.0|The Spaghetti Incident? was released in december of 1993 and is GN'R fourth studio album. <br /> <br />The band was not doing very well at time TSI? was released. Departure of two band's original members (Guitarist Izzy Stradlin left in fall of 1991 and drummer Steven Adler was fired in late 1990), exaustion after Use Your Illusion world tour and personal conflicts weakened Guns N' Roses. No one would be surprised if these guys released a weaker album - and so They did. TSI? is GN'R tribute to their punk roots. What We've got here is bunch of loud, noisy punk covers of bands like Sex Pistols, Nazareth, or The UK Subs. Some of them are interesting tunes, but mostly it's average release. Definately not something GN'R fans desire from this band.  <br /> <br />First of all, GN'R are not a punk band - punk music influenced Them, but it wasn't their mainstream. They used to play raw, powerful Rock N' Roll that became their trademark. Unfortunately, We don't get anything like that on this album. Some of the songs are actually interesting remakes - Since I Don't Have You is easily one of the sweetest tunes the band has ever recorded. It was originally recorded by Skyliners, but this version kills the original one. Raw and nasty Hair Of The Dog is also strong point of the album. You Can't Put Your Arms Around A Memory and the fast-paced Attitude are other standouts here. Ain't It Fun and Black Leather are interesting... but it all ends here. Rest of the album is just bunch of mediocre punk covers. For the end GN'R recorded one of their unfamous, critized tunes - Look At Your Game Girl. This one is just a simple acoustic piece. There is nothing wrong with the song, but the fact that Charles Manson wrote it is actually quite... shocking? This track is not even listed, it's part of I Don't Care About You. <br /> <br />If I would have to sume up, this is the weakest GN'R effort. While their other albums are almost perfect on each note, this one has only a few interesting points.TSI? is the one You should get last if You're into Guns N' Roses. If You're a new fan, don't even touch it. Get Appetite For Destruction. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000B7BRMM|2.0|I love Diana Krall. The DVD of her concert in Paris is fabulous,and you Krall fans know what I am talking about.  I have a 2-disc set of her best tunes and the CDs are a joy to listen to. She is superb--when she is singing JAZZ! <br /> <br />I had high hopes for this new CD. I thought, with the right arrangements, she could pull it off. Unfortunately, she didn't. Knowing how good she really is, this was painfull to listen to. The only thing more painful to listen to was Stevie Nicks singing \\"Silent Night.\\"  <br /> <br />Some Christmas albums are great, like Bing Crosby's 1950s classic, but that is going back a bit. On this disc, Diana just seems out of her element. She could have changed the arrangements, the pacing of the songs, to be more in line with her singing style.  <br /> <br />I am afraid I won't be listening to this one again. Be warned, Krall fans--you may like it, as some reviewers have stated, or you may find it very disappointing.
B0007DAZW8|3.0|After an album as clever and elegantly dancable as \\"Discovery,\\" Daft Punk dropped the ball on \\"Human After All.\\"  The tracks seem like really good musical ideas, but they're highly undeveloped.<br /><br />I could see a DJ in a club remixing the tracks to perfection, but it's pretty raw and boring save for \\"The prime time of your life\\" and \\"Technologic.\\"<br /><br />I probably wouldn't buy it again, but I did buy it, and it's not horrible, but still not as good as \\"Discovery.\\"

B00097DXZS|5.0|The searing guitar tone and licks played by Santana on this album once again confirm his ability to elevate the songs beyond mere lyrics.  Santana brings out the healing harmonics of superb guitar lick phrasing and elevates the artists he accompanies to a new level of artistry.  I'm Feeling You, Just Feel Better, Cry Baby Cry and I Don't Wanna Lose Your Love are just several that will elevate your soul to new heights.  Thanks Santana for proving once again the universal healing power and love that music offers humanity.  As a physician I know well the power of music to elevate the spirit and improve the mental and physical well-being of all. Gratitude, blessings and good health to you Carlos and all the lives that you touch. <br /> <br />James Schlichtmann MD
B000BM6AVA|4.0|If you were into the old days of system this might not be for you. I personally love the two new albums (orginally supposed to be one album) but they still lack the feeling the first 3 gave. Its an obvious shift in image.Serj cut his what was awesome beard and hair. The shift in image coensides with the shift in music. Its just the band saying were getting a little older and we should try to evolve our image and music these were transition albums they haven't perfected what they are looking for but it was a defenit improvment between the two and im sure the next album will blow people away more so then any other album the have produced
B000AP04FG|5.0|A great date movie, my husband and I were thoroughly entertained because we took the movie for what it is- sexy, passionate, wild and fun.  Yes, the plot is weak and the ending more than a little convuluted.  But I did not go to see an insightful thought provoking movie.  We watch enough History Channel and PBS!   I went to go see two stars with unbelievable sexual chemistry tell me a story.  That's it, take it for what it is a good night of fun.  My husband did not want to see a \\"chick\\" film but he enjoyed it and admitted it is not a chick flick.  Fair is fair, he enjoyed Angelina and Brad was wow.  I laughed watching the beginning dance scene because Brad can't dance and all the rehearsals in the world didn't help him, but he pulled it off with a lot of help from Angelina.  Oh well I guess you can't have it all.  I eagerly anticipate a Mr and Mrs Smith 2 where you see them really get to know each other (including his penchant for singing to Lite FM music) and fall in love but this time they are working for the government killing the bad guys along with the action and peril that requires with Vince Vaughn as the hapless friend and cohort.  Of course they have to give us more insight via flashbacks into how such a smoking hot couple became so dull after 6 years of marriage, lies is one thing but no sex, c'mon!  If anything that's the hardest thing to believe.
B00000I78Y|5.0|This is an album that I have been wearing out for years. It is thrashing, insightful, mysterious and never gets old.<br /><br />System of a Down is without a doubt my favorite Rock band. No doubt, without question. They wreak of aptitude, even as displayed in this their debut album.<br /><br />If you want an indepth view into each of these songs, it would literally take me thousands of words spread across a hundred pages, so I will sum up my avidity into a breviloquent format.<br /><br />Frankly that can only happen if I give you an overall sense of the experience of listening to this album an incalculable amount of times. It is an emotional piece of work, displaying a band (labeled by and kicking off the genre of N&uuml;metal, supposedly) which is beginning to find a focus on later greatness. With the release of Mezmerize/Hypnotize, it is highly recommended that you go back to this beginning to understand their foundations. Though their sound may not of been as authentically ethnic as newer work, it still rocks.<br /><br />Spiders is in my mind (no pun) the crowning achievement of this album in the realm of haunting pulses and envelopment. Suite-Pee, though labeled with a name in no way associated with the song - as many are, is a bold throw against the belief that Christ was a woman. Ddevil is a sarcastic snarl at Satan, amazingly enough. The verses tell about the horrible \\"photographic relapse, of a people feeding frenzy\\" then the acerbic line \\"the devil is so lovely.\\" The exhibition of Good and Evil is still lingering in their music today. SUGAR gives the bouncing breakout song which had youngin's banging their head with glee. It tells, in a roundabout way, the drained emotions of the lonely - playing russian roulette just by exhisting day to day. Others cover the plagues of war and injustices upon the family infrastructure. They fight the agnostic heathen and thumb their noses at anything resembling the formulaic backbone of Rock. They are good, real good. And, blunt.<br /><br />**The Two bonus tracks included are Marmalade and Storaged, which are songs that are not to be bypassed. For Thirty more bucks? That's between you and the folded hunk of leather in your back pocket.<br /><br />That touches the skeletal structure of an album that is alive and well. It is refreshingly different, as are all of their albums.<br /><br />The videos, which can be seen through a number of sources on the net, are worthy of study and combine vision, style and coolness to enhance the songs they represent. {S~A~O~S}luded are Marmalade and Storaged, which are songs that are not to be bypassed.

B000ANVQ0K|5.0|On April 14, 1912, the RMS Titanic hit an iceberg in the North Atlantic Sea. The ship, that had been declared \\"unsinkable\\" went down within two and a half hours taking the lives of 1,500 passengers and crewman. Since that fateful night,the fascinating story of this tragedy has been retold over and over again in both print and film. The culmination of this came in 1997 with the release of the James Cameron's film, \\"Titanic\\". This epic movie won 11 Oscars and went on to become the highest grossing film of all time. Why was the movie so successful? Why does this film work so well? I think it is because Writer/Director, James Cameron chose to tell the story of Titanic's sinking in very human terms. He gets us to care about the majesty and beauty of the ship itself. Then he gets us involved in a fictional love story, that uses history as a backdrop. For those of you, who are the few individuals on the face of this Earth, who havn't seen the movie, the plot is fairly simple. In a flashback, a 101 year old, women (Gloria Stuart) recalls how as a upperclass, young lady named, Rose De Witt Bukater (Kate Winslet) she boarded the Titanic with her Fiance, Cal Hockley (Billy Zane) to be wedded in America. He is a wealthy and smug man, who seems to treat her more as a possesion then a love interest and is intent on reigning in her free spirited nature. Rose's mother, Ruth (Frances Fisher) has pushed her into this marriage, because they are in financial straits. Rose is so distraught of her future nuptials, that in a fit, she rushes to the stern of the ship to commit suicide. Luckily, she is saved by Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) a  young, poor, adventurous artist. The two make a connection and fall in love against the backdrop of history and that fateful night, that Titanic goes to the bottom of the sea. This movie is successful because it envelopes us whole into this opulent world of the past, where money, class & gender distinction mean everything. We watch as Rose emancipates herself from the formidable rules of this world. Finally, we see an incredibly meticulous, historically accurate, depiction of the Titanic disaster as it unfolds in very human terms. This is one of those rare times in which the big Hollywood budget actually helped instead of hindering the creativity and vision of a film maker and his movie. Usually a Director (and especially the Producers) become quite timid in making creative choices, when the budget climbs sky-high. Clearly there is nothing timid about this movie! The attention to authenticity and detail is just amazing! James Cameron truely was \\"the King of the World\\", when it came to creating the world of \\"Titanic\\". Everything just comes together from the casting, the wonderful performances, the script, authentic period costumes, amazing sets and special effects (that are truely special without overwhelming the story) and even James Horner's unforgettable, musical score. Movies work best, when they transport us to another world that not only entertains us, but says something about the human condition. I think the film \\"Titanic\\" works on all these levels. In the past the movie has been released to the public on a bare bones DVD. I think most of the film's legion of fans felt this was pretty shabby treatment for an 'Academy Award' winning film. The movie just seems to cry out for extras and the box set treatment. Well, with the release of the 3-DVD \\"Titanic\\" (Special Collectors Edition), the past injustices have certainly been rectified. This is quite possibly one of the best DVD box sets, I have ever seen. The film has lovingly been remastered in both picture and sound. It is Nirvana for both \\"Titanic\\" fans and movie buffs in-general, who are just interested in a detailed analysis of how major motion pictures are made. The set offers 3 different commentaries (Cameron's is the best of the lot) plus over 45 minutes worth of deleted scenes (with there own commentaries). It also includes full length documetaries plus a large number of short \\"pod\\" documentaries on the dives to the real Titanic and the making of the film. Finally, a whole host of publicity materials used for promoting & marketing the movie are included. This truely is the best in DVD treatments and extras. It's a wonderful movie and great DVD box set! Highly recommended!us a large number of short \\"pod\\" documentaries on the dives to the real Titanic and the making of the film.

B000B5Y00U|5.0|Probably no other Traviata has the detailed Verdi singing of this recording. The attention to Verdi's dynamics and markings especially by Caballe and Bergonzi proves that opera singing does not need dramatic tricks to be affective. Of course, not everyone has the technique, musicianship and vocal quality to achieve such a result. You won't find a vocally more ideal Violetta-Alfredo match on any other set!     I'm willing to buy anything Caballe recorded in the 60s and early 70s when the radiance and clarity of her voice was the best thing one could experience. Caballe has enough coloratura to cope with the first act. She doesn't hit the high E in Sempre Libera but it is a sacrifice I am willing to accept since other sopranos who do hit it, have nothing of Caballe's vocal luxury and clarity. In the next, more dramatic acts her ability to sing perfectly from pp to ff make her a very moving Violetta. The dramatic outbreaks in the sense of shouts, chest notes etc are few and sincere. It's easier to shout and bark than to sing the way this woman sings.     Similarly, Bergonzi's Alfredo is simply the most musical on records. The drama is injected in the singing just as Verdi intended it. In his first, equally magnificent Alfredo recording with the spectacular but otherwise mushy Sutherland he hits the high note in his cabaletta something he now avoids. The young Milnes, makes a convincing and imposing Germont and is vocally surprisingly firm.     What most people dislike about this recording is its conductor. I'm not an expert in this field but I know when I dislike like a conductor and believe that Pretre did an OK job. Some tempi are at times either slower or faster than usual but it's a minor distraction to me.    Even if you favour the more dramatic Traviatas starring Callas, Scotto, Cotrubas etc you should listen to this recording to hear exactly what Verdi wrote. If you listen carefully, you will be surprised to realise how much emotion clean-cut singing offers.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I'm so proud of Mariah for having a comeback when everyone said that her career was over.  <br /> <br />1. IT'S LIKE THAT - As she has done on many of her albums, she started the CD with an up-tempo track which is a good decision. \\"It's Like That' is the perfect single to start her comeback year. It's a fun, light, party song with a bumping beat.  <br /> <br />2. WE BELONG TOGETHER - Her surprise 16th No.1 single on the Hot 100. I think it was the perfect song to have as her comeback No.1 hit. It has all the things that people love about Mariah's singles: an amazing vocal performance, a great beat, and it's a mid-tempo ballad. It's a beautiful song. I love the melody.  <br /> <br />3. SHAKE IT OFF - Her biggest No.2 single ever, at 6 weeks. I didn't like this at first, but it certainly grew on me. The cool R&B groove that it has is very infectious. Everyone says it sounds like an Usher styled song, but I see it as a Jermaine Dupri styled song. After all, he produced most of Ushers hits.  <br /> <br />4. MINE AGAIN - This is a great song! It's a classic old school R&B-styled ballad. She sings the hell out of it, but at times she's kind of yelling. But all-in-all, a great vocal performance. Great melody.  <br /> <br />5. SAY SOMETHING (f/ Snoop Dogg) - This is the song that introduced most people to MIMI, since it got leaked last November. A lot of people aren't feeling this song, but I love it!!. I love the beat, the lyrics, and the amazing Neptunes production. There's been so much debate about this song being a single, but it looks like it's not gonna happen. This is definitely a good club song though.  <br /> <br />6. STAY THE NIGHT - This is one of my favs on the album. I like the piano sample that's going through the back, and the old school eat. It kind o reminds me of \\"The Roof\\", except in this song, Mariah belts out the lyrics. They sound great and the chorus is really catchy.  <br /> <br />7. GET YOUR NUMBER (f/ Jermaine Dupri) - This is another club hit thatsamples \\"Just an Illusion\\" by Imagination, with a Jermaine Dupri twist. He also sings the chorus, and it kind of sounds like Nelly. The beat in this song is crazy, I love it! The melody and lyrics are so catchy that you can't help but listen to it.  <br /> <br />8. ONE AND ONLY (f/ Twista) - This is my least favorite song on the album, because it's not all that catchy. Mariah sings as fast as Twista though, which is impressive considering he's the fastest rapper in the world. It's a mid-tempo R&B/hip-hop song. It sounds like more of a Twista song then a Mariah Carey song.  <br /> <br />9. CIRCLES - This song is amazing! Her voice sounds crystal clear and she really shows emotion in this song. It's an old school R&B styled song, it's kind of mid-tempo. It sounds very similar to Alicia Key's hit song \\"You Don't Know My Name\\".  <br /> <br />10. YOUR GIRL - This is a very slick R&B song. It's very smooth and Mariah belts out the chorus and the second verse. This is also one of my favorites on the album.  <br /> <br />11. I WISH YOU KNEW - This is a soul song that's done with a complete live band. I like the lyrics. The thing I like most about it is the sound of a live audience in the back, it really adds a lot to the song. I really like the horns in the back.  <br /> <br />12. TO THE FLOOR (f/ Nelly) - This is another Neptunes' produced track. It sounds similar to Britney Spears \\"Boys\\". It's a very old school sounding funk song. Neptunes' did a great job with the production. Nelly's very charismatic in the song, and he overshadows Mariah.  <br /> <br />13. JOY RIDE - This is the slowest song on the album. It's a modern R&B ballad. It's very soothing and nice. It sounds like something that should be on `Charmbracelet'.  <br /> <br />14. FLY LIKE A BIRD - Now this is what you call a classic. This song is perfect, it features a live band. Also Mariah's voice builds up momentum the whole song until the end when the choir is singing the chorus and Mariah belts out the adlibs (Carry me home, oh, carry me hoooome). It's amazing. The lyrics, the voice of her pastor, everything. A perfect way to end the album. <br /> <br />All-in-all, I'm very happy for Mariah because no one expected her to have this massive comeback story, and this album was the perfect one to do the trick. I'm glad she's back doing what she does best: Delivering great club songs and ballads all with her amazing voice.  <br />
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I bought this soundtrack after hearing a few songs at a friends house, and it is now probably my favorite CD... and I've had it for  quite a few months now. I've yet to see the show, but the music is amazing, and the arrangements make it so easy to see in your mind. The voice talent is incredible! And being someone is is very particular about voice quality, that says a lot. Everytime I listen to this music I'm utterly amazed at how wonderful it is! Just hearing it makes me want to go see the show!<br /><br />If you are a fan of showtunes and musicals, this is definetely something you will enjoy listening to over and over again!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|...that hasn't already been said in the 1500+ reviews of this series?  Thoroughly entertaining, witty, thoughtfully written, attentive to detail, and technically sensitive, Firefly is in my personal top 5 list of favorite all-time shows.  It was truly saddening to become attached to the characters and story line as I completed the series knowing that when it was over...it would be over. I'm glad Whedon was able to release Serenity and hope it will be a huge success on DVD! Who knows, maybe there will be a Serenity  2 or 2nd Firefly season???<br /><br />Qu ni de FOX!!
B000000OSE|4.0|Don't ask me why, but I didn't get this until ten years after it came out. Once I got this and \\"II\\", I realized what I had been missing. It doesn't quite top \\"Appetite For Destruction\\", but it's a rockin' 75 minutes. I also am someone who thinks a single disc between the two \\"Illusions\\" would have been mind-blowing, but more is more right. Obviously there's filler here, but just a couple tracks. The rest is classic Guns & Roses, and better than I always assumed it would be. Besides the hits here, I really like \\"Right Next Door To Hell\\", \\"Bad Obsession\\", \\"Back Off Bitch\\", and \\"The Garden\\". Overall I think \\"Use Your Illusion II\\" is my favorite, but this disc will still supply your Gn'R fix.
B0007Y4USW|5.0|I'm so proud of Mariah for having a comeback when everyone said that her career was over.  <br /> <br />1. IT'S LIKE THAT - As she has done on many of her albums, she started the CD with an up-tempo track which is a good decision. \\"It's Like That' is the perfect single to start her comeback year. It's a fun, light, party song with a bumping beat.  <br /> <br />2. WE BELONG TOGETHER - Her surprise 16th No.1 single on the Hot 100. I think it was the perfect song to have as her comeback No.1 hit. It has all the things that people love about Mariah's singles: an amazing vocal performance, a great beat, and it's a mid-tempo ballad. It's a beautiful song. I love the melody.  <br /> <br />3.

0670033375|2.0|Excerpt from a work in progress: <br /> <br />\\"Perhaps basking in the afterglow of having won a Pulitzer Prize for Guns, Germs, and Steel, Jared Diamond subsequently released a book entitled Collapse, in which he puts forth a multi-point thesis purporting to explain why societies, ancient and modern, pass away-sometimes abruptly.  Among those points one will find resource depletion, climatic changes, lack of trading partner availability, and war--all of which Diamond supplements with considerable research.   <br /> <br />But for all of the grandiloquence and anthropological minutiae, Diamond devotes not one letter of copy to the lack of vital institutions as a factor in collapse.  The problem with this oversight is that the primary cause for the collapse of any society, as well its ability to reform or rebound after collapse, is a lack of these institutions.  As Judith Thornton explains with regard to why the Soviet and Eastern European collapses differed in their relative ability to restructure after 1990: <br /> <br />\\"One difference between the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe is the immense size of the Soviet economy and high degree of centralization of its government system. The sheer size of the Soviet government meant that the resources at stake in government decisions were enormous, creating significant incentives for individuals in the decision-making hierarchy to attempt to influence decisions by lobbying and by distorting the information on which decisions would be based. Local interests took advantage of long bureaucratic channels between local and central levels and their control of information to supply biased reports.\\"   <br /> <br />What are the institutions whose absence impedes restructuring and post-collapse adjustment?  Thornton's answer comes later in the same chapter: <br /> <br />\\"First and foremost, they are property rights and markets. But what impedes the exercise of property rights and contracting in markets? The hurdles are lack of legal institutions, financial institutions, public goods such as law and order and physical infrastructure, and government administrative capacity.\\" <br /> <br />If the purported connection between institutions and transaction/interaction costs is right, no theory of societal collapse can be viable and fail to address the issue of institutions outright.  In the same way, no theory of collapse can omit the idea that rules of a certain sort effect the ability of a system to transition from a hierarchical to a networked state of affairs.  Thus, we should look past Diamond's work for valid theories of societal collapse.  A good place to start might be Douglass North's Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance.\\"
B000BW7QWW|5.0|What is the deal with the poor marketing behind Whedon's projects?? When the trailers for Serenity first started airing I wasn't interested at all. Much like when the TV series aired back in '02.  After reading nothing but good reviews for this movie, I took the plunge and LOVED it! Then I went back and watched the series.  This is a fantastic film (and series), better than any recent Star Wars in my opinion.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie yet, do yourself a favor and watch the complete Firefly series FIRST. I promise you won't be disappointed with your investment in time. Serenity picks up where the last Firefly episode ended and should make the viewing of this film much more enjoyable as not *everything* is explained in the movie.  Great flick!!
B000002B2X|4.0|Just after Alice In Chains had rocked my world by the heaviness of \\"Dirt\\", they unrocked it (so to speak) with \\"Sap\\". This EP is very much like the \\"Jar Of Flies\\" EP as far as songs being more acoustic-driven. In fact, I've wondered 1000 times why the two EP's were never released on one disc. I actually found the two packaged together as a 2-disc collection years ago, and of course grabbed it pronto. No it wasn't called \\"Jar Of Sap\\". Both the songs \\"Brother\\" and \\"Got Me Wrong\\" have turned up on other AIC releases, but \\"Right Turn\\" alone makes this a must to own. Layne, Mark Arm, and Chris Cornell singing together (aka Alice Mudgarden), that's a grunge fans wet dream come true. At the very least get this used.
B000BO0LKY|5.0|Tons of other artists have re-released their albums, so don't single Mariah out b/c of that TeamLamb tihng (That was OBVIOUSLY started by a Modonna fan to enrage fellow Madonna fans. You guys are pretty dumb if you didn't figure that out).  <br /> <br />And if Madonna re-released her new album with four new tracks and a DVD ,don't even TELL me that you wouldn't go buy it.  <br /> <br />Madonna fans are just jealous that Mariah had a comeback, when you thought she was over.
B000301YY8|1.0|In five to eight years' time, millions of copies of this CD will be nestled snugly against Daniel Powter and Aqualung in the reject bin at your local music store, I guarantee it.  <br /> <br />Whining like a sickly eight-year-old seems to be the \\"in thing\\" for male vocalists these days. Five years ago it was yelling and screaming like a mental hospital patient with a broken toe. From one extreme to the other, I guess. <br /> <br />Do not waste your money on this trash.
B000BB1MI2|3.0|Love the movie. \\"You're really weird, arnchya\\" is my favorite line that sums up the film. There's no great acting here (with a hugely weak Wonka play by Johnny Depp), no great characters but a great, continually moving visual feast that is just plain weird.  There is a Russian movie (forget the name) that is the longest single shot movie - about two hours - where the set just continually moves from scene to scene. \\"Charlie\\" reminds me of that movie but is much more visual. I think that the film pales a bit compared to the earlier Wonka with Wilder where the movie developed some character depth instead of relying on weirdness.
0571202284|5.0|I cannot reccomend this book enough. When I bought this book, I went home and threw away all my other animation books. This is the only one you will ever read. Richard Williams draws on a lifetime of experience working with some of the world's greatest animators and presents his knowledge with a beautifuly designed book. <br />Rather than a dull \\"text book\\" or technical manual feel, this book reads like you are sitting down at a drawing table right next to the author. If you are an animator- or even just interested in the art of animation, do yourself a favor and get this book!
0156907399|4.0|This book is considered one of the greatetst books ever written, and a little background information is required to understand why.<br /><br />Woolf was one of the first Modernists in literature.  The focus of her novels heads heavily on internal character development, growth and strife.  These internal thoughts form he basis of the plot, no great adventures, no murder mysteries, the psyche of the hman mind takes center stage in \\"To the Lighthouse\\".<br /><br />Her characters take on real human emotions, James who stays a victim of the Oedipal Complex (of which came out only shortly before this novel), and most notably, the internal workings of a victorian-woman's mind.<br /><br />The strains of love are pushed as it's darker side is explored, no dreamy music, no immediate happily-ever-after, but the beauty with which Woolf captures the Ramsey's love would ring deep with most long-married couples.<br /><br />To the Lighthouse is a difficult read, and time must be taken to contemplate what is being read, but if care is given, the novel emerges as a beautiful testament to the internal worlings of the human psyche, a beautiful piece of work with a subdued, but very present sense of familiarity.
B000AP04FG|5.0|HEY PEOPLE THIS IS AN ABSOLUTLY GREAT MOVIE. GOOD STORY AND VERY EXCITING. ALL U PEOPLE WHO SAY THE ACTION IS UNREALISTIC U CAN GO SCREW URSELF WHO CARES IF ITS REALISTIC, THE WHOLE POINT OF GOING TO A MOVIE IS TO BE ENTERTAINED NOT FOR IT TO BE REALISTC.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|This album is worth its weight in platinum just for videos and DVD behind the scenes footage.(Mariah is very funny). But that's not all you get..The 4 new songs are hits and Don't Forget About Us is tearing up the airwaves. Released Nov. 15: the album however saw an increase is sales week to nearly 200,000. Millions of Americans are making this record the standard stocking stuffer for music lovers. Mariah has set the bar very high and she proves she is one of the few stars in 2005 (50 Cent) to deliver a massive album..
B0007XT87G|5.0|With all the side projects one band member may persue, Steven Wilson in my mind, has to be the most successful at consistently spreading his genious around. Don't get me wrong. His main gig Porcupine Tree wouldn't \\"be\\" without the other individuals involved. However, let's say our little Stevie is, well, \\"special\\". With PT's latest release, I'm almost positive that a lot of fans can say that \\"beyond the sky is the limit\\". Deadwing offers much hope for the rock world and much to be expected. What I'm trying to say is that it's safe to get your hopes up with Mr. Wilson because you're sure not to be let down. Especially when it comes to his baby PT.<br />What can I say to beef up Deadwing that hasn't already been said. It's mature and intelligent music.<br />I'm just sorry more people don't know about PT. With all the garbage that is released today. You can't even compare MTV/radio driven rock/metal/garbage with these guys. My God, comparing PT with what's in the mainstream. People don't even realize how they are being ripped off.
1400086035|5.0|Charles Dickens is a legend, and Jim Dale should be.  I was thrilled to find out that Mr. Dale had recorded \\"A Christmas Carol\\" because I've listened to many many hours (and more voices than hours!) of Mr. Dale. <br />One of the great strengths of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is that it can be presented in many different ways and appeal to a variety of people at many ages.  I've seen and listened to, live or recorded, Owens, Sims, Barrymore, Stewart and even Mr. Magoo perform this story but I knew Mr. Dale could bring something new to it. <br />I'd forgotten that Crachit had no topcoat and Scrooge's niece had kissable lips.  I'd lost the memory of Scrooge trying to put out the light of the Ghost of Christmas Past and was glad to be reminded of all of the descriptions of food that Dickens layers throughout the book.  I love listening to the English phrases and words that had slipped from our common usage.  When I was young I thought the Ghost of Christmas Future was not much of a threat, but now, deep into middle age and a cancer survivor, I see that hooded figure quite differently. <br />It's a wonderful story, told with a fresh view from a beloved voice.  What a great Christmas present!
1594200653|5.0|Tony Judt, with POSTWAR, lays out in the massively complex story of the European continent in the wake of WWII.  But be prepared -- dense with facts (over-dense in some cases, perhaps) this is a history that demands much of the reader, both in terms of concentration, as well as time.   <br /> <br />Judt, I believe, uses his facts in an exemplary way - to really communicate, for instance, the near total destruction of Europe and the implications that held for rebuilding a shattered continent.  For example, Judt is particularly good at elucidating through facts the pernicious and massive evil of the Nazi death state, which he makes apparent was essentially a machine manned on one end by the military and on the other end, by slave labor manufacturing munitions.  This machine not only killed millions of Allied soldiers, and millions more to attain \\"racial purity,\\" it dragged hundreds of thousands into the heart of the Nazi military industrial complex from all over Europe to manufacture weapons and do the work of the \\"master race.\\"   It is in the details that Judt communicates how diabolical this machine truly was, its scale, its reach, its viciousness and cruelty. <br /> <br />Upon this solid foundation that Judt then builds his impressive history of Europe's recovery.  This is an even more complex story than that of the immediate postwar era, but Judt handles it with balance and distinction.  For those of us raised in the postwar world and who only experienced its history from movies, television, or less comprehensive histories, Judt's work is not only impressive its scope, but truly insightful and useful as well.   <br />
B000B7HZXM|1.0|This old man needs to get a life. He is stinky. I bet his teeth are made out of wood, but he's no george washington, although he probably went to school with him. And why all the ben-gay ? I bet he has a layer of crust on his toenails 3 inches thick. I bet you could find an entire uneaten grilled cheese sandwich under one of his wrinkly flaps. Get some BOTOX! STOP having BABIES! Youre a sicko! What kind of a skank would do this animated corpse? The songs on this CD are for old people like him. I can smell him thorough the microphone, it makes me want to barf. As for his hairy back, well , that is another story. So where did he ever get so much money? I bet he sold chihuahuas by the road for nickels. I bet he sleeps in a refrigerator box with pimento cheese stains. I bet he wears depends, since i could smell his excrement from over 200 yards away. I bet he doesnt even whipe. ROD. What a name. Well, you are what you eat, you know? But anyway. Why is your grandma so in love with this old hag? I bet its cause he has a barrel full of viagra, although its the generic kind. Flatulence is his calling card.
1563899426|4.0|Bill Willingham, Fables: Legends in Exile (Vertigo, 2002)<br /><br />If you needed any proof that the strength of DC's Vertigo line does not rest solely on Sandman and its offshoots, look no further. Bill Willingham's new graphic novel series Fables kicks off with a hardboiled detective story in the classic vein-- clues everywhere, suspects a-plenty, even the parlor scene at the end. The big difference here (aside from the obvious, that this is a graphic novel, a medium in which Agatha Christie never got round to working) is that the vast majority of the characters (we do see a mundy or two) are fairy-tale characters.<br /><br />A creature we know of only as The Adversary has taken over the lands previously owned by the various fairy tale characters, and driven out of their homelands, they've ended up sharing a building in New York City (with the more nonhuman of them inhabiting a remote upstate farm; one of the more amusing bits of the tale, which I assume will become a running joke, is that one of the three little pigs escapes the farm and ends up shacked up on the Big Bad Wolf's couch with a bad attitude and a nasty sense of entitlement). The Big Bad Wolf is the sherriff; Snow White is (for all intents and purposes) the director of operations; the whole schlemiel is run by, of course, Old King Cole.<br /><br />Our story opens with Jack (of the beanstalk fame) bursting into Wolf's office reporting that Snow White's sister Rose Red is missing from her apartment and that there's blood everywhere. Wolf, with Snow White tagging along at his heels, has to investigate, and thus begins your first hundred twenty-eight page journey into the contemporary lives of fairy tale characters. I say your first because I have every confidence that, once you have gotten to know these characters, you'll be going after the second book in the series posthaste. I know I will. *** ½
B000BOH8XW|5.0|We all now that Shakira is one of the most talented singers in the latin market, she is marketable, different (in a good way) but yet true to her music. But in her new album (Oral Fixation 2) she probes that she is no longer part of the so called \\"Latin Explotion) She can now be taken seriously and respected for what she really is, a female rock performer. This Album is so well crafted and different than her previous english album. It picks up where \\"Donde Estan Los Ladrones\\" left of. It resembles the Red Hot Chilly Peppers \\"Californiacation\\", and Alanis Morissettes \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" and Coldplays \\"Yellow\\". This is the best alternetive album of 2005. I hope she is recognized for this at the Grammys. I'm truly blowned away by this album and hope she keeps staying true to her rock alternative roots. Shakira has now become one of the best new Imports since Coldplay. In spanish or enlish she is now here to stay.
B000065BPB|4.0|These headphones are an excellent buy. After some research, I decided these were the best option for me. <br /> <br />I use them mostly at the office. I'm a designer and music really helps me concentrate on my work. These phones were perfect because they block out most of the ambient noise - but I can still hear my phone ring or someone calling me. Sometimes I put them on without playing any music throught them - just to get a bit of silence when I need it :) <br /> <br />I'm also a bit of an audiophile and the 280's are brilliant in reproducing all of the music I play through them (from electronica to reggae to classical to jazz to rock). I plug them straight into my PC at work, but they were lovely to listen to on my Marantz CD player at home.  Bass goes down deep and low without overpowering the rest of the music. <br />Apparently they sound much better when plugged into a headphone amplifier... <br /> <br />Although I have a larger-than-average head, I have had no discomfort wearing them - even after hours of listening. Because the cups can swivel, you can adjust them to a fine degree, so you can have a very comfortable fit. <br /> <br />Another great feature for me was that you can fold up / collapse these phones, which is great for popping them in my bag or desk drawer. <br /> <br />... <br />Now for my only disappointment: <br /> <br />When I bought them, I thought these phones would last forever. They're built like a tank and look and feel very rugged. The joints, cups, cable, connector, pads, etc. are very high quality and look very strong and sturdy. These were designed for the professional DJ or Sound Engineer out in the field, after all... <br /> <br />Which is why I was very disappointed to see cracks developing in the headband (above the earpiece, where it slides in and out). <br />This seems to be a very common problem with this model and apparently it isn't serious, but it's just one flaw in an otherwise beautifuly engineered product. <br /> <br />The cracks atarted appearing about 8 months after purchase - even though I handled them very carefully. <br />Sennheiser offer a 2-year warranty, which I'll soon take advantage of, but I'm sure it will crack again after repair. <br /> <br />It's just that the material used is not appropriate for the amount of stress applied to it. <br /> <br />Some customers have continued to use them even after the faulty part has completely cracked and fallen off, so it's probably only cosmetic damage...
B0007TKNIS|5.0|My nine year old daughter watched this and is now hooked on musicals.  I did have to explain at times, what was going on but she absolutely loved this movie and is now listening to the soundtrack constantly. <br /> <br />I would recommend this movie to get your children (especially girls) into music that has stood \\"the test of time\\".  <br /> <br />Absolutely great movie.  I loved all the singing and thought the actors were perfect.  Now I'd like to see the play but I'm afraid I might be disappointed.
B00004YZFR|5.0|Watching this after a screening of WOODSTOCK is a real study in contrast. ALTAMOUNT was always on my radar, growing up, and I had seen this in the theater back in the 70s, but revisiting it now ... what a revelation. There was a perception that WOODSTOCK had been an incredibly significant event in the counter-culture galaxy; a peace+love tribal congress. This concert came four months later, and because it was the west coast rebuttal to the upstate NY megafest, would be even better - better bands, better drugs, hipper hippies, freakier clothes, groovier vibes. The crowd shots are both revealing, and inevitably, terrifying as the claustraphobic crush tightens around the stage (crowd control plans, anyone?) and the HELLS ANGELS react like bears in cages being poked with sticks ... they erupt in an orgy of beatdowns and over-the-top violence. After all, that's what they do. Was anyone truly surprised? The various bands (Airplane, Santana, Dead, Stones) are merely ineffectual witnesses (with a good view) to what goes on, tho Marty Balin does get coldcocked during the Airplane set. I'm sure the musicians to this day feel fortunate that they did not get stomped on stage by the ever-growing legion of wild-eyed, wooly strangers standing nearby. (keep an eye out for the 300 lb. naked man careening through the crowd) If Woodstock gave us a pleasant marijuana buzz, Altamount grinds our collective molars with a bad blend of street meth and bootleg LSD. Man, am I glad I wasn't there. <br />All this being said, a good portion of this excellent documentary features the Stones backstage, in the recording studio, on the road, and performing with aplomb at a Madison Square Garden show.

How Enya is # 2 in Ireland in sales after U2 is much more evidence of the greatness of U2 than the quality of the totally depressing music Enya dispenses.  After some 5 years since the huge hit \\"Only Time\\", this album sounds even more morose.
B00005JO1G|4.0|\\"Jarhead\\" is a war movie not really about war.  Rather, it's about that strange time before war, when young men and boys are trained to kill without hesitation or remorse, when group-think and group cohesion become the goal of every soldier, and when the boredom and tedium of waiting for the enemy to strike can be almost as unnerving and unbearable as the horrors of war itself.<br /><br />The film is based on the true story of Anthony Swofford, a Marine sniper who served in the Gulf War in 1991.  The story begins in 1989, as Anthony is undergoing the grueling rigors of boot camp training.  When Saddam Hussein invades Kuwait, Anthony is shipped off to the Middle East as part of the operation known as Desert Shield, soon to become Desert Storm.  For Anthony and his fellow Marine sharpshooters, it is the waiting that turns out to be the least endurable aspect of the assignment, as they battle the discomforts of life in the Arabian Desert - and often each other.<br /><br />At no time does \\"Jarhead\\" pretend to be anything other than the story of one particular soldier in one particular war; we never get the sense that Anthony is supposed to be representative of all Marines at any given time.  As such, the movie eschews politics and philosophy, avoids heavy-handed moralizing and preaching, and refuses to either glorify or denigrate the men who are its subjects.  Instead, it keeps it all life-sized and realistic, showing us how ordinary men cope with the extraordinary life of being a Marine in times of peace as well as times of war.  Writer William Broyles Jr. makes every moment count as each of the major characters confronts some sort of personal demon, although Broyles never overstates the issues or indulges in cheap theatrics or hyperbole.  The men remain complex and real, with each character drawing both strength and weakness from those around him.<br /><br />Director Sam Mendes keeps the scale intimate and the story tightly focused on the interplay between the men, reserving most of the actual fighting scenes for the final act.  The film is filled with memorable moments and unforgettable images that often border on the surrealistic: the boys achieving a near-orgasmic frenzy watching the helicopter scene in \\"Apocalypse Now;\\" their stumbling upon endless rows of burned-out vehicles filled with charred corpses of fleeing civilians; oil from set-afire wells raining down from ink-black clouds, turning day into night and covering the earth with a thick coating of sludge and ooze; an oil-drenched horse mysteriously emerging out of nowhere only to disappear back into the vast wasteland of the ruined, darkened landscape.  The film is worth seeing for its imagery alone.<br /><br />Those seeking a traditional war film - one heavily laden with booming artillery and graphic battle scenes - may find \\"Jarhead\\" a bit of a slow go at times, but those in the mood for a film about personal relationships set in a military context will find much to celebrate in this movie.en, reserving most of the actual fighting scenes for the final act.

B0006L16N8|4.0|Excellent album-I think \\"message\\" is my favorite coldplay song ever.     But I really just want to address the reviewer 2 reviews down. OF COURSE the lyrics are inane, saccharine crap! Had you not heard a coldplay song before X&Y came out?? I think the \\"the scientist\\" rhymes \\"heart\\" with \\"apart\\" like 25 times! Its just part of what we get and what we expect with Coldplay at this point. They're still the best popular band going right now, unless you count The Darkness.
0553573403|5.0|This book was GREAT - I couldn't put it down. Like real life and unlike many fantasy series, bad things happen to good people. Magic is barely there in this book either. You can tell it is coming in the follwoing books, but most characters talk about magic and dragons as being hundreds or thousands of years gone. You also get a real feel for what it is like to live in a hereditary monarchy. If the new king is a drooling imbecile or a murderous psychopath it isn't like you can just vote him out of office in a few years, you have to kill him.
B0000028PI|5.0|I completely agree with the other reviewer who said this is a masterpiece.  I think it was a big hit for Alice in England but sadly ignored here in the USA.  Great story, terrific music and lyrics, even the artwork is the best on an Alice album since From the Inside (another one of AC's best \\"solo\\" albums).<br /><br />Buy it!  You won't be disappointed.

B00005JO1J|1.0|\\"Rent\\" is the story of eight New Yorkers from Christmas Eve 1989 to Christmas Eve 1990.  Those New Yorkers include Mimi (Dawson), a stripper who got HIV from sharing needles; Tom Collins (Martin), a gay man with HIV; Angel (Heredia), a transvestite with HIV; Roger (Pascal), a musician who also got HIV from sharing needles; and Mark (Rapp), a filmmaker who is trying to catch a break.  When old friend Benny (Diggs), the guy who owns the tenement that they all live in, threatens to evict them unless they start paying rent, they begin to worry about what the future holds for them.<br /><br />\\"Rent\\" is based on the popular musical of the same name and stars most of the original Broadway cast.  That is probably the greatest thing I can say about this movie, and I applaud the filmmakers for getting the cast to reprise their roles.  After all, they are the ones who made the characters what they are.  The music is OK, the stand out song being \\"Seasons of Love\\".  Of course, that is the first song, and the rest of the songs are lesser in comparison, so it is all downhill song-wise from there.  The story is maddening, as these lazy people struggle to live rent-free so that they can just enjoy life.  While I appreciate their desire to enjoy the time they have, I hated the characters for doing it at the expense of others.<br /><br />I did not like this movie.  I suppose to see it live is more impressive, and that may be enough to overshadow the dumb story, but that does not work in movie form.  This is for die hard fans of the musical only.  Otherwis, stay away!
0307276902|5.0|I would definitely be considered a voracious reader, and I must say that A Million Little Pieces could be the best book I have ever read.  I don't cry at movies, and I certainly don't cry when reading.  This book made me cry tears of sorrow as well as tears of joy at least 10 times while reading.  I laughed out loud several times, and I found that I peeled through this book in 2 days time.  Frey really has a great way of conveying how he was feeling while at Rehab.  While it may be an unorthodox prose, I can't wait to get my hands on his follow up book \\"My friend Leonard\\".  READ THIS BOOK!
0142000671|4.0|as with most of steinbeck's work, 'of mice and men' poses a series of moral dilemmas and takes a serious look at both the positive and negatives nuances of relationships; but more than anything, the novella (steinbeck's first major work) explores man's inability to escape his situation and surroundings. escape, maybe more than any other theme, runs through the book.<br /><br />lennie and george are well-documented characters, so there's no need to delve into their respective personalities.  what struck about 'of mice and men' is steinbeck's assertion that human beings in precarious situations, whether of their own making or as the result of others, are trapped.  whether or not the reader buys into this theory is, of course, up to the reader. however, throughout the novel steinbeck introduces the reader to characters stuck in their situations.  lennie desires freedom but is stuck with george (notice how many times lennie offers to leave george), george wants to be rich, but it stuck with lennie (granted, george chooses to remain stuck with lennie); curley's wife wants to be a movie star, but is stuck at the ranch with a miserably, miserly husband.  the majority of the major characters, at one point or another, all express sincere desires to escape their current situation--all of which lead the novel's shocking ending.<br /><br />without giving too much away, there are really on two possible interpretations to george's actions in the final pages.  either we view george as a savior or a muderer (i guess i just gave it away). either george is justified in his actions, or he is not. again, this depends on each reader's own individual interpretation of the text. steinbeck makes no effort to villify or diefy george--he simply tells what happened. was george justified? did he do lenny a favor or was he acting out of his own selfish motivations? it's a great topic for debate and thought.<br /><br />'of mice and men' was steinbeck's first major work and in a way established him as a master of the moral dilemma. this novel, just as his others, leaves you thinking days, weeks, months and years after you finish reading.

0553801503|1.0|It seems that Martin is following in the footsteps of Jordan.   He wrote a few good books and then just filled the pages with fluff to add another book.  Please do not buy this book.  It only encourages other authors to do the same thing.  There is nothing in this book that you need to know to continue the story.  I will wait until the next book hits the library or the used book store.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|Hypnotize, the companion CD to Mesmerize, completes a double album of the best music that System of a Down has ever created.  This second half offers stranger and at times much more discordant tunes than Mesmerize.  That is what is so good about it though.  Hypnotize's themes are a little bit darker than Mesmerize's so the music is naturally darker.  Many of the tracks are reminiscent of the older tracks of the original album.  The sound, however, has evolved immensely with extremely complex guitar riffs, multiple layers of sound and amazing vocal harmony.  The accompanying lyrics are also outstanding.  You may find yourself headbanging and shedding tears in the same song.  It's hard to describe everything that makes this album so awesome.  If you like any of System of a Down's previous CD's, then you should buy Hypnotize...NOW!
B000BP86OG|3.0|It is interesting.  That's for sure.  In my opinion, they had a chance to go in either of two directions after their first album, and, unfortunately, it appears they took the one that I was least hoping, even though it is still not a bad one necessarily.  As others have mentioned, they could have either gone the route of AC/DC, Motley Crue (good Crue) style balls to the wall rock, or taken the Queen, ELO, more art pop hard rock route.  They took the ladder.   <br /> <br />The new CD is definitely a step in the Queen, ELO direction and the production is ultra-slick.  This is both good and not so good.  But, again, I was hoping for a more dirty rock album.  The songs themselves are good and are growing on me more and more as I listen multiple times.  The majority of tunes are just too over produced for my tastes right off the bat.  This is mainly because I was expecting and hoping for the opposite.  Again, the songs themselves are good for the most part, some are really good, but some are overshadowed by the production and are the ones you can tell will totally rock live when they are stripped down.  I just wanted them to totally rock on the CD.   <br /> <br />You can tell that they were very conscious of the songs that were big hits from the first album in the writing and recording of this one because they stuck to that formula on most tracks.  Unfortunately, the big hit songs from the first album were my least favorite (even though I did like them).  I was just so hoping to get a hard, hard, dirty rock album this time around, even if it used a slick production.  More songs like `Black Shuck' and `Get Yer Hands Off My Woman'.  And while the new CD does open pretty strong with the first 3 tunes, they are just not as rocking as they could have been due to the style of production.  Then after the opening 3 songs they start the more experimental, poppy, overly produced tracks.  Some are good, some are not, but nothing strikes me as totally bad. <br /> <br />Overall I like it and it really is growing on me, but my initial impression is a bit of a let down and disappointment in the overall direction.  <br /> <br />3 to 3.5 out of 5 <br />
B000BO0LLS|1.0|I nearly bought \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" the original version... until i heard one particular song a few thousand times too much!! Yuck!!

B0000041JU|3.0|I give the Pictures 3 stars, and the Ravel Five stars.<br />I must admit that the first time I listened through this, I hated it. Pogorelich is so self-indulgent that it is hard to take him seriously sometimes. I have no doubt that he is an outstanding pianist, but I dont believe he is an outstanding musician. He can play the lights out of almost anything, but when you look closely at the little details, he often ignores the score, adds pauses that delineate the structure, and kill any momentum. I am not \\"dissing\\" this because he plays it differently. Pletnev plays this even more strangely yet I feel his performance, and his pianism in this work are only bettered by Richter.<br />This is a different performance to say the least. I found it to be average at best.<br />The Raval, on the other hand, is brilliant. HE takes up where the Gaspard left off.

055380457X|5.0|I picked this up hoping to learn why Google's stock price is over $400, and now I know.  \\"The Google Story\\" reads like a thriller at times, at other times like an inspirational how-to manual for business success. And, the authors do a great job of humanizing this tale of technological and business success. This was a really great read.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|Collateral is an excellent - and sometimes brilliant - thriller from Michael Mann, the director of Heat. Tom Cruise ('Vincent') holds cab driver 'Max' (Jamie Fox) hostage as he travels around LA to finish his 'work' (as Vincent puts it). <br /> <br />The movie starts out rather slow, and many action and thriller fans might be yawning or wondering what all the hubbub is about. But director Mann does not waste time with the camera - the first thirty minutes are integral to the story's plot and the character development of Max, a humble cab driver who does his job well, but is quick to point out that he has bigger aspirations. <br /> <br />Things continue on with seemingly little relevance until, by chance, Vincent (Tom Cruise) happens to pick him as his cabbie to drive him to several destinations. <br /> <br />From the moment Vincent talks to Max, it's apparent that something is up with Cruise. Steely eyed and grey haired, Vincent is a man in charge of his own destiny. The regular Cruise shtick - his smirks, his sunglasses - are distorted into a fierce but empty persona, giving the character the weird emotional vacancy of a sociopath. Most of his acting is done through his eyes and the confidence of his movements, delivering a completely believable but subtle performance that some might miss. While someone like, say, Javier Bardem (also in this movie) could have been cast as Vincent, Cruise adds a sense of 'glib nihilism' (as Mann puts it) and affability that makes his character both charismatic and interesting, much more so than a merely one dimensional, evil assassin. <br /> <br />Contrasting Vincent's confidence and fierce determination is Max, a cab driver who seems to be content, if not happy, to continue doing the same job night in and out. Compassionate and kind hearted but shy and humble, he is Vincent's polar opposite, and creates tension between the two characters as Max tries to stop him from his ruthless quest. <br /> <br />This tension from these two conflicting personality types is at the heart of the film. Collateral works on the level of a thriller, but is also a character study in how people can meet seemingly inconsequentially, and can change each others destinies. Excellent writing and acting makes watching Vincent and Max compelling and fascinating as both a study of who the characters are, and the subtle changes to what they become. <br /> <br />Max is instantly endearing and genuine, but perhaps the greatest triumph of Mann is the ability to get a performance from Cruise that is at once ruthlessly determined, but also touches on some of Vincent's latent humanity. Max's unease and sometimes shock over Vincent's nature segues into genuine talks between both characters that reach deep into the core of their inner beings. Throughout the the film, Mann makes both characters worth caring about. <br /> <br />The intensity of Vincent's work - and the fumbling of Max who tries to sabotage his plans - continues to escalate in an exhilarating fashion, culminating in a brilliant club shootout that is one of the best of it's kind. Filmed from several points of view, the surrealistic vibe, sound, and colors of the scene ooze sophistication. Lacking special effects like most action films, it nevertheless manages to effortlessly upstage them. This scene alone is worth the price of admission. <br /> <br />Much of Collateral's excellence is dependant on camera work, as some of the most poignant scenes are wordless and expressionistic. A knowing glace from Max or Vincent instantly gets feeling and emotions across without dialogue. Colors permeate the movie with a strange dream like quality that is only known to those who have quiet moments at dusk in a big city, and the cab itself feels like an entire world, never drab or boring. Whether it's streaking lights across the side of the taxi, or a shot of palm trees over someones shoulder, Collateral feels like a movie set at night in LA. <br /> <br />Completing the package is a solid and diverse soundtrack. From jazz to the cool vibe of club music, the movie manages to catch much in the way of the multiculturalism in big places like LA without feeling disjointed. The closing track of the movie, 'Requiem' by Antonio Pinto, gives this haunting movie an almost Vangelis Blade Runner era feel, further pressing the film into the viewers mind. <br /> <br />The ending is the only real hubris of the flick, unexciting and conventional compared to the exhilaration of the rest of the film.  <br /> <br />Smart, intense, sometimes mesmerizing and beautifully acted and filmed, Collateral is something that will stay on ones mind long after the credits roll.
B000AP04FG|4.0|Call it media blitz problems, but the negative feedback on this film, due primarily to the controversy of its stars, made a lot of people stay away.  But now on DVD MR & MRS SMITH has a chance to prove it is a good little action film.  Pitt and Jolie do have a screen chemistry that is as strong as some of the old film classics.  The plot is a bit silly, but the script takes the chance of addressing some important issues about marriage, therapy, trust, fidelity, and the impact of making relationships work under duress.  Not a great movie but a well-paced one and full of enough fun moments to make it a nice evenings diversion. Grady Harp, November 05
B00005JO1J|4.0|I thought this movie was great. It truly expressed in so many ways the true meaning of friendship and the struggles they went through. No matter what lied between them, they all stayed friends. An inspirational movie especially for teenagers to see. I recommend it to everyone.
B00005U8EM|5.0|Many people are familiar with this groundbeaking moral fable about a selfish man who must relive his life over and over in a sort of Dantean Hell until he emancipates himself from his selfishness and general misanthropic foolishness. To shed light on this theme, I recently I heard the film's director say that Groundhog Day was in part inspired by Buddhism, which says that our self is an illusion. Bill Murray's journey was, the director said, one from \\"self-centeredness to selfnessness.\\" That this journey is convincingly rendered without strident proselytizing is one of the film's great virtues and explains its long-lasting appeal. For films that deal with similar metaphysical themes, you might want to check out Being John Malkovich and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.
B0000067L2|5.0|Disraeli Gears is one of the all-time classic albums of the 60's.  It is also the best album Cream ever recorded, and shows Clapton at his peak at that time.  Clapton at that time was the best guitarist in Britain. He recruited the best bass player and best drummer in England, Hence Cream.  We all know that Sunshine of you Love along with Tales of Brave Ulysses, Swablr and Outside Woman Blues are on this CD.  What we have here is an expanded edition with album out takes such as Lawdy Mama which was where Clapton got the guitar for Strange Brew. Lawdy Mama was actually the song Clapton wanted to release, but the producer didnt like the lyrics. He wanted something more psychedelic to rival Jimi Hendrix. Clapton wrote the words for Strange Brew and stole the guitar from Lawdy Mama.  We also get to hear Clapton singing Blue Condition which he didnt sing on the original release.  We also get some excerpts from The BBC recordings.  You get the Stereo version and Mono versions of everything.  This is a great album and now with the added songs its even better. For collectors like you and me.
B000A5044C|5.0|This film is based on a true story but as Koreeda himself states at the film's outset, all the details of the film are entirely fictional as what actually happened was far bleaker than what is shown in the film. What actually happnened was that mother left one baby dead in the closet while leaving the other four on their own to take care of themselves. One of the kids that the eldest son brought into their apartment killed one of the other three infants, whose body was then abandoned in the woods. Afther the whole picutre of the incident unravelled, there followed lengthy debates in many quarters on how children born out of wedlock should be recognized and protected by society.  <br />  Compared to the utter gruesomeness of the event, the film, tragic though it may be in its own way, offers us viewers a glimmer of hope and is emotionally far more acceptable. All those child actors play wonderfully well with all the subtlty and fineness one can ask for. Piano, baseball, airplane and plants in noodle containers all work as metaphors of freedom that the children long for. This film is truly the one for the ages, and I have no hesitation whatsoever to call this a modern-day masterpiece.
B000002P5W|5.0|Axis as bold as Love is one of three albums that were released while Jimi Hendrix was still alive, if you dont count the Greatest Hits package he released. <br />Included are Castles made of Sand, which has some outstanding guitar on it. <br />If 6 was 9 is also on this effort. <br />The real find on the album is the recording of Little Wing. <br />Little Wing is not only well done as far as guitar but is among the best lyrics you will ever find by Hendrix or anyone else for that matter <br />This album is not usually mentioned a lot but those who have it, cant stop playing it. <br />If you havent heard much Hendrix or if you are exploring Hendrix for the first time, this is a great CD to check out.

B000001FGG|5.0|Wheels of Fire has two parts. A studio recording and a Live recording. <br />White Room opens the studio portion. Sitting on top of the World, Politician, Those were the Days and Undeserted cities of the Heart are included on the Studio portion. <br />On the live portion is where we get the real treat. <br />Crossroads is included here and to this day many think it is Claptons best performance on record with Cream <br />He takes the lyrics from Crossroads blues and adds a verse from Travelin Riverside Blues to come up with the lyrics to Crossroads. <br />Spoonful is also on the live portion. Spoonful lasts 16 minutes and features a very long guitar solo as well as some great bass solos.  <br />It captures the pace that Clapton and Bruce had in those days with blistering solos and an orchestra of drums added by Ginger Baker. <br />Baker is featured on his song Toad where he does a very long drum solo featuring his bass drums. At that time he was one of very few if any who used 2 bass drums. <br />Ginger Baker was without question the best drummer at that time and possibly could still be. <br />Train time is a song that Jack Bruces uses a blues harp to capture the effect of a train moving. <br />What you have here are three superb musicians in their finest hour. <br />I can listen to the live recordings on this album and enjoy them as much as I did in the 60's <br />

B000002KD9|4.0|This is one of several early solo albums by Neil Young that are now classics.  This album starts out with Tell me Why. Tell me why is played on an acoustic guitar. Neil flat picks the song and its actually very catchy.  After the Gold Rush is a song that to this day I have never entirely understood. Well I dreamed I saw some silver space ships flying in the yellow haze of the sun.  In a dream all in a dream, the loading had begun.  I have always wondered if we were being saved from a nuclear holocaust or what.  Southern Man is another classic on this CD. Dont Let It Bring You Down is a personal favorit of mine.  When you Dance, I can really love is a great rocker.  There is not really a bad song on the album

B000BB1MHS|1.0|from Tim Burton. The original will have nothing to worry about, as this film isn't within 50 miles of it. Lacking memorable songs, heartwarming characters, and other candies besides chocolate, this remake falls flat on its face.    I preferred Gene Wilder's warm-hearted and child-wise Wonka to Depp's deeply disturbed chocolate prodigy. In the original, there was more respect and affection between Willy and Charlie.  In the new version, the relationship seemed more superficial, needing Charlie to get Willy out of his shell. Why should a child have that responsibility?    Also, I am sick of issues of origin in movies. Why is Willy Wonka the way he is? Why not leave it up to the viewer's sweet imagination? We don't need flashbacks of Willy's terrorized childhood victimization by Christopher Lee. Chalk a couple of those scenes up to a bad dream instead.    While Tim Burton is a talented, original, and imaginative director, he needs to put more substance behind his stories and characters. They come across as one-dimensional and jokey. He needs to balance his gothic leanings with some true-to-life realism. Why not have a boring, white-bread, average Joe who has a soft side for lizards and turtles? How about a wrong- side-of-the-tracks guy clad in black leather, who, just may be guilty of sacrificing children to his favorite Aztec god?    I love outsider and misfit flicks just as much as the next goth, but, once in a while, let's mix it up a bit. Be unpredictable and realistic. Put some flesh behind those Count Chocula cartoon cut-outs.
B0000067L4|2.0|Cream announced their break up and had a contract for a final album.  Each member agreed to write one new song and the rest of the CD would be live.  Clapton wrote Badge along with George Harrison for this album.  Infact looking back Harrison along with Ringo Starr wrote the lions share of this song. It features classic George Harrision style guitar.  Doing that scrapyard thing was added by Jack Bruce and to this day does nothing for me.  Baker does the song What A Bringdown. In my mind Baker was talking about this album.  The live side is very solid with three great live songs that show Cream in top form. The songs are Politician, I'm so Glad and Sitting on top of the World.  This is not their best CD, but is worth purchasing if for nothing else but Badge and the live music
B000021YQV|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this album. There are tons of groups who can knock off a couple of good songs. But \\"Toxicity\\" just WORKS as an entire album. I feel that its best to listen to this in order, from beginning in end to get the full experience.  <br /> <br />Chop Suey is the obvious hit from the Toxicity, but not the best song however. <br /> <br />The best songs go in this order: <br />Toxicity <br />Chop Suey <br />Aerials <br />Forest <br />Atwa <br />Prison Song <br />Needles <br />...after that its hard to really rank the songs, but believe me they're all good. <br /> <br /> <br />
0446577383|4.0|Baldacci really thinks up a plausible scheme that terrorrist could probably succeed at. It's scary to think that. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the fact it wasn't a classic, and I think 5 stars should be left for those. However this book is a real thriller that you will enjoy immensely unless you're such a hardcore conservative that you can't take the story as what it is. A fictional story!
B000BM6AVA|1.0|This band has remained one of the worst psuedo metal bands since Korn. Real metal is Gwar, Deicide, inflames, Soilwork, Darkane, Strapping Young Lad, Wizard, Brainstorm, Gardenian, Helloween. SOAD is a pathetic excuse for music.
B000089RVX|3.0|i liked the guitars and double- drums, but Amy's voics sucked. She kept having to catch her breath from jumping around so much, and her vowel formations were WAY off. I'd know. I've been in chorus almost a full school year. I love \\"missing\\" though. Very addictive.
B00005JO1G|5.0|I actually loved the movie very much.... i watched it twice already and thinking about watching it a third time! :-) .... i didn't really have high expectations of the movie before i watched it... i just wanted to watch it cuz my bro is in the military... i guess thats why i liked it so much ....no high expectations = lovin the movie! i also ended up loving Jake Gyllenhaal which i never really thought much of him until i saw this movie!
B0000931QA|5.0|I recall buying this album on TAPE when I was about 16. I was used to listening to the likes of Warrant, Cinderella and (god forbid) Poison. Queensryche really made an impression on me with the sheer quality of their music and the story of Nicky, the assassin. <br />I can't recall exactly what I felt hearing it for the first time, but I still get a reaction from it everytime I listen to it. It's poetic, it's raw, it's profound. From the rocking SPEAK and OPERATION MINDCRIME, to the operatic heights of Suite Sister mary and the virtuouso guitar of Waiting for 22. This album has it all: Power, Melody, Meaning and above all, some of the most haunting songs ever written. Can't wait for the Sequel!
0451169514|5.0|...let it be \\"IT\\". This is his best book, even better than \\"The Shinning\\" in my opinion; and one of the greatest horror books of all time. Its horrifying and touching at the same time. <br /> <br />The 1000+ pages will fly, and in the end you will be sorry its over. <br />
B000002JOH|5.0|I notice there are a lot of reviews defending Pantera or the opposite, ripping them to shreds. At the end of the day who cares what anyone else thinks? <br />I listen to most types of music and wouldn't consider myself a 'metal-head'. However, there are times when all I want to hear is some heart-pounding drum beats combined with finger-shredding guitar licks. In this case, I turn to Pantera and VDOP. <br />Nothing really compares to this CD at full volume in the car, stunning my speakers and onlookers alike. I love metallica, but even they seem like Hanson compared to the sheer brutality of Pantera's music. I find it good motivation for that monday morning at work, or before a big football game. By demons be driven, this love, f**king hostile, regular people all get my blood flowing and fired up. <br /> <br />If you like b*lls to the wall, flat out, relentlessly hard and agressive music, buy this CD, you won't regret it. <br />If you don't like this music, don't listen to it.
0895260131|5.0|This book bothered me very much.  The idea that Islam, based upon the teachings of a false prophet, Muhammed, encourags followers to make war until the entire world falls under Islamic Law is a scary idea.  Of all the major religions, Christian, Budhist, Hindu, Shinto, etc, only the religion of Islam teaches world domination through violent means.  The present day jihadists are following in the footsteps of their prececessors through a thousand years of bloodshed, forced conversion and subjugation. Islam was born the creation of a warped deluded mind bent on vengeance. It remains that way. <br /> <br />The god followed by Islamics is definately not the God that Christians know. The Islamic god is a god of rath, vengeance and hate.  Their god demands conversion through war, ie: jihad. Those who do not immediately submit to conversion to Islam have two other choices, become a willing subject to Islamic rule (dhimmiah)and pay poll tax (jizya), or face death by the sword, neither of which is a benevolent choice. <br /> <br />Dr. Spencer points out in great detail how the Crusades saved Europe from Muslim domination.  He contrasts the teachings of Jesus Christ with those of Muhammad.  He outlines the steps that the non-Muslim world must take to protect ourselves from violent jihad. <br /> <br />This is one of the few books that I believe everyone should read. The Western World is facing a great challenge in the coming years.  It isn't global warming, air polution, or high gas prices that we have to fear, rather it is the religion of Islam.  In the words of Alexis de Tocqueville, \\" ...by and large there have been few religions in the world as deadly to men as that of Muhammad.\\"
1400077915|4.0|Canadian Alice Munro's newest collection of short stories, Runaway, has just been issued in Vintage Contemporaries paperback edition.  <br /> <br />For Munro fans it will be no surprise that theses stories are populated with unique, fully rounded characters whose stories are at once highly individual and broad ranging. The plots are grounded in the same human emotions found in most of literature, but each one shows a different take on those emotions, and the events and outcomes that surround them. <br /> <br />In one series of stories a woman named Juliet grows from a young girl falling in love to an older woman making her way on her own. At the end of the three stories about Juliet, when Munro has told her readers all she apparently intends to, I paged ahead in the book in hopes of finding further knowledge of Juliet and her daughter Penelope.  <br /> <br />Such is the power of these tales, and such is the nature of fiction: the author decides when, how much, and to what extent her characters will be revealed. <br /> <br />Munro is not a flashy writer, but she creates complex narratives. Her characters are often highly intellectual people, who exhibit the same tendencies to be found in all human beings. Of one character's loss of her impetus to finish her thesis and receive her doctoral degree Munro writes:  <br /> <br />That is what happens. You put it away for a little while, and now and again you look in the closet for something else and you remember, and you think, soon. Then it becomes something that is just there, in the closet, and other things get crowded in front of it and on top of it and finally you don't think about it at all. . . . A loss you could not contemplate at one time, and now it becomes something you can barely remember. That is what happens. <br /> <br />And, that is what is at the heart of these fascinating stories. We all have what Munro calls our \\"bright treasures.\\" Some of them are living beings, some are accomplishments, some are hopes.Some bright treasures are simply the way in which we see ourselves in the world.  <br /> <br />Armchair Interviews says: What keeps the reader fascinated is how Munro weaves each of her stories so tightly, how she shows us the clear humanity in each of her characters.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005Y228|5.0|I cannot believe some of the negative reviews I have read about Kylie and this album.  Thankfully there are many, many more people out there like me who completely love this album.  Every song is a winner.  Step out of your jaded world of music snobbery so you can hear it! <br /> <br />Even more important than the music itself is the positive, uplifting feeling that all of \\"Fever\\" brings.  It is almost staggering how much joy this album has given me.  I mean that very seriously.  Very highly recommended!  I also recommended \\"Light Years.\\"     <br /> <br />
B0000039PW|5.0|I'm not big on the whole Ho's and cash rap thing.  In fact there's very little about WHAT Notorious BIG or any of his contemporaries rap about that I care for.  I do however, appreciate talent when I hear it.  I am a fan of Biggie... a BIG fan... and a huge fan of this CD.  When I listen to it I don't so much hear talk of gats and b*tches, rather I hear a talented young man with a unique penchant for humor (even self-deprecating), skillful use of language and verse, a captivating style and flow, and the incredible ability to tell a tale that resonates.  Anyone can make a rhyme, some can even weave a really insightful yarn... but Biggie creates a symphony.   <br />What I loved MOST about him above all others was his ability to enthusiastically deliver his gift for graphic verse, yet NOT take himself too seriously (which, despite his talent, was one of my major reservations about Tupac).  Biggie's READY TO DIE doesn't just make your head bob... it's \\"entertaining\\".  Biggie was hungry and seemed to genuinely enjoy putting his all into his craft.  Despite his youth and talk of guns, boosting and such, there was something in his words that gave me the feeling he truly wanted to eventually rise above what he'd previously been or rapped about, while others seemed content to wallow in it forever. <br />READY TO DIE reigns supreme as one of my favorite all-time hip-hop albums.  To this day I can still bounce to \\"Big Poppa\\", giggle at his clever lyrics and even shed a tear because there's a moment when I feel his sincerity just that much on... if you can believe it... \\"Me and my B*tch\\".   Initially I'd written this review capturing a verse that sticks with me from each song.  However in doing so I discovered that, for me, the magic of this CD is not just in his lyrics but in his energy and delivery.   Think of the \\"One More Chance\\" remix single... tying for highest debut single ever.  The track is very nice, yes (sampling an R&B song \\"Stay With Me\\").  But would any other rapper have made it what it became?   <br />R.I.P. Christopher Wallace
B00005JO1P|5.0|Walk the Line is a movie that all will enjoy.  Cash fan or not this movie moves you and makes you enjoy the music and share in his life for a few hours.  I know a person who claims to hate country music but was dragged to this movie by her father and she is so glad that she went.   <br />I have been a Cash fan all of my life and this movie does his life story justice.  It was well acted, making you believe the addiction and certainly the love that John and June Carter Cash shared. <br />I would recommend this movie to all young and old. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000BGR0OM|4.0|I remember hearing \\"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\\" for the first time in the summer of 1983 and mistaking it for a Grace Jones song.  The icy synths and Annie Lennox's commanding voice made this track a single like no other I heard before.  Little did I know that Lennox and Dave Stewart would stick together for a quarter of a century during which they would enjoy a string of hit singles, gold/platinum albums, and even enjoy the honor of recording with Aretha.  \\"The Ultimate Collection\\" is the duo's second hits compilation (the first was the best-selling \\"Greatest Hits\\") which features two new songs: \\"I Got a Life\\" and \\"Was it Just Another Love Affair.\\"  Both are pleasant adult contemporary singles that are a far cry from their edgy material of the 1980s.  The hits fare better: from chilly synths (\\"Here Comes the Rain Again\\" and the outstanding \\"Who's That Girl?\\"), legit soul (\\"Sisters Are Doing It For Themselves\\"), bittersweet pop (\\"Thorn in My Side\\"), and a couple attempts at rock (\\"Would I Lie to You\\" and \\"When Tomorrow Comes\\").  I'm also pleased to see that two cuts from the underrated \\"Savage\\" album appear: the urgent \\"I Need a Man\\" and \\"You Have Placed a Chill in My Heart.\\"  But I have to dock a star because \\"The Ultimate Collection\\" excludes the singles \\"Don't Ask Me Why\\" and \\"Beethoven (I Love to Listen To).\\"  Including solo Annie or solo David material makes no sense as this is a EURYTHMICS album, and inclduing album tracks would be nice but unnecessary in this instance.  However, had \\"Don't Ask Me Why\\" and \\"Beethoven\\" appeared, \\"The Ultimate Collection\\" would have truly been ultimate and worthy of five stars.
0689853637|5.0|This remarkable, enchanting book is a work of art. It dazzles the reader with its beautiful three-dimensional and intricate pop-up creatures and scenery, warm prose and unexpected surprises on every page. For anyone who can delight in the joy of childhood wonder, this amazing creation will be a joy to the senses. Robert Sabuda is a magician - an adult with a heart and soul that is ageless and who is in touch with the child within. For the young of heart of all ages, this book is a treasure.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This movie is intense. The action, the emotions, the plot development, the effects, the acting - this movie is full to the brim and is guaranteed to sweep you off your feet. You'll laugh out loud, you'll cry, you'll hold your breath, you'll sit quietly in astonishment. The audience in the cinema where I watched Serenity (totally packed) were by turns completely still and in uproar. What a great experience! <br /> <br />Contrary to most science fiction drivel, it actually has real people you quickly relate to going through actual character development, a story worth telling and the use of special effects and action in the service of the plot - not vice versa. Don't miss this - guaranteed a place among science fiction classics!
0553801503|3.0|First off, a point I haven't seen yet.  I remember reading something about Martin originally planning the book after Storm of Swords to take place 5 years afterwards.  Then, he decided to write Feast of Crows to fill in that in between time.  Therefore, even before he ran into the problem of having too much material for one book and splitting it up, Feast for Crows was already destined to be more positioning and some filler vs major, story altering events happening.  Dance of Dragons should also be much of the same except with more of our favorite characters so I am already anticipating more Jordan comparisons about filler books, etc.  Where it will \\"hit the fan\\" as it were will be in book 6 if this memory of mine is correct.   <br /> <br />Secondly, because he was so upfront about what he did with the book, ie; splitting the story the way he did...I did not have a problem with not seeing some of the more popular characters.  It did leave me very much anticipating Dance of Dragons so we can visit those characters though.   <br /> <br />Basically, I enjoyed the book.  The writing was Martin through and through and its content was exactly as Martin had let it be known it would be.  I think most of the negative reviews are either those who are impatient for the more meaty content, or had expectations that it would be in this book.  It was not, hence the 3 stars, but I did enjoy it.  Thanks GRRM! :)
B000687M48|1.0|This is a good example of a trash band over hyped. Check out Nightwish, they do the same thing only better, every song on this cd has the same tempo with the same vocals. I am just giving this cd 1 star to lower the rating because the band/singer are that bad. Just like Linkin Park they will only re-release the same 1 or 2 cds for the rest of their career and try to milk them for all the money they are worth.
B0001LJC2K|1.0|I read a couple reviews from this album and thought it was going to be a rendition of a Radiohead album mixed with some Coldplay and Queen...but it is far from. If you are looking for good music, do NOT get this album. Radiohead is being degrated when people compare this band to them. This album sucks. theres a bunch of whining and music beats that are ones i've heard before just with some screaming or singing in the back. Nothing was good on this album and no one should get this. take heed to my warning. please!
B000020617|1.0|and he's a super-talented drummer. The day the Foos release a best-of compilation I'll probably pick it up. Otherwise, I'm sad to say that the average Foo Fighters album cut just doesn't cut it for me. All of the songs on THERE IS NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE are mediocre, run-of-the mill \\"alternative\\" rock. Only \\"Stacked Actors\\" has some real songwriting substance and it does have some swagger and bite, but to be perfectly honest, it still isn't a huge turn on in my book. \\"Learn to Fly,\\" the other track that got some airplay on alt-rock radio, may as well have been written by The Outfield or some other average rock band along those lines. I almost gave this album two stars, but unfortunately I think that rating would be just too generous.<br /><br />Foo Fighters HAVE made some really good songs, like \\"Everlong.\\" But I honestly don't think they'd be nearly as big if Grohl hadn't drummed for one of the most highly revered and charismatic bands of all time, NIRVANA. Elsewhere, their fantastic cover versions such as Gary Numan's \\"Down in the Park\\" and Prince's \\"Darling Nikki\\" suggest they are great rockers but less great in the songwriting department.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|Cream was a super-star group in its day, and this video just shows that they are still masters of the craft. How can anyone give this production less than five stars? I have a feeling many of the viewers who do so are of a younger generation. They just don't see what all the hype is about. I can understand that. When I was a kid, and my Dad would play Sinatra, or the Dorsey Brothers music, I could not figure out what he saw in them.It sounded \\"awright I guess.\\" He said these performers were great. If you say so. Sometimes you just have to be a member of the generation that spawned the particular music you are listing to in order to truly appreciate the experience. <br />  Cream is indeed a Generational/cultural thing. Listening to them on a Stereo, via an LP, circa the late 60's or early 70's is part of the Baby-boomers roots. Seeing them today just brings back a slight taste of our youth. Yeah, they look a bit shop worn, (I'm not getting any younger myself) but sound great. Its a nostalgia thing. <br /> Remember Having service refused you in stores or eating establishments because of your hair length. Seeing signs on Taverns that read \\"Hippes Use The Back Door.\\" Remember phrases such as \\"Are you for real?\\" or \\"Its organic. How can it hurt you?\\" and the often used \\"Hey man, don't hassle me.\\"  <br />  Cream were a part of all that. If you were a member of the counter-culture, and the music then (Beatles, Doors, Cat Stevens, Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young and so many others) WAS one of the most important things in your life, you'll love this DVD.
B000A59PMO|5.0|Veronica Mars, is the first television show in a long time to constantly keep me guessing. I love the creative plot and the connection of themes made throughout each episode. I recommend this show highly. You'll love every minute of this spunky one of a kind teenage girl's life.
B000BJS4SU|4.0|I've always admired John Mayer for his songwriting abilities, but when I first saw him live his guitar playing ability took me by surprise.  Now, after millions of albums sold and 3 grammys, he has taken the risky move to form his own blues-rock trio.  All things considered, it was a risk worth taking.  The album features 11 performances from the Trio's maiden Fall 2005 tour, seven of which are new Mayer originals.  Of those, \\"Good Love Is On The Way,\\" \\"Gravity,\\" \\"Vultures,\\" and the terrific title track stand out.  \\"Something's Missing\\" is fairly faithful to previous live and studio versions, but \\"Daughters\\" is transformed into a revelatory bluesy ballad.  But the album has its weak parts.  \\"Who Do You Think I Was\\" sounds like a sloppy Lenny Kravitz rip-off, and the pure blues of \\"Out Of My Mind\\" is meandering and unfocused.  But the best is the cover of Ray Charles' \\"I Got A Woman,\\" where Mayer, bassist Pino Palladino, and in particular drummer Steve Jordan shine.  While this is not your babysitter's Mayer, and blues (and SRV) purists may scoff, this is a credible first step in a new direction for John Mayer, one that bodes well for the future.
B0006284JQ|1.0|I knew nothing of Brittanny Spears's music career, but with the huge following from the \\"MTV X-treme Generation\\", I assumed she'd at least have some talent.  Not so.  I was also hasty enough to believe music aimed at boys and girls aged 5-15 would be suitable for that demographic.  Again, it seems I've missed something.  Apparently pornography is now suitable for all ages.<br /><br />How did a bright young girl from the Mickey Mouse Club stoop so low as to parade her unmentionables around in front of impressionable young children?<br /><br />The album cover isn't the only offensive thing about this album.  Miss Spears's lyrics are no better.  \\"Me Against The Music Featuring Madonna\\" promotes anarchy, and \\"Overprotected\\" overtly encourages birth control.  Who knows what permanent damage this alleged \\"music\\" is doing to the children of today.  My 14-year-old nephew, Norman, only started wearing midrif-exposing tops after I bought this CD for him.<br /><br />I for one will be burning this album and sending the melted remains back to Sony.  I suggest all other God-fearing aficionados of good taste do the same.
B000BBOUU4|5.0|This movie was a delight.  It was much better than the original and had a lot of emotional moments. <br /> <br />The acting, special effects, and songs were amazing. <br /> <br />  Interestingly enough, this is the second movie Johnny Depp was in involving chocolate.

0783227434|5.0|Despite my dislike for Evil Dead 2, I have to admit that Army of Darkness is actually a successful film.  Unlike Evil Dead, the acting pulls off the comedy smoothly, and there is never even a gesture towards being a serious film.  From the moment Ash (Bruce Campbell) is sucked into the infinite and plopped down in a medieval world, chainsaw, shotgun, and all, everything is played for gags, and this time it works.<br /><br />Take a dab from A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, through in an entire host of the undead and you pretty much have the story line.  Ash is dripped into the middle of a battle between Lord Arthur (Marcus Gilbert) and Duke Henry (Richard Grove).  Arthur, the victor, promptly drops Ash in a pit where the undead roam.  Ash gets royally ticked off and makes tiny little pieces of the opposition.  As he crawls out from the hole, the local wiseman (Ian Abercrombie) pronounces him The Promised One, and we are off to the races.<br /><br />Or rather, off to the graveyard, where the local copy of the Necronomicon has made its home.  Managing to forget the words of the releasing spell (klaatu barada nikto) and manages to release the entire deadite army.  But Ash is not to be undone - he wants to go home to his job managing the sporting goods section and it is going to take a whole lot more than a few 1,000 ugly corpses to stop him.<br /><br />As I've said, this film works the best of Director Raimi's series.  In part, I think, because Ash starts out mad, and plays the maniacal cowboy knight to a tee.  In addition, the choreography for the final showdown is excellent, and the script actually has a number of good lines in it.  None of that bad film makes good nonsense here, this was written to be a good film, and it really turned out that way.
B00000761W|4.0|Ready An' Willing\\" is a blues rock record performed with the Whitesnake's best lineup. Along with David Coverdale, Ian Paice and Jon Lord from Deep Purple joined up with British guitarist Bernie Marsden and Mickey Moodey to produce the finest blues-rock album of 1980. This is their best album!<br /><br />Highlights: Fool for your loving, Ready & Willing, Blindman and Carry your load.<br /><br />If you like the MK III version of Deep Purple, you will probably like this disc as well.
B000002BSG|5.0|I'm gonna make this short...If you heard one track on here and really dug it your gonna like the whole record.  They use mostly live instrumentation on this record and it stands out on this record more than others, that and the excellent production.  The only time I've ever gotten negativism from this record are from the didjereedoo tracks which can easily be passed over if your not diggin' em.
B000001FLA|5.0|Of  the myriad Yngwie Malmsteen albums to own, this is one of them, especially for guitar players (neven guitar aficionados).  Also, Trilogy, Odyssey, Marching Out, and the Concerto Suite with the orchestra are all very good, with a definite must have is the Live in Leningrad show.  Yngwie does a 10-minute solo that fuses his neo-classical style with blues and other genres, and it is simply amazing.  Yngwie does like to play fast for a long time, and quite consistently, which turns away a lot of people looking for simple guitar lines (which is a shame).  I just saw him live last weekend and can say that his finger speed in person is dazzling.  Scalloped frets or not, he can play blindingly fast anywhere on the guitar, and the cleanliness of both his picking and fingering hands while he plays above the 12th fret is simply amazing.  But when he broke it down and played some bluesy tunes, it was just as amazing.  And he can play the classical guitar as fluently as he does the electric, which is refreshing.  Yngwie can be described as an amalgamation of metal, blues, and classical mixed together to present a heterogeneous style that is unique and appreciable.     Yngwie influenced some of the best guitarists out there, such as Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, Jason Becker, Marty Friedman, Paul Gilbert, and Vinnie Moore (Tony MacAlpine is good too but is a far better keyboardist).  Check out some of the Cacophony (Friedman & Becker) and Racer X (Gilbert) material, it is phenomenal, and you can notice the influence Yngwie's neo-classical style had (arpeggios galore).  If Jason Becker had not gotten ALS (known commonly as \\"Lou Gehrig's disease\\") he would be competing with Yngwie for the role as the best rock guitarist on Earth.    Any guitarist who bashes Yngwie as merely a shredder (a complete misnomer) needs to consider switching to a more suitable instrument, perhaps the lute.    (...)

B0000TG9E2|4.0|As a film \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" has always been in the bottom 10 of Disney animated features for me(high on the bottom ten).  Not for technical reasons or characters.  I guess I never liked how abruptly this film ends.  She wakes up from her freaky dream...  ...film over.  I think I actually enjoy it more as I grow older but the end just always bugged me.<br /><br />However, as a DVD package this is the best feature laden production second only to the \\"Snow White\\" release a few years back.  I really don't want to talk about the films merits.  That's important but I doubt you don't know if you want this film or not.  What follows is a list of the things beyond the actual film that make this an incredible DVD;<br /><br />-Virtual wonderland party is live action fun for kids, and somewhat obnoxious for adults.<br />-\\"Thru the mirror\\" Mickey Mouse short is a great bonus.  Another example how Walt would recycle ideas/visuals from older films into new ones.<br />-\\"I'M Odd\\" \\"lost\\" song is OK but self indicting.  Left out for good reason (I think).  Not fully animated either.<br />-Sing alongs are...  ... sing alongs.  No big deal.<br />-Set top game is easy and has disapointing results.  Oh well.<br /><br />Thats disc one.<br /><br />DISC TWO:<br /><br />-Dispite the description, \\"One Hour In Wonderland\\" is a full hour TV special complete with Coka-Cola advertisments from 1950, not a documentary.<br /> THIS IS PURE GOLD!!!  I would have bought this as a DVD by itself.  Included are comedy bits by Edgar Burgen and his usual cast of dummies, Kathryn Beaumont (the voice of alice) as Alice, Walt and his Family, his famous team of animator playing in a firehouse band, a Pluto short film, clips from \\"Snow White\\" and the currently un-released \\"Song of the South\\". Finally, a \\"premier\\" clip from \\"Alice in Wonderland\\".  This is a digital time capsule into \\"ancient\\" television.<br /><br />Honestly, there are more extras on disc two, but I got so wrapped up in the one hour special that it became second thought.  Deleted scenes and concepts are common Disney fair and the other clips of shows are less compelling than the special.  The Match card game is, again, too easy.<br /><br />I hope this fills in the gaps that I have not been able to find on the other reviews here.  The point is the extras are worthy of their own disc, so this is absolutely a great buy!mmon Disney fair and the other clips of shows are less compelling than the special.

B000001FOS|5.0|Of  the myriad Yngwie Malmsteen albums to own, this is one of them, especially for guitar players (neven guitar aficionados).  Also, Trilogy, Odyssey, Marching Out, and the Concerto Suite with the orchestra are all very good, with a definite must have is the Live in Leningrad show.  Yngwie does a 10-minute solo that fuses his neo-classical style with blues and other genres, and it is simply amazing.  Yngwie does like to play fast for a long time, and quite consistently, which turns away a lot of people looking for simple guitar lines (which is a shame).  I just saw him live last weekend and can say that his finger speed in person is dazzling.  Scalloped frets or not, he can play blindingly fast anywhere on the guitar, and the cleanliness of both his picking and fingering hands while he plays above the 12th fret is simply amazing.  But when he broke it down and played some bluesy tunes, it was just as amazing.  And he can play the classical guitar as fluently as he does the electric, which is refreshing.  Yngwie can be described as an amalgamation of metal, blues, and classical mixed together to present a heterogeneous style that is unique and appreciable.     Yngwie influenced some of the best guitarists out there, such as Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, Jason Becker, Marty Friedman, Paul Gilbert, and Vinnie Moore (Tony MacAlpine is good too but is a far better keyboardist).  Check out some of the Cacophony (Friedman & Becker) and Racer X (Gilbert) material, it is phenomenal, and you can notice the influence Yngwie's neo-classical style had (arpeggios galore).  If Jason Becker had not gotten ALS (known commonly as \\"Lou Gehrig's disease\\") he would be competing with Yngwie for the role as the best rock guitarist on Earth.    Any guitarist who bashes Yngwie as merely a shredder (a complete misnomer) needs to consider switching to a more suitable instrument, perhaps the lute.    (...)
B0002VKZL6|4.0|Just picked up Knopflers latest and must say I am quite impressed Ive loved music all my life with a very diverse collection from rap and rocknroll to mozart and chanting monks Ive long known of Marks work that I heard on the radio and always enjoyed it and cant beleive I had never purchased any of his cds especially when I know the mutual respect he shares with one of the greats sent from the  heavens to enlighten the masses Bob Dylan. Well Im really glad I picked up this c.d. there are a number of gems and I love the feel I cant wait to explore his past work. Ive given it four stars as it is a very good album and I reserve my five stars for masterpieces such as The Beach Boys Pet Sounds .
B000002JSP|4.0|I dug this album. Plant's voice was disappearing around this time, but like fine wine, he let the aging do the talking.  The song that took me by surprise was \\"Carouselambra.\\" They had a funky disco sound going on through most of the track, with the synths and the creeping bass lines.   <br />Page & Plant let go of the reins and give John Paul Jones room to stretch out with the keyboards and Bass throughout this album, with mostly good results.
630460291X|1.0|I like this movie overall but the DVD itself is rather frustrating.  Half of the movie is on one side of the DVD and half the movie is on the other side.  It is only an hour and a half to two hour movie.  There is no reason that the view should have to put up with that.  Movies of greater length have the feature in its entirety on one side of the DVD.  I do not recommend this particular version of Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.
B00005JKC3|3.0|. . . Lots of muscles<br /><br />  And skin that's green<br /><br />  You can make him with Play-Dough!!!<br /><br />The Incredible Hulk is an incredible butt-cramper of a movie.  You kind of wish you had him around to work out the kinks in your back from sitting so long.<br /><br />The movie took itself WAY too seriously for a comic-book film.  The special effects Hulk looks amusing rather than scary.  His powers are preposterous.  He leaps and flies through the Grand Canyon like an eagle, even though he weighs about a ton.  He battles the military in the air and sky, under tremendous stress, but never eating a bite of food for fuel.  He splits his shirt, but his purple shorts miraculously contract and expand with him.  It was all I could do not to bust out laughing.<br /><br />Nick Nolte is very good as Bruce Banner's megalomaniac father who wants his son's powers for himself.  He alone makes this movie good for a one-time rental ONLY.
B000001DTM|5.0|You should own this album. Stop reading this review and push the 'buy' button. Now. Go on!<br /><br />If you're still reading then you probably want to know why. You're one of 'those' people...which is fine. I guess.<br /><br />You want to own this album because its by the only band that came out of the 80s, survived, released more material that was not only relevent, but revered, who then hit a small slump but snapped out of it to once more take their (rightful) place as icons in pop culture. You want to own this album because it was a turning point for the band, where they dropped their older sound (the Joshua Tree, Boy, War) and started into their newer style (though it took them some time to really perfect it- see 'Pop'). You want to own this album because it contains some of the bands most popular hits.<br /><br />...but more importantly, you want to own this album because it has some really, really good music on it. Forget what you've heard on the radio, forget all about 'One' and 'Mysterious Ways'. Forget them and instead concentrate on the rest of the album. The sounds represented here are sonic in scale, the lyrics are terrific, the execution is iconic (if you are not U2, you wish you were)...In short, this is the album that most artists wish that they could make- It's the one that you can plop into your CD player and hit 'play' and then never have to touch the controls again- most people never achieve that, though they try and try.<br /><br />In a recent interview, Bono mentioned that he thinks that songs can be a lot like prayers. The music contained in this album supports that statement- the words themselves paint grand pictures of in the inner workings of people and their emotions, all of which is supported by the three musicians who make the music that works hand-in-hand to elevate those lyrics. This isn't just art for arts sake, its something more; this is the essence of what Don McClean was trying to capture in his song so long ago.<br /><br />Bottom Line: see the top line.<br /><br />-LP<br /><br />Now!r />Bottom Line: see the top line. <br /> <br />-LP <br /> <br />Now!
B00005JO1J|3.0|Being the good homosexual theater student that I am, I patiently waited for five-hundred twenty-five-thousand six-hundred minutes for the film version of Rent. Of course my expectations were high since almost the entire Broadway cast reunited for the film, and the film soundtrack (in my opinion) is much more enjoyable than the Original Broadway Cast recording. Sadly though, the film version of Rent made me more disappointed than seeing a horribly miscast and untalented thirty-something play the title role in last year's film adaptation of The Phantom of the Opera.    So what turned this Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award winning piece of theater into the worst film adaptation of a musical since A Chorus Line? I'd start by blaming virtually unknown screenwriter Steve Chbosky and director Chris Columbus as both obviously do not understand what the original stage version is all about.    (...)  Still, Rent is somewhat redeemed by its brilliant cast. \\"Law and Order\\" alum Jessie L. Martin gives a charming performance as Collins. His rendition of the heart-wrenching reprise to \\"I'll Cover You\\" is enough to win him a Golden Globe nomination. Other stand-outs are Tony Winner Idina Menzel's energetic and hilarious performance as the trashy, constantly horny bisexual Maureen. Her rendition of the monologue/song/performance art piece \\"Over the Moon\\" is both nonsensical and laugh-out-loud funny all at once. And Tracie Thoms as Maureen's sophisticated, Ivy-League lesbian lover Joanne gives a brilliantly understated and demure performance. Their fierce duet, \\"Take Me or Leave Me\\" is easily one of the most enjoyable moments of the film, as is Thoms's duet with Antony Rapp's Mark in the \\"Tango: Maureen.\\" But the biggest surprise of the bunch is Rosario Dawson as the optimistic yet HIV positive junkie, Mimi. Who knew that she could sing or dance? At any rate, she is a joy to watch, and her striptease number \\"Out Tonight\\" is a high point of the film.    Despite the enjoyable performancesby the cast, Rent is plagued by bad writing, directing, and editing. As I watched this train wreck I could picture the producers of the upcoming adaptations of Dreamgirls and Hairspray cowering in a corner. My advice when it comes to Rent: save your money for The Producers, which will hopefully follow in the footsteps of better recent musicals like Moulin Rouge and Chicago. And if you must see Rent, well consider that renting that seat in the movie theater costs a lot more than renting the DVD will.
B00005MP58|5.0|Firstly, let me address the quality of the DVD.  Yeah, it's fine.  I don't know what other individuals are talking about when they complain about the poor quality.  They must have gotten bad copies because the quality is fine.  Now, let's talk about the film itself.  Pride and Prejudice is one of my all-time favorite books.  This is now one of my all-time favorite movies.  This film truly does the novel justice.  It is suberb.  Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle top the list of \\"everyone in this thing was perfectly cast!\\"  My husband doesn't really care much for period films, but he sat down and watched this with me last year and it is now one of his favorite movies.  Anytime we're sitting around wondering what to watch, one or both of us inevitably calls out, \\"Pride and Prejudice!\\"  Love it, love it, love it!  I know there is a new version coming out with Keira Knightley, but I can tell you right now it won't be able to hold a candle to this faithful adaptation.  Just see this one instead.
B00079HZUM|4.0|Despite how much I've enjoyed some movies this summer, such as The 40 Year Old Virgin and Batman Begins, the lackluster movie season has made me turn to DVDs. <br /> <br />A few nights ago I rented Stage Beauty starring Billy Crudup and Claire Daines and got a pleasant suprise. The film was a wonderful blend of comedy and drama. The story, set in London circa 1660, centered around Ned Kynaston (Crudup), a famous bisexual actor who plays women on the Elizabethan stage. His dresser, Maria (Daines), wishes to be an actress, despite a royal decree that only men can act. Still, Maria finds a loophole and under the stage-name Margaret Hughes she performs, impresses the mistress of the King, and inspires a law that forbids men from playing women. Kynaston is therefore out of a job and blames his downfall on his former friend, but of course he eventually falls in love with her.  In short, it's a tale of sexual politics told to perfection. <br /> <br />I was initially skeptical about this film as I've never been a big fan of Claire Daines, and though I've always found Billy Crudup attractive, I've never thought of him as a great actor, especially one that could convincingly portray a man who in many ways identifies himself as a woman. However both shine in this film, and the chemestry between them is electrical. Their sex scene together--in which they substitute nudity with simply kissing and running their fingers over eachother--was one of the most beautiful and sensual sex scenes I've ever seen. It probably helped that they fell for eachother in real life over the course of this film, prompting Crudup to leave his wife, Mary Louise-Parker, while she was pregnant. <br /> <br />The supporting cast of this film is stellar, too. Rupert Everett is a riot as the King, and unkown Zoe Tapper makes an astonishing debut as his mistress. The excellent cast, paired with exquisite writing, made for an entirely enjoyable film. <br /> <br />I'm sure it must be hard to make a dramatic comedy that's as funny as it is dramatic, especially when it's a period piece as well, but Stage Beauty pulls it off with flair. Though on many occasions I felt totally emotionally invested in the characters, especially in the stirring conclusion to the film, at other times I was laughing out loud. This film is full of quotable lines and exchanges, such as when the King says, \\"Why shouldn't we have women on stage? After all, the French have been doing it for years,\\" and his advisor replies, \\"Whenever we're about to do something truly horrible, we always say that the French have been doing it for years.\\" <br /> <br />Whether you are a fan of period pieces or love Billy Crudup and Claire Daines, rent this film.  I sincerely hope it goes down in the books as one of the most under-rated films of 2004.  This one was way more Oscar-worthy than the pile of dung otherwise known as The Aviator.  If I keep telling myself \\"I have to buy this\\" as I'm watching it, you know it's gotta be good...well, that or I have a major DVD buying problem...or both.
B00001U0GQ|5.0|I'm a great reader.  I love reading.  I'm also a great movie watcher.  I am accustomed to the book always being better than the movie, but not this time.  To be honest, I don't really care for Cooper's book.  But oh, how I love Michael Mann's movie!  The cinematography in this film is excellent.  The casting is perfect.  The direction is brilliant.  I've seen this film several times, but I just watched my DVD copy last night and was struck once again with the beauty and power of this movie.  I am saddened when I think of all that we have lost.  How far we have gotten away from nature and our roots.  It is beautiful to see the nobility and sacrifice that plays out at the end of the film and Mann does it absolute justice.  This movie is so beautiful it hurts.  If you haven't seen it, watch it as soon as you can.  If you have seen it, watch it again.
0792165020|5.0|This is as good as films come and a wonderful period piece of 1950s Europe.  Directed and writen by Anthony Minghella, the director of The English Patient and Cold Mountain, Mr. Ripley involves the exploits of Tom Ripley, played to chilling perfection by Matt Damon, who initally travels from his native Manhattan to Venice to retrieve Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law), the spoiled son of a multi-millionaire.  Tom becomes enamored by Dickie's illustrious livestyle--and perhaps with Dickie as well--but when Dickie tires of Tom, Tom murders Dickie and passes himself off as the millionaire.<br /><br />What makes this movie so wonderful--besides the incredable writing, beautiful cinematography, homoerotic relationship between Matt Damon and Jude Law, and the occasional shots of the two star's backsides--is the stellar cast.  Matt Damon is dead on as Tom Ripley.  He is boyish, charming, and fragile yet sinister and capible of anything.  Sociopaths haven't been played this well since Anthony Perkins in Psycho.  What makes Damon's performance more fun is how you never know everything about the character.  Is he gay? Is he straight? Is he bi? Is he even aware of what he is doing? Does he feel remorse? You never know.  The whole character is an act and an illusion who fools both the other characters and the audience.<br /><br /> Jude Law also turns out a star-making performance as Dickie Greenleaf.  Jude's a charming man's man and a throwback to the leading men of the 50s and 60s, so he fits this role like a glove, and as we know now he can identify with the womanizing side of his character.  Nevertheless, Jude's charisma and charm make it easy to believe why Matt Damon's character would be so taken by him.<br /><br />The rest of the cast--led by Gweneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett, and Philip Seymour Hoffman--is amazing as well.  The Talented Mr. Ripley is a sexy, provocitive, superbly acted nail-biter.  Hitchcock would be proud to see a suspense film like this.
B000AYQLX6|4.0|Walls & Bridges is a terrific John Lennon album, and it sounds better than ever with this mix.  You will hear sounds you haven't heard since the original vinyl.  Shame they couldn't have recreated that album cover.  My one caveat, and it is major: they used the Yoko morphing into John picture from the original Sometime In New York City album label for the W&B CD label.  Wrong!  It bugs me, but the enhanced sound certainly makes up for it.  The Lennon interview is unnecessary.  Again, the sound is astounding!  You'll hear the difference.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|About a year ago, all of my friends started getting this album. I was a little bit shy about getting it, mainly because I don't usually get what's the \\"new fad\\". But my friends let me have a listen to a few songs, and I loved them! So I got the album. <br /> <br />The music is really creative and spunky, something new and unique. It's about time we have a band that actually makes catchy music that most people can enjoy. The lyrics are fun and amusing as well, and many of these songs can get stuck in my head for hours. <br /> <br />Not all of the album grabbed me however, a few songs I found a little weak, usually in the middle of the album (\\"Auf Auche\\" was nice, if you can handle the slow, minute-long piano beginning, and \\"Cheating On You\\" was... okay, but compared to the rest of the album...). My personal favorites include \\"Tell Her Tonight\\", \\"Michael\\", and \\"Come On Home\\". <br /> <br />I've also heard a few of their new songs from their second album. Personally I found those songs a lot better surprisingly, but no matter what, I think you'll like this album if you're a fan of indie music and punk pop. Enjoy!
B000089CJI|5.0|I like to buy cd's. It's a past time. The really challenge comes when you think you have everything you want, but still have the urge to find something else. Such Great Heights was stuck in my head for about two months straight, and I didn't know who it was buy. I found out and eventually decided to buy the Postal Service cd. Every now and then I guess wrong and buy a cd I expect to like and don't like it very much. This was one of those where my expectations were not only met, but exceeded. Of my hundreds of cd's, this is right up there with my favorites.
0446577383|5.0|As a thriller reader I can tell you that this was a fantastic and exciting story. I have read all of David Baldacci's books and this ranks as one of his best. I read for entertainment and quality writing. This has it all.

B000AP04FG|2.0|\\"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\\" is perhaps the worst movie I saw in 2005.  It's a clever concept, but it suffers from script problems, absurd action sequences, and gaping plot holes.  While Angelia Jolie and Brad Pitt work together well, their characters are empty ciphers.  They are so boring in the film that there doesn't seem to be much of a marriage worth saving, and you don't even really know how they could have stayed together long enough to figure out they were both contract killers.  Even then, why would their first instinct be to kill each other?  Who do they work for?  Is the same hit man agency employing them both?  That seems to be what's implied.  Wouldn't it be easier to tell them?  The idea of a Husband and Wife hit man team is infintiely better than what ended up on screen.  For that, we must balme the script, which relies entirely on it's own sense of cleverness to try and hold the floundering story together.  But the concept isn't enough.  Save for one car chase sequence, the movie never really captures any magic or true sense of fun.  It was designed to be fun, and that it is actually boring is what makes it even harder to stomach.  That Doug Liman, who so expertly crafted \\"The Bourne Identity\\" directed this thing is a tragedy.  The action set pieces are mostly generic, with the final store shoot out looking more like a video game montage.  The story movies from plot point to plot point without giving us any real reason to root for the Smiths, and by the time the entirely anticlamactic fianle shows up, I felt like I had been ripped off.  This movie isn't even fun on a dumb level.  It's just bad.  With no story and no real climax, \\"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\\" is a film best left in the discount bin at Blockbuster.  I would avoid it at all costs.
B000002KLP|5.0|Let's face it... Prince's albums up through Sign 'O the Times are brilliant. Dirty Mind in particular ranks as one of his very best (some would say his very best). Unlike many pop albums this is not merely a collection of songs, i.e. some radio hits and a bunch of filler. This album works organically as a whole, i.e. each track is integral to the album. Every track is excellent and the production and sound is very stripped back and \\"raw\\". This is pure pop/funk genius. Probably my favorite Prince album after Purple Rain and just above Controversy. Essential= Get it!
B000AP04FG|3.0|Brad Pitt is excellent in almost all of the movies he's in. Angelina Jolie is fun to watch in the Laura Croft films and several others, but Mr. & Mrs. Smith in my opinion is not a good movie for either of them. They need a good script and this movie doesn't have one. <br /> <br /> I won't go into the story itself because that's been covered already. I went into watching this movie with a totally open mind because I enjoy watching both stars do there thing. And I came away with sore ear drums and wishing I had watched something else of there's like Oceans 11 & 12, or Lora Croft & Gone In 60 Seconds. So here's the facts, good and bad on this movie. <br /> <br />First the bad. <br /> <br />The story is WEAK. How could two people live together for 5 maybe 6 years, make all this money, have guns hidden all over the house, and not know what each other does for a living. <br />Example...Double oven, bottom one is a storage locker for Angelina's gun collection. Then the entire basement in this house is the locker for Brad's gun, cannon, and rocket launcher collection. We must be living in a fog here. Believe me there's more unexplainable happenings here but I'll leave that alone. <br /> <br />It's REALLY not funny at all. Brad Pit was funnier in Oceans 11 & 12. And Angelina Jolies funniest things are her quick looks at Brad Pit. Other than that she really has nothing to say that's even close to comedy. <br /> <br /> The editing is horrible. Quick, Fast, Jump, Spin. Bad matches from shot to shot and don't look in the background. When they shot this movie nobody was careful enough to see what was going on there. That's the editing. <br /> <br /> How about DTS Sound. I love DTS Sound but this goes from very soft to VERY LOUD. So your always playing with the remote control volume. First UP to hear the words, then DOWN so you don't blow out your speakers or drive the neighbors nuts. <br /> <br />Here's the good. <br /> <br /> The big fancy house, the cars, the opening shot ofthe two of them in the shrinks office, and Angelinas quick looks at Brad. And of course Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. But even they can't pull this movie out of the dumper.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Slayer are without a doubt the greatest thrash metal band of all time and along with Iron Maiden and Metallica the greatest metal band of the 80's. Reign in Blood along with Metallica's Master of Puppets is the very pinnacle of thrash metal. This is a completely flawless album: the production, the riffs, the arrangments, everything works incredibly well. The tracks function as small parts of a whole and not as loosely connected songs. The album is very short (just under 30 minutes) with all of the ten songs as being under three minutes except for Angel of Death and Raining Blood. The brevity of the album is one of the things that make this album work so well, were it longer the subject matter would just seem too ridiculous but as it is the lyrics come off as very effective (Angel of Death in particular is quite horrific). This is an album I recommend to any fan of metal or anyone who is even remotely interested in metal. Mandatory Slayer!
0688170528|4.0|I loved Picoult's story telling ability.  I was instantly grabbed by the whole story and enjoyed the way she lets you get into everyone's mind both before and after Emily's death.  I thought that the end left too many loose ends and was really unbelievable after we all hear what happened from Chris' mouth.  <br />The end weakens the whole story.
B000AGTPUA|5.0|This movie is about the spirit of Christmas.  Being able to believe in something you can't see.  I have three girls 3, 6, 11.  And all three love this film.  So do my husband and I.  I am not sure that the three year old understands all the tender moments.  But she has asked to watch it again and again.  I would recommend this film to anyone it is definitly going to be a classic.
B000AGTPUA|5.0|(This is an updated version of an earlier review.) <br />       \\"The Polar Express\\" is a beguiling holiday-season fantasy, something that ought to be part of Christmas for decades to come. Adapted and expanded from a children's book by the gifted writer/illustrator Chris Van Allsburg, it combines the work of one of our best-loved actors with some innovative animation techniques, all under the command of celebrated director Robert Zemeckis. <br />       When Tom Hanks first read \\"The Polar Express\\" to his own children, he bought the screen rights- two decades ago. Using some great voices and an unusual method called \\"motion capture\\", he's a half-dozen different characters: the stentorian train conductor, the ghostly hobo, a stern Santa, a cackling Scrooge puppet, a quiet dad and (with some help from \\"Spy Kid\\" Daryl Sabara) the modest \\"Hero Boy\\", whisked out of his snowbound, heartland home for a wondrous train ride. <br />       This very Jewish writer doesn't necessarily believe in Christmas or Santa Claus, but \\"Polar Express\\" is enough to convert anyone. The journey includes some stunning, painter-like tableaux: a dramatic caribou crossing; a chilling ride over the polar ice cap; a roller-coaster passage down glaciers. All this leads to one of the most arresting animated sets you'll ever see: this North Pole is no Alpine chalet but a solid red-brick city of gigantic toy factories, resembling a cross between St. Peter's and an antique New England mill town. <br />        The other kids on the train: a good-natured \\"Hero Girl\\"; <br />a nerdy \\"Know-It-All Kid\\" and a withdrawn \\"Lonely Boy\\". Together, they not only bond on the ride north but in a runaway train car at the North Pole. They look like figures from a painting come to life. It all leads to the kind of classic holiday lesson that all can appreciate- inspiring without a hint of schmaltz. A humorous aside that I loved: the Grand Central- <br />style dispatch center, run by a crew of elf officers with wacky Brooklyn/Jersey Jewish accents right out of '50s-style New York TV sitcoms. <br />       The best extra shows how Hanks did his multi-role work; as \\"Conductor Tom\\", he wears a black unitard with what look like polka-dots on his face. These are tiny light sensors that transpose Tom's own movements and expressions into shadows for the animated character(s). We also meet Van Allsburg, a self-taught artist/sculptor with many other celebrated books- and movies (\\"Jumanji\\", \\"Zathura\\")- to his credit. Pop-opera balladeer Josh Groban and composer Alan Silvestri also appear; the latter, Zemeckis' musical collaborator ever since \\"Back To The Future\\", did both the soft, subtle score and several songs- including the bizarre, big band-ish \\"Hot Chocolate\\" number, done by Hanks and a chorus line of dancing waiters with huge cocoa vats. Even an array of holiday standards you've heard ten million times- Como, Crosby, and- classy!- Sinatra to back Santa's grand entrance- sound both quaint and brand new as the kids make their way through the North Pole toy factories. <br />       \\"Polar Express\\" is to the Christmas season what \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" is to musical fantasies of old. If you have a chance to see the IMAX edition next December, don't miss it. Meanwhile, you can enjoy the proverbial \\"Christmas in July\\"- or whenever- with this enchanting tale.  <br />         <br />
B000B7HZXM|1.0|I am a longtime fan of Rod Stewart but the Songbook series is simply awful. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE these songs. It is just that they are available by Sinatra, Tony Bennett and other great singers. These albums would have been fine if done by Frank Sinatra Jr. who has a history with the great American songbook. It isn't just the latest \\"thing\\" or \\"phase\\" with Frank Jr. Rod Stewart should go back to being Rod Stewart. This cd is the worst in the series and should come with an extra raspy warning. Rod is simply wrong for ALL of these classic songs. Buy Sinatra and Bennett and hear perfection.
B000BOH8XW|5.0|To whomever gave this album a one star (based on the video I might add...) Open your ears!!! To start with you obviously are not a Shakira fan... She does in fact play the guitar and she writes her own music... she doesn't hire someone to do it for her... Just one of many reasons to admire her as an artist. <br />SO to those who would like to purchase this CD... I highly recommend it... If you like the Shakira of Laundry Service past, you will love the CD... It is classic Shakira, a mix of many different sounds and ideas. She has been doing this from the start and I can only hope there is more to come.  <br />

6305736650|5.0|This is a 1942 movie that marks the high mark in the Bogart career of approximately 75 movies, many filmed at Warner Brothers in Hollywood. It received 3 Oscars, but Bogart did not get his own acting Oscar until African Queen about a decade later. Bogart made a name for himself in the 1930's as a gangster and in smaller supporting roles in Bette Davis movies. In 1941 he played Sam Spade in the Maltese Falcon. This became his breakout movie along with High Sierra. The Falcon movie was directed by his buddy John Huston. After the Maltese Falcon, he graduated to more complex parts including love stories, far removed from the early gangster roles. His next movie was the bittersweet love story Casablanca and the multiple Oscars.<br /><br />Casablanca has all the extras and special effects, and in its day it was a big budget movie made factory style, completely on the lot at Warners. Casablanca is a wonderful and fascinating story of an American living in Casablanca during World War II running a nightclub. He is visited by his old girlfriend, Elsa, now married and played by Ingrid Berman. They are still in love, but of course Elsa is married.<br /><br />Bogart appears in virtually every scene, and the movie is carried almost completely by Bogart. Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre are perfect for their supporting parts and they add a certain attraction and exotic flair, and depth and mystery to the movie. There is some continuity with the prior movie Maltese Falcon, where Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre had important roles in that movie as well. Here Greenstreet plays the black market travel document dealer Mr. Ferrari and Lorre is the document thief. After Bogart and Bergman, the French police chief Louis Renault played by Claude Rains is the dominant actor.<br /><br />The special effects, the fog, the music \\"As Time Goes By\\" played by Dooley Wilson are all beautifully done, and when Lazlo and his wife (Bergman) walk out to the plane through the night fog to escape to Lisbon and on to America with Rick's blessing (Bogart) one cannot help but shed a tear.<br /><br />Interestingly the writers did not like the movie, the writing was chaotic often being completed just a day before shooting - all piece work - and there are many technical errors such as a wine bottle with the top appearing and disappearing, and the rain suddenly vanishing from Bogart's rain coat. But it all comes together to make magic.<br /><br />Possibly the best movie ever made, and definitely in the top 10, and the best of the 1940s film noir era. Also, I recommend Double Indeminity, made a few years later, and another great film noir movie. This present Casablanca DVD has excellent extras.a with Rick's blessing (Bogart) one cannot help but shed a tear.

B000BOH8XW|5.0|I just finished hearing oral fixation vol. 2. I am so thankful for this material. All the songs display intelligence. Shakira sings/speaks in English, Hebrew, Arabic and French. I found that this cd tops \\"Laundry Service\\". This cd is well written and produced. I love all songs and I think that Shakira is a musical genius. It is my opinion that Shakira truly \\"sees\\" words in a different context than many. I highly recommend this cd to all.
0895260131|5.0|I first came across Mr. Spencer's website looking for information about Islam. There was so much conflicting information about Islam out there. Many of the concepts and terms covered in the PIG to Islam, were explained I feel truthfully and balanced. Yes, much of the information is disturbing and possibly opinated. The information is well researched and can be verified. Spencer mostly provides a primer in this book which will help clear up some of the confusion. It was a very helpful book. Of course, there are other books on the subject, but the information is very accessible and seems to be correct based on my limited knowledge of Islam and the movements within it.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|I bought the \\"beyonce look-alike\\" E of M album. I love the album and i'm happy for the success of the album. However, when should someone draw the line? I constantly hear that the album has sold 6 million copies worldwide and that Mariah is the \\"comeback of the year\\". I'm happy for Mariah and the success that has followed her this year. When I read that a re-release was set for November 15 I thought \\"gosh, why MUST you do this?\\" \\"what's the purpose?\\" Aside from all the obvious reasons like money, power and numbers. I know that the re-release has four new tracks and a DVD. Personally, every morning before work I watch t.v. and  see all the videos. I just feel that Mariah is throwing TOO MUCH at us at one time. Four singles in 7 months. That's too much. What about the future? It seems that Mariah's people see everything in \\"moment\\" and not the future. I understand Mariah is \\"hot\\" right now but don't \\"burn out\\" before you start.
B000BKJ78U|1.0|I got sick of waiting for Lucas to release the original trilogy on DVD a long time ago and I actually purchased a LaserDisc player and the so-called 'Original' Star Wars trilogy on laserdisc - only it's not the original Empire Strikes Back that I saw in the theater!!    THE MISSING SCENES FROM EMPIRE STRIKES BACK:  1 - The 'Bacta' scene with Luke in the tank and the medical droid was longer. Thre was a point where Luke was floating in the tank and you see this red goo/dye injected into the tank. Then they pull him out and Leia or 21B (the droid) says something like, 'The Bacta are growing well, the scars should be gone in a day or two...'    When I saw 'Empire' in the theater back in 1980 there was another scene I will never forget that I have NEVER seen since except on the earliest of (bootleg?)VHS copies.    2 - In the battle scene on Hoth in 'The Empire Strikes Back', right before General Veers is about to destroy the power generators, Hobby 'kamikazees' the walker with his snowspeeder. He lets out a blood curdling 'Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!!' on his way in. You see the snowspeeder coming in from General Veers perspective from inside the walker then you see the General - the expression on his face is priceless. The walker's head then explodes as the snowspeeder hits it. Another walker then destroys the power gens a little later. The power gen explosion is also different, it is a more pulled-back shot with full view of a nuclear mushroom cloud superimposed over what were the generators.    Also!  CUT SCENE/AUDIO #3  When the snowtroopers enter the base immediately following the battle, there are some scenes cut out of them rushing in to the command center and the audio has been changed to eliminate a PA announcement that says, 'Imperial troops have entered the base, Imperial troops have entered the base! (then Static as it is cut off presumably by the announcer being killed).    I give up.    It turns out that my local theater may have gotten a 'prescreener' version of thefilm!   I have purchased the 'Special Editions', the original laserdisc releases, and a bootleg DVD set from eBay and I STILL do not have the original trilogy unaltered. Now I am looking for a VHS with everything there...    Lucas, if you were trying to make me broke and insane - good job.
B000AOJ9X0|2.0|I know it's Buddy that is not enough to make it great. I bought this after reading the reviews and was kind of disappointed. It's not bad, just a lot of weak songs, very toned down and very few good guitar solos, just very slow and not the old smoking Buddy. Like always this is just my thoughts, and I am sure this one is not for everybody. Some will pick this review apart, but I am a huge Buddy Guy fan. I have over 30 cd's by him. I just find this one to be weak after listening to his others. Do yourself a favor listen before you buy.
B000BB1MI2|4.0|I'm not a Tim Burton fan but I am a fan to this story. As a child I both read and watched the movie versions although I only had a vague recollection of them going into this film. An excellent group of actors both adult and child wise. The set was colourful and very techno for the time period and the ompaas were hilarious although they might be scary for small children. Depp was an eccentric and somewhat egocentric Wonka but delightful to just look at. Other than Charlie the kids were perfectly deplorable and you can't wait to see what will happen to the next rotten child (no one is killed). I found it entertaining and would watch it again.

6304884419|5.0|This film is a great Mafia related movie that belongs in any Cosa Nostra collection.  Even with the boring love story hidden in the script, the overall acting by De Niro and Chazz P. is awesome.  Gives a real great feel for life in the Bronx during the late 50's early 60's, and also has an astounding soundtrack.  The movie is violent but in a good way, without any blood and guts.  A great organized crime feel.  The only disappointment is that you never find out what Mafia family Chazz P.'s character, Sonny, belonged to.  Plus you get a cameo of Joe Pesci.

I see alot of people here say its good and they remember playing it when they weere kids. So I have a question? What is a arcade? My uncle said thats where they used to get cigarrettes when they were not old enuff to smoke! And also my girlfriend step-mom said that the lead singer is the first rockstar clone? She was smiled when she says it, but what does that mean? I really like the slow songs better, like the very last one is good. But some of it is just too cheezy.
0671027344|5.0|Fourteen-year-old Charlie is introverted and cries easily. He describes in detail his freshman year of high school through letters to an unknown person. Charlie's best friend in junior high committed suicide leaving him feeling alone and depressed. His English teacher mentors him and encourages Charlie to put aside his social anxiety and \\"participate\\". At a football game he approaches seniors Sam and Patrick and the two siblings welcome Charlie into their group of friends. Sam and Patrick introduce him to smoking, parties, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, and his first girlfriend. Despite his newfound social life, Charlie is a vulnerable and unstable teen, struggling with the death of his aunt because he feels responsible. Throughout the year he suffers from bouts of depression and experiments with alcohol, drugs, and his sexuality. The novel's conclusion reveals the source of Charlie's sensitivity and depression. Ultimately, Charlie learns to be more assertive and not to waste his high school years by observing life from the sidelines.<br /><br />The Perks of Being a Wallflower contains a number of mature subjects including drug use, homosexuality, suicide, masturbation, date rape, abortion, physical abuse, sexual abuse, and mental instability. Although the novel covers a lot of ground, the problems are not overwhelming as in a Chris Crutcher novel. The characters and situations are portrayed in a realistic manner that will engage teen readers. However, the novel is provocative and parents may be displeased by the depiction of adolescent sex and drug use. This coming-of-age story is easy to read and has plenty of cultural references that will satisfy reluctant readers.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|I feel no need to write a long drawn out review here.  Pure and simple this is one of Enya's best albums.  I have been a dedicated fan since Watermark came out many many years ago and this CD is just incredible, the best I think since Watermark.  You must buy this!
1572814349|5.0|While I cannot call myself an experienced Tarot card reader (yet) i did purchase about 10 Tarot cards sets. <br />I feel that there is an emotional response I have with all my Tarot cards. I click on not with them. <br />This set here is one of the best! Out of the 10-12 sets I have, my favorite is this and the Gilded Tarot.  <br />The pictures are just beautiful, expressive, intuitive. You can look at the cards and tell a story. <br />You will not regret if you buy this deck. I highly recommend this and the Gilded Tarot.  <br />I also have some of the Dragon Tarot, Angel Tarot and the dark Crow Tarot.  <br />My least favorite is the Celestial Tarot.  I have spent time taking a card (like the 5 of cups for example) from all the sets and  <br />compare the cards - learn to understand the little symbols, colors or the intuitive sense I get from the same card from all the sets I have. The Gilded and Golden are easy to read, easy to respond to. If you want beautiful, intuitive, good and easy to read Tarot then this (and the Gilded ) are what you're looking for.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|With a release date for the DVD of 20 December, prospective viewers would be well-advised to catch the ill-fated TV series 'Firefly' from which the movie 'Serenity' springs (with all original cast in place from the show which was prematurely cancelled by clueless studio execs). You don't need to be conversant with the TV-series (available as a bargain 4-DVD set) to enjoy this film, but it will immeasurably deepen your appreciation. I saw the film, bought the 14-hour series, and saw the film again. But it's still not enough - the future world of 'Serenity' is that good. <br /> <br />'Serenity' is something entirely different from formulaic CGI-fests that dominated 2005. It's an impressive sci-fi action story that has the sort of character hooks that makes you feel you know the protagonists and want to live in their tramp spaceship with them. There's not a cardboard cut-out in sight: both heroes and villains have more dimensions than a folded superstring.   <br /> <br />'Serenity' (and the 'Firefly' precursor) were made by Joss Whedon, the brilliant writer/producer who created 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' for TV. In 'Serenity', Whedon shows how mature he has become - this is writing entirely for grown-ups, whether in the delightfully mordant humour or the breathtaking action sequences. Whedon's masterstroke was in imagining the future 500 years hence, as humans colonize newly terraformed planets, as resembling the frontier of the Old West, a world where shanty towns and seedy space ports long precede the glittering megalopolis and where the arm of the law is short. <br /> <br />If the Firely-class ship Serenity is the new Millenium Falcon, then captain Mal Reynolds is Han Solo with a brain, and a troubled back-story as a fighter on the losing side of a war of independence against the governing Alliance. But this is no off-the-shelf Evil Empire, just an overbearing bureaucracy - nine tenths of the human population happily chooses to live under its auspices, after all. Soevil, as it appears in the shape of 'The Operative', takes the form of a fanatical believer in the State as guarantor of human happiness. Lethal assassin or no, The Operative is scary because of the intensity of his belief, rather than just the sharpness of his blade. <br /> <br />The object of The Operative's hunt is River Tam, the damaged 17 year-old waif with telepathic powers who has been rescued from dire military experiments on psychically gifted children. She and her priggish brother are fugitives from the Alliance, who have taken ship with Mal Reynolds and his crew of hard hitting, wisecracking smugglers and heist artists. River has secrets in her scrambled brain that the Alliance can't allow her to retrieve and so the pursuit across space begins. Mal and the crew of Serenity have to try to evade the Alliance traps until they have time to figure out what the girl knows.  <br /> <br />The final revelations are utterly worthy of the suspense that builds through the film - a conspiracy of terrifying scope. The crescendo of risk and violence is also of that satisfying sort where characters have to make ever greater sacrifices to do the right thing, a real heroism that is the antithesis of the glib heroics of a Han Solo.  <br />But it's almost what is left out that makes Whedon's imagined future that much more plausible. No 'aliens with bumpy foreheads', no noise in the vacuum of space, no wire fighting, no CGI that doesn't advance the plot. Serenity will be an instant 'cult classic' but it deserves a far broader audience. See this film for its screen craft and its respect for the viewers' intelligence: it might be subtitled `for evil to triumph it is only necessary for good men to do nothing'. This is a movie from a director who knows that life and love are bitter sweet, now or 500 hundred years in the future.

B0001L3LUE|5.0|Erol Morris is one of the best documentary filmmakers to ever have lived and his masterpiece, \\"Fog of War\\" is one of the best Documentaries ever.<br /><br />You have to see this film...Don't miss it. You will learn more about American history during the baby boom generation than any PBS mini series can ever teach you.<br /><br />The central character, Robert McNamara, was considered, \\"THE BEST OF THE BEST\\", by John F. Kennedy and was appointed to Secretary of State in the 1960's.<br /><br />We see McNamara as a troubled and complex man despite his high IQ and Harvard education. McNamara was a genius, a briiliant man who invented the seat belt in cars, and countless other innovations. His inventions to this day are used in companies around the world. He had more ideas than Thomas Edison.<br /><br />But, his legacy was the Viet Nam War and he shows no remorse or guilt about his involvement in getting us to war. According to him it was the right thing to do and he did not make any mistakes in judgement at all...now that is an interesting and compelling man!<br /><br />After you see this, you can't help, but admire and respect him. He had his convictions and never wavered on any of of them.  The man stood his ground on every belief he had.  At the end the film, the director, Morris,  lets you judge and decide, without any subjectivity, if McNamara was a moral straight arrow or an immoral loose cannon.
B00005JO1G|2.0|For one thing, I don't like to see a war movie without the war!  Next, after 21 years in the military with several male-bonding opportunities, including forty years as an avid athlete showering with teammates, I NEVER had a homo-erotic thought!  The less-than-one-percent of our population that sways that way obviously includes the author, Swofford.  I also figure the buddies in his unit are a might uncomfortable reading his book.  Otherwise, the movie was well-acted and well-done.

It looks like maybe she's supposed to have some dragon tail or something... funny stuff.    She really needs to redo that cover.

B000BCKFWK|2.0|I already know that most people are not going to like this review because it's considered hip and cool to like this film, but it's all visual flair and style, with little substance, depth or reason to care for the characters. And, unfortunately, it's about 40 percent too long. If whittled down to just two chapters, it would have been great popcorn entertainment, a heck of a violent ride from beginning to end. <br />On a side note, just because people express negative opinions about a post, that doesn't mean the opinion isn't valid, rather, it can often mean that the people disliking an honest critique of a movie are simpletons far too easily amused. <br />But back to the movie, the chapters with Mickey O'Rourke and Bruce Willis are great. But the one with Clive Owen goes on far too long, with too many pseudo endings. And the opening and closing act suffers because Josh Hartnett comes off as the clothing model that he was -- all surface, no depth. He's more wooden than Hayden Christensen's performance as Mannequin Anakin Skywalker in the Star Wars prequels.  <br />An interesting study in how to make a movie look and feel like a comic book come to life, but some emotional depth and resonance would have given these chapters some depth, and make us care for what happens to the characters. But as it is, it's just cheap laughs and a big-budget exercise in style over substance. Sure, your friends might think you hip and cool for going along with the crowd and singing the praises of Sin City, but honesty will make you more original and an independent thinker, free of the simplistic views of most of your peers. <br />Yes, the simplistic kind of thinking (or non-thinking) that will have people saying my review, and others that are critical of this movie, are bad ones.
B000AP04FG|4.0|Some 60 years after Hitchcock made the marriage troubled screwball comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith in 1941 with Carole Lombard in the female lead and Robert Montgomery opposite her the film has received an action-packed makeover.  This remake casts Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt as Jane and John Smith.  The film certainly gives the audience a fireworks spectacle comparable to many Schwarzenegger and Stallone films from the 1980s and early 1990s.  It even has a touch of James Bond and Mission Impossible with its secret compartments and its cool approach to the hush-hush missions.  However, the remake still possesses some of the same screwball humor, as the new Smiths struggle with their marriage.<br /><br />There are both similarities and differences in both the original and the remake.  The original opens in a messy hotel room to which the arguing couple has withdrawn to deal with their relationship issues while the 2005 version delivers a more contemporary solution through a visit to a marriage counselor.  Hitchcock applies a detailed mise-en-scene and terrific performances by the cast to accentuate the character's lives while Jane and John offer information on their relationship through brief verbal testimonials.  However, the most obvious difference is the subtlety of threats in Hitchcock's film while director Doug Liman is much rougher (maybe a clear underestimation) in his depiction of a marriage in trouble.<br /><br />It is in the presentation where the remake highlights the differences with the original film, as both Jane and John live secret double lives.  They are professional killers that serve the highest bidder.  Successfully, they have hidden their secrets from each other for the last five-six years (they do not seem to be able agree on how long they have been married.)  This is also the second time that the theme of a couple having secret double lives emerge, which it also done in James Cameron's 1994 box office hit True Lies.  However, the difference here is that both are secret killers.<br /><br />Jane and John are constantly watching over their shoulder in order to maintain the normal front of marriage.  Often they come close to uncovering one another, but never do. It did not start this way between them, as they once were happily in love.  Over time, their never-ending series of intricate lies and deceits has begun to wear on them.  The weariness has worn out their lustful desire and loving appetite for each other's lips and created an indifference.  Despite their apathy, they both try to maintain the illusion of happiness by doing the things married people do such as eating supper together and going to dinner parties.  The apathy also forges a strong silence between them, which never seems to be broken through any kind of quarrel.  Still, these emotions must surface in order for the relationship to continue, as Hitchcock so well portrayed through his 1941 version.<br /><br />The truth is about to come out when they both take on a job of assassinating the same person.  The question only is how it will affect their relationship, as they both carry years of repressed resentment.  It is a strong bitterness that will affect their reaction to the truth of their identities and fake foundation of their marriage.  Also, they realize that they are competitors living together, and the awareness of one another might just have lethal consequences and bring a love quarrel to another level disguised in blades and bullets.<br /><br />Married couples always encounter some moments in their lives when their relationship might seem weakened.  Some successfully survive the rough spots while others seek divorce.  Jane and John will propel the thought of splitting up into an entertaining action film that will have the audience laugh and rock in their seats, as the characters of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie seek the ultimate ending of a relationship.  In addition, Liman has previously made the witty Swingers (1996), exciting Go (1999), and the suspenseful Bourne Identity (2002) and shows in Mr. & Mrs. Smith his eye for thoughtful and quick action, which displays much promise for future films.  Unfortunately even though the film is amusing and has some flashy action sequences that will draw attention, it never reaches the innovative quality of Hitchcock.99), and the suspenseful Bourne Identity (2002) and shows in Mr. & Mrs. Smith his eye for thoughtful and quick action, which displays much promise for future films.  Unfortunately even though the film is amusing and has some flashy action sequences that will draw attention, it never reaches the innovative quality of Hitchcock.
8799701650|4.0|The Natural Approach has a lot to say for it. But it makes a fatal assumption: adults learn the same way as children.    Fact: Adults already have a lifetime of experiences children do not have.    Fact: Anybody learning a second or third language as an adult will initially associate the new language with those languages already known.    When I used this method in a university class, the first thing all of the students did was to go out to the bookstores and buy grammar texts and a Latin-English dictionary.    This is not a textbook that makes a good primary text. However, this book would be an excellent second book for a Latin language class.    Additional information on December 13, 2014:  I am now relatively fluent in Mandarin, which I didn't start to study until I was 29. If I had put the amount of work into learning Latin as I have put into Mandarin, I'd have a PhD in the language and be a university professor at this point. Instead, I'm going for an MA in Education with a TESOL focus. I'm teaching English in China.     I found that the most effective way to teach English is only speak English in the classroom, no matter what level the students are at. What matters is the approach. The Natural Approach is great, when properly applied. I personally use the Total Physical Approach, another naturalistic approach to language learning, for beginning language learning. Latin could use TPR as well, but many things that exist in today's environment do not have Latin names. Most people study Latin, not for the ability to use it in contemporary society, but to use it for its academic and historical value. Yet TPR could help students learn the basic grammar forms in a very dynamic fashion.     Lingua Latina is an outstanding text, but one I think is best supplemented with other approaches.
0307276902|5.0|James Frey is a rebel.  With his quirky style of writing, which took me some time to get used to, he is also a rare-breed in the area of recovery - shucking the 12steps for his own method - sheer determination.  As I read his account of this particular stage of his life, I couldn't help but feel a connection to this addict...there's a bit of him in me - the fury, the fear, the need to do it \\"my way.\\" I'm not a drug addict, but I can relate to the food and caffeine addict in him while reading this book.  It was therapeutic to read another's hell while you are facing your own and to know there is light at the end of the tunnel, even for someone as far-gone as James seemed to be at the start of the story.  Extremely vivid descriptions of situations I cannot imagine experiencing - the teeth, the toe...just wait and see... Looking forward to reading what happens next.<br /><br />**And to those who haven't read this yet, DO NOT look at the last page of the book - you might glimpse his accounts at the end and you do NOT want to ruin it...
B00006EXL5|5.0|First of all, I'm looking at the people who commented before me and some are kids under 13. Most say they like \\"Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge\\" better, and that's probably only because MTV played \\"Helena\\", \\"I'm Not Okay (I Promise)\\" and \\"Ghost of You\\".<br /><br />This album is much less poppy, and has barely any songs with choruses. The songs on \\"Bullets\\" are much more poetic, hardcore, disturbing, and beautiful than \\"Revenge\\".<br /><br />To me, the songs on \\"Bullets\\" take more than a few listenings to understand. Each have catchy riffs and stuff in them, but in some songs, the beautiful lyrics are masked by catchy beats, that most preteens will overlook.<br /><br />\\"Bullets\\" is based on many morose subjects, like suicide, death, alcohol, pill, and drug abuse, and the occult. It takes more than a preteen to appreciate the beauty of this album, so I reccomend if you are looking for a pop-punk album with a more mainstream sound, try \\"Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge\\", but if you really enjoy hardcore emo mixed with goth rock, \\"I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love\\" is more for you.

Rather, it is Dickens who critiques us with this masterwork.<br /><br />A Christmas Carol has burrowed into the very heart of our Western Culture to where few people would be confused if you referred to someone as a \\"Scrooge,\\" that is to say a skinflint, miser.<br /><br />Aside from presenting us with some of the most memorable images in literature as Scrooge is taken by the Ghosts of the Past, Present and Future to review his life and probable ending, we are brought along with his and given opportunity to review those elements in our own lives.<br /><br />A Christmas Carol was not just a nice story of the Christmas Season to give warmth and cheer.<br /><br />Far from it!<br /><br />Dickens had an agenda. Just as in his other famous works, like Oliver Twist and David Copperfield, Dickens longed to make a social statement to draw attention to the poor in England, their plight and hardship. A Christmas Carol is about Scrooge as a person, but also as representing a class of the wealthy whose abundance is wrested from the large working poor such as Cratchett and his family. THEY are the point. THEY are the ones Dickens sought to draw to public attention.<br /><br />Heaven help us is we simply see this book as nostalgia and fail to see the point Dickens had to make then and which still applies today!
B00025ETIW|5.0|I bought \\"Revenge\\" a few weeks before I was to see MCR in concert. I was familiar with \\"Helena\\", and \\"I'm Not Okay\\", but I was eager to hear what else MCR had to offer ( I LOVED their first album, so I knew this one would be great too). So I popped the CD in my computer to listen to it and I haven't taken it out yet. It is amazing. The songs are by far more poppy than the songs on \\"I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love\\", but they are probably more catchy and appealing to those who like screamo but not hardcore stuff.<br /><br />Each song on this album is very unique and wonderful. Each song has its own theme, too, which makes listening to the entire album through enjoyable. The poppy beats to the songs make it easy listening, but if you really listen to the lyrics they all deal with pretty heavy -sometimes taboo- subjects...like death, suicide, murder, loss, sex with men, and prison sex. Gerard Way combines these beautiful elements and topics with poetic words, catchy rhymes, mournful/angry/beautiful/ gentle vocals, and Frank, Bob, Ray, and Mikey supply the awesome musical parts.<br /><br />I loved this album and if you like screamo/pop-punk with a darker tone than most pop-punk out there, then be prepared to feel the romance.

B000BP86OG|5.0|Great! It's like when KISS made Destroyer. Critics and fans<br /><br />didn't appreciate it. This is a great effort and shows these<br /><br />guys are no one hit wonders. Slick production and keyboards<br /><br />and backing vocals make this a classic rock album. The Thin<br /><br />Lizzy celtic \\"hazel eyes\\" is my favorite. \\"Dinner Lady Arms\\"<br /><br />sounds like a rocking Raspberries song. The title track and<br /><br />\\"Is it just me?\\" are good rockers like the first album. It's<br /><br />like Queen meets AC/DC. It's got everything a true fan of rock<br /><br />n' roll would love. Give it a chance. These guys are for real<br /><br />and I hope stay around a long time. Rock n Roll needs them!!!!
B000AJJNPY|4.0|This is a great cd to listen to.  But it makes me really sleepy.  So I wouldn't suggest listening to it in the car.<br /><br />By the way, you can get a lot of free songs from this band on their website.  If you're not sure if you will like it that might be a good place to start.  There is an excellent song with a bunch of fiddles, for example.  I filled up two cd's with music from them on their site.<br /><br />I think that you will still end up purchasing this cd.  It is an excellent one to start with.  This band has been around for about five years, and I think that they have really hit their stride with this one.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|Here's what you all should do. First off, run out and buy this album. And right before you put the cd in ur cd player take all comparisons out of your head... And take it for what it is. It's john mayer's attempt at the blues. He's playing what he likes, which means his heart and soul is into it. If you can't see that and appreciate it, you're right for not liking it. Blues isn't about playing sick guitar phrases and riffs, it's about putting every ounce of your heart into the music, your personality and your soul. That's exactly what john did. and he did it well. John is an incredible artist, with tremendous talent. Any john mayer fan will see that and love this cd. it probably won't appeal to the casual fan, but then again...that's not really who it's for.
B0009S4IHY|4.0|This movie has nearly everything that an action fan might like:  Action, things getting destroyed, guns, knives, kung fu, dancing gangsters... wait!  Dancing gangsters?!!  Yeah, this movie has them.  In fact this flick is just about the craziest thing that I have seen in a long time.  Not much of a plot, but an excellent movie in all other respects.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, this movie (according to the extra stuff on the DVD) used all Chinese music.  I would have to say that the music is great in it.  Especially the opening credits and the dance sequence.<br /><br />Also, I ended up with the subtitle version of this movie.  I didn't know that there was an English dubbed version.  However, in thinking about it now, I prefer the version I got.  The acting is excellent, and I wonder if some of that might have gotten lost in the dubbed version.  I didn't mind reading the subtitles, and you can still hear the voices of the original actors.<br /><br />Finally, my wife also liked this movie.  She liked it, I think, because of the lady landlord (who kicks it pretty nicely).  She also liked the silly humor (which really brought back memories of old Warner Brothers cartoons).  There is also a tiny bit of romance.
B000BISBDY|5.0|When Johnny Cash sang a song, you listened. His deep, commanding voice & presence, his brilliant ability to tell stories, his heartfelt songwriting and skillful fingerpicking on the guitar....you didn't mess with The Man In Black. It's no wonder that he has influenced so many songwriters & musicians straight across the music board, and not just country music, but also rock and folk. Johnny Cash was a true original, and we'll never see another one like him. If you only buy one Johnny Cash CD, then \\"The Legend Of Johnny Cash\\" is the perfect choice---a single shot of 21 of Cash's greatest tracks spanning his entire career from 1955 to 2003, and all sequenced in chronological order, starting with Cash's earliest single \\"Cry Cry Cry,\\" and ending with his gorgeous, instant-classic rendering of Nine Inch Nails' song about addiction, \\"Hurt.\\" In between, you get other signature Cash favorites like \\"Folsom Prison Blues,\\" \\"I Walk The Line,\\" \\"Ring Of Fire,\\" and Cash's duet with his beloved wife June Carter, \\"Jackson.\\" There's also his huge hit novelty song, \\"A Boy Named Sue\\" (recorded live at San Quentin Prison), and later Cash material like his song with U2, \\"The Wanderer,\\" his memorable tale, \\"Delia's Gone,\\" and there's even a great, full-throttle rock song for Johnny with his terrific cover of Soundgarden's \\"Rusty Cage.\\" Needless to say, Johnny Cash's entire catalog is well worth buying, and the man certainly left us a whole wealth of wonderful music and then some. But this CD, \\"The Legend Of Johnny Cash,\\" is an outstanding disc to start with.
B0001GL3K4|5.0|After a series of slapstick Christmas comedies over the past several years, LOVE ACTUALLY may be the ideal modern Christmas story.  The reality of love may not be any more tangible than the meaning of Christmas, but the various incarnations of love that are portrayed perfectly in Richard Curtis' star-studded film, are heartwarming yet grittily sophisticated enough to leave the viewer without visions of sugarplum affairs. While this movie could be watched at any time of year, for me it will become a perennial Yuletide event along with Miracle on 34th Street, It's a Wonderful Life, White Christmas and, A Christmas Carol.<br /><br />The theme that runs throughout the story is communication, or the lack thereof.  The secret admirer uses cue cards, and another learns to speak a Portuguese.  There are chalkboard notes, drum sets, and hopes of second chances.  There is body language and silence, plus loads of misunderstandings communicated by people who need people.<br /><br />Sure LOVE ACTUALLY contains mature themes and perhaps deserves an \\"R\\" rating, but then love actually does.  And for how long now have adults been waiting for a Christmas story intended solely for adults?  Not wishing to take anything away from the traditional holiday films, I welcome a film with the complexity to match the season.<br /><br />Whether you believe in love or not, this movie reminds us that there are people who do.
B00005QAPH|4.0|This review is for the 2001 Criterion DVD.    The movie '8-1/2' is allegedly an \\"artistic\\" autobiography of Federico Fellini's life as a director.  The essence of the film is that a director named Guido (Marcello Mastroianni) has started making a movie but has lost his creative energy.  As a means of finding inspiration, Guido goes to an Italian health spa but is still tormented by his producer, auditioning actors and even an intellectual critic who all put great demands on Guido's time, energy and thought.  Guido escapes his peers by having an affair with a trashy mistress in another part of town but is later joined by his embittered wife a few days afterward.    The movie has plenty of abstract allegories, childhood flashbacks, present day issues and even some very restrained sexual fantasies about women.  The movie reveals that Guido is torn in so many directions.  When he has an affair, he is immediately conflicted as a Roman Catholic, as a husband, and as a son of morally upstanding parents.  We also see where his infidelity has damaged his marriage - perhaps beyond repair.  Finally, he also finds that the perfect woman doesn't turn out of be perfect after all.  Eventually the film becomes a movie within a movie.  He wants to make an honest film but is so saturated in the conflict and tormoil of life.  Guido finally liberates himself when he realizes that the beautiful confusion of life is what needs to be celebrated on film.    The movie at times is difficult to follow - especially since much of the abstract artistry is so ambiguous.  But I found the characters very engrossing and early 1960's Italy a fascinating and fashionable setting.  The most of the women in this movie are very beautiful and alluring while the rest had immeasurable entertainment value.  The men are typically very animated and complex.  I was never bored with any of the scenes, but as an art film, I can't say that I was inspired or moved by this picture.  I thoroughly enjoy the energy  ofthe Italian culture and this film certainly revealed much of it.  The B&W cinematography was top-notch and the music has typically festive and quite enjoyable.  This is a movie that is clearly not for everyone and I'll be the first to admit that on an artistic level I think it's just OK for me.  But at the same time, I think this is a movie everyone needs to experience just once to have some appreciation and understanding for Italian neo-realism films.  I've watched this movie now five times and I still get new insights with each viewing.  The commentary is somewhat helpful but at times does not fully explain Fellini's true intent of some of the artistic episodes.  Perhaps, that's the way he intended it - to mean what you want it to mean.    The DVD is a stunning B&W widescreen transfer and the sound is excellent.  There are plenty of extras in this double DVD package.  As usual, Criterion did a superb job.      Movie: B+    DVD Quality: A
0740748475|5.0|We have a Hobbes (stuffed tiger) in our house. I constantly refer to the wisdom of Calvin and Hobbes.

B000006SGT|4.0|The reason I chose this compilation above others was the inclusion of,'The Story of Bo Didley.' I thrilled to this mesmerizing slice of rock revisionism when it first hit the airwaves. I can't recall clearly, but I think,'The House of The Rising Sun,' was already out there, and what a pounding chunk of R & B that was. It alerted me to Dylan, and retrospectively to Leadbelly. But neither of them surpassed Eric Burdon and Alan Price's take. The Bo Didley story just romped on and on, flashing light on Bo's humble beginnings(I didn't even know who he was), Dylan, payola, The Stones & the Mersey beat. And of course, when Bo visits England with Jerome Green and his gorgeous sister,'The Dutchess' Burden twists on a feigned Southern accent to declaim his own emulations of the Blues, telling us that according to Bo, their music was, 'the biggest load of rubbish I ever heard, in my life'. But not in my life. Bo and the black bretheren came after Eric in my life. So thanks, Animals. I look at Pricey stumbling around the keyboard in Pennebaker's film,'Don't Look Back', and can't believe this innocent' was capable of those deep organ notes that set a new agenda for Rock music, paving the way for the ethereal sounds of Garth Hudson, I suggest. We'd have to wait on Don McLean's nostalgic,'American Pie' for an equivalent and qualitative summary of Rock's progress. And it packed nothing like the impact on the membranes as this Animalism!
0385483821|5.0|Intel was one of the pioneers of Silicon Valley, one of a handful of household brand name companies that helped to create, and constantly reshape, the information technology landscape in the US, and the rest of the high-tech world.  Andrew Grove was at the center of this company from its inception, and this is his story in his own words.<br /><br />The information-economy industry, unlike the giant manufacturers such as GM that faced more stable markets, was singularly brutal and fast-changing. Roughly every eighteen months, newly minted microprocessor chips arrived with double the circuit density of the preceding generation, increasing both their capacity and speed. For decades, Intel had been an exemplar of success, assessed in 1998 as the third most valuable company in the world by market capitalization. Known for their loyalty and hard work, virtually all Intel employees shared in the ownership of the company via stock options.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the company's success was constantly portrayed internally as tenuous and hard-won: in the mid-1980s, facing ferocious Japanese competition in the memory chip market segment, Intel re-engineered itself, focusing instead on the emerging microprocessor market segment.  This is the core of Grove's book, and is a remarkable achievement - I vividly still recall how, in the late 1980s, we thought Japan was going to take over the PC industry - and it was Grove and his team that did it.<br /><br />To do so, Grove engineered Intel's corporate culture so that it melded \\"control-freak management\\" with creative chaos:  anyone could compete in an open, yet authoritarian \\"culture of innovation.\\"  As a symbol of this, Intel Chairman Grove continued to work in a cubicle alongside everyone else, but he reveled in challenging employees down to the smallest detail, which included the correction of grammar in the memos sent to him. To promote equality of access as well as economies of scale, Intel's offices and chip-manufacturing facilities (\\"fabs\\" in the industry jargon) were virtually indistinguishable world-wide; all the walls were one color, cubicles identical in size, even the same vocabulary permeated company meetings from Taiwan to the U.S. This \\"copy exact\\" uniformity provided security for customers and helped in problem solving; should the defect rate appear high at one facility, it allowed the engineers to call any of the other facilities for advice; in effect, they could discuss identical processes with great precision, which was a key to the quality and reliability of Intel chips.  Another aspect of the company's culture was its \\"paranoia,\\" that is, its obsessive attention to the demands of the market and to the actions of competitors.<br /><br />If this sounds like a tough place to work, it certainly was.  I interviewed several employees there, who emphasized the \\"sink or swim\\" nature of the place:  you either found a way to create value, or soon you were out.  One of them described it like his stint in the Green Berets, when they are \\"plunked down in the middle of the chaos of war...You have an overall strategic goal...with near-complete freedom to find whatever works best to push towards that goal.  It's like we accept the rules of the game and the parameters within which we communicate and compete. But inside the circle, virtually anything goes.\\" It was a competitive meritocracy per excellence.<br /><br />Not only can this culture (paranoid, chaotic yet authoritarian, and ultra-competitive) serve as a paradigm - I know, that word is over-used - for other industries, but it is a key to the astounding creativitiy that has emerged in some American companies since the days of the \\"Japanese challenge\\".  And Grove's company not only symbolized many of these innovations but drove them.<br /><br />Warmly recommended as a must for all students of business.ing facilities (\\"fabs\\" in the industry jargon) were virtually indistinguishable world-wide; all the walls were one color, cubicles identical in size, even the same vocabulary permeated company meetings from Taiwan to the U.S. This \\"copy exact\\" uniformity provided security for customers and helped in problem solving; should the defect rate appear high at one facility, it allowed the engineers to call any of the other facilities for advice; in effect, they could discuss identical processes with great precision, which was a key to the quality and reliability of Intel chips.

B000002NJS|4.0|Madonna proved she could keep up with the times with \\"Ray of Light,\\" starting yet another dimension in her already multi-faceted career.<br /><br />She used the birth of her daughter to start a fresh chapter with her music and the end result was a cutting-edge album that brought electronica to the masses.<br /><br />One of the reasons why my interest in Madonna never faded is because, despite her fame and wealth, she continues to write songs that everyday people can identify with.  One song on here, \\"Frozen,\\" came out at a real down point in my life and it really helped me to realize that I wasn't alone in dealing with certain situations.<br /><br />Even though I enjoy \\"Music\\" more than \\"Ray of Light,\\" I loved this album when it was released and I still do today as it was, and is, a refreshing break from the endless stream of people masquerading as musicians who look and sound the same.
B000ATQYT2|1.0|Update after calling Disney's consumer number:  They of course really aren't there to give out any real information, but here is what I was told:  The upcoming BluRay will be \\"The Original Theatrical Version\\" in 1.85.  That's all she knew.  Not even any mention of the other version in pan/scan.  Cancelling my pre-order now, as I already have most of what's on the Blu on the two previous DVDs.  I just can't imagine what they are thinking, given the fact that practically everywhere this title is discussed, that song is the number one issue with fans all over the world.<br /><br />Update after Disney issued a press release stating the feature was \\"approximately 89 minutes\\"  They were wrong.  Another online merchant has begun shipping this title and it has been discovered the Blu Ray contains only the cut version.  Hence the flood of cancelled orders and angry fan response.  I have no reason to buy this version.  I have the first two DVDs with both versions of the film and all the previous supplements.  I won't reward Disney for ignoring its customers.<br /><br />Review of the last DVD version follows:<br />While the menus for this disc are almost identical to the previous DVD release, this version is missing the entire Fireside Chat with Brian Henson - a nice behind the scenes look at the making of the film with interviews of Michael Cane and nice bits from the production.  Those and some cute banter between Brian,  Gonzo and Rizzo made this feature fun to watch more than once.  Why leave it out??<br /><br />The Pepe Profiles Gonzo thing has nothing to do with this film and was a very poor choice to replace the behind the scenes featurette.  Only diehard fans could sit through this thing once.<br /><br />And yes there is NO good reason for Disney Home Video not to include the entire movie in the widescreen version.  Except maybe that they didn't want to bother to remaster from the original elements.<br /><br />Another thoughtless decision by Disney Home Video is that everytime you press play you are forced to sit through Disney's obnoxious \\"Disney DVD\\" title (as if they invented the DVD format) then read the FBI warning and the Copyright warning.  These things belong at the beginning when you insert the disc so they don't corrupt the presentation of the film, but Disney would rather use that space to try to sell you things...<br /><br />There is then a very long blackout before you actually get to the film.  Long enough to make you think there is something wrong with the disc.<br /><br />So there is really not much excuse to buy this new release.  There IS a widescreen version but it's missing that crucial song that is argualbly the heart of the movie.  And by squeezing both widescreen and pan/scan versions on the same side, they have compromised picture quality of both.<br /><br />I frankly regret selling off my copy of the previous edition.  There is nothing here worth buying this again if you have the earlier release.
B000068QZK|5.0|I love \\"No Rest For the Wicked\\" and believe it's one of Ozzy's most underrated albums (along with \\"Bark At the Moon\\").<br /><br />Zack Wylde proved he was more than a worthy successor to Jake E. Lee, jamming with the master himself and laying down some deep tracks and outstanding guitar work.<br /><br />My favorite cut here is \\"Miracle Man.\\"  A thinly veiled busting of disgraced TV preacher Jimmy Swaggart's stones, one line has never failed to make me snicker every time I hear it:  \\"Now Jimmy he got busted with his pants down, repent ye wretched sinners, self righteous clown\\" (Swaggart was among the crop of TV preachers who pounced on Ozzy throughout the 80's, calling him everything but his mother's child).  Ahh, revenge can be so sweet.<br /><br />One tune that I was disappointed with was \\"Bloodbath In Paradise,\\" which glorified Charles Manson.  Then again, there was a trend in the 80's in glorifying murderers.<br /><br />Ozzy always has a penchant for writing songs that everyday people can relate to, such as with \\"Demon Alcohol.\\"<br /><br />One fact that must be noted: The original album only contained 8 songs - from \\"Miracle Man\\" to \\"Demon Alcohol.\\"  \\"Hero\\" was a bonus track on the tape (it wasn't on the album or the then-new technology of cds).<br /><br />In all, \\"No Rest...\\" is definitely worth the effort.  Ozzy ended the decade on a high note and he only continued the momentum in the 90's.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is one of the few CD's I can put in and let it play the whole way through without skipping \\"filler\\" songs.  This is a great CD for relaxing - romantic, mellow, and just pleasant to listen to.  If you're going to pick a Norah Jones album, this is the one to buy.
B00009W0U4|5.0|I am truly surprised, after reading many reviews about \\"Irreversible,\\" and after watching the film yesterday for the first time, to find out that the majority if not all of the people missed the biggest twist in the movie:    There was no revenge!!!!!!!!!!  The person that got killed at the \\"Rectum\\" was an innocent man.  The rapist did not get killed. In fact you can see him standing there smiling, looking upon the scene.  That's right - Tenia walked away scratch free (evil triumphs!).  Thus, for me, the movie's message became even darker and with a deeper meaning.  It gets into an even more serious (if such a thing is possible) territory by letting the evil win (rapist is unpunished) and letting the good suffer (an ex-pretty woman is in the coma after being brutally raped and beaten, possible in a wheelchair for life, Her now two ex-boyfriends will surely end up in jail, after killing, as it turns out - an innocent man...)    However unlikely, the final moments in the film made me feel that perhaps the director was working on many diverse layers of consciousness within the storyline (maybe all we see in a movie is someone's dream?). In other words - things are not as simple as they seem.    I have to applaud the director for staying true to his artistic vision. Every detail within a frame, every sound and color - everything in this movie has many different meanings.  To put it simply, - the director takes the concept of \\"Red/White/Blue\\" type of movies to even a higher level.  I am very impressed.  And lucky actors... they must feel very proud to take a part in creation of this masterpiece.    Irreversible hits the viewer like a ton of bricks.  It's an otherworldly experience!    The whole project took guts, intelligence and lots of talent.  It's movies like this that make me want to get involved into the movie making.    Thank you Gaspar No! 
B000BTJDG2|4.0|With all due respect to the reviewer Shashank, this movie was never meant to appeal to the fluffy scarefest audience of recent years... the \\"Ringu\\" crowd. Ideally, the audience that will find this movie a refreshing change of pace will be those of us over the age of 35 (like Ebert and Roper... WAY over 35).<br /><br />And as for Shashank's \\"WMDs in Iraq\\" comment.... guess what? If one took a room full of biological agents, and hid them in a region as big as California... it would be near impossible to find this buried supply. One cannot prove they are present, but this doesn't remove all suspicion that they are there.<br /><br />Which leads me to the case concerning  possession and exorcism... the evidence regarding the reality of these things is minimal... albeit greater than most people realize. But keep this slogan in mind... \\"THE ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE is NOT EVIDENCE OF ABSENCE.\\"<br /><br />If something remains \\"unproven\\"... whether it's current WMDs in Iraq or the actual possession of the girl given the pseudonym \\"Emily Rose\\"... one is NOT compelled to believe in such things. Yes, doubt and skepticism are healthy. Transversely, one cannot definitively DISMISS the reality of such things. They remain UNPROVEN, not DISPROVEN.<br /><br />Also, there are evidences that fall short of \\"absolute proof,\\" but they are still evidences of value. I have personally heard the recorded voice contortions during the exorcism this movie is based on, and it would be the type of rasp that would hurt a normal throat after five minutes. This seemingly possessed girl would go on and on in this gutteral voice for hours.<br /><br />The movie plunges into actual theology, much as the original \\"Exorcist\\" novel did decades ago. I'm glad to see the return of intelligent horror. For me, a scary movie is actually scarier when it's not slapping us with a startling scene every three minutes. Less is more!!<br /><br />Crawling, decaying corpses and cgi- effects are out there, for the new generation of fluff movie goers. It's nice to have a movie for us older people on occasion.<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, author of \\"the Shroud of Torrington.\\"ew generation of fluff movie goers.

B000BOH8XW|5.0|wow, she blew me away with this album. i thought it would be good. but this was a very pleasant surprise. i've been listening to it all day. lots of great songs. both ballads and uptempo. this, in my opinion is way better than laundry service. my faves are \\"timor\\", \\"dont bother\\", \\"illegal\\" \\"how do you do\\" \\"dreams for plans\\"(that one made me cry). really they're all excellent. \\"timor\\" is the catchiest of the bunch. very 80's sounding. and great use of a childrens choir in the chorus. very addictive.i can see the video already.
B0002S947K|5.0|Words cannot express the power of Ray's voice.  Please buy this album, and let the mournful, cavernous, sugar-textured sincerity of every utterance carry you deep into your soul, into a place where you and Ray are madly in love, where Ray understands every ounce of pain or lust you have ever experienced, and sings each note like it is his last.  Each bluesy melody and sexy syncopated rhythm must feel blessed that it has been created by him.  Have I made myself clear? See him live, close your eyes, be carried away...but then open them to witness the urgent honesty in his.  Ray, thank-you for singing.

B000000W5L|4.0|After the incredible songs and sound of Sticky Fingers, Exile is a step back to what the Stones would have sounded like if they never made it big.  It sounds like it was recorded on a cell phone in a bar (no, they didn't have those then) - not that there's anything wrong with that.  I think the Stones thought they were sounding too good - and too jazzy - on Sticky Fingers, so they went for a more raw approach- anticipating the punks by years. For my money, Sweet Virginia is one of their best songs. But nothing approaches the amazing Brown Sugar from Sticky Fingers.
B00006LI4S|3.0|This is a DVD of 2002 concert, with some bonus tracks from 2001.  David Gilmour's back up band is mostly \\"unplugged\\".  There are a large number of background singers that really give the music an acoustic feel.  There is stand-up bass and piano.      Gilmour mostly plays an amped acoustic guitar, except for all his famous guitar solos, where he plays an electric guitar, like on Shine On You Crazy Diamond and Comfortably Numb.    He plays a mixture of very old Pink Floyd material (like Fat Old Sun), most recent Pink Floyd songs (like High Hopes) and songs from other artists (like a Richard Thompson song).  For some reason, there is nothing significant from his solo career.    There are some very nice moments on the DVD, especially when Gilmour stays in the unplugged format.  It isn't so good when he pulls out the electric guitar and plays those famous solos exactly like he has been playing them for over 25 years.  I think it would have been much more interesting if he did something new with those songs.    Comfortably Numb is on here twice, once from 2002 and once from 2001.  The only difference between the two, is that Bob Geldalf sings on the 2001 one, and Robert Wyatt sings on the 2002 version.  Other than that, the music and the solo is exactly the same.    Comfortably Numb is on every live album Gilmour and Pink Floyd have released since 1980.  It is a great song, and there are some great versions of it.   But, on this DVD, it is just overplayed and tedious.  To me, it looks like Gilmour is bored and almost cringing as he goes to pick up the electric guitar in the 2002 version.    Gilmour can put on a really great show.  He has played with more energy and emotion than seen here.  On this DVD, there is a clip from 1992, and you see Gilmour really get into the playing.    The filming and editing of the video are very good, especially when you compare it to many of the new concert videos that have come out today.  The camera is usually focusing on the correct person at the right time and the shots are not constantly zooming in and out.    The DVD comes with some nice extras.    There is a \\"home movie\\" showing the group practice for the concert.  There is a really great part with the singers practicing Shine On You Crazy Diamond.  It sounds wonderful.    There is a \\"digital\\" section that plays all the guitar solos, while the camera is zoomed in on Gilmours fingers.    There are three videos of songs from earlier timepoints.  It is really interesting to see Gilmour in 1992 vs. how he looks now.    The sound is in stereo or 5.1.  On the menu, a portion of Shine On You Crazy Diamond is played in 5.1 and it makes full use of the surround sound.  However, during the concert, I didn't notice that much of an enhancement to listening in 5.1 over stereo.  It is not like an old Pink Floyd or David Gilmour concert where full advantage of the surround sound was taken.
B0006GAI6Y|5.0|I don't know how many times I've read reviews of this movie that slammed it because \\"the Japanese version is better.\\"  No, it isn't.  The Japanese version \\"different\\" and different is good.  Okay, the Japanese version deals with the social stigmatism of showing off in public and ballroom dancing is one target of their uptightness.  That's a great angle to tell a story from.<br /><br />In the U.S., obviously, we don't have that kind of social convention.  We have a totally different outlook on such things, but they can run quite parallel to the Japanese way of life.  In the American version, John Clark has pretty much everything he could ask for.  A beautiful wife, two great kids, a nice home and much more.  And he is bored out of his skull and has no idea why.  When he finds that he loves ballroom dancing and then is found out by his wife, he doesn't have to deal with the social implications of public displays as in the Japanese version, but the embarrassment and heartache of having to admit that his \\"perfect life\\" was missing something.<br /><br />Though our society doesn't condemn you for wanting to dance, or more specifically, ballroom dance, you will find out how many morons there are around you that will assume that if you are a guy and you love to dance, you must be gay.  Link Peterson was absolutely correct in keeping his passion secret for as long as he did and he was dead right on about the reaction that would occur if the people in the office found out about it.<br /><br />So I give this film five stars just because, as a dance movie, it has great dancing.  As a romance, it shows what can happen when secrets are kept and how much better off our relationships would be if we didn't try so hard to hide them.  Get this movie and enjoy a good story and quit worrying so much about how Japanese society is \\"this\\" and Japanese society is \\"that.\\"
B000301YY8|1.0|This album is truly awful... <br /> <br />If the terrible single \\"your beautiful\\" does anything for you then buy it....but if you are already turning the radio off whenver this overplayed, steaming turd of a single comes on then avoid it at all costs... <br /> <br />garbage...
B000BPCCZA|5.0|Mezmerize was very good but it was a mix of really good songs followed by a few that just did not fit in and made the whole album kind of shallow for lack of a better word.  Don't get me wrong...I like the first as well but something was missing.      Even though Hypontize doesn't have strong hits like B.Y.O.B or Question the overall quality of the songs and lyrics is fenomenal.  And it all flows together from start to finish...no songs about Hollywood (thank god).  It sounds like a mature version of Mezmerize.  I meant that as a compliment.  This album is a very pleasant suprise.  I expected a dud.  Man was I wrong.      As far as the DVD side...who cares...sure we got a few extras but that is just what they are...extras...icing on a freaking cake.  If you gonna complain about it and rate that, then you must be a spoiled brat and you should not be listing to this group to begin with.  But I guess I am impartial to it since I only paid a dollar more for the dual disk option.
B000BKJ78K|1.0|not so much a review but a question. I have always been a fan of the original star wars (mid 70's release). never thought of the new three up until a friend of my daughter get hooked on the last one (revenge of the sith) now I want to see the original three and the prequels. <br />my question is why is there a box set for the original three but the prequels are sold single? is there a time that they will be released as a six disc set? don't care too much about bonus, unless if it is to explain certain aspects of the movies. so can anyone point me to a place to buy all six at a decent price?
B00005JO1J|3.0|\\"Rent\\" is art triumphing over reason, aided by extremely catchy music. It's cute despite its relative absurdity, which is heightened on a movie screen, a canvas easier to scrutinize than a stage, where the musical \\"Rent\\" has enjoyed an extraordinary run on Broadway. <br /> <br />Employing all the songs from Johnathan Larson's original production - based on the opera \\"La Boheme\\" - and using six of the original cast members, \\"Rent\\" tells the tale of seven New Yorkers living in and around Alphabet City amidst art, drugs and AIDS. Set in 1989, the friends are rallying against landlord Benny (Taye Diggs) and his attempt to close down their rent-free tenement and reopen it as some kind of cyberstudio. Benny would like to employ his old roommates, filmmaker Mark (Anthony Rapp) and musician Roger (Adam Pascal), to stop a protest by performance artist Maureen (Idina Metzel), who dumped Mark for uptown lawyer Joanne (Tracie Thoms).  Mimi (Rosario Dawson) is a club dancer with her eye on Roger, while Tom (Jesse L. Martin) is another friend mugged in the street and nursed back to health by a street drummer/queen named Angel (Jermaine Wilson Heredia). Both have AIDS, as do Roger and Mimi. <br /> <br />Director Chris Columbus opens up the musical by staging certain numbers at various New York landmarks - the subway, Central Park - and creating an elaborate set for Maureen's performance. Music comprises 90 percent of the film, the better to gloss over a gossamer story that requires the characters to fall immediately, joyously in love and use Benny as a convenient villain who emerges more as a prompt for conflict or song - it's his words that touch off \\"La Vie Boheme\\" - than a character.  <br /> <br />Metzel, in the smallest of the main roles as Maureen, is shrill, flirty, funny and generally excellent, willing to give her character a shade of selfish, and Rapp turns in a old-school showman's performance, all passion and gesticulation; it reminded me of Sam Rockwell's work in \\"Confessions of Dangerous Mind.\\" The other cast members are suffering saints, led by Mimi, played by Dawson as a dangerous-but-sweet minx. \\"Rent\\" assaults Roger from all angles to date this dying heroin addict half his age who's been on the street since she was 17 and used to date Benny. Think about that for a minute. <br /> <br />Or don't. Roger and Mimi's courtship does, after all, include two of the best songs, \\"Light My Candle\\" and \\"Another Day,\\" the end of which is the first full belting of the mantra of \\"Rent,\\" \\"no day but today.\\" The idea: Live solely in the moment, loving those you're with, making friends and art  your family. While it's more of a defensive, desperate life philosophy than I think anybody should live by, the characters believe it and are eventually rewarded by it. Thoms, as Joanne, probably has the best, full-bodied voice; Dawson has the weakest, but also the easiest on the ears. They might have affected Rentheads another way, but Tom and Angel seemed to me disposable; their relationship is goofy, slight and coy. Angel is meant to be an emotional anchor, but he comes off as a plucky sidekick. <br />
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This has got to be one of this year's best releases. Critical acclaim aside, considered me shocked as I think that it's better than anything she's put out, EVER. The way underrated \\"Erotica\\" to me would be a close second.<br /><br />This CD not only flows seamlessly from beginning to end, but there is not a dud to be found, which is generally not the case with ANY artist. I was very skeptical when I heard that this was here \\"back to dance music\\" CD as it sounded like a reincarnation that did not sound organic on the surface, especially considering the low sales figures for \\"American Life\\". Many have described this release solely in retro terms but while she certainly mines from the 1970s and 1980s dance crop, the songs embraces recent dance/trance/electronica sounds so the sound is equally \\"Into the Groove\\"/ \\"Ray of Light,\\" but taken to a level that astounds me.<br /><br />The CD starts out with the first single \\"Hung Up,\\" which will rank as one of Madonna's catchiest singles. That telephone will ring in your ears long after the song is over. Next comes. \\"Get Together\\" starts out like early Madonna then weaves into a thumping hook and chorus that you won't be able to shake off. Why would you want to?<br /><br />\\"Sorry\\" starts out with an otherworldly grandiose feel (think Enigma) and has lyrics that you actually remember as they dance with a chorus that just won't quit. I love the way she says sorry in several languages. It just works. The end has a Pet Shop Boys like feel that feels new not borrowed. Next comes my favorite song on the CD: \\"Future Lovers.\\"  She tells a little story about love that is propelled by the amazing Donna Summer/Giorgio Moroder \\"I Feel Love\\" riff. I love the way she coos right before the chorus. This is without a doubt yet another single waiting to happen.<br /><br />\\"I Love New York\\" has silly lyrics but the \\"Can You Feel It\\" riff and chorus are hard to ignore and, while not as good as other songs on the CD, it does not detract from it. \\"Let It Will Be\\" starts out with visit to \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" with hypnotic strings and continues its non-stop energy attack that is this release's greatest accomplishment. The song segways perfectly into \\"Forbidden Love\\" which has beautiful lyrics and a New Order feel, which is a little slower than most of the songs on this dance-a-thon. \\"Jump\\" starts out with a confessional \\"Erotica\\" feel and a chorus, which while retro, is as strong and original as anything released this year. I love its move on and don't look behind message. Very empowering and could give Gloria Gaynor's \\"I Will Survive\\" some company in the non-sappy, I'll be ok without you anthems.<br /><br />\\"How High\\" has Madonna looking back at her life and while it does not shed much new post-\\"Ray Of Light\\" insight, it finds her making peace with the many incarnations that she's gone through in finding what works for her. No regrets which is evident in \\"Isaac\\", which centers on a contagious Jewish chant that is very melodic. Some in the Jewish community have taken offense with the song, but all I know is that it is such a beautiful song (Madonna's voice is a stand-out here) and from my limited knowledge does not seem to be offensive. I may be wrong, but I won't opine on matters that I don't understand. At worst the chants may remind some of the Eastern sounds that Sting embraced in his last CD. In a nutshell, why not use Jewish chants to create a hybrid sound that is.<br /><br />\\"Push Me\\" starts out like a sequel to \\"Like a Prayer\\" and seems like a major thank you to someone very special to her. It has a subtle Latin feel to it, which segways into the CD's last song, \\"Like it or not,\\" which is a strong statement to all those who have an opinion of her. It's a great closer to a set of songs that will leave you tired and wanting more and more. This CD has not left my CD player for a week, and that happens, ... actually never.<br /><br />Over the years I have taken Madonna's sometime provocative opinions with astrong grain of salt, and that has allowed me to focus on the music and not on her as a personality. She's one of those bigger than life celebrities, not unlike Barbra Streisand, who gets reviewed for what people think of her, rather than focusing on the music. Her die-hard fans will give \\"Confessions...\\" 5 stars without even listening to the CD, while those who hate Madonna will continue to hate her and give this 1 star (0 if it were possible).<br /><br />I am neither a die-hard fan (as my review for \\"American Life\\" will prove), nor a Madonna-basher, and can safely say that giving this release 5 stars is the result of the quality of the music. This baby flows from beginning to end, and will without a doubt be in my top 10 releases of 2005.pinions with a strong grain of salt, and that has allowed me to focus on the music and not on her as a personality.

B000BJS4SU|5.0|Why is this album so GREAT?  Well it is not the typical \\"Mayer\\" that most people expect.  The songs are bluesy and rock.  Lots of great guitar stuff for those who like such things.  The remake of the Hendrix song is kicking as well as the Ray Charles song.  The new songs are a touch Mayer with a new edge.  I love John in all forms and there is a little of something for everyone with this.  Plus it is better quality than the previous Mayer \\"live\\" albums he has put out.  There is less background interference and the audience sound is tempered enough to allow one to actually hear the music. Check it out.
B000AP04EW|5.0|I loved this movie and I want to see it again.  I just wish that they would not have deleted the sex scene.  I would like to see the whole movie and hope they issue the R-rated version.  Ya think Jennifer was the reason that the sex scene was cut?  Go do your own sex scene Jennifer...you should have left this one alone!!!
B000ATQYT2|3.0|What is wrong with Disney?I could not wait to get The Widescreen version and what does Disney do?But give us fans a Widescreen version but remove a scene! Shame on you Disney! I guess I too will watch The Widescreen version and then at the momment of the cut scene swich over to Full Screen watch the Deleted scene and then go right back to Widescreen.What a pain!
B00004R7TP|5.0|I am no die-hard Kate Bush fan--though I respect her work and like a great deal of it.  I do think, however, that this album is one of the very best that anyone produced in the 1980's.  Everything works right for her on this album.  The first five tracks were the initial \\"A\\" side of the LP, and are generally more pop-friendly, but still retain that edge of the unusual that one finds in all Kate Bush records.  \\"Cloudbusting\\" \\"Running up that Hill\\" and \\"Hounds of Love\\" were all British hits from the album.  The title song is without a doubt Kate's best pop recording, the humming Cello against the big drums propels this song forward with speed and urgency, just like the tempo of falling in love. <br /> <br />The B-side features more idiosyncratic works, in the best Bush tradition.  Be sure to get the import remastered with the Bonus tracks--\\"Under the Ivy,\\" and \\"My lagen Love\\" are outstanding, some of her best singing, and worthy of the extra expense. <br /> <br />Bottom line--absolutely, without a doubt, a superior recording in every way.
1400031087|1.0|There is absolutely no reason why an addict can't be given anesthesia for dental work.  And as another reader pointed out, root canals take more than one sitting.  Having published twenty-five novels, I have to say this book smacked of fiction.  In my opinion James Frey probably can't write grammatical sentences, which is why he resorted to this hodge-podge style.  I think Oprah is a wonderful person and a good influence on our culture, but she didn't do her homework on this pick.
0316776963|1.0|Reading is my passion. This was like the worst lover ever. I didn't laugh out loud or to myself once. Not once. This book was so gratuitous and predictible, it made my want to scream. I would never have finished this book after the first ten pages, but I've committed to myself that I will finish every book that I ever start. Why was this so funny to so many people? I'm scared.
B0001HAISG|5.0|I love watching films based on famous books, such as Gone With The Wind, To Kill A Mockingbird, and Pride and Prejudice. However, Peter Pan by JM Barrie never crossed my mind as something that would be done successfully on screen. This movie is amazing and has become one of my favorites because of how beautifully done it is. The freedom of childhood and the desire to mature is a pardox often overlooked in Peter Pan becuase it is so often shown to be a sudden epiphany to one character. However, this film shows character developement as the book did--all the characters struggle with the fact that they have to grow up and in trying to avoid it, they hasten the event. The effects were lovely, the music beautiful, and the plot true to original. This is a wonderful movie for all ages and anyone who has ever read the story should definitely see it.
