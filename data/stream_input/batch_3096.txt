B00ET2ODU8|5.0|Splendid ensemble performance piece, with Amanda Seyfried giving 200% in the demanding title role.Not to mention a scene-stealing turn from Sharon Stone, her best work since the 80s.An at times grim,but nevertheless utterly compelling,cautionary tale.See it !
B000IDGDPA|5.0|Excellent movie. Great plot and strong acting. It had an interesting story line and held our interest completely. I recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoyed the problem solving puzzles for each room. I just wished there were more rooms and levels with more complexity
B005OP7162|5.0|Excellent insight on human sentiments well execute beautifully settings Emily fantastic Nolan great Daniel soso.<br />Revenge happens to everybody must of the time ends badly
B002SSUQFG|5.0|You can not beat the product for the price. The watch keeps accurate time. Excellent product. I would recommend to anyone.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I play this game almost every night on my Kindle Fire. It's additive.  Perfect for anyone with ocd and folk who are not overly concerned with number of wins.  I find it relaxing.
B0081J9OWC|5.0|New to ES&TMZ so bought two albums, the self-titled and this one. Both are worth buying but I prefer this one for a regular listen. Great tracks!
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|If you have not purchased this CD as a Stryper fan, get on the ball now!!! if you have not purchased this CD as a non Stryper fan, become one and get on the ball now!!!! The absolute best Stryper comeback recording since they reformed in 2000, and is true to their sound in all aspects! It really sounds like the band again, and their previous reunion works were good too, but this.......this is the reigning champion of what we all fan have been waiting for, and they have not sounded this good, and true since \\"Soldiers\\". Michael hits a TON of high notes, and has lots of screaming, Roberts drums are real, live, and loud, and Tim's bass thumping can actually be heard more in the mix now, and the solo's are typical Stryper awesomeness!!! This is the direction they need to keep going in, and I dig the heavier, darker sound on this disc. i have no idea what my fave track is, but \\"Marching Into Battle\\" kicks my butt, and i seem to play that one more, and crank it up because of the beat, and Michaels high screaming - it really makes you want to march into battle!!!! \\"Saved By Love\\" is a fast heavy rocker that gets you pumped up, and wanna stage dive all over the place. \\"The One\\" sounds a lot like Michaels solo recording \\"Blue Bleeds Through\\" with the chrous, but that is not a bad thing, as that song was hauntingly beautiful, and \\"The One\\" is no different, and is the only slow track on the disc, although it is not a syrupy ballad. I love how live/raw the drums sound on this CD. I pray they never go back to the over-compressed, highly over-produced sound of IGWT, because as great as that CD was, it was way too sweet and sugary/polished sounding. The raw, darker, heavier sound on this recording is what they need to stay focused on, and give the fans what they crave, as well as edify their souls for making a killer record that will please the fans hand over fist.<br /><br />KUDOS Mike, Oz, Tim, Robert - this CD kicks *SS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />*UPDATE11/13/13* STILL loving this cd, and the songs are stuck in my head like tar on a white sheet! Again - if you are a Stryper fan, YOU MUST ADD THIS TO YOUR COLLECTION!! If you are a metal fan who appreciates all formats of the genre, ADD THIS TO YOUR COLLECTION! I swear i am going to burn out my battery of my MP3 player, and wear a groove in my cd from listening to this recording so much!!!! LOOOOOOVE IT!!
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|Cute film. Kids loved it. Love the lesson that you can do anything and be anything you want to be- regardless of what society may tell you. My kids also came away talking about honesty & admitting when you make mistakes. Disney did well with the practical life lessons in this movie, while keeping us chuckling and well entertained! We loved it.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Very good looking game. Lot of fun and ways to play. I enjoyed the variability In Gameplay.  Ai is really well done
B00G725UZA|5.0|This is a fantastic addition to the main album. Atomica, the Love is Lost remix, and God Bless the Girl are highlights, but all the other songs are great. Some of them have a very Beatles like sound, while others sound like something that could have been on Lodger. Overall I can see why these tracks were left off the original release, but they are still great and deserved to see a release. I'm so glad to see Bowie wasn't finished with the Next Day and I look forward to hearing more!
B00985E3UG|4.0|It contains a lot of information, but might cause a gullible reader (i.e., me) to be hypercritical of almost all processed foods.  There is no doubt that the food industry has created nutritionally useless money making &#34;puffs&#34;, but in the real world, sometimes affordable and accessible food is what is needed to fill the bellies of the poor.  I agree with the author that the food industry would be better served to create more access to nutritious and affordable products and pay less attention to the dividends paid to shareholders, but that will not happen.  Money is the king and humanity is just a source for corporate profit.  While I recommend the book, it may make the reader angry and disheartened with what is available since MOST of us are at the mercy of the large food processors.
B00CF2UORK|5.0|My kids love Shaun the sheep.  They just laugh and laugh at all his antics.  My husband and I enjoy it much more than many other kid friendly programs so it is well worth the cost for us~
B007CKNX28|5.0|My very, very favorite place to look for stuff is Amazon and my husband wanted it and he loves it.
B0074PNCRM|5.0|Amazing amazing amazing. I downloaded this because I was told it was a book I had to read. THey were right. Everyone should read this book.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|I have read several Bryson books.  This one is outstanding among the great.  Also, I have figured out Bryson's approach to writing which I will relate.  There are two things he does that I will merge in my rating.  First, a cartoonist named Bill Keane, used to publish a comic strip called &#34;Family Circus.&#34;  One of the characters, Jeffy, would be sent on an errand and instead of going directly from A - Z in a straight line, Jeffy would always visit every distraction along the way.  This is Bryson.  Then, I am sure we have all known someone like this in our lives, there is always the kid who, when s/he finds something particularly interesting or exciting (to that kid), s/he is compelled to enthusiastically drag all of his/her friends to see and experience the same thing, cheerleading all the way.  This is Bryson.<br /><br />In One Summer, Bryson could have picked ostensible main topic and written yet another dull narrative on the subject.  In stead, and with the enthusiasm of a boy at a summer carnival, he chose to research the entire year of 1927 with background and side-bars (as end notes) to lead the reader on a comprehensive journey through the most important aspects of the era, while consistently returning to the main story line for continuity.<br /><br />Anyone who is interested in the actual stories, history and minutiae of those things Bryson writes about; or if one has an adolescent (even younger, perhaps) child who they wish to learn more about the world, Bryson is the author of choice.  It is too bad Bryson doesn't have another 100 years of life so he could explore even more about the world to share with the rest of us.<br /><br />I think that Bryson is going to (if not already) be recognized as one of the premier nonfiction authors of our time.  I cannot recommend his books highly enough.  I just wish he would come home and write from his homeland and stop using the British writing style and spelling.
B005LAIIFS|4.0|Great show.. although the one Pitch Black character scares my 4 year old quite a bit and he gets blamed for a lot of bad dreams. We still really enjoy it! My boys especially like the idea of the Sandman and we are waiting anxiously for Jack Frost to come to our house this year :)!
B00181JGI2|1.0|The plot was pointless, the constant screaming of the dialog was annoying.  Glad we didn't go to the theater and only blew a few bucks instead of a night out.<br /><br />Forget it.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Awsome show. They have a great cast. Keeps you pumped up.  The shows different to all other shows. Like the fact its based on real motorcycle club.
B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|Absolutely outstanding and very funny.  Bryson tells of his research visits to Australia in the same inimitable style of his other books, leading us on an adventure with several side-bars of facts and profiles.  I learned more about Australia in this modest book than in everything else I have ever read.  Perhaps it is because so little is known or written about the continent.  Bryson does us another service in an excellent book.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This device is pretty awesome. Want to make your TV into a smart TV but don't want to spend too much for a Roku or Apple TV? This could be the gizmo for you. Plug it in, and use your smartphone, tablet or laptop as a remote control.<br /><br />I am very happy with this purchase. Though I do have an Xbox 360 and a smart Blu-ray player, it is nice to use the Chromecast instead of bringing the Xbox to the TVs in my house to watch Netflix or Hulu. If your HDMI port doesn't provide power, the box comes with an USB cord and a plug adapter if you need it (though if the USB port in your television is a 'service port' the Chromecast can't get power from it, you'll need to plug it into your wall). Another word of caution (kind of), if you want to use your laptop/pc to control your streaming you need to have Windows 7 or higher. This isn't a huge problem but my office computer runs with Windows Vista, so I wasn't able to test how it works beyond my smartphone. Another plus is since you're not running the app on your device, just using it as a remote control, that saves a lot of battery power.<br /><br />If you do your research and this device fits your entertainment needs/lifestyle then it is definitely worth the purchase. And at $35, this is practically a steal. Though the roster of apps is small at the moment, I'm sure there'll be more on the way
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|The CD is crazy out of sight.<br />Verses from featured artists are almost as good as his own.<br />Each song is unique, from each other one.<br />His samples are perfect, his range is better than ever.<br />This CD is so Different from anything out now, recently, or past and it is oozes Eminem so hard it is impossible to dislike if you are fan of music of almost any kind.<br />If you are a fan of music then you are a fan of this.
B00F8KIJ2I|1.0|Honestly I don't know where to start with this. When I was in high school I loved Avril, and I still listen to her other albums from time to time. Let Go was fun and overall innocent. Under My Skin was dark, yet relatable. The Best Damn Thing was a bit of a disappointment, but it still served its purpose as a light-hearted pop album. Goodbye Lullaby was a pleasant surprise; despite the shallow singles, it was filled with meaningful songs that reflected her experience and maturity. Now we have the self-titled, and honestly it sounds like some pages ripped out of a tween's diary. Of course both Let Go and Under My Skin had their share of teenage rebellion and angst, but considering she actually was a teenager at the time it wasn't a big deal. And even despite the adolescent emotions, her lyrics were still surprisingly mature. Some of these songs are just plain embarrassing. All it takes is one listen to \\"Hello Kitty\\" or \\"Bitchin' Summer\\" to start cringing. There's nothing wrong with wanting to have fun, but fun music doesn't have to be bad music. No one wants to hear a 29 year old woman act like a 12 year old brat. I hate to say it, but the majority of this album sounds like Taylor Swift with some token obscenities thrown in. To Avril's credit though, there are a couple highlights. \\"Let Me Go\\" is overall a pretty ballad, and it's kind of cute how she included Chad on the track. And \\"17\\" is a fun, nostalgic song about actually being young and in love; coincidentally it's very reminiscent of Let Go. It's also the only song I actually downloaded. Thank goodness I listened to the album before buying. Save your money and just buy the good songs.

0545586178|4.0|Very good continuation of the first book, &#34;The Hunger Games&#34;.  The ending of this volume, which is part two of a trilogy, was unexpected.  I'm looking forward to reading &#34;MockingJay&#34;, the next volume of the trilogy.<br /><br />Yes, this is supposed to be a book written for young people, but I'm a mature man, and found I was unable to put the series down!<br /><br />Paul G
B00F031WB8|5.0|This is the best documentary about Jimi Hendrix I've seen. His story is nicely related with insightful interviews while the music is perfectly woven throughout. Many rare, or unseen concert clips are included. I'm buying the dvd for the extras as well, because he is a huge part of the soundtrack of my life and I want to fill in all the spaces possible.<br /><br />I do wish Jimi had liked his own voice better. I think its great, but his unassuming off-stage persona must have let the self doubts enter regarding his vocals.<br /><br />This is the way Hendrix should be remembered, it honors his innovative, original brilliance and vision. If there is a lack of ugliness about background people or situations, all the better. Its about the music and his legacy as it should be. The documentary is very satisfying and supports all my good experiences with this amazing, original artist.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|The whole family are Lego Maniacs as well as Back To The Future.  So for Christmas I am giving my youngest son (age 23), the Blue Ray trilogy, wihch I bought from Amazon and the Lego DeLorean.

8184776217|4.0|As was the case with the first two volumes of the Hunger Games trilogy, I found it hard to put this book down as well.  The twists and turns of the plot were unexpected, and kept me reading non-stop!  Ms Collins is truly a gifted author.<br /><br />The trilogy was allegedly written with teens and young adults as the target audience, but this &#34;old man&#34; enjoyed the story very much.  It's difficult to suggest a specific genre for the series, but it has shades of horror, science fiction, and governmental thriller throughout.  Start with &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; and you'll want to read all three books!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|At first I thought the game was too easy, but look out! This game is probably my all-time favorite now! It is incredibly challenging without being complicated, and they give you a full game, not  just a demo! LOVE IT!!
B001NLKZUA|3.0|Decent YA fiction, but a little whiny at times for my tastes. Well written, though, and worth continuing with the series.
0802473156|5.0|Great book. :) :) :) :) It is a very good read & if your marriage needs work, I highly recommend it.
0061537969|5.0|I picked this up at an airport bookstore just before boarding a flight, had never heard of the author or the book, but I liked the cover.<br /><br />I couldn't put it down, really just a wonderful story with great characters.  Anyone who has a pet knows how much a part of your life they are will absolutely love this book.
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|Oh how I love Bridget! This book is fantastic, laugh out loud fun. I hope it becomes a movie like the other two.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I want to let you know right now this review is more about House of Hades than Mark of Athena. Call me an idiot, but I accidentally submitted my review before I put the actual important stuff in. So, I'm going to start now.<br /><br />  *****SPOILERS*****<br /><br />At the very end of MoA there is a hypogeum under a- under THE Colosseum. Percy, Jason, and Piper fall out of a tunnel coming from what would have been their death. Fortunately they live. After stumbling out of there, their clothes stiff and wet, hair plastered against their foreheads, they find the two giants their party of seven has been searching for. Ephialtes and............ dear god it's him. The tutu giant, dressed in baby blue and obsessed with ballerinas. Today, he is wearing a slim fitting, tight looking, *cough* revealing *cough* ballerina outfit. Not pretty. Anyway, the trio has come for two reasons- to kill the two giants, and to rescue Haze's brother Nico di Angelo.<br /><br />(Nico's POV) Nico heard about Camp Jupiter and Camp Half-Blood. He has been walking a thin line between Roman and Greek camps. When he hears about that forced line of trading, Hera's trade-off, and the PROPHECY OF SEVEN (mysterious music playing) he knows that he has to search for the doors of death, the expressway between life and death. Nico reached the doors. Almost two seconds of thrill and joy. Almost.<br /><br />Nico is trapped in a solid, airtight bronze jar for six days. He ate the sacred pomegranate seeds of Persephone to keep himself alive, along with a death trance. He made it, just barely. On the Kalends of July, Percy Jackson came and rescued Nico from certain death. This creates a life debt- the second one between them. Nico owes Percy Jackson his life. So it comes as a great suprise what happens next.<br /><br />Jason and Nico are going baby hunting. Or Cupid hunting. Whatever you call him. They need to retrieve a scepter that Cupid holds. This scepter controls the dead, which is why Nico needs it. However, the big bully named Cupid demands that Nico reveal his secret to Jason<br /><br />&#34;I had a crush on Percy.&#34; These six words caused hundreds of people to toss out Rick's books and never read them again.<br /><br />WHAT THE **** is wrong with you people?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! The workd is FULL of lesbians and gays. Listen to me. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH BEING GAY! It us not some horrid disease that you catch- it is spontaneous. LGBTQ teens are not an alien race that needs to be confined. It is okay to be gay. When you tell your kid that LGBTQ kids are wrong, or sick, or ill, or mad, or disturbed or different, weird, ugly, inappropriate, or crazy, you are RUINING our world. I am an ELEVEN year old girl in my school's ASB program, and I know how it feels to be different. Parents, do you know what it feels like to be different? Don't lie, because everyone in the world has felt different. If you tell other people that being LGBTQ is wrong, then you are the hater. YOU are the wrong, sick, ill, mad, disturbed, different, weird, ugly, inappropriate, and crazy person  What right do you have to tell others about someone elses life? That's right. NONE AT ALL. So why are you doing it? Listen to me. I got told about LGBTQ people when I was seven or eight. And in those reviews people are telling me that their kid is too young at age TEN. WHAT IS WRONG WITH OUR SOCIETY? In Harry Potter DUMBLEDORE is gay.<br /><br />It is time to take a leap into reality. SUCK IT UP. The world is not made of straights and whites. If you think that, well, GOOD LUCK in the REAL world. Not everyone is as great as Riordan at creating diversity. EVERYONE IS EQUAL.<br /><br />My Rating:<br />+1 star for a great storyline<br />+1 star for inspiring characters<br />+2 stars for making Nico gay<br />+1 star for having diversity<br />- 1 star for all of the people out there who hate LGBTQ people<br /><br />That is the reason I gave it four stars not five. Cudos to you Riordan, for the most excellentseries yet.

1250037751|5.0|Boy did I love this book and even more so on CD!  One of the more unique books I've read in some time.  Clay takes a job in a unique bookstore but finds so much more.  It's a secret society (Clay refers to it comically as a cult and there's probably some truth to that) trying to discover the secret of life in their long-ago mentor's writings.  It interweaves his talents as an techno-wiz/internet marketer, his girlfriend's work at Google and an ancient society together so well it left me awestruck.  A fun read.

B00B0LPWU6|1.0|Sigh. I love Denzel. And I LOVE movies about plane crashes. I have had a fascination with both actually for quite some time, so when I saw the preview for this movie I told my husband we HAD to go ON opening day. If you knew me, you would know how strange that was coming out of my mouth. Normally we never see anything in the theater because its a 40 minute drive and always packed with unruly teenagers and people on their phones.<br /><br />So this movie comes out and we make a date night of going to see it. Dinner and a movie. I was excited. Great dinner. HORRIBLE MOVIE.<br /><br />Like anyone who watched the original trailer for this movie, you would ASSUME that this is a movie about a hero pilot who does some risky maneuvering to save a lot of lives. There was a hint of some substance abuse issues there too. OK. No problem. So we have a plane crash movie with some drug undertones. That I can deal with, because it has Denzel staring.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that is NOT AT ALL what this movie is. This is 98.5% a substance abuse movie and the subject just HAPPENS to be a pilot. Seriously. Of the entire 2 hours and 19 minutes, MAYBE 10 minutes MAX is about the plane at all. This movie is about a DRUG ADDICT. The main character is horrendous. Let me say first that Denzel did a stunning job; but I wanted to beat the crap out of his character. The main character was a complete and total POS. He had ZERO redeeming qualities. And as the movie progressed I hated this guy more and more. Then nearing the end his poor choices really set me off and I really wanted to leave the movie, but my husband asked me to sit back down. So i did. I sat through this crap. I HATE drugs. Having grown up in a house with a drug addicted parent, I also hate drug addicts. I have no sympathy or feelings at all towards them except HATE. This movie was not about a plane crash. It was about a horrible man who happened to fly planes. I hate that we spent $20 watching this movie. I hate that Denzel even was in this movie. This movie should not be called \\"Flight\\" it should be called \\"Druggie Middle Aged Man\\" because THAT is what it is about.<br /><br />Yes, there is nudity and language. Those I could totally care less about, they don't bother me a bit. I am giving this movie 1 star because it is over 2 hours of a drug addict doing what drug addicts do, and who the hell wants to watch that? Just go watch an episode of intervention.ven was in this movie.

B00DSGT8TW|5.0|The first of two new releases, the Manics go acoustic for this one - with great success. Nearly every song is a classic. The lyrics are very dark on this album, although it doesn't detract from the music. The Manics have once again delivered an album that blows away most other &#34;alternative&#34; acts out there today. Highly recommended.

B000GWE44U|5.0|Still a scary movie, even if you haven't seen it since childhood. Brings back a whole lot of memories. Great movie whether you saw it in theaters back in the day or are seeing it for the first time! Jack Nicholson is perfect and Stanley Kubrick did a wonderful job.
B009JZVT70|4.0|Season 1 was 5 stars. Still working thru Season 2 to catch up with what is on the DVR for Season 3. My daughter and I really enjoy watching this together.
B00EAZTONU|5.0|This is for the extended edition with the statue. First, I will preface with the fact that I was a big fan of the extended editions for LOTR so having nearly 3 hours of movie was not daunting for me like it is for some others. Watched in theaters, and loved the longer scenes here. There are enough reviews about the movie out there so I will leave you to finding those on your own.<br /><br />Mostly I wanted to review to post my opinion of the statue with this set. Simply put, it is amazing. the quality of what you get is top notch. Sometimes you see the promotional items in photo and such from the manufacturer and when you get yours you are stuck wondering if yours was one of the last ones from that mold before it was completely worn out. That's not the case here, the details are all there and it isn't some lightweight cheap material either. I have seen similar quality statues go for more than this entire set, it really is that good.
B005V5WBFG|3.0|I'm not really sure how good of a product this is. I'm sure it would be a good antivirus product if you're willing to spend the money. One thing that I was irritated at was this said &#34;Free&#34; no, its a demo for so many days and then you have to pay for it. The price wasn't bad I don't think, but I'm not really willing to pay for it..
B0038QMREK|5.0|Absolutely love this album on vinyl! I am a pretty big fan of The Tallest Man On Earth and already had one of his EPs on vinyl, so I decided I would give 'Wild Hunt' a try because it wasn't too expensive and it's my favorite album of his. As soon as it came in the mail I put it on as soon as I took it out of the package and have been in love with the sound ever since. His voice sounds absolutely great on vinyl, perhaps it's just the genre, but it is definitely my favorite of all the Folk records I have on vinyl. Must buy for any Folk/Tallest Man On Earth fan!
B008YRVW0I|3.0|I have this on my laptop and it is good. I don't like playing a demo unless it says it is.<br />Good point about all the fishdom games is that there is no IAP'S!<br />It is appropriate for all ages.<br /><br />Have fun!

B00B0X4PIO|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book but it didn't captivate me like the authors previous two books. It is always lovely to read about the ordinary people of Afghanistan the only thing new in this book was the introduction of homosexuality in a closed society
B000WCDBKM|3.0|The only reason this is worth watching is because it has Johnny Depp, which is reason enough for me. However, as for a coherent plot, or understandable motives, or even an end that has some semblance of explanation...
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I felt it was a Hugh rip off. All the hate, fighting, death you just keep reading because you are sure it will all come together and make sense.  Instead we get this stupid confusing end with one of the main players killed. All the time, money and emotional effort wasted. I was ok with the &#34;outside the fence explanation, but it just got so stupid, like she was just trying to get to the part where the girl dies and it ends, just finish it. No more money or time on this author and the movie is out unless I hear it ends different.  I felt betrayed!  I was loyal to the author with money, time and all the interest and she bailed. Wished I had never started the books.
B00DICGK24|1.0|The movie was in Chinese! It was a Chinese version of the movie. I was not expecting the dvd in the wrong language at all...
B00EKR61FM|2.0|I'm not a fan of this movie series, and since everyone has their own opinion of it, I'm not going to rate that aspect of it.<br /><br />I bought this set for my mother, who really enjoys this series.<br />The packaging, although pretty, is not very good for the disks. We've already had a bit of a scratching issue just taking the disks out to make sure they were not damaged in transit.<br /><br />The &#34;art book&#34; case also inserts into the box from the bottom, so you have to be careful and remember about that when you pick it up or the whole book falls out. I had that issue when I took the plastic wrap off, before I even realized it came out of the bottom.<br /><br />If you get this I recommend buying some blank blu-ray cases to keep your disks in, and using the &#34;art book&#34; as just an art book.<br /><br />I only give this two stars because it's a pretty good price for 5 movies on Blu-ray. Otherwise it would have had only one.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|This book is awesome and cool I like it a lot full of adventure and all the rest I you to think this book was not that good well now I know tree that is perfect for 5th graders
006202406X|1.0|This is my first review of a book on Amazon and I am only writing because I dislike it so much.  And I have never disliked a book or series like this in a very long time. The first two books were frustrating enough reads with the author repeatedly creating dramatic situations caused solely by the stupidity and lack of common sense from her own characters. The heroine just whines and cries all the times and seems to bumble her way through dangerous situations then coming out on top by sheer luck alone.<br /><br />Then comes this book.  As if the author has no clue how she to end the series. So instead she creates a lame excuse for more conflict, kills off characters to create drama and leaves the reader feeling hollow after they've turned the last page. Hollow because the reader feel, they can't believe they've waste the time out of their lives reading these 3 books.<br /><br />I am willing to bet the first movie goes straight to DVD and the next two movies will never get made.  Not without a major storyline and ending change.
1594487154|5.0|Daniel Pink is a good author. His subject material is important to me and he makes a solid argument that it is compelling to us all.<br /><br />This subject has been hashed and rehashed by other reviews. Basically Pink makes the argument that the most successful salespeople - in all forms of sales, in the 21st century - are those with the interest of the buyer at heart. This is a heartwarming conclusion to reach on scientific grounds, and for some readers it may be enough.<br /><br />If you're in sales - and Pink argues most of us are - this leaves you in a tough spot. It is best to act selflessly. Yet acting selflessly provides immediate feedback! Namely you get walked on! I'm not speaking generally, I've been in direct sales for five years.<br /><br />Pink fails to bridge a critical gap. The problem for any aspiring do-gooder is getting to the point where your community supports your selfless approach.  The community WILL do it, Pink shows. But you'll be bleeding cash until they do AND more problematically you'll be tempted at every turn to take advantage of just one customer to get by.<br /><br />This is setting yourself up for disaster. In the short term all you can see is a trade off between your own success and the success of others. Look for examples in your own life. Many of those \\"struggling\\" the hardest are also not looking out for others - only themselves. Until you escape this framework by getting your reputation built in a valuable industry you'll be stuck. Unfortunately Pink doesn't weigh in much on that.
B00E8S2GJI|1.0|I LOVED the MOVIE. This Extended Version is a great STARTER for you to prepare for the DESOLATION OF SMOG tha tis coming to Theaters next month.<br /><br />Why one star? BECAUSE they have absolutely no respect for us that buy media: This movie only comes with UltraViolet Digital Copy and not iTUNES !!!<br /><br />So if you like iTunes or AppleTV FORGET IT. If you want to watch the movie where you don't have a good internet FORGET it and if you like to download your movies, because, well you bought it and it's YOURS, FORGET.<br /><br />I think not including iTunes digital copy in a Bluray that I bought (specially the extended SPECIAL edition) is a disrespect.
B000M341QE|5.0|Best scorcese movie period. My only regret is not seeing this movie in theaters. Kills me every time I think about it.
1451666179|5.0|Allie is brilliant and unbelievably talented! Every story is entertaining and undeniably true. I've never seen a more accurate representation of depression and anxiety.<br /><br />&#34;Cake is all that matters!&#34;
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It's really good but it's always needing updating which the app store doesn't have. Other then that it works perf
B0091WD4ZQ|5.0|Incredibly well made movie!!  I love the whole trilogy.  This is an absolute must see, if you love great movies
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I think Ice Age Village is an awesome app. Keep up the good work<br />Game loft. I love playing it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game but I just wish u guys would put more levels on it so I can play it
B00821OX98|5.0|The story line is well put together. Every episode I watched left me wanting to see more and to find out how the events and characters would continue to develop. An all around great show!
B00B3MN65K|5.0|Love the singer and this album was remarkable.  I listen to it every day and enjoy it while walking my 30 min
B009RX7IX8|5.0|this is the BEST SHOW EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it has a combination of mystery and romance.  The perfect mix!!!!!!!!!! Don't you think
B004HWYTP4|5.0|While not a work of staggering complexity - it is a very slick funny romp which thankfully doesn't take itself too seriously and is full of fun characters. John Malcovitch does a great job of playing off of the always watchable Bruce Willis's straight man and Mary Louise-Parker is her own wonderfully batty addition.
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|Eminem shines brightly with Marshall Mathers LP2.  In interviews, he talked about this album is a revisit back to the original MMLP with a different perspective and you really see that with tracks like &#34;Evil Twin&#34; and &#34;Headlights&#34;. Headlights is Eminem's retake on cleaning out my closet as he tries to mend his relationship with his mother which he utterly destroys with cleaning out my closet.  Rap God is hands down one of the best tracks I heard from Eminem and I have been a long time stan since his feature in the source.  For those who says that he failed on trying to channel the old Em, he answered that question in a very tongue in cheek fashion on &#34;So Far&#34; as he acknowledged the lack of shock value but most rappers still can't touch him bar for bar.  Overall, this is a must have if you're a Eminem stan!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am enjoying this game. I play it almost every day. The steps are harder sometimes to clear but its a challenge
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Great game, love love love this game. Can't wait to play again right after this review. Keeps you on edge the hole time you are playing .
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|It is a great game. Very fun. The only thing is that it takes along time to fight, and to buy sime robots you have to use the in game money which is hard to get. But it is a great game and would recommend it for anyone!
B0037NVM1I|5.0|I've seen it a dozen times over the years and as a sequel it was great.  Arnold at his best.  Of course, lots and lots of action with a great storyline.  If you're an action freak, like me, this one is for you.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|The twists in the final book are great! Was a bit disappointed with one twist, but I expect most fans of the trilogy feel the same on this. Don't want to spoil the book so go read it!
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Thoughtful and thought provoking - written by a man who has earned the right to tackle this significant a subject
B00BWWS81S|2.0|To slow paced, not nearly as good as Eye To The Telescope. I still love that voice though, I could listen to it forever.
B00005JNEI|3.0|It's one way too look at the events.<br />The amazing part was how much of this movie contained images and video that was not released by the press before this movie was created.
B0063GORYU|2.0|I had previously reviewed Spider solitaire as addictive fun.  And it really was.  Until I joined the ranks of the reviewers that claim that Spider simply quit working one day.<br /><br />After nine months of play, Spider has now stopped working on my Kindle Fire.  I have deleted, redownloaded and reinstalled several times.  It flat won't work anymore.<br /><br />Do you suppose that the developer purposely programmed it to quit working after we play this game X number of times so that we will purchase a paid version?
B00G456S38|2.0|I like this type of genre so it has to really bad for me?  The episode was \\"OKAY\\" which fairly bad for me!  So keep it up!  You never know it might catch on.  But keep up the good work and pray, you have the start good crew!  It will get much better so keep it up.
B0086700CM|5.0|very fun and adicting. seriously, when u start ur eventually gonna die, then ur gonna wanna beat ur high score, and ur never gonna get off! overall : great game.
B0000UJDLM|3.0|Hard to believe we were that cheesy in the 80's.  It's the pieces you don't forget that make this a great movie.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|This game is a tower-defense type, where you have to defend your home against invading zombies. Thankfully they don't move as quick as those in 28 Days or World War Z! To help you, plants can ambush the zombies in various ways, shooting them or blowing them up, for instance. You also have the help of Crazy Dave, who will sell you stuff out if the back of his car, like extra plant slots, a shovel, better plants, pool vacuums, and so on. Unfortunately he is very crazy and has a thing for tacos.<br /><br />The game has hall of achievement which adds to your enjoyment, but sadly on Amazon Appstore, the game hasn't been updated past version 1.2. Whereas on Google Play, it's fully updated.<br /><br />This means you miss out on the Zen Garden, Survival mode, and many achievements.<br /><br />That's the primary reason I cannot give a 5 star rating on Amazon. Sad too, that it's not the only game that suffers in this way. I love Amazon, but it seems you're better off giving your money to Google when it comes to Android Apps.<br /><br />Update 12/22/13: It looks like this app will not be updated on Amazon Appstore, so I've uninstalled this version (1.2) and purchased the latest version from Google Play (version 5.0.1). And yes, you have to start all over again, as the game data is saved in a different format. (Appstore uses .asec files)
1452110581|5.0|Hilarious!!!  You'll pee from laughing...honestly.  Kitty lovers will want to give this as holiday gifts.  I'll soon order several more.
B00BFIFIPS|3.0|We like the case. I would have given it 4 stars, except one caveat here.  Read on please.  It's very attractive and the bright colors are nice.  The case fits the iPhone 5s we bought or upgraded new from T-Mobile.  One thing here though.  If you plan on using a headset to listen to your music, beware that certain male headphone plugs DO NOT insert all of the way with the case installed onto the iPhone 5/5s.  This they need to correct in it's manufacturing.  i.e. make a bigger hole to accommodate the slightly larger headset plugs.  One other consideration is a protective iPhone transparent clear screen cover or plastic overlay that this case doesn't have.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|I can't recommend this. It bored me to death. Everyone involved with this movie must have felt like bandits all the way to the bank.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Outstanding Blu-rays of Alien Anthology Box Set, looks great , even judge it with my old DVD Box Set of Alien Anthology that I have to and like I said, Blu-ray set is so cool watching it on my big screen tv and I got a great price on Blu-ray. All films here in box set are are super. Sigourney Weaver never look better here on disc as The Alien even looks better than her, HA! HA! Good fun here on Blu-ray.
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|Rare genius. Keeps you glued to the screen. We watch this show as a family and we truly enjoy it
031623480X|2.0|I give it five stars for entertainment and one star for content.<br /><br />This is an interesting book and entertaining to read. Unfortunately, some of his information is, well, wrong. If you want to feel good about eating high fat animal products, and avoiding carbohydrates, go for it. You'll feel proud of yourself for following a \\"best-selling\\" author. Your body will deteriorate, you'll enjoy less than optimum health, you'll probably get fat(ter), and you'll almost certainly suffer from heart disease, atherosclerosis, and several other very bad diseases. But hey! You'll get to feel righteous about following Dr. Perlmutter and his flock.<br /><br />If you really want to learn about optimum nutrition, Google Dr. McDougall or Dr. Wolford. Neither of them has written a \\"best-seller,\\" or I don't think they have, but they have the keys to the kingdom as far as nutrition goes. Dr. McDougall has several videos on Youtube, too.
B006LSZECO|2.0|The story went very well for a while then just got stupid.  Was very disappointed as I had heard from a friend that it was good.  But I found it was a stinker.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|Following Serena's route through university and early work was entertaining and very much a cold war story as expected. Definitely entertaining. A bit slow in the beginning but took of after a while - don't give up.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This app works great just like any computer version of spider.  You can change the all settings and play whatever way you like .  I've had no trouble running it on  an old and new kindle fire.
B00E0OYOXQ|5.0|Excellent debut album, this is for the 2 CD version but have the 4 disc version as well since I'm a collector of their music. The only flaw is they did not put &#34;Saxophones as Opiates&#34; on it with the rest of the &#34;B Sides&#34;. Well, no problem, already have it on another couple CD's in my collection. No matter what version of this album release you purchase, you really can't go wrong unless your not a solid fan of this artist. I personally enjoy the regular album better then the second or third disc. Fun for a listen now even though I have all the 12&#34; / 7&#34; versions of their work from the day. So get this one, highly recommended & in 2015 we will get &#34;Songs From The Big Chair&#34; next, for now, enjoy this one.<br />Check out my website / BLOG @ &#34;JudeMac Forever&#34;, something for everyone to check out on it.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Enjoyed the book.  Well written and very likable characters that I found myself rooting for!  One of the better books I have read recently.
B00633PFQC|5.0|Excellent analysis of where the boundaries of markets ought to be in our society. Have we gone too far in the pursuit of a market driven life???
B008JFUR10|5.0|This movie is a pure, unadulterated fun. Other than being one of the most human positive movies I've seen in years I can't help but smile for the full run time of the movie. Growing up watching Godzilla films and Ray Harryhausen adventure films like 7th Voyage of Sinbad, this movie is a love ballad dedicated to the escapist movies of my youth. Highly inspired by other properties popular in Japanese Anime as well, this film channels all of these elements into a blast of a film enjoyable to young and old.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray transfer is great and sounds excellent. The bonus features containing the Guillermo Del Toro production journal was a nice addition as well.
B0091WNK8M|4.0|This was a movie that brought back memories from when I first watched it when I was younger.  It is still as good as I remember it.  Not too scary.  Just right and funny..
1454704225|4.0|If you have a creative or crafty child, this book is perfect! Even if you are the crafty type, you would most likely enjoy the exercises in this book. There are 75 exercises in all, and each one is unique. Several different artists contributed to the book, so styles and ideas are widely varied.<br /><br />I liked some styles and exercises better than other ones. Not every exercise appealed to me, but the beauty of having so many artists contribute is that there will most likely be something for everyone.  This book is a great resource for getting those creative juices flowing and switching into right brain mode. It is a lot of fun to take the doodle prompt and put an individual touch to it.<br /><br />This book is definitely recommended for anyone artistic! It would make a really fun Christmas or birthday gift.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love this story so much! Great, page-turning story! A must read for any girl in her twenties! One of my favorites.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|so glad they finally got candy crush for the kindle!! I absolutely love this game! works great and it runs great for the kindle fire
B00F91G5BS|4.0|I thought this was a great movie with regard to intensity of action & chaos. However, the conclusion would have been seen in medical facilities around the globe. For that, I felt the story line was a little flaky. But then again, it's a zombie movie!
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Love Grisham books. At about 50% the end became predictable. Liked \\"The Litigators\\" more. Looking forward to his next novel.
044654759X|5.0|Great book. My girlfriend is a huge Nicholas Sparks fan. Better than the movie. Good story if you like romance.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My life is over! I am addicted after only 2 days of down loading app. Had know idea what i was missing
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|Great game!!!  Finally a game that is user friendly and has good hints when needed.  I remember recommend this game to all.
B001FQMOCA|5.0|Huge fan of Johnny Cash and his music....this movie fits the bill any time I want to relax and enjoy the music as well.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Entertaining.  Some good characters.  Really like the character of the chip monk mouth lawyer.  Good acting by him.<br />Would like to see him in more shows.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Great game but everything in game is so expensive. I don't want to put money into the game but I really wish things in game were cheaper.
B00FRQ32N4|1.0|it was awesome and so cool the robots where to cool and the desins where awesome you sud get it !
B00DVKOYBM|3.0|Do not get me wrong this is an excellent game, but for some reason it constantly tells me in the middle of my games that there is something wrong with my internet.. I have all 5 bars on my kindle fire's wifi. This happens very often with this game. This is the only game out of 36 games on my kindle that gives me this problem
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Now you see me is just a fun movie.  The twists and turns aren't all that unexpected, but still bold enough to keep you guessing a little.  The pacing is great and I'm glad I rented it.  Characters never really get a chance to fully develop and engage the audience, but for this movie it works.  You don't need to be emotionally tied to them to enjoy what they do and what happens to them.
B009YN2M7S|4.0|I'm not a diehard Sparks fan--his books can be a little too much on the sappy side for me--but I really enjoyed this one. It's not just a love story; it's a story of strength and resiliency and emotional growth, which he can write quite well, of course. But most important for me, there's an element of suspense that I don't usually find in his books. It was the suspense that grabbed me and held me, and the love story unfolded nicely. In this one, he also created a credible and nuanced villain.<br /><br />I'd decided to read it after I'd seen the movie, and, as usual when comparing the book to the movie, the book is by far superior.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|A fun, uplifting movie.  Poignant at times, but light-hearted and joyful. The hubby and I both enjoyed it, and laughed out loud over and over.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|I like this game but fifteen minutes is NOT enough they really should make it longer but it's still a great game
B00G4I0DNG|4.0|&#34;Blackfish&#34; is an attempt to bring awareness to the inhumanity of keeping Orcas in captivity for the sake of display to humans.  Personally, it wouldn't take much to persuade me, but I do still believe this documentary would have been better with more facts and objective data.  That isn't to say that there seems to be any credible counterargument that I've heard elsewhere which isn't brought up here, but I would have appreciated the addition of such statistics as normal whale roaming ranges and such that I've heard elsewhere into this film.  As it stands, the documentary is mostly an emotional one, though there isn't anything much more convincing than the trainers' own opinions.  The film progresses very well, and is never dull.  It's a little graphic, as whale attacks are shown, as well as the results of whale on whale aggression, but is otherwise a clean film, and a great idea for animal lovers.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|My daughter & I listen to this and sing along all the time! We love the soundtrack! A must buy!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play Solitaire all the time.  I simply love it for what it is, relaxing and I can loose myself in it.
B0085OEU1I|5.0|Great acting, great acting, great acting, different, I loved to hear johnny sing. We all kinda knew that he could.
B009XHAM8G|1.0|This is a picture book where you look at the picture as you read to the child. You can't do that here as they separate the picture from the words.
B000NGTJTY|5.0|I love this movie!!! One of my all time favorites! Lots of suspense and action. Plus it doesn't hurt to look at Leonardo DiCaprio.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is cool and a lot of fun. It is also somewhat addicting. Some levels are easy and some are hard.  But overall a great game.
B000I9S5VY|5.0|It made me happy. It was so funny! Johnny depp was amazing in it! As he always is. What a great cast!
B00G4SS24I|5.0|It's hard to find pop music with substance, but Ferreira has created an emotional and honest piece of work. It's gloomy, beautiful, and sometimes slightly psychedelic. Check it out!
B0084TWN9K|3.0|These stories just don't resonate with me.  I was kind of surprised that this is a collection of short stories of a Nobel Prize winner.
B007WEQ3K8|5.0|I am very pleased I added this app to my Kindle. I use it often and it helps keep my brain active.
B006ZEEHQS|5.0|Loved the story. Giovanni and johnny were great in this movie! Both are great spellbinding actors I could watch over and over.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Awesome show for people who can handle gore. The writing is really good the characters are amazing and the story's always leave you wanting more
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Love CCS, but hate having to pay so much.  It may only be 99&cent; at a time, but it adds up after awhile.  Still it's a fun game when you can play.
B009AMANBA|1.0|Simply Boring.  I only give \\"Lincoln\\" one star because the costumes and the cinematography were good.  The movie is grossly over-rated.  It might be good to watch before bedtime if one has insomnia.
B000JD1CEQ|5.0|Very well done. Thought provoking.. Scary in a weird sense, I could watch it over and over.  So many faces johnny has!
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Addictive and fascinating storyline. Episodes include all aspects of fringe science used to tell really unique stories. The acting is superb and the characters feel real.<br />The characters grown on you, there are some excellent actors in this series.<br />The Walter Bishop character is brilliant and the actor does a phenomenal job with this complex genius.<br />All the actors play their characters in differing universes, so they each are stretched playing slightly different aspects of the same person - brilliantly done, both acting and writing.<br />For anyone who loved Lost and is experiencing withdrawl symptoms, look no further this is for you.<br />Very satisfying on many levels, science, paranormal, romance and the interplay between the characters will keep you coming back for more.
B00BPDR3F6|3.0|Nice story, but the last few chapters drag on.  I would read other books in between and finally finished after a couple weeks.
1451666179|5.0|The quintessential manual for life! I love Allie's honest point of view as she slides, trudges and bursts through her cartoon life experiences.<br />There is a special place for people like Allie who can describe anything! Even the sound of a vacuum!<br />I love it!
B000I0XBNK|5.0|Love it! Never had a chance to see it when I was younger. Very good movie! Johnny depp is an amazing actor!
B00F8MIIKO|5.0|Stands on it's own and explains Mike and Sully's relationship.  Portrays the school marm as an uncaring dictator who doesn't understand trying.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|I have been reading Stephen King books for 40 years!  the book was good, but it did not have the Stephen King rhythm and narrative that can be found in his prior books.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This is the book form that is awesome, colorful and easily a collector's edition! I took pictures so people who buy it now understand it is the best version of Blu-ray with the cardboard and shiny outside covers. I purchased this along with Prometheus because the entire saga may end up being the subject of my psychology dissertation.
0385351399|5.0|The premise of Eggers' thought-provoking book is,  transparency is upon us.  Technology, specifically social media, will eliminate all lies, all secrets, all strife in the world.  Children will no longer be abducted, Congressmen will have no private converstations, all knowledge will be shared by all.  That's the idea behind The Circle.  You are either in the Circle or, well, there's really no choice to be outside of this most perfect form.  I don't belong to one, but I would recommend this novel for a book club.  The themes are timely and real.  Ask yourself this question: how much do you really want the world to know about you, then read the book.
B00DF92E7U|5.0|Kenny Wayne Shepard Stephen Stills wouldn't think it would work but you WILL be Surprised. Excellent Stephen sounds good as ever!
B00G32VYDG|3.0|It was okay. I could have saw in the theater. Kind of like MIB. Could watch again on regular TV.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Yet another book written not for the story, but for a screenplay.  Sure it's going to be a movie, but save it for the screen.  This trilogy deserved a better end than the rushed and muddled mess to which we are subjected.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Better than the first. I just don't like the casting of Zoe as Uhuru, but other than that, it was enjoyable.
B00006FDCJ|4.0|I purchased this for my husband. It is one of his favorite movies. I have watched it more than once and like it a lot. Who would dislike a prime Clint Eastwood western?
B000FA675C|5.0|I actually read the book prior to seeing the movie.  Excellent book.  Good Movie.  Every detail is painted thoroughly with words.
B007WTFWJ6|5.0|A fundamental book on different types of refactoring, clearly written. The content remains valid even for other languages and for future generations of programmers; each refactoring is accompanied with clear examples.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|Hey, the Matrix called. They want their storyline back.<br /><br />Also, a group of really bad teenie bopper fanfic authors called. They want their writing style back.<br /><br />This book was weaker than Christopher Reeve taking a muscle relaxer and chasing it down with Bud Lite.<br /><br />**SPOILERS**<br /><br />A'ight, so I was totally digging the first two books. Then this hot mess comes around, and hoooly hell. First of all, the \\"SURPRISE, your whole reality is a LIE, and lots of failed experiments came before you, and HAY LOOK, a person who's glitch in the system might mess everything up!\\" = I liked this story better the first time I heard it when it starred Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne. And can we say \\"Holy info dump, Batman!\\" Yikes.<br /><br />Now let's talk about the alternating perspectives. Or better yet, let's talk about how there was no difference AT ALL in Tris's and Four's voices. Like, none. Sure, the characters have a lot in common, but they're not brain twins. I seriously kept forgetting who was narrating each chapter because their \\"voices\\" were just that similar. Lazy, sloppy writing on this front, for sure. And I say this as someone who LOVES reading books with alternating perspectives. It's one of my favorite  narration styles! But this just did it so poorly it was downright distracting.<br /><br />Next up: Characterization. Or more accurately, lack thereof. I was NOT buying Evelyn at all. She just seemed like a super cartoonish Scooby Doo villain, going from this uber mega dictator of doom, hellbent on ruling the world as she knew it, to being magically cured of her evil ways by...what? A hug? FAIL. Nita was flatter than a cup of warm Coke-a-Cola, we got nearly no insight into Caleb's mind at all, and Marcus had so much potential to finish off as either an incredibly dynamic villain or an extremely complex, morally ambiguous pseudo-protagonist (depending on how his character developed), but as it turned out, all his character did was fizzle, resulting in yet another dropped ball from the author.<br /><br />And to wrap it all up, we have an excellent demonstration of \\"how NOT to kill off a main character.\\" Okay, I get it. War leads to pointless deaths. Just the same, this ending was downright unsatisfying. It seemed like there wasn't nearly enough air time given to the death itself or the aftermath of it, and having it come at the end of a really weak-ass book that didn't hold a candle to the first two made it seem less like a heroic sacrifice and more like killing off a main character just for the hell of it - which translates to an epic downer that frustrates the reader.<br /><br />This book did keep me turning the pages, and I blew through it in two days, so I'll give it that at least. However, a lot of that page-turning was simply momentum built up from the first two books.

1433502410|5.0|Great study Bible with beautiful coloured maps and illustrations.  Very reasonable cost for such a great value.  Shipping was fast.  Nothing bad to say about this purchase.
B008E6I1K8|5.0|Absolutely Fantastic. I did C# programming almost exclusively up until 2010, then switched to Java/C++. Now, needing to quickly brush up on my C#, I needed something both comprehensive and concise that contains all the new stuff for this rapidly-evolving language.<br /><br />This fits the bill perfectly. All the basics are there including many advanced topics that would often require a separate reference. It's up-to-date and best of all: it is CONCISE. There is no waffle, there is no nonsense, and no beating around the bush. It's the information you want and need and no more. Excellent job!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|i love that i can make  notes, see them like virtual post its and edit from any device, anywhere i am,  offline or on. great simple app for teachers to keep track of the bajillion things to do, say and think. i write notes  while walking class to lunch etc, no more getting to the end of  the day and drawing a blank only to panic when  it all starts coming  back at 6am
B000SEFDP0|5.0|Helps to read &#34;United States of Paranoia&#34; first. This book is a classic. It reminds me of later hitchhiker's guide books. Have fun.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great story, very weird turn of events. I couldn't put it down. It almost makes me think somewhat about karma.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|Great if you need a quick edge on your knife but I'd recommend spending the money elsewhere if you're looking for something to really put an edge on your knives at home.
B00F880BWG|5.0|It's awesome with great story and great characters although this episode was a little slow I'm glad about the whole carol thing though
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|I never get scared watching movies anymore, but I was freaked out while watching this in the dark at night. The lack of CGI and use of old school scares really makes this more believable and scary. A must have for any horror fan that likes an Amityville Horror type of movie.
B007WOFXB8|1.0|I did my homework and own the Tres and Fandango w/bonus. The rest of this is a real horror. Even if you don't much care for ZZ Top, you have to read what is going on with their material to believe this could possibly be true. What is on this band's mind?
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Great show it's wroth the time to check it out. a bunch a bad dudes just ripping up the streets and trying to keep the club alive.
B00G2SIW7M|4.0|A much more varied enterprise than The Suburbs, but the divergent sounds play well together. Personal favorites would be &#34;Here Comes the Night Time&#34;, &#34;Normal Person&#34;, and &#34;Joan of Arc&#34;, but the entire album is enjoyable, if a bit messy and loose in spots. If you have enjoyed Arcade Fire's previous efforts, you will enjoy Reflektor - just make sure you give it two or three listens before settling on an opinion.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|very good, would recommend to anyone, very interesting game, good competition, cant wait for next one, cant put it down
B0053TMP24|5.0|Love these books!  Love the whole series, both the Percy Jackson series and the Heros of Olympus!!  What great reads!
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|This is one of the Best Rock Albums I own! Stryper has stepped up to the plate and hit a home run with this record. Michael Sweet and Oz Fox share some awesome solo work on the guitars, Timothy Gaines brings the bottom end with thunder and Robert Sweet keeps it kickin' throughout the whole mix. By far, the greatest Stryper Album to date!!! Get a copy today!
B0094MFITS|5.0|The Jesse Stone series is excellent. Tom Selleck is awesome as usual.He brings so much realism to his flawed character.
B00C7O8MJ8|4.0|Of course the music is beautiful and polished, but a little choppy.  Really more of collectible score music, not as great for stand alone listening.
B000TGJ8F8|1.0|We did not buy this movie.  There is something wrong with our records.  We buy classics and comedies that are easy for old people to follow.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Glad to have this for kindle fire! I've played on my iPhone but I like it on the Kindle with the big screen!
B00571F26Y|5.0|I was fascinated by the in-depth analysis of how the wheat was genetically altered over time and that we are eating an entirely different product today than in the 1st century. It makes more sense about gluten-free foods and the harm the gluten proteins of today can do to the body throughout every body system. Thank you Dr. Davis for your persistence in searching for the truth.
B00G32OMF8|5.0|This entire series is fabulous... leaves me wanting for more, more, more every time.  My fingers are crossed that there will be a fourth.
B000E5KJFC|1.0|This is another movie that we did not buy.  My husband dislikes John Travolta movies.  I like them, but I would not bring in something that he wants no part of.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|interesting so far. I enjoyed the first samurai vs zombie game so this is a treat! so excited to continue playing.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Well done show. You'll become addicted from the first show. I recommended watching season one and two if you haven't yet
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|What a great collection of books.  I couldn't put my iPad down and I don't think I've ever run the battery down so much.  The books are very well written and depict a great story that puts the reader there in the action.  I'm not much of a book to movie sort of person but I must say I'm looking forward to see how the movies will attempt to tell the story!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This came can make time go by fast. This is a really cool puzzle game and strategy game. If you have not heard of it you don't know electronics. GET IT!!!!!-
B008Y6SLL2|1.0|very slow in developing. a little interesting in seeing what couold have occurred behind the scenes on Wall St. at the time of the financial crisis in 2008. not interesting enough to make watching the movie worthwhile. anyone who likes this movie probably enjoys watching grass grow.
B000I55YV2|3.0|Okay-good scenes, but it feels like the &#34;good&#34; actors in the film are mailing it in.  Charlize Theron, Donald Sutherland, and Edward Norton probably being the most critically acclaimed of the cast, all certainly have some weak/insincere moments,  Some of the dialogue is cute, but not natural for the actor saying it at the time (though some of these are not known as &#34;good actors&#34; and I am sure it was the best THEY could do-felt like some lines could have been re-written to fit in better with one's skill set.  Overall, decent action/plot for a non-realistic heist film.  Just not one of the best.
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|This is another excellent story in the field of teenage life.  The story was well done and the art work was very good.  The characters' expressions did well to convey the emotions for the kids.  If you enjoy the stories of teenage &#34;growing up&#34; anime, this one is first rate.
B00E9A656K|5.0|As a daily player on CMDR I always thought it was a pretty lame game but was the best racing app offered UNTIL 3 days ago I found CSR .  I quickly proceeded to delete CMDR as I will no longer be playing that wack a** game!!  Street Racing at its best can only be found by downloading this app. That is all. I said Good Day!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is an incredible series. I originally bought it, as it is one of my granddaughter's favorites, and we are all going out of town during the Thanksgiving Holiday week. I had not seen the movie, and once I read the first book, I immediately saw the movie on Netflix. Just wonderful and the casting was great. I am now finishing up the second book, as while we are out of town, I plan to go with my granddaughter to see the second movie, which comes out before Thanksgiving. These books will grip you, and even though they focus on the teenage stars of the book, it's a book about how things are going in our country, and how if we don't do something, we will end up like this into the future world. These kids are true fighters (and are good people), which reminds us what we need to be to save our country.
B00ESY77LO|3.0|This is not baz luhrman's best movie but still it's a great film. Visually stunning. Leonardo Dicaprio is good as is Toby Maguire. I think the weak link is definitely Carey Mulligan
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Outstanding way for people to prove to themselves that their thought IS causative and creates all that they experience. Based on proven science and written in a delightful and easy to understand format. Highly recommend!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I liked the book. It's written from a secular perspective as opposed to a religious one. It was interesting how he found God in the whole experience. Being a Christian, myself, I liked Heaven is For Real better. It's from a 4 year olds eyes. Both of the books were interesting enough that I could barely put them down; and I looked forward to reading them every chance I got.
B008CPZNL6|4.0|I really like the news and automotive section. It is very informative and up to date with the latest in new cars
B00915G6SU|5.0|This is an incredible series. 8 seasons in and the stories are still fresh and original. Great acting as well.
B00902AKK4|4.0|This app I have been looking for a long time my grandmother has had it on her iPad since it has came out amazing app for teens and children EVEN BETTER it's a FAOTD!
B005SCSL56|5.0|A terrific book I log  it from cover to cover! Great book for a kid to read. An amazing journey
B000YDCFRE|5.0|I read all the reviews from people saying order a full size smaller but decided to go a half size smaller instead and I'm glad I did.  It's a comfort issue with me.  My feet have room but are not swimming around in my boots.  I also wear thicker than normal socks in the cold weather months (just the weather these boots are made for) so I feel like I have the perfect size, and did I say they were comfortable.  Were it not for the fashion police I could very easily wear these everyday (thinks maybe I'll get them in another color...)
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This is a very intriguing story.  I was captured by the possibility<br />of a life beyond this one and found Dr. Alexander's accounts<br />of his personal experience very interesting.  My father had an<br />out-of-body experience when he had his first open heart surgery but never<br />shared much about the experience beyond telling of seeing his own body laying on the table<br />with his chest open.  He did tell my mother a few other aspects of his experience but<br />at the time (1972) there was little credit payed to the experience by medical practitioners so he kept<br />pretty quiet about it.  This story makes me think about him and what he really must have gone through.<br />I found this book to be a great catalyst for opening the mind to the possibility that there may really be a heaven.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|i paid more for much less than this game. worth every penny. smart, sophisticated,  and beautiful graphics, loved every moment of it...waiting for the room 2....
B0013ND30M|5.0|The movie was in perfect condition and still in the original package.  I ordered this for my daughter's 5th birthday. She will love it!
B00F91SCXC|3.0|I personally prefer Contagion-style mass viral outbreak storylines so I came away from this movie disappointed. However, if you want an action-oriented pandemic movie then you'll probably enjoy World War Z. Brad Pitt does a good job of playing the Superman lone-ranger who manages to save the day by the skin of his teeth no thanks to questionable decision-making by those in positions of influence. In the end the story really falls flat and I just threw up my arms and said \\"huh...that sure was a movie.\\"
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a very good and exciting game !  Realty  keeps your interest up.  You just can't wait  for the next  problem to solve. I love it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!! This game is so addictive, I play it on my KIndle and when I run out of lives, I switch to my pod. Can't get enough.
B005EI86JU|4.0|The content of this book is useful to master the D7000.<br />The eBook-format makes is a compact and easy to use handbook to carry with you.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Very well written, great story. Loved the way it was tied together. As good as both previous books. Good read
B003BW0CB6|5.0|Great book. Very intriguing. Could not hardly put this one down. One of Michael Connelly's best. Great character development in this book.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Cloud Atlas is a collection of loosely connected stories with a common theme. It's construction is very unusual as each story is split into two parts, widely separated.  The language is brilliant, the references and inferences compelling, and the characters diverse.  That said, it was often challenging to find the thread that connected the stories, and sometimes hard to understand the actual events.  Overall, I enjoyed it.
B003U53GK8|5.0|It's the end! You can have your life back now. It's been a long, crazy trip, but it's over and it was worth it.
B004047XXO|1.0|This is not a blue ray 3d movie. It comes with the old red and blue glasses which are poor quality. My 3d glasses that work with my tv do not work with this movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game this is how to update on kindle I have one go to store search minecraft and click update I did it and for all games to
B006S009IY|5.0|A very touching and heartfelt story.  Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet shine.  Great chemistry. Fully enjoyed it. Would highly recommend.
1451666179|5.0|Nobody in my office will give this back to me.  We haven't put it down since it arrived!  It has a great mix of new and favorite stories.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Awesome movie. Would tell my friends to buy this one. Graphics are great. 3D is outstanding good picture and real clear
B000NVIXFK|5.0|I love these guys!<br />Because They RULE! 3rd favorite album, perfect guitart and song structure. I believe this to be perfect prog for Rush Fans.
B00881VLCE|1.0|Uninstalled this app after 5 minutes. I got so frustrated trying to drag the pieces out. I would drag one but a different one would come out or none would come out! Not worth the frustration even for a free app
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|Exactly what was advertised. Giant robots and monsters.  What is not to like.  If you want Citizen Kane recommend looking elsewhere.
B001MM28JG|5.0|This movie is great fun. Its good for both groups and watching it by yourself. Its a classic. Every character is great too funny.
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|I love this book because it feels like I am in the book with Alex and Connor I am excited for the next book.
B00114RKT8|5.0|One of our favorite movies. It's well done with political humor, a touch of romance, gut-wrenching truths, and best of all - with Amazing Grace.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Great read.Ordered for my daughter for a school project,and she really enjoyed it.Would gladly order again,there's something special still of reading a good book,it's a shame so many miss this experience!!
B0080R3PSE|4.0|so far so good, My OB says that this is the most successful method for woman who go naturally. I'm hopeful since I'm due in 4 weeks.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Lou is in her mid-twenties, has never moved out of her parents house and is stuck in a rut in her small England village. Her own view of her life's possibilities is narrow and only becomes smaller when she loses her job as a waitress at a local cafe. Lou mourns the loss of a job that she enjoyed and finds herself on a employment hunt with little education or skills.<br /><br />Lou's whole life changes when she takes on a job as a companion to Will, a thirty-six year old paraplegic, who comes from a wealthy family that owns the castle in Lou's hometown. Will is a former jet-setting CEO, who's lifestyle was shattered when he was hit by a car.<br /><br />Will is counting down the days until he can head to Switzerland to commit assisted suicide. He has made a pact with his parents to wait six months in case he changes his mind and his parents have hired Lou in hopes that she can help him discover his will to live.  As Will and Lou develop a friendship, it becomes clear that Lou's life is the one in desperate need of saving.<br /><br />Jojo Moyes' novel, Me Before You, is a bit sneaky. The emotional punch creeps up on you. Overall, I found the plot to be very predictable, yet even when I could predict what was coming, I still felt left a little raw with the emotions. I connected with the characters on a deeper level than I realized while I reading the book. I felt for all of them<br /><br />The story is mostly told from Lou's perspective. However, Moyes does a nice thing where she writes few chapters from the perspective of other characters. This was very clever, as it was easy to be heavily judgmental towards those characters, yet when I got into their minds, I felt more compassion towards them. There is very much a theme of judgment and learning to show compassion towards others.<br /><br />Occasionally, I felt a disconnect from the story, usually when Lou's family crept in. I felt like Lou was becoming a bit of a punching bag. It felt overbearing. However, the more that I read the book, the more realistic her family became. I started recognizing traits that Lou's family shared with my own family, which was probably what created my disconnect in the first place. It hit close to home.<br /><br />The biggest reason that the story works is that I found myself really rooting for the characters. They are stuck with impossible choices and I just want the outcome to be the best possible scenario. I read through it quickly just to find out how it was going to end.<br /><br />This story has a lot of heart and compassion. ​I finished it yesterday morning and it has lingered with me. The best stories are those that make an impact and this one is definitely impactful.<br /><br />Like my review? Check out my blog!
B00GBCMW9S|5.0|This is one of Eminent greatest works yet ! The beats are amazing that's is why this man is such a lyrical genius. Don't think twice about ordering this album it's truly amazing
B0076DCT2G|1.0|The book contains over 600 pages of Corey's wisecracks. There is nothing else to reccommend. Absolutely nothing occurs for 350 pages. Don't waste your time.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|did not work with uverse cable box.  useless for me, freebie for the guy who spent 2 hours trying to figure out a work around. bleeding edge of technology :&(
B0042TV4IW|4.0|Really enjoyed this  series.  Drawn in right from the first  episode. Looking forward to another season. Very good for whole family
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Excellent and fun movie!! Recommended to me by my 14 year old nephew....so a great movie for your teens also.
B008XBCJ34|1.0|Delivered as promised. Right on time. Exactly what i expexted. Awesome in 3D. Thank you
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's very fun and exciting to play.  It keeps you mind and eyes moving have to figure moves before you make them, addicting!!!!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I admire Adam Brown not just for his heroics on the battlefield, but that he requested this book be honest and include his struggle with addiction. Worth the read.
B00D8CSVLW|5.0|Could not stop reading, now I have to make up for the hours lost at work! Congrats, John Grisham. Keep them coming.
0316044695|5.0|Great Book!!!!!  Highly recommend it.  Amazing what are personnel in the military are capable of.  God Bless America.  Thank you!!!!!!
B004T4LUPW|1.0|Complete and total waste of my money.  I have read this was a good app for syncing with google, but I did not think it was user friendly at all.  I could not recommend it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Classic King, loved it. I actually had to put it down it scared me. I was in a classroom, as a guest, and I started reading it. I was so absorbed, I mentally left the room. I love Stephen King and I LOVED Doctor Sleep.
0140564349|5.0|This is one of our favorite stories. My two-year old makes me read it nearly every day at naptime. The illustrations are just beautiful and the story is just darling. This is a classic!
B001TH16DI|5.0|This was the best  of the Star Trek Series. The movies were great. A must have for any Trekkie. Even if you're not a Trekkie, the movies were great.
B008ZVJE3A|4.0|The Mother of all Metal videos.  The best there ever was, is, and ever will be.  Spinal Tap Rules Forever.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved it! The digital book worked great with my kindle app on my smartphone. It was a great read.
0920236162|5.0|This is a hilarious book. I just love the ending because it isn't exactly what you would expect from generic fairy tales but it is far more realistic to how children would react.
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|I bought this based on its sleek good looks and user ratings.  I just bought a super beautiful Acer S7 and I need a USB lan adaptor for a business trip.  I was a bit nervous buying a completely new brand and new product, but it worked great.
B00CDSIMI4|5.0|Great track worth it spooge onions baby great sounds good ambiance like a pig and a bat two dogs and a cat monkey cum
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I read copiously and cannot bring myself to denigrate anone willing to expose their psyche the way writers do.  I have tried and know the pain!  I am also remiss in my praise, but this book is special.  It has impact, depth, humour, pathos and technical appeal.  I loved every minute of it, and rate it superb as a read for anyone, not just tech-heads or scifi geeks.  I believe Andy Weir was actually marooned on Mars..... :-)
B00BV0FK58|5.0|As a soldier, military wife, military mother, etc...I found this book to be very beneficial.  It helps explain some of the processes that reintegration goes through.  Doctor Chapman also uses some of his real life military families to explain their issues and how they dealt with them.  It helps you understand how your partners needs as well as your own.  It is a wonderful book.
B00FGJNS72|1.0|Overall functionality is just OK, not as good as Docs To Go. Very sad, though, that despite references online to Polaris supporting Google Docs and Drive, this version does not. Polaris should provide more information about this app in Details. It does tie in with Box and Dropbox but clunkily.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I'm not a violent person at all. actually I think this game is the bbbeeeeessssst game I have on my kindle. I play it for what seems like five muns when really 45 mind have passed.  I love it so much!!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Best book that I have read in a long time and con wait to buy the next book and then the next and the next after that.
B006T5C5PS|4.0|This is an eye opening book.  If I ever get cancer I would try the diets and relevant material in this book.  I believe it was worth the price just to read it and have it around.  I am amazed at the cancer cures that have been around for years and years and pushed under wraps by the AMA and the FDA in order to protect profits.
B00ESNDQWY|5.0|A well crafted script, well acted, and a complimentary cast that sizzles.  Every regular cast member contributes to the success.  This show is well worth watching
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally got to play this on my kindle and just love it. It really lived up to the hype. Wish had 10 lives though.
B004PYWRQC|5.0|Johnny Depp was really good st keeping you drawen into the movie. This movie kept you in supense and had a lot of surprises.
B007AJFSJW|5.0|This was a great non-math explanation of macroeconomics. A must read for everyone who wants a better understanding of the current state of the world, and the policies needed to make things better for us all.
B008RF0M9O|3.0|Shoulda waited until I got to the office and checked out my headphones before ordering these replacement pads. I was thinking I had a pair of MDR-V6's there, but they were MDR-V600's instead. These pads won't fit V600's no way no how. Can't give them a glowing recommendation since I can't try them mounting on V6's, and it wouldn't be fair to give them a 1-star rating since they don't claim to fit V600's. So this middling rating-- the material on the pads doesn't feel as heavy as the Sony factory pads, and the &#34;apron&#34; that would mount the pads to the headphones seems a bit skimpy. But hey, you can't beat the price.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The numbers are large which reduces &#34;fat-finger&#34; errors. I mainly love the convenience of not having to look for a calculator!
B0036S4B6M|1.0|I was barely able to get through 40% of this book when I finally decided to \\"skip\\" 20 pages at a time only to read another one or two pages of the same boring blah blah  traveling from one prison to another. Clearly the only thing this Smith graduate was capable of, was showing how uneven the sentencing is between criminals with money and a good lawyer and criminals who were less financially capable. (I think we know that already)  Additionally, there is a unnerving disconnect  with regards to \\"correctional\\" facility when the jailers care less about the inmates. All prisons housing inmates should have basic consistent standards for guards, food, health & education.  This book really didn't give us anything new.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|My sons and daughter all love this movie even after they have grown older.  A very nice story. It is a beautiful soundtrack also.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This contains spoilers:<br />After the low ratings, I'll admit, I was nervous to read Allegiant.  I loved Divergent and Insurgent.  And I love Allegiant.  I liked that Four had a voice in this book.  For those reviewers who didn't like Four in Allegiant, remember that you only knew Four from Tris' perspective in the first 2 books.  Allegiant gives an idea about who Four really was - complex, a whole person with struggles.  As for the ending, I wish that Tris had survived.  I love a happy ending and I think that the point of the story could have been made while keeping Tris alive!  But I understand WHY she died.  She made the ultimate sacrifice for her brother, and as a result demonstrated true forgiveness and real selflessness (because, lets face it, as much as I love her character, she could be pretty selfish and angry at times).  Allegiant was more cerebral, less action, which was a good thing, in my opinion.  The whole trilogy (whether you like the last book, the ending or not) tackles some weighty issues, and I have found myself thinking about these books long after I have closed them.  For that reason, I am giving 5 stars and look forward to more books by Veronica Roth.
B0071MV540|4.0|Entertaining. Combines a caper and revenge theme with some comic moments and a few unusual twists. Not the greatest flic of all time but entertaining
B009XIXVU6|2.0|Hard to follow.  Took several pages into a chapter to determine who the story was about and where it was taking place.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Charming and delightful characters, also devious and cunning.  Anxious for the new season, even though it means everyone, including me, is a year older.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|This movie was a crackup from start to finish.<br />Tarantino made another enjoyable movie.<br />Stoners gotta blaze before watching.<br />A+
B000FA5STS|5.0|This book is well-written and the events are presented in such a manner that the reader can follow and understand before moving on.  The element of surprise is on every page, and I can hardly wait to get home so I can begin reading again. I love David Baldacci's books, but I think this one is my very favorite.
B0091QS88K|2.0|My son loves this games but after playing it once or twice it won't load again.  I have to delete it and redownload it for it to load again.
B005LAII3U|3.0|Kind of wish I rented before I purchased it.<br />I say this cause I am a huge fan of the original.<br />It held up in some points but flopped in other areas .<br />I recommend renting before buying!
B00902AKK4|5.0|I had a blast playing this game. There are loads of unique levels and tons of achievements to earn. Game play was smooth and puzzles really made you think, especially as the game progressed.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Love this album! Enough variety of songs but doesn't get too 'different'. Myself and my 8 month old like to listen to this.
B00E8S2JZ4|1.0|If I knew there was going to be an extended edition, I WOULD NOT HAVE WASTED MY FRIGGIN MONEY BUYING THE STANDARD EDITION!!!!! AND WAITED FOR THIS EDITION.
B00EY7LT9Q|5.0|I'm a fan of Marvel Comics and use to read Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. on growing up (Fury was white back then but I don't have a problem with the current character as long as it's done right). This show has been very good to watch and I went and got a TV pass for buying the episodes as they come out (far cheaper). The stories and the characters are very good.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|What an intriguing book!  I am loving it and I even bought another book to check accuracy and yup, it's accurate  :)
B00D7NWTSI|5.0|Its a sleigh ride! I think this one was much better than number 2. I was never much of a Robert Downey fan, but he certainly delivers a great performance.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game. Love that it's on my kindle now, so I can play anywhere, anytime.  It's catching on all over.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The personalities, clothing and settings in this series are extraordinary! This teaches about the times in a way that infiltrates the mind.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I can't help it, I am and forever will be a Trekkie. Who ever it is that brought these folks together to bring us, once again, the crew of the USS Enterprise is a genius! There is enough of a shift in the story to make it fresh and enough of it remaining steady to bring back us Kirk fans! Yes!!!
B000S1M9LY|1.0|After finishing this book, I find its positive reputation curious. It is a long novel but I didn't think it was particularly dense or challenging. There were some involving passages about addiction and the teen tennis angle was something I thought could have made a great 300 page work as the strain and focus described was new to my experience.<br /><br />To get there however, you have to wade through 700 pages of clumsy sci-fi and the kind of smarty pants absurdist nonsense you'd expect from a precocious middle schooler (wheelchair assassins, herds of feral hamsters). From my perspective, Foster Wallace is not the kind of writer who will be remembered for his future vision. Much of the world he imagines is laughably dated even down to his incessant brand name checking. As a 90's artifact, it might appeal to the nostalgic but I never felt like he illuminated anything lasting for me.<br /><br />As a final point, I would note that this book contains the most cringe worthy attempt to capture the black American vernacular by a white author since James Bond eavesdropped in a Harlem speakeasy.  The  &#34;Wardine be cry&#34; section is so awful and stilted that even though the book is almost two decades old, it is hard to believe that any editor let it be published with that passage intact. It does pretty much sum up the level of discovery for any character who isn't a white male in this book as they tend to be translucent stereotypes.<br /><br />My recommendation would be to ignore those who pretend that there is something more here than there really is and find another book.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|These books makes every girl want a Christian Grey all for themselves!!! (Definitely like the kinky but I would  not want the punishments)
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|game keeps stalling and costs too much to play if you do not want to wait forever to move on.
B008602KQI|5.0|Excellent movie, story line and choice for the cast!!  Can't wait for the 2nd movie to come out this month!
006202406X|1.0|I felt empty as soon as I read the last word of the series. The author built such a climax with Divergent and Insurgent, and to kill off the main character after she went through so much. I felt she deserved a happy ending. Again, very disappointing.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Well written. Not what I expected. The characters were well developed and made you think about the life of a foster child
1455523550|2.0|SPOILER - i had not read a NS book in a while. This book was okay although very unrealistic. I really didn't like that Jo turned out to be a ghost. Really?
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really liked the book. It seem to start as the typical married in Vegas plot but it actually turned out to be really good....I'd Dec. Read a sequel to this!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I absolutely love this game!! The struggle I'm having is I'm having a lot of freeze up moments and then my game disconnects. It doesn't happen to any other game but one. I am also having several glitch problems...can someone tell me what may fix the problem?
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This app works good and is very easy to use for those who may not have the time to &quot;learn&quot; the How To that others require. It serves it purpose and is free; therefore, a 5 star rating is deserved.
1596590440|5.0|Excellent read.  It is really helping in my transition.  I recommended it to my sister in law and she enjoyed the information also
B00BD99JMW|4.0|So sad to see tris go...<br /><br />Not quite as action packed as the rest but a nice wrap up to the series.
B00F0AI9Y4|5.0|I could not pass this album up when I saw that Amazon had it on sale for $3.99.  This is only the second EDM album that I have bought in my life.  The first one I ever purchased was \\"Clarity\\" deluxe version by Zedd  (again I lucked out cause Amazon had that album on sale too).  \\"True\\" is a wonderful album.  I love country/folk/soul influences in music AND music that is catchy, so this album is perfect for me.  My favorite track is \\"Hey Brother.\\"  I am so glad that Avicii is doing something unique.  I will definitely be paying attention to EDM from now on; indeed, I started checking out EDM because most music on the regular pop charts is terribly uncreative and bland.
B004YXE438|4.0|Love that I can use my own photos to create puzzles. I like that you can choose the level of difficulty and how many pieces. Play for hours on end, very addicting!!!!
0810995522|5.0|I got this book for my 51/2 yr old son, couple of months ago he started reading Diary of Wimpy Kid at Costco (whenever we go for shopping he will grab a book then gets busy reading that makes my shopping easy). He love books, while reading Wimpy Kid book he laugh so hard that sometime people look at him, I don't know what they think of him, but he enjoyed reading those books a lot for sure. So I decided to buy one to give him a surprise and bought Rodrick Rules. He was so excite that he finished whole book in 4 days, he could not wait to read the book after coming back from school. It's really interesting book, I also read some of it, I wish had time, but my son told me the story and made me laugh that's soooo sweet. I really think this  book is good for anybody no age boundary, it's full of fun and nice cartoons makes it so lovable. It will definitely makes you laugh :)He still reads whenever he think of some part of the book, best part is he always shares the story with me and laugh. :)
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was the first book I read by Gillian Flynn and I was intrigued. She had a great way of keeping me interested by the  twists and turns throughout.  I felt like I could actually get in the minds of these devious characters and the ending didn't let the reader down. I liked it so much that I purchased another book by her...will have to see if she does the same with this one!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This is a great series.  The acting is superb and the episodes keep me rivited to the screen.  Haven't watched anything I enjoyed more since Brothers and Sisters.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|couldnt put it down .<br />although it reminded me of a fanfiction<br />I could see why so many raved about it
0743297334|2.0|they get on a train to spain and you're just like &#34;i don't really want to hang out with these people anymore.&#34;
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I really like this game! The only bad thing was that the lives run out and I still want to play.
B00CA6WLAE|4.0|The book was very good.  I couldn't put it down until it was finished. I can't wait to read the next book.<br />Aiden, age 8
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|me and my son enjoy playing candy crush it to them best game ever and it helps with the mind
B004LWZW42|5.0|I love this movie.  It's a geek-a-rrific paradise romp through Dr. Xavier's school formation and the X-Men's beginnings.  All around fun.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This book is so compelling that before I got to the ending I reread the story from the beginning.One of his finest works to date
B00FVFT7YO|5.0|Affirmations are firm and need to be handled delicately. The book has got everything you need about how an individual can learn to build positive affirmation, instances that can help you efficiently and at ease. The author has the process outlined  with a substance of different outcomes.The book is surely worth buying
B0073PZIYI|5.0|This movie was a lot of fun.  I watched it with my teenage son and we enjoyed the sci-fi mind-bending elements - AND - the romantic scenes were tame enough so that we didn't have that weird mom/teen discomfort thing going on that happens when you find yourself unexpectedly watching something graphic with your kids (and they're too old to cover their eyes, but not old enough that you feel ok watching together)
B0083P1QUM|3.0|This was an entertaining read but I got the sense that I had read it before.  There was a certain sameness to the plot, the characters and the inevitable outcome.
B00EJX2YGM|5.0|Really excited about this one, there's a lot I love about this but I really love the digital copy's of it
B00FX8EY60|3.0|My daughter says &#34;3 because some of the songs are meh.&#34; I am ok with the album. Some song are good and some are even a little different.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Child makes enough twists and turns in the plot to give the reader whiplash while consistently and rapidly moving the story forward.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|my opinion is that the people who made this game rocks. and I hope to buy more.  and I give my gratitude to the makers
B00992CF6W|4.0|I was playing on my survival world I have been working on for a long period of<br />time. All the sudden, when I start to type something on a sign for my pet cow Jester, I couldn't type at all. My kindle fire immediately shut down on me. So then I turned my kindle back on and got on minecraft pe. I looked for my world on the list. My world had no name and turned into creative. That's right, my survival world turned into creative. But all in all, minecraft pe is still a great game to play.
B0017QSZW6|5.0|At first I thought this would be the same old Henry Viii story which I have seen many times. This program held my interest and I enjoyed my evenings with the tyrant and his unique selection of wives.  The be-headings were very well done and it gave me a new perspective on life at court back in those days.  Never thought about all the sex that was going on but I suppose they were no different than us.  Human beings are still the same.  Loved the regalia that was worn by the fine selection of actors.  They all played their parts, first class!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Not nearly as easy as the instructions suggested it would be. The Beta streaming feature was laggy and cumbersome. At a distance of about 15 feet with a wall separating the router from the computer, the Chromecast did not work at all.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I bought it 3 weeks ago, and I like it very much. I am not an English native speaker, so my language must look weird to you. First of all, the sound quality is very good, it precisely transmit every sound. In short, everything is CORRECT. Second, it is very comfortable to wear, I majorly used it on my computer at home, so the cord is not a problem. Remember, this particular product of SONY has existed for at least 20 years, the reason they keep producing it, Is because that it is really good.
B00GB7GX20|4.0|So after taking chances I kind of lost hope of getting Celine back into the current day limelight, not including the vegas spotlight. Don't get me wrong it was a good album but it was spotty. This Album however, Loved me back to life, did just that. Celine's best english album of the decade by far. I'm loving the beats that play amazingly with her vocal ability. She has a few slow jamz around the last half but nothing power ballad like the preceeding 90s albums. I really would have loved at least on but the duet with Ne-Yo \\"Incredible\\" comes very close.<br /><br />I was ellated to hear the new songs and realized that she got a better hold of her \\"new\\" style. In Taking Chances, which I rate a 3, Celine used alot of her long note holding ability which felt excessive on the rock type, edgy album. Here I feel like she found the balance between the edge and softness, using different notes and vocalities rather than the screatchy Janis Joplin notes of Taking Chances.<br /><br />Top Songs: Loved me Back to Life, Thank You, Breakaway, Overjoyed, Save Your Soul, Unfinished Song
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Wonderful app.  I would recommend it to everyone.  Keeps my kindle running smoothly and reminds me to clean my cache everyday.
B0081336FO|5.0|This is the most awesome show.  I hate there is not a season 3 to look forward to.  The stories are great and the characters are so spot on.  This show moves Sherlock into the 21st century seamlessly.  I recommend this show highly!
B001G70M6S|5.0|Better and cheaper than impossible project film... however, I guess it's apples and oranges.<br />I use this with a 1963 Land Camera. The film is new stock, there is one machine at the Fujifilm factory in Japan that is still churning this and the FP-100C color film.<br /><br />The film I've gotten has had 6 to 9 months before the expiration date, and all have been in perfect packaging.<br /><br />I prefer the black and white to the color film because the quality of the developed shots, and the 'negative' (of sorts) is easy to get a high quality scan from.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Excellent! It's nice to see a modern re-telling of this story. I will definately continue to watch this. Thanks again!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|great read and very engaging. clean and nothing i had to skip over. i liked that it was a little sci fi but not weird like aliens or vampires. im glad this is a trilogy bc it really pulls you in
B001BANK32|5.0|amazing!  beyond my expectations....can't wait to see the film finally and read the sequel.  I couldn't put it down once the hotel slowly took on a life of itself.  A true American horror story.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Like the author says... This is a work of fiction and more so than usual.  Great story all tied up with a pretty red bow.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|great game can not seem to put it down. well worth the money. keep them comlng. I told all my friends about this game.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|We all knew that with THAT many main characters, some would die. The end left me upset because I wanted a &#34;happy ever after&#34; and I didn't get it. Mr Sanderson has done an excellent job of finishing the the never-ending tale.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|FINALLY CANDY CRUSH ON KINDLE FIRE!!!!!THANK YOU AMAZON!!THIS APP IS GREAT FOR KIDS OF ANY AGE MY 14 LOVES IT AND SO DOES MY 3 YEAR OLD!!IT  EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND NEVER GETS BORING!!  : )
B008P1EWIM|4.0|This is a nice app to keep with tempatures where I live and where my friends live. As a bike rider it's nice to know the temperature for several days in advance. It needs to load faster.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like this game because it is really cool you get too jump roll have all kinds of cool powers and things too do and the cute costumes.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love this game. very addictive. great to play with facebook friends. highly recommend it. great deal too can't beat free
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|Should be required viewing for all 9th graders.  And then discussed.  It is a story that will stay with you until death.  And knowing that it is true  just makes it so much powerful.  The ending, where the Jews present Schindler with the ring has everyone in tears, and then seeing the actual people that were portrayed walking over the hill to lay a stone on Schindler's grave . . . well, what more is there to say.
B005LAII4E|4.0|Much better than the First movie!!!  Just to clarify, I enjoyed the first G.I.Joe moive, Rise of Cobra and I did like some of the action but the acting was not all that great.  The second movie was much more entertaining and my kids did enjoy watching this one more.  Bruce Willis and Dwyane Johnson are good adds in this movie.  Snake Eyes still rocks as a ninja!!!<br /><br />Shipping again on any Amazon item bought has always been first rate, and on time.  The Bluray was packed very well and on my door step the day it was released.  Thanks again Amazon.
B003QTUQGU|4.0|I truly enjoyed Alice in Wonderland for its artistry.  The scenery was so colorful, the acting by the main characters, particularly Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter was stupendous.  They really know how to turn a phrase, and H B-C is one of my all-time favorite actresses.  I can usually depend on her to do something I will want to see.  The animation of the fantasy characters was so well done - the Cheshire, the red knights, the caterpillar, etc.
B001KVZ6G6|4.0|My sons wanted to purchase this movie after they thought it was pretty good in the theater, I thought it was so-so, Disney/Pixar have produced some good shows and the quality on Bluray is outstanding,  great picture and great sound.  &#34;Up&#34; was okay and my kids watch it every now and then, I do like the dogs in this movie.  Shipping was on time and packed well as always!!!  If you want to purchase anything online, Amazon.com is the place to do it!!!!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|A bit different but who could dream up such descriptions?! Love Neil Gaiman!! Plus he has a superb sense of humor!!
B001CDLATE|4.0|I only bought this Bluray because of the reviews on the picture quality and when I opened this package on the day it was scheduled to arrive, which it did, I put it in and watched it and it is what I expected, great quality and clarity.  Very sharp and colorful.  If you are into documentaries and scenic shots of different parts of the world, this is a really cool item to watch
0060936223|5.0|I am not a fan of Patti's music, but everything I read of hers is stunning in its use of words and emotion to draw the reader in.  A national treasure.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|The second season is just as thrilling as the first, it will keep you wondering what is going to happen next. I love this show
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Awesome season and leaves you ready for the next one!!  Love the cds because they don't take up space on my iPad!
B0036S4C6G|4.0|Multiple prespectives on the impact of time on the lifes of a set of characters. Some really proving insights, and a very enjoyable style of writing.
B007FEZQF8|4.0|been watch the show from.the start and have been hooked and just started reading the comics and love them!<br /><br />awesome!
0525423842|2.0|Shouldn't someone say in the description or the reviews that this book was written for children?  If it was written for adults, then it is dumbed down to such a level that grown-ups should avoid it.
B0071R43MG|5.0|I'm a huge Satch fan and I really wish I could see one of his concert live here in Abu Dhabi! Audio and video is excellent. This is one great collection to all of you Satch fans out there! Thank you Amazon!
B004SIP9E2|5.0|This is the show that started off a kick ass funny horror movie series! This movie makes fun of all the cool movies that tried to scare you! Buy it people!
B009VL28W2|5.0|I am a big Metallica fan and all I can say is, this concert video was an excellent choice. An additional to my tallica collection! Audio and Video quality is superb. Great choice of venue too.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|Best Rock Album I have ever heard!  I love it!  Can't stop listening to it!  A must have!  Stryper is not only back, but they have put out the best rock album I have ever heard!
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|My life has changed by eliminating grains and spreading the word. This is the book that I give the skeptics.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|It's a better app than any others. No doubt. Put it into use on anything math. Much better than any other calculator apps.
B0051XSKSU|5.0|Ahhh its a classic! Love Po's character and Master Ugway! One of my faborites. The depth of the character, honesty and the authenticity reverberate throughtout the movie. Hope you enjoy it :)
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|It's fun but you have to buy coins. At the beginning it's easy too. And the pictures give you some answers.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|I was riveted- I was captivated.  A book about science, life, and family-  and how they interweave with each other.<br />This book reads like a family tree- dotted with love, loss, and the wonder of how we all fit our piece into the puzzle of the world.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Excellent reading, well put together. I would like to see the story keep going,very interesting reading and I highly recommend it
B004JN1D2I|4.0|Fast and fun read. If you like the show, you will love the book. The characters are even more developed and engaging.
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|As usual a finely wrtten story, well developed plot that stays in line with previous appearances of this character in the series. Does keep you guessing.
B00902AKK4|5.0|l usually bate platformers due to having to repeatedly run a lvl to finish it.  this game gets round that nuisance by having a rewind function so you can just go back to where you messed up to continue.  the graphics are cute. the expressions the bug makes are tu. to watch.  the best bit is the catchy jazzy music.  I usually play games muted but this one I leave on.  gamelpay is surprisingly complex puzzlers which I will enjoy figuring out.  no lag responses others have and I use 1st generation kindle.  I wonder if what they percieve as lag is really that if the bug has a ledge over him the jump motion will not execute till he clears it.  this will happen with even a sliver of ledge in the way.  this makes the jump left then jump right move very tricky to complete in order to scale multiple ledges.  the tutorial was fun to play.  a first for me.<br /><br />all in all a nice game
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Really enjoy playing this game it is fun and enjoyable but challenging. It's a great game for a family to all get involved with.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Keeps me engaged. I love it.<br />Hate waiting on lives! I can play this while watching TV, and it relaxes me.
076790592X|5.0|Tuesdays With Morrie is an amazing novel about the bond between a professor and his student. Mitch Albom was the student of Morrie Schwartz from over twenty years ago. Twenty years after attending Morrie’s class, Mitch heard that Morrie’s life was coming to an end and was going to be cut short. Mitch goes to visit Morrie and spends hours talking with him about the lessons that life has to offer. Every Tuesday Mitch goes to visit his sick professor for hours on end in his study. The story goes to prove many lessons that life has to offer and that no matter the age or the relationship, everyone leaves some sort of impact on one another’s life. I am not a huge reader but this book grabbed my attention so much that I finished the entire novel in one sitting. I would recommend this book to any person looking for an emotional and powerful story of a friendship and the impact people have on each other’s lives.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I learned a tremendous amount about Jesus the man and about what was going on in Israel during his life and after. I thought the writing was excellent.
B003LSTK8G|4.0|A Chilling incite into the reckless behavior on Wall Street that led to the 2008  financial  crisis. A must reading.
0792164903|5.0|This is one of my favorite Depp movies.  I do not typically purchase movies, but this one i watch every year during Halloween Season.
B00AVL23YE|3.0|At first worked fine. Now it continuously prompts  to update when there isn't an update. Also would br nice to have a lighter background or the ability to change background.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Well written<br />Disappointed in the ending, but any other ending wld have been too easy<br />Loving her other books as well
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Excellent movie! Great costumes, special effects, and moral values message. The only downside is the dark screen at the start of the movie. At first, I thought it was my equipment. However, it cleared up after about 20-minutes. Overall, great picture.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I bought this for our family reading time, and it quickly became a favorite of mine even though it is ostensibly for tweenagers.  There aren't enough books about kindness.  This book is of course about much more than kindness.  But it's the kindness that moved me to tears.  Highly recommend.
006202406X|1.0|Veronica Roth's Hunger Games wannabe trilogy simply falls apart in this final installment. Although the society she created in the first book was intriguing, it was clear that at some point she had to explain how it came about.  Unfortunately, the explanation she came up in this book with was totally implausible and boring to boot.  The Hunger Games finessed the question of how such an improbable future came about with non-stop action.  Here, though, the action is sporadic, leaving the reader lots of time to wonder why, for example, the international community would just stand by and watch the United States implode, without taking steps to intervene or take over.  The constant dithering on the part of the main characters and the random deaths of characters who have become more and more indistinguishable from one another don't help, either.  If you liked Divergent, quit while you're ahead.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|First time seeing this and watched it all in one day!  Love the way they made it into a series.  Enjoyed it more than the latest movie!
B0060ANP10|4.0|One of the greatest guitar players ever. If you like monster guitar playing,buy this album.If you like a great,mellow singing voice,don't bother.
B00F91H15W|5.0|This movie was not what I expected. It goes way beyond stealing, it explores the psyche of the teens. These kids are desperate wannabees. I enjoyed the movie and I would definitely watch it again.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Pam Grout's zany sense of humor and practical logic makes this a fun but enlightening read! The experiments are wholly doable and lend credence to what many term &#34;new age hooby-dooby-vodoo.&#34;<br /><br />Like most spiritual teachers however, she does not deny God or even Jesus, but opens the door of your mind to another way of viewing Him and the miracles He performed.<br /><br />&#34;Look through the the Bible and nowhere does Jesus say &#34;Worship Me.&#34; His call to us was &#34;follow me.&#34; There's a big difference.<br /><br />Wise, wise words.<br /><br />Unless my Kindle explodes this is one book that will forever be in my possession!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It works as Goodle said it would, magnificently. Since it is so new, look forward to it's being capable of streaming other applications from tablet to the big screen in the coming months as technology advances even more. George McLain, Salisbury, Maryland.
1569242739|5.0|I had previously owned this book and lost it, so I was thrilled to find it again on amazon. These cupcake recipes are delicious and real, and the cupcakes come out so wonderfully that nobody would guess they aren't made with &#34;traditional&#34; ingredients like milk and eggs. Anyone dabbling in vegan baking NEEDS to own this book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have enjoyed playing this game when im waiting for someone or before bed. Im not addicted to it like some people & dont want to be!
0446672653|5.0|This book's premise is one of the most profound concepts I've ever read about...and even more powerful because it is a true story as told by the doctor who encountered it. This book changed the way I view the idea of people crossing my path in this life.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|get time waster - - waiting at doctors office, for kids to get out of sports practice, or the need for a mind numbing activity
1476727651|5.0|The story was addictive and the price was right!  I'm a big SK fan and this book took the boy Dan (aka Doc) from The Shining and showed you where his life after The Overlook took him.

B00BWQW73E|3.0|As someone who has been in retail for 20 years, eCommerce for more than a decade, a fairly frequent Amazon shopper, and an expert in 3rd party marketplace sales, I eagerly read this book looking to better understand the man and myth that is Jeff Bezos and how Amazon came to be the force it is. In that regard, the book clearly delivers.<br /><br />Regarding the 'controversy' around the accuracy of several important aspects of the book, I'm not sure what or who to believe. I'm sure many of the various &#34;characters&#34; from the book will come forward in their own way and in their own time to state their case, so far better to leave those insights to them. With that said, I have no doubt that Stone made some factual errors. For instance, he indicated that Circuit City allowed Amazon to run their web store for a period at the start of the century, in the same way that Target and Toys&#34;R&#34;Us did. That's simply inaccurate. While Circuit City was an early &#34;marketplace&#34; seller on Amazon and even developed a way for customers to purchase from local stores via Amazon, at no time did CircuitCity.com reside on Amazon technology or using their fulfillment ops. It doesn't seem like it would take a host of researchers to validate a simple fact like that, an especially relevant fact, in my opinion, based on the argument he was making in that section of the book, too.<br /><br />Did the author help me learn more about how Bezos thinks and runs his company? Yes. Did he make me want to emulate Bezos? Sort of -- long-term thinking, a focus on the customer, insisting on hiring top performers, and a willingness to disrupt your own business are all worthwhile characteristics. A shockingly abusive attitude to people whom he seeks to lead? Not something worth emulating. Being brilliant doesn't necessarily mean you need to be a jerk. Being respectful also doesn't mean you are weak or dumb. The sheer number of examples of this poor behavior from a fairly decent group of individuals makes me believe Stone got this aspect of Bezos right.<br /><br />All in all, the book is worth a read to most people in the industry or to anyone who wants to learn more about the impact long-term, strategic focus can have on a business.iduals makes me believe Stone got this aspect of Bezos right.<br /><br />All in all, the book is worth a read to most people in the industry or to anyone who wants to learn more about the impact long-term, strategic focus can have on a business.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|-as you probably have figured out there aren't many fun games on the kindle fire I love that bloons tds are on here makes a book reading device have a great game too
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Very good book. I wish it were more than just what I consider a novella. It moved at a good pace and the story was gripping.
B00136RY6I|5.0|Great album. Pearl Jam contiunes to be the most versatile band in history hope they continue to put out great albums.
1781162646|5.0|King is one of my favorite authors. This story, although short, was a good Saturday read. As usual, king creates characters that readers view with empathy and can get involved with very easily.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this series and sylvia day is a Wonderful author!!! I would u of recommend this book to anyone!
1476727651|5.0|I always purchase King books and this is no exception! What a great story to continue Danny's story! You won't be disappointed with this book!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Super Great book. Very sweet ending. Author is soooooooooooo cool. Even though he might not look to hot. He seems like the sweetest dude in the whole dude world.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I liked playing the game and I wish it came other than on facebook. I would purchase it if it did. I do not twitter or do facebook. I can go so far and then I have to wait a certain amount of time to get new lives.
1451666179|5.0|Allie Brosh proves her comedic excellence again!  I totally snorted soda out of my nose by laughing while reading it.
B00G32OER4|5.0|Almost from the first scene on you can feel that this is going to scare you, I mean like cover your eyes for two thirds of the movie type scary. Made by the people who brought you the Paranormal Activity series, insidious, Insidious 2 and Sinister, The Conjuring stacks up well against these new horror classics as it appears they have really found a successful formula for making movies that are both downright creepy while having mass appeal at the box office. They have again struck horror gold here with that similar formula but with a solid performance from Vera Farmiga as half of the real life Ghost Hunters Lorraine and Ed Warren, with Patrick Wilson putting in another solid performance as the earnest husband. Lili Taylor gets to add to her impressive career with a nice performance as the afflicted mother of the real life Perron family with Ron Livingston effectively portraying her husband who feels powerless to protect his family from forces he cannot comprehend. There is no use going into the exact plot much as it is not overly deep but suffice to say that it will scare the pants off you and leave you thoroughly entertained.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I enjoyed this book and I'm glad there is more to come.  My only complaint is having to wait for the next installment, but that is a personal issue since great stories take time to write.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Purchased for a third grade reader for book report. He absolutely loved it - great book, classic. Great read for children and adults alike.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|It's a great story.  It's just not my favorite from Khaled Hosseini.  I enjoy the twists the author so eloquently infuses in all of his work.
B003L77G06|5.0|As always a modern Family is a pleasure to watch again and again and again I will be ordering the most recent season from this supplier too!

1451626096|5.0|This might be my favorite of the Cousins' War series!!! Its a really great summation of The Red Queen and The White Queen! As usual, a great book by Philippa Gregory! Can't wait for what's next from this one!
B007X6SMD6|4.0|Good for people who want to get their hands dirty on AWS quickly without having to troll through much information.
1451626088|5.0|A great book! I love the Cousins' War Series, and this book delivers! Philippa Gregory does it again!!! Fast read!
B0095P31L6|5.0|This truly is humorous storytelling at its finest and happily appropriate for all ages. My 5 and 3 year old grandchildren love it.
B00F30S0Y0|5.0|If you haven't listened to Arcade Fire yet this album is a good start. Stirring eighties type sounds and powerful vocal stimuli together to make a cornucopia of melody and harmony this listener can't get enough of. I highly suggest this album and I also suggest you buy the hard copy yourself because you get the digital copy free. Thank You Amazon for bringing me to the digital age but also helping me be a purist as well.
B0054R6BFM|3.0|This can best be described as an effective young adult novel, perfect for a middle-schooler or high school student.  The emotions described did a good job of evoking adolescent angst, but the OMG inner dialogue became a bit tiresome for an adult.  However, the book was excellent in describing the unexpected ways teens' actions can hurt others and have a powerful effect.  Probably a great tool for teaching and discussion.
B008220DIC|1.0|\\"The Films Of Paul Thomas Anderson: Bullies and the men who love them.\\"<br /><br />What is it with PTA's fixation on bullying? He does not attempt to defend or explain, but focuses on the violent acts of small men fetishizing and lovingly, like Hitchcock on a strand of blonde hair. In my world bullying is not an amoral act to partake in vicariously. Strike one.<br /><br />By identifying with the bully and not the victim does not the film promote fascism? Are we to believe that the glee the audience experiences over the \\"milkshake\\" scene in TWBB is purely escapist and not connected to other issues? Like, playing a video game that realistically simulates war?<br /><br />How did a movie about Scientology get made in Hollywood, anyway? The group is notoriously pro-active, shall we say?, against any detractors. The answer to that question is that the film is not ANTI-scientology. It could even be interpreted as being positive toward the group, (barring PTA, god-forbid, taking any definite moral standpoints in his films). Look into Amy Adams eyes as she tries to hypnotize you into thinking her eyes are a different color than they are... listen to her voice... you feel your will becoming very weak... You see what I'm getting at here?<br /><br />In the future, if humanity survives the present age, this film will be studied as an example of a society in deep trouble. -And not for the questions that the film asks of the viewer, but for the questions the viewer asks of the film.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|A very intriguing concept. Started slow but concept well-developed. The pictures are a bit difficult to fullly see in a Kindle format.
B000O8OTNC|2.0|Its overall a good item. The only problem i had is the carbine side fell apart the the second time i used it. The ceramic sharpens my knives pretty good.
B006TJXZ30|4.0|Given the limitations inherent in the Kindle I've loaded this on, it works just fine as a way to check my e-mail.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|And the Mountains Echoed is different than Khaled Hosseini's first two books.  Each chapter is like a short story that has some connection to the other chapters/stories and often sheds additional light on them.  The first and last chapters bookend the novel with a heartbreaking start and a lovely, bittersweet ending.  The stories take place in several different countries (Afghanistan, France, USA) and time periods. I found myself sad when a chapter would end because I was not ready to leave that group of characters and their story and then excited all over again when I started a new chapter. Like his earlier books, the prose is lyrical, poetic in some instances.  The characters are complex and realistic - disappointing in there choices/actions in some cases, surprisingly compassionate and courageous in others.  The stories made me tear up at times, my heart race with the beauty of the writing at others.  Khaled Hosseini remains a must-read author for me.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Way too childish.  Used to 'real' hidden object games.  This is more for children.  Hard to say if they'd like it either.
B00D1VKZ3M|1.0|Don't bother with this tedious piece of rubbish - it's beyond pathetic! Helen Fielding tries to resurrect the awkward, clumsy, gauche but always entertaining Bridget but fails dismally.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I've read most of Grisham's books over the years. Some I remember well, others not as much.  This one has kept me captivated and awake at night reading instead of sleeping.  Wouldn't want to forget this story but truthfully couldn't even if I tried.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|I bought this for an early Christmas / welcome to the area present and it was absolutly loved.  But, then again, if you are interested in season 6, there's really nothing I need to say about the show.  You already love it.  Great writing, perfect cast, if you already have the first 5 seasons, you can't help but get the 6th.  It arrived quickly and in excellent condition, as always.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book because there are so many twists and turns that there was a surprise at every turn. Everyone who likes adventure should read this
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I am a 39 year old woman and must admit that i adored this book, the whole series, in fact.  I was pleasantly surprised with the character progression and the unpredictability of the story line!  Excellent!  Plus, it's nice to add a new concept to the young independent readers out there...
B00FX8EY60|4.0|I just love Katy Perry and this album is great.  Unconditionally is quickly becoming my ultimate favorite song, it is beautiful
B008OOYALE|5.0|I think this game is good for people who like 'checking' on they're stuff. the dragons get coins for you so if you wait a couple hours they have like a thousand. it tells you quite clearly when you need to spend money; anyway the dragons you need money for can be breed with the ones you need coins for. you can name them, which helps a bit when you have more than one at the same time. its real cute when you put them in the breeding den and if you check it it says &quot;your dragons are still making magic...&quot; ;) if you need help with breeding,  check online on dragon story wiki.<br />my familiar dragon is hungry,  gotta go :)
B004UJAOLM|4.0|I haven't read very many books in my lifetime, however Mrs. Bronte did a womderful job. No wonder they loosely based a movie about this book. A great Classic in my opinon.
B000VE439Y|5.0|My high school and college &#34;gang&#34; were all quirky nerds, and quoting lines from Life of Brian and The Search for the Holy Grail were the glue that held our guffaws on our faces. Just learn to whistle &#34;Bright Side of Life&#34; and when you do, Pythons will slither up to you with knowing smiles.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This is the best movie ever written, although the quality didn't really seem like Bluray. I was still very satisfied.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Very nice mouse and great bargain. For the price I'm extremely satisfied with this device. The weights were a nice touch that i didn't realize came with.

And worse, the \\"help\\" always led to amazon.jp, not my original US site. I guess Kindle is too slow catching up with newer device.  All I can do is waiting for an update and fix!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is the most interesting book i have ever read. If you like drama and a lot of action then you'll like this book
B006ATJXQW|3.0|The book was great in the beginning but I would have liked to learn more about Thomas and wicked. I liked the epilogue and the prologue but I didn't like the rest if the book
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The story was intended to have a surprise ending. The ending was indeed a surprise. However, I can't help but feel that the story was disjointed and did not offer the usual flow that one would expect from this author. because I normally enjoy his books, I feel that the lowest rating I can give him is three stars.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|this film deviates substantially from max brooks' novel upon which it was based.  the book was incredible from start to finish.  it told the zombie wars as a form of history by visiting all the countries' battle sites after the war was over. the film handles the zombie war as it is occurring and brad Pitt has to find a way to fight the virus.  the strength of the film is in the sheer physical showing of what it would be like to be overrun by zombies,  you have never seen zombies like these. it seems as if they have rabies.  once they have it, they move differently.  they can move very, very fast. and they can pile up so as to become ladders to get over walls or battering rams. the cities they are infesting are well depicted too. there are a wife and two children who are left behind. they were missing from the novel and they don't add much to the movie. brad Pitt is on camera for virtually the entire film and that is necessary as he holds the film together.<br /><br />if you don't think you need to read the book now that you've seen the film, you are mistaken.  it is a beautiful recounting of the entire war which you cannot put down until done. there is so much more going on in the book whereas the film just scratches the surface.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B00F87ZUYG|3.0|Unfortunately, The Walking Dead is no longer must see TV.  It is feeling recycled these days.  The music track has improved however.  I am just not sure it is worth paying 2.99/episode though.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is intriguing, frustrating, and thoroughly fun to play!  I get so upset when i get killed and swear i won't play again, but i do. Lol. I can't resist it.
B00G32OER4|4.0|Good for a family scare fest.  We especially liked the jump factor and the rising tension.  A good option for those who aren't so into gorefests.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Can't stopped playing. Time just flies when playing this game. Very intense to clear the board before moves are gone.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Works well on my Kindle giving me lots of options for saving or conserving power.  I don't often need a collection of utilities for the Kindle but this one is a keeper.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Slipknot has been one of my favorite bands for quite some time. Vol 3 is one of my favorite albums along with Iowa. This album had a lot of meaning for them and I think they did a great job in showing it.
B0037EAJAC|5.0|Classic movie with excellent direction and casting.  Ran remains one of my favorite all-time samurai movies.  The Blu-Ray version offered crisp images and sound on my system which made it a complete pleasure to watch.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love it fun relaxing and challenging, makes your mind think of nothing else you are in your own world when you play
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This is the first CD I purchased of the Piano Guys, but will not be the last; they are great!

B0046B8GEQ|3.0|Great movie for kids and some good old music watch it with my nephew and had fun and lots of laughs!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Wonderfully done and almost perfect in historic accuracy....almost.....there is some revisionist social history.  All-in-all, great.  Casting is perfect and character development is interesting.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|its fun it is like God of war mix with diablo. so far I like it very much yup I sure do. I hope I get to play some more games like this for free so I can buy all the best items for real money.
B00EJYGQFG|5.0|One of Lady Gaga's most interesting songs. A very catchy chorus and unique production. This song took time to grow on me but when it did, it stayed on my mind. I bought this mainly for the cover art which is compelling and unique. Great artwork. In fact after the release of the ARTPOP CD I used the single's artwork for a special edition of ARTPOP I created.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Once you start playing you can't stop. My 4 yr old never wants to stop playing and pretty sure he is better than me.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I loved this book!  I didn't want to put it down.  I could imagine myself hiking the PCT.  This book is a must read!

B001HM1PFO|5.0|So much more than just a cult classic; this is a true classic film! Tim Curry steals the show with a great performance.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is great the graphics are amazing. I hope they can get more games like this one. Angelina M. Wrote this
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Downloaded this game back in July. Got all the ponies but Rainbow Dash and leveled up to 70, and low a behold my son (15 months old) deleted the game from my Kindle. My 4 year old was so upset. We have now started over since yesterday's tragic accident. She is happy to have ponies to play again but sad that we have to work back up to where we were. However we (daughter and I) love this game. Now buyer be ware you do have to spend real money to accomplish some of the tasks, bc the game does not give you gems fast enough. Also only thing I wish gameloft would do in the app is allow you to trade the gold bites for gems, when you've got an abundance of gold bits.
B002RMVAZ8|5.0|Just Bravo!<br />That's really all I can say about Hamlet, greatly artistic, terrific cast who did a fabulous job of acting their parts
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It works like a charm. 4 stars only because not too many apps. But my samsung tv was having youtube app. Now i can see youtube without any issues
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Good movie, I have never seen a bad Denzel movie. This particular movie held my attention because I am a recovering addict, and now work with people suffering in addiction.
B005V5WBFG|5.0|I have used if for about 5 years, and have COMPLETE confidence in it. Always protects my laptops brilliantly, and warns me if there is anything sinister trying to get into my laptop. keep up the good work.
B00ECR7KX2|5.0|It's Shakespeare. It's Joss Whedon. Need I say more? Well, maybe I'll say a bit more...<br /><br />The Look: First, it looks fabulous despite the low budget. Set pieces like the fete and the funeral procession through the woods were surprisingly impressive. And the choice to film in black and white coupled with Shakespeare's witty dialogue reminded me of an old 50s comedy. I half expected to see Audrey Hepburn or Cary Grant drop in for a cameo. The atmosphere it creates is smart, charming and classy.<br /><br />Directing: The choice to set the play in modern times could have been a disaster, but Whedon pulls it off surprisingly gracefully. Sure, a few touches are distractingly corny---an ipod sets the mood music for one scene, Don John's apprehension is sent to Dogberry via his iPhone, etc. But overall, it wasn't overbearing. The story remains the central focus, to the point that I really ceased to pay attention to what the actors were wearing.<br /><br />The confines of Whedon's house and yard also provide a more fitting, intimate setting for the play than Kenneth Branagh's lavish splashiness. Whedon uses this to great comic effect in the eavesdropping scenes, where Benedick and Beatrice tumble and bumble around trying to go unnoticed.<br /><br />If I could make one complaint about the directing, it would be to disagree with Whedon's choice to give B&B a passionate romantic past. Several completely unnecessary flashbacks show them kissing and making love. This just carries the &#34;contemporary&#34; spin too far, reading more into the text than the text itself really provides. Plus there's the annoyance that ALL the fades are white flashes. A little variety would have looked a bit less low-budget. Other than that, he did a great job, and I say that as someone who doesn't usually go for modern reboots of the Bard.<br /><br />(Extra item of note: Whedon composed the music score, which adds a refreshingly jazzy twist to the film's atmosphere but also has a more classic, tender feel in some places.)<br /><br />Casting: When Branagh and Thompson set the standard, you can't really compete, you can just do something different well. That's exactly what Denisof and Acker offer---not on the same level, but different and good in their own way (though I had trouble getting into Acker as Beatrice at first, since I know her only as Root the psychopath from Person of Interest!) They have good chemistry, and their dramatic scenes together worked especially well.<br /><br />Among the supporting cast, Hero and Claudio differed little from the Branagh interpretations. Don Pedro seemed perpetually drunk and not quite as likable as Denzel Washington's performance. But as others have noted, both Don John and Dogberry are considerable improvements over their Branagh counterparts. It's the difference between under-playing and over-playing (which reflects the entire production's less over-the-top approach). Clark Gregg as Leonato also had a great natural delivery, which makes sense given his extensive work with the Atlantic Theater Company. I would agree with other reviewers that he handled the dialogue the best of all the cast members.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: If you hadn't told me this was filmed in 12 days, I wouldn't have guessed. That's how well everyone pulled this off. Buy it and enjoy it as a prime example of what happens when a bunch of pros get together and decide to do something fun just for the hell of it.
B00902AKK4|4.0|Quick download to my kindle fire hd. Great graphics and smooth play. Good tutorials and good controls. Looks like a good game for children because of the cute graphics and story line, but not young ones. Starts easy but gets hard very quick. Overall I liked the game but got discouraged very early. Will quit for now and maybe try again later.
B008LXZFH6|4.0|Goofy parody - Steve Carrel was hilarious and the street fight was hysterical. Looking forward to the sequel, and more jazz flute!
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|Best read this month!  Loved it.  Will tell my friends to check this book out.  Highly recommend this book.  Awesome!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm at level 403 love it. It's what I fill blank time with. So you will love this game. Enjoy!
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Great, fun way to either learn a language (at least some words and phrases) or brush up on a language you learned long ago.
B003G4W49C|1.0|I liked what I saw of the movie. However the streaming was so bad that I was unable to watch the movie. This is not the first time that I have rented a movie from Amazon that would not stream. It is however the last time.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Bryson takes a period, just not 1927, and  presents it in an entertaining and lively manner as only he can.
B00687PWQG|5.0|Here we have an amazing story and a superb actor. One of those very underrated people in American history. John Adams Rocks!!
B004QK6TZA|5.0|I wasn't someone who was all that familiar with Marillion when this came out.  I had just started listening to \\"Holidays in Eden\\", \\"Seasons End\\", \\"Afraid of Sunlight\\" and \\"Brave\\" (a favorite) perhaps a couple of months before \\"Marbles\\" came out.  So I had a log of their music swimming around in my head.  When I heard \\"Marbles\\", however, it was a revelation.  The songs that are good on this album and extremely good.  The musicianship, production and balance here are top notch.  This is the Marillion album I keep coming back to.
B0035JNTA6|5.0|One of my guilty pleasure movies. Not a great movie, but certainly one that hit all of the right buttons. Yeah, some of it is really over the top but it is supposed to be a rediculous sendup.<br /><br />I highly recommend it if you like the &#34;Scary Movie&#34; type genre.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|I have loved this series from the very beginning, but that's not th  only thing that has kept me addicted, I love Aiden! I love him! I love him! I love him! It was a strangely beautiful ending. I can honestly say that I was blind sided and did not see a lot of that coming which is very rare for me. I can normally predict with the best of them! So sad to see it end but and so glad it was a wonderfully told story! Can I please ask for one thing... I'm going to need a spin off! Maybe with Seth or I don't even care more more more please!!
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|Being a fan of the Wachowski siblings, I watched Cloud Atlas in the theater, knowing very little about it before.  I liked the movie, but DID find it a little hard to follow all the stories and the constant jumping between the stories and timelines.  But at the end I liked it even though I was not sure I fully understood it.  Watching it again on HBO-Go I was able to pick up the details that I was missing the first time around and the story made much more sense.<br /><br />The movie has plenty of action throughout to keep it from becoming boring UNLESS you give up because you feel lost in the jumping sequences.  But if you pay attention, it will make mostly sense the first time around and complete sense the second.<br /><br />Many good films with detailed scripts are not fully understood after a first viewing.  In fact I think REALLY good films often require additional viewings to catch all the details of the story (examples, The Matrix, Heat, LA Confidential, Inception, etc.).  When stories are more complex they are simply harder to follow and slight distractions while viewing can get you lost.  Yet these are my favorite films of all cause they are truly focused on telling the story, as opposed to many movies gutting story lines for the sake of CGI sequences.<br /><br />I have now seen the movie about 6 times and now I am purchasing it.  Good story(s), overall good acting, excellent SFX when done.<br /><br />Finally I would say that with exception of the stories being tied by the reincarnation aspect, they truly could be COMPLETELY separate stories....keeping that in mind might help you follow the stories in the movie.  I find some people get lost because they are busy trying to tie all the stories together TOO much.  Enjoy the stories individually as they come and go, jumping around, then you'll see how they are loosely tied together.  I think it will help provide a better first time viewing experience.
B003U4ZOQ8|5.0|The 4th season was much better than the 3rd season. The new characters and the flash-forwards added new life to the series and added new things to obsess over from episode to episode. The freighter storyline and the partial exodus from the island gave the series the legs it needed to go 3 more seasons.
B003O86FMW|4.0|A decent book that was worth the time to sit and read.  I don't like being forced to write reviews amazon..
B003U4ZQRK|5.0|The fifth season of lost was a fantastic penultimate season. The time traveling storyline was entertaining and helped the viewer understand the motivations of lesser-known characters. It was also a nice counterpoint to the struggles of the survivors off-island. The epic/emotional/frantic finale was a perfect setup for the final season.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Best season I have ever seen, great plot lines and a ton of action. Highly recommended to any one wanting to watch
B00DJZR46G|4.0|Elton John's genius as a composer, lyricist and performer is on show and truly enjoyable. There is a quality listening experience here.
B009AJD5E0|5.0|Great movie. Watch it over and over again. Like to see another one like this. It explains a lot from other movie and if you watch the history shows you will see where they get their idea from that were thought through
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Lots o fun to play. Not happy that they try to make you buy extra lives and upgrades and have to wait 30minutes for another life. Still fun to play
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|Didn't expect much from this movie and waited to watch when I didn't have anything else to watch. Well I should have watched it sooner. It was a good flick.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Very good movie, it may not be what you expect but it is very good. I ended up liking it a lot more than I thought I would. Tom Cruise and Jai Courtney are awesome together.
B000AM6OQ2|5.0|Awe..this is one of those cases where the remake made me not watch the original. But that I do regret because after watching this, it's easily one of my top movies. Its about some men that died on a sunken ship years ago and they come when this enormous fog rolls in.There in search for there treasure that the locals &#34;stole&#34;..so they kill until the fog vanishes. It has good amount of kills, nice script and action. I recommended it to any horror fan.
B002GSXKN8|5.0|I love the dark knight series, but it's always good to get back to the original movies where it started. Penguin, Cat Woman, and Mr. Freeze are awesome. Val Kilmer does a great job as well, I was also surprised by Uma's portrayal of Poison Ivy
B000MGATTE|3.0|Not your typical King novel.  While I appreciate the story it was a hard read, too long, full of queer insider lingo and a storyline that jumped so much in the beginning I gave up several times and opened other books.  All that aside, I felt this story was more heartfelt...a writer writing about a writer. So if you choose to muddle through it you may come out with a different appreciation of King and fellow authors you admire.
B0017VG69U|5.0|Watching something from that long ago, it really surprised me how much I enjoyed watching it. It is very good, a lot of movies and shows from then seem to come off too corny to enjoy or like but I don't believe this is. It's a very good show and the original people are very good. Spock brings so much humor to it and Scotty as well
B008C20TDG|5.0|This is a very insightful book. I recommend it to those interested in bettering their overall diet and their health.
B00FEN000S|5.0|solid movie! My favorite of 2013, if you want action with out a lame story you found the movie<br /> transformers + Godzilla= pacific rim
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Kind of repetitious and boring.  Trite story and not one I would recommend to anyone else to read ever--just read it  because I downloaded it during a weak moment.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Earlier this year I finished the book The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and in Business by Charles Duhigg,  I was very impressed by this book and by the lessons it offers to individuals and organizations alike.<br /><br />This book discusses the science of habit and establishes a reproducible framework for successfully implementing change within an individual or organization.  The advertising industry has been using this science for years -- just ask the makers of Fabreze, who unwittingly contributed to Duhigg's book by developing a product that they couldn't sell (at least initially).<br /><br />Common sense tells us that selling a product, any product, is about marketing, however Duhigg exposes another \\"actor.\\" It is not enough to simply have a good product (even if it is superbly marketed);  you must also change the habits of your potential customers.  Your customers must buy what you have to sell, and do so repeatedly -- in order for you to be truly successful.  In order to be a success, you must become part of your target audience's routine.<br /><br />Let me ask a question.  How often do you eat fast food?  Now, I don't literally expect you to post an answer, however I do want you to consider what triggers your purchases of fast food.  Most individuals succumb to the fast-food craving on predictable intervals -- or they at least have predictable triggers.  Is there a fast-food restaurant on your way home?  If the answer is yes, then by altering your route home, you could potentially change your fast-food habit.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this book provides excellent, and perhaps even indispensable advice on how to change your life and your business.
B00957T6X6|1.0|The books themselves are great, but the digital version does not work on the new paperwhites or the old keyboard version.  Kindle support has been working on the issue for almost 1 month with no resolution in sight.  This does work with the Kindle fire and the android app
B00FMZ22CM|1.0|The app would NOT work and was so bad I complained. Amazon didn't even TRY to remedy and refunded my money, probably because the app is so poor that there is NO remedy. Don't buy this app!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|This is the story of an American hero... someone who did the job taking incalculable risks that 99.9% of citizens would never consider doing. Bud Connell, Author & Novelist
1401917232|5.0|We found the content most helpful. The casual commentary was easy to read and understand, with tidbits of humor tossed in.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Wonderful book; this was my first for this author, and now I am hooked! I am working my way through all of Liane Moriarty's books, and they are all really good. She has a way of writing that seems very intimate and real....the characters have thoughts that we all have from time to time, which makes the story and everything seem authentic. I highly recommend this book!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Quick game. Easy to bet other player quickly no problem. Easy to play with family member and other family and friend
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|I tried this game on a friend's recommendation, and have been pleased with the amount of thought it takes.  I also like the fact that the games are quick and that they allow &quot; do overs&quot; if needed.  I have already recommended it to another friend.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I will not recount the story line and plot as it has been done in many reviews already. Sections of this book are classic King (pre-TommyKnockers), but other sections are more recent King vintage (i.e. needs editing!!).<br /><br />Overall, a fun and engrossing book, and a realistic and haunting portrait of Dan Torrance (the psychic kid from \\"The Shining) as an adult. Unfortunately, the story runs out of steam ... :-)
B00F031XPS|4.0|Some things that are absolutely not correct:<br /><br />1. Jimi did not get out of the army due to a broken ankle.<br /><br />2. JANIE HENDRIX IS NOT JIMI HENDRIX'S SISTER! SHE IS NOT EVEN A BLOOD RELATIVE! Her mother married Al Hendrix, but her real father is NOT Al Hendrix, and Janie was already born before her mother met Al.<br /><br />3. The &#34;story&#34; about how Jimi died is the same old fairy tale, that he overdosed on barbiturates, that Monika Danneman discovered him unconscious, tried to wake him, then immediately called for an ambulance.<br /><br />Not even true.<br /><br />Nice that there is new footage, and I saw a lot of photographs that I have never seen before, but overall the documentary part tries to cover up any facts that are &#34;inconvenient&#34; to the Jimi Hendrix &#34;legend&#34;.
B0041KBWM0|3.0|It is great series depicting that era.  Fashion and surroundings great in this series.Emma is annoying but evolves with each mistake she makes.
B003L77GGA|4.0|I loved this show, didn't give it 5 stars because there could have been more extra features on here, since it is the final season.
B000FCKC4C|1.0|Watch the Wizard of Oz and save yourself the trouble.  This book is cliche, lacks depth of any kind, and is written on about a second grade level.  I can't believe all the positive reviews.  There's hardly any story to review in the first place.  If you want to read a fable about metaphysical mumbo-jumbo with absolutely no fleshing out of characters, settings, relationships, or meaningful plot, then by all means, this is the book for you.<br /><br />[SPOILER ALERT]<br />The treasure was back at home the entire time, but he had to learn about himself on his journey before he could go home.  *gag*  If this is supposed to be some sort of deep, emotional, inspiring adult literature, then The Wizard of Oz is the freaking Bible.  At least Oz is entertaining while conveying its juvenile message.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|Great series!  I'm hooked on these guys. Loved the addition of Castiel! My other favorite character! This series will make ANYONE pick up a Bible...
157421327X|5.0|I purchased this book first, then shared it with a local program for \\"Elder Arts\\".  Everyone has loved the concept and I'm sure many of the older adults will continue to explore this activity.  The organizer of the weekly craft meetings is collecting everyone's TANGLE SQUARES (they drew on both sides) and a mobile is being  constructed to show off everyone's beautiful and unique pieces.  I have since purchased several other books on this subject, just for reference when my brain dries up.  This book is an excellent place to start.  It is funny to me that the book(s) are copy-writed, because most of the designs are derived from doodles we all have been doing all our lives....the author's have basically just 'organized' the process.  It is inexpensive (the book) to get started (the supplies), you can use any paper (sometimes I use envelopes before I throw them away), any pencil and any pen.  once you get the hang of it and perfected your own designs, then it is worth buying the Micron pens, for pieces you want to frame, or scrap book or decorate items (what about a sculpture in plaster with tangles all over.....WOW).  Design your own note paper.  Your imagination is your only limitation.  I hope you enjoy this pleasant and relaxing pastime as much as I have.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|This book was incredibly interesting.  It is amazing how quickly we can lose the things we take for granted.  I am shocked at the lack of interest taken in these inmates and what a disappointment the prison system is.  The main character was deeply insightful and I had a hard time putting the book down.
B005LAIGOQ|3.0|I bought this because I heard it was &#34;scary&#34;, huh......., not so much.  Interesting, but not scary.  But then again, the idea of what's scary is all relative, isn't it.  There will be those who agree with me and others who have radical differences of opinion.  So if you are confused, watch a trailer, read the critic's reports, rent it and above all decide for yourself.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is one of the best games I have played on my Kindle. If you like figuring things out this is the game for you. I hope they make more soon.
147676459X|5.0|Fantastic.  Hilarious at times, yet very poignant at others.  To this day her writings/drawings on depression have been some of the most insightful that I have ever read.  She is brutally honest about herself in her own writing and makes one feel better about all their crazy urges.  The stories are on color-coded pages which make my brain just as happy looking at it closed as open.  Be aware you may get odd stares from your roommates because you keep laughing randomly so much.  The book is also thick enough to bludgeon their judging faces. I kept putting it down so I wouldn't finish it as quickly...but we aren't discussing my lack of self control.<br /><br />As a side note she stated on her book page \\"there are ten and a half new stories (I say \\"ten and a half\\" because technically I already posted the goose story, but it didn't have pictures before) and seven and a half reader favorites,\\" so pay no mind to those that decided to not read the description of the book and got upset that is contained some stories they had seen before (pretty much all the 3 - 4 star reviews).<br /><br />If you aren't sure check out her blog where you can read seven and a half posts for free (plus many more): [...]
B004K8WPUQ|4.0|I like this Mic.  it is a little fragile and I have had to replace one in the past, but the quality you get for the price you pay is unmatched.
B009POCG5Y|5.0|Great story,i  love the actors in this. This is a wonderful, inspirational story about broken family relationships. Amy Adams is marvelous!
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I always enjoy the ' Reacher ' character and his adventures - I would not have cast Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher in the recent Reacher film - too short and not good looking enough !!!!!
B007FJUP2W|5.0|I previously bought a pair of these shoes in black back in April for a Summer Vacation to Universal Studios and DisneyWorld. I picked these pairs of shoes because there light weight and thin for a hot place like Florida, and walking around in those theme parks get your feet pretty sore and sometimes get blisters. This was actually the first year I didn't get blisters because I used these shoes. They also didn't wear out, and I actually still use them to school! I also almost forgot to put that I get a lot compliments on them and my friends actually bought a pair because they liked mine.(:<br /><br />Pros:<br />Light Weight<br />Cute Style<br />Could go with a lot of outfits<br />Could wear to school/summer vacation/ beach<br />Doesn't get your feet hot<br />Could just put in the washer if they get dirty<br /><br />Cons:<br />Look weird with socks since they are crocheted<br />They kind of stink after awhile (you could just throw them in washer)<br />They feel weird at first, but you get used of it<br /><br /> These were actually my second pair of Toms I have gotten. Now I am actually looking at a different color of Crocheted Toms just because I love my black pair so much. I would definitely recommend Crocheted Toms to a friend!(:
B004GHNIRK|3.0|Many long and unknown words .  Interesting story line,  one would need a good amount of time to properly finish it,
B009K0OL06|5.0|Love this show - suspenseful and entertaining.  It's one I record to DVR, but somehow I missed a few episodes, so I purchased them to watch on Roku.
B008D37SGU|2.0|Did not enjoy.  Th emovie was slow paced and hard to follow.  Not the best acting or good story line
B00F91SCXC|5.0|This movie is exciting from the first 5 minutes and the tension doesn't quit until the very last few seconds of film!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush is extremely  challenging. ..and it assist with concentration. ...it's a stress buster at the end of the day! !!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book follows an amazing series, but the ending is sad. In my opinion it is not as good as the other books
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Good book creepy but real good you should get this book i really liked it and don't just read this book a red the whole seriesb
B004DLPXAO|3.0|Easy to use, but I wish it had better options for colors. I also wish it would use smaller side margins so that I could use more of my phone's display. Lots of wasted space on the sides. An easier highlight function would be nice as well.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|Ms. Boyle has done it again.  Another remarkable CD.  She has enhanced my favorite Christmas songs and made them hers.  Her voice has never sounded better, and I like the way this album was produced.  Finally, we can hear her clearly with choruses and musicians.  My favorites are &#34;Hark the Angels Sing,&#34; &#34;I'll Be Home For Christmas,&#34; &#34;The Christmas Song,&#34; and &#34;The Christmas Waltz.&#34;  This is going to be an early Christmas gift for friends, as they listen to music while they shop, decorate and entertain.<br /><br />Thank-you, Susan Boyle!
B00G32OER4|5.0|A rare extremely well done and consistent horror film. Acting, directing, writing and videography are on point. Would highly recommend!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun and challenging! Can play for hours and loose track of time! I would definately recommend to all my friends.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Fast shipment, very happy. Love the movies and now I can enjoy them in blue ray. We took a week and watched the whole set day after day.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It &#34;hangs up&#34; a lot and I have trouble sending lives through the notifications.  I will select then accept them and they don't go anywhere.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is so heat wrenching and beautiful,it was impossible to put down and I don't believe I'll be able to get the story out of my mind for a very long time. I can't recommend it enough. I absolutely loved it
1781162646|2.0|Ah - Stephen - what happened?  You used to be so good, now, not so much.  It was clear that this started out with King thinking he could use the carny talk to make a story.  The first half of the book is used to explain the different roles, rides and talk of the carnival - or carny in the \\"the Talk\\"(does anyone really call it that?).  One of the angles of the story is supposed to be getting over your first love (or the first love that dumps you), but this never really gained traction - it felt forced and tired.  The suspenseful parts of the book I found tiring and not suspenseful at all, King tried to hard to recover, didn't really engage himself, and just let it fizzle on the Ferris wheel.  King was a good writer, not a great one, but could put a good story together - think Salem's lot and Carrie, but this one - take it out of the library.  One thing that also annoys me is when authors try and lecture you through their books - I don't read Stephen King for his intellect so don't lecture me on politics, religion or the NRA - stick to the story line - which in this case could have used a little more focus.<br /><br />Not a big fan of this one - two stars.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|This was my first Jack Reacher novel. It was recommended to me by my brother in law, an avid Jack Reacher fan. There were slow parts. But no different than any other book. All in all this was a great book. I would recommend it highly.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|I have been a Stryper fan since 1988. I love this band, and this album really ROCKS!! I am very proud of this band and I am looking forward to see them live again.
B00DIJQAI6|1.0|It races to fast to much money for junk and totally not worth your time you should just skip over this game and not bother
0767903374|5.0|I absolutely adore this workbook! It is highly beneficial to go through the exercises in learning how to deal with your highly sensitive persona.
0061906220|5.0|Very cute book, and great for any age.  Would recommend this book for any child. Excellent book, and so happy for the purchase!
B004ADH1RI|2.0|Bring your ear plugs. For whatever reason every character in this movie has to scream loud, all at the same time. No one listens to anyone, and what they perform on screen is simply stupid or gross. Film goes from dumb to dumber, excessively in every direction. Waste your time elsewhere.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|Wow!! I have been a Stryper fan since Yellow and Black Attack and this is one of their best to date!
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I probably read this book when I was a child, but decided to read it again as a great-grandmother. Delightful adventures!
B004LROMWU|2.0|Overall, based on what little I saw of it, not very good at all.<br />Basically, you have ten minutes or less (my opinion is under five minutes) to the hook the viewer to your story, and introduce them to your main character.  The viewer may not have empathy yet, but they should at least be interested in what's happening.<br />By the twelve minute mark (and that is what my review is based on), I had learned I was uninterested in the characters, the story was unoriginal, the dialogue was just plain bad, and sad to say I didn't want to watch anymore.  The VFX were bad as well, though they probably had a very minimal budge for it.  I just didn't care about the story, and that is a sad day.<br />Now, Spielberg's name is on this show, but that doesn't automatically make it a good product.<br />I wanted more from it.  If they had spent more time in writing room, developing the characters more (with depth and edge), gotten a more original story (how many stories are there with the aliens taking over earth), and created better drama and dialogue, then this show would have had me.<br />I will not be watching this again.
B00FEJHPRI|5.0|Great movie! I like the way the director tied the trilogy together. It was definitely worth the wait. Tony Stark lives on!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I am a Stephen King fan for many years.  I haven't finished reading this book but it's definitely holding my interest.
B00DKY4LBW|5.0|Really love this CD. There really isn't a track I dislike. Arctic Monkeys are GREAT! This album is their best yet in my opinion.
B002ZDOXM6|4.0|Just love Backstreet Boys.  Good for listening to when you're stuck in traffic to help calm you down rather than some of the current music.
B009CVRQLY|5.0|Songs are great.  I could listen to the whole  from beginning to end.  The last album, Taking Chances, was such a big disappointment.  I am glad to know that she still has what it takes to make a great album.
B00574P9EQ|5.0|The series itself is very entertaining and funny. This one in particular is about the sibling rivalry/jealousy and how that is so common in every family. It is a good realization for those families experiencing it, like ours ;) Greg and Rodrick are just too cute!!!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I didn't get into this show untill the end of last season. I was thrilled to find out I could go back and see it all. This is my favorite show on Television . It's never boring and totaly different.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|Read this to finish the series if it continues I won't be finishing, which is unheard of for me. Story line is hard to follow and characters get stale.
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|Funny but not as good as 1 or 2. It tries to hard to make all three movies tie together...
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|This is a great game and it's quite addictive. I'd easily recommend it over regular suduku because of the different levels.
B00BLYFDO2|3.0|It was great to hear a new stooges album but many of the songs have Iggy's vocals tracked 2 or 3 times. I thought it sounded weird. His voice is still strong enough not to have to do that, not my favorite stooges album. I also miss Ron Asheton's ultra dirty and sloppy guitar sound
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Love this show. I own all of the seasons and I plan to continue purchasing them as they are released.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This is absolutely the best notebook/note taking program for the Kindle Fire HD. Its so simple and customizable. It lets you convert your notes automatically to PDF formats and it is just really neat with a clean setup. Easy to use, especially with a bluetooth keyboard.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I love this show. Probably my favorite that's still running on TV. They've kept it funny and new every season.
B00EGMQIJ0|2.0|I am a techie.  This novel stimulated thought about The Evils of Technology and Big Data.  I liked that portion of the book.  But there is little plot.  Reading it was work.<br /><br />Disappointed
B003L77G6A|5.0|Love this show. I own all of the seasons and I plan to continue purchasing them as they are released.
B009GEFXLC|4.0|Wonderful, dramatic episode, sequel to Target. Well worth it to own! Get to see Nathan Fillion bring out his Mal Reynolds persona a bit!
B0010X8NF0|3.0|Definitely not my favorite Wes Anderson movie, and I've seen most all of them. It's supposed to be pretty symbolic and although I knew it going in, I just couldn't really enjoy this movie.
B00FQU8XTE|5.0|Our family of 6 (ages from 8-42) was anxiously waiting for their next cd.  Again, they have given great music a twist.  We thoroughly enjoy this and have listened to it many times over already this season.  If you like the other music they have done, you will enjoy this just as much.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|I've loved every other season of this show and the sixth season is no different. Can't wait till season seven comes out!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|AMAZING product, everything about it is great! No more having to go searching for an hdmi cable any time I want to watch a movie or show family photos. One slight downfall is that the tab casting can be quite glitchy on videos, but compared to what else this thing can do its a five start to me!
0385474547|5.0|I ordered this book to read for a history class in college but I really enjoyed it. It was interesting to ponder the importance of keeping with traditions and how far is too far when it comes to trying to maintain customs.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|I'm going to keep this as short and simple as I can.<br /><br />If you liked Stryper in the 80's you will like this album. It is on par with, if not better than, Soldiers Under Command and To Hell With The Devil. I know that sounds like hyperbole, but it's not.<br /><br />If you like Hard Rock/Metal but didn't like Stryper or have a preconceived opinion of them based off of their 80's sound, check this album out. Even though this album has enough of the classic Stryper sound to please a long time fan, there has been enough growth musically that there's a lot here to like for those who maybe thought their previous efforts were a little too poppy or whatever. Give it a try. It's a really great Hard Rock record. You'd be doing yourself a disservice by not at least giving it one spin.<br /><br />The bands previous two efforts were a covers album where they did everything from Iron Maiden to Dio-Era Sabbath (The Covering) and an album where they re-recorded many of their own classics (Second Coming). In my opinion, the experience of those two projects reconnected these guys to their roots and to their own identity. I don't think No More Hell To Pay would be the artistic success that it is if not for the band really finding it's center.<br /><br />This is a confident sounding album. You can hear it in the songs. It's relentless and razor sharp in it's attack. Even the lone ballad \\"The One\\" has balls.<br /><br />Right now my favorites are \\"Marching Into Battle\\", \\"Saved By Love\\", and \\"Legacy\\". There's not one song that you want to hit the skip button on. It's a classic record that you put on and just let it play itself through. Not many of those coming out these days.<br /><br />Congrats to the guys in the band. God bless 'em and thanks for an album that is going to be a pleasure to listen to for the rest of my life.
B0053O89RY|5.0|I loved seasons one and two and this one was no different. Phil is one of my favorite television characters so I always enjoy the episodes where he plays a big part.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows of all times. I love it, if you have not seen it you need to. The price was great as well
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This season is just as good as the others.  It has a lot of love in it, especially at the end.
B00EY8A6BC|2.0|It was ok. Hindsight is 20/20 but if I could go back I would wait until it came out on Netflix. Enjoyable enough to get through but don't tell anybody you paid for it.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|This the best stryper album to date. Smoking guitars and bass. The drums are pounding. But ultimately it's Michael Sweets voice. He gets better with age. God bless you guys. Keep rocking into the future.
B00F91H15W|3.0|It was fun. Reminded me of Springbreakers. Kind of a cool story and can't believe it happened. Definitely worth a watch.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love this game it has awesome graphics and I can play it for hours. th only thing is j run out of tokens to play the game so I have to wait tip the next scratch off is ready to scratch off
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It is great. I love that you can put anything up on the TV. With anything else you get stuck with the programming that it comes with but this is an awesome and affordable product.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|its probably the worst thing ive ever downloading. my laundry is piled up my house is a mess because I cannot stop playing this game!!!! two complaints when I use the extra moves it doesn't always give them and when I need friends to move on to another world they don't always get the requests

0385351399|1.0|As a voracious reader, I'll plow through a book a week, never failing to find something redeeming in virtually everything.  However, this first excursion into a work by Dave Eggers was a constant chore, a clock-eating slog into some sort of \\"warning\\" about the trend toward more and more personal information being demanded by Social Media.  I have resolutely refused to turn over any more of my info than necessary so I'm quite aware of the ills.  But I digress.  If you're looking for an Orwellian look into the possible future, a well-written, clever thriller that arrives at a smashing climax, I can assure you that \\"The Circle\\" isn't it.  Displaying a minimal imagination when it comes to technology, here Dave Eggers lives solely on his reputation.  In short, I wouldn't recommend this slow and uninteresting fantasy to anyone.  Let's forget that the book isn't even broken up into chapters; there are pages and pages of conversations that a more skilled writer could have designed in a fraction of the space and perhaps even brought them to life.  \\"The Circle\\" is only for the reader to likes to plow uphill, struggling to remain even mildly interested, determinedly hoping (praying, even) that in forging ahead the book will suddenly begin to \\"get good.\\"  Sadly, this one never does.  Keep in mind that draining bathwater moves in a circle too.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I loved every moment of this book. It was very exciting. It was full of suspense. Almost like a potter book but with Greek mythology. This is a good book for students in fourth and fifth grade students.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|My son needed this exact model for a college audio class.  They work perfectly and the price was competitive and even less than many other sources.<br />This model must be a good one for it to be on the supply list for a college course.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you for having Candy Crush on Kindle Fire HD!  Love this game. The other game I'm addicted to is Pet Rescue Saga. I play these two games all day. I'd really love having an app on here for Pet Rescue. Please make this Kindle owner (and I'm sure others) happy by having a free app for it. It would be great having everything all in one place, my Kindle.
0143122916|3.0|An interesting account of a brutal upbringing  in a barbaric country. It is educational and well written. The main character's account is credible.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's a great free app. It's big!!! Everyone can see this calculator. You gotta get it if you need a calculator!
6305388458|5.0|A classic!  Very funny, and also provides a satirical poke at organized religions without getting nasty. I highly recommend it as a staple in everyone's DVD collection.

B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I love this processor because for the price this little piggy loves to be overclocked with proper cooling. I'm running a nice conservative oc at 4.3ghz. I have not had one issue running this under load with my flightsim cockpit setup. I enjoy hours of flight simulation and this thing stays around 48c or so under the load. Again, proper cooling plays a big role.
B0018QXL1K|5.0|I love it! I couldn't find this CD anywhere but here!  There's a couple songs I couldn't find so I decided to buy the whole album. Def worth a listen.
B007R21JJK|5.0|This board works very well for the price. It has no problems with bclk clocks that I can see, I haven't gone that high tho. I'm running a 3570k oc'd to 4.3ghz with the bclk at 103mhz with no issues. I chose to increase the bclk in addition to the multiplier for an extra push on the memory etc.<br /><br />The only con I can see if that Gigabyte doesn't offer advanced rma (cross ship) like EVGA and others do. The board this replaced took a month to get back on rma, no issues with the rma tho. Just took longer than I'd like.<br /><br />Gigabyte please consider doing advanced rma, many of us have no problem giving you our credit cards just in case we don't return the bad board. I'm not sure why Gigabyte would have an issue with it.<br /><br />I've always used Gigabyte boards and will continue to do so in the future.
006202406X|1.0|Ok what the hell?  I'm so angry with the ending of this book that I had to get out of bed to write this review. First off I'm angry that I spent the last week and a half flying through Divergent and Insurgent- only to come to this book? I dont get it. Did the author not want to finish the trilogy so she came up with a crap ending? Sweet, just read 1000 pages between 3 books only to be majorly let down. Not cool. If you like to be wicked dissapointed; feel miserable and empty, then this is the series for you! Otherwise dont get involved.<br /><br />************SPOILERS****************<br /><br />The main thing that ruined this entire book for me was Tris's death. And Tobias going back to his mother so easily. I dont have much more to say than this is ridiculous. Sad I put in the effort and time to read this trilogy.
B005MHI0QM|5.0|Beautiful, haunting, heartbreaking, funny...there are so many words and ways to describe this diary written by an incredible young woman. If you've never read it or it's been so long since you read it in school, I say pick it up and give it a go because you won't regret it.
B0085OEIOC|5.0|This movie, by far, is one of my most favorites, next to Airplane. It has cheap laughs, sight gags, infantile poop jokes, pretty much what you expect from a Zucker-Abraham-Zucker movie spoof. It lampoons practically every film genre, including: Elvis movies, spy/underground resistance films, WWII thrillers, to name a few. If you enjoy immature humor then this is your gem. I have loved it since the first time I saw it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Absolutely love this show, we'll done. I laughed and cried with the characters! Lol, the actors are fantastic. Definitely give it a chance.
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|Today (Tuesday, November 5, 2013) marks the release of Stryper's tenth studio album. It is the first new album of original material featuring the original four members since 1990′s Against The Law. They have released an album of cover tunes and an album of re-recorded \\"hits\\" since Tim Gaines stepped back into the band as bassist...but this is the first \\"new\\" album featuring his bass work and it is a great start to their rejuvenated career.<br /><br />I have been a fan since first hearing Soldiers Under Command when I was fifteen. I have purchased every album they have released and at once time had a Stryper wall in my bedroom. Even now...at the ripe, old age of 43...I am a huge fan and am just as excited about this new record (yes...I still call them records) as I was when To Hell With The Devil came out in 1986.<br /><br />Stryper resumed their career in 2005 with the criminally underrated Reborn...but it wasn't a true return to form. That album sounded like a Michael Sweet solo album with some finishing touches added on to make it sound like Stryper. I love that album and was thrilled to see a new CD with Stryper on it...but I wondered if it was just a last gasp for a dead band. There had already been several \\"best of\\" compilations with a handful of \\"bonus\\" tracks thrown on to garner sales...but for the most part...Stryper was another dead Sunset Strip glam band.<br /><br />Reborn was followed by 2007′s Roxx Regime Demos, and 2009′s Murder By Pride...which was another album that I eagerly anticipated. It featured a step back towards the classic Stryper sound while still incorporating elements of modern hard rock. It also featured a cover of Boston's Peace Of Mind which highlighted the fact that Michael Sweet was touring with that band after the death of Brad Delp. The next two albums from were the aforementioned cover album (The Covering 2011) and the album of re-recordings (Second Coming) which was released earlier this year. Those two albums contained three new Stryper songs that hinted at the direction the band claimed to be heading.<br /><br />All of that lead up to today...the new album. Two videos have been produced and released in anticipation for today's release and at last check (about half an hour ago) the new album is the #1 Rock album on iTunes...edging out the new Pearl Jam. It is also sitting at #27 overall which is impressive when one considers that the new Eminem album dropped today as well. So what that means is that an 80′s CHRISTIAN hair band is still relevant in 2013.<br /><br />I have already listened to the album four times since downloading it this morning. I will pick up a physical copy later...but I couldn't wait until then. The first thing you notice on the album is Michael Sweet's voice. It is not quite as high as it was in their heyday...but it also sounds less processed and manipulated as well. Another thing that grabs you are the riffs and hooks. This album is dripping with tasty guitar bits. I truly believe Michael Sweet and Oz Fox are underrated as lead guitarists. Both of them have serious chops and show them off here.<br /><br />The BIGGEST surprise...however...is the bass playing of Tim Gaines and the drumming of Robert Sweet. I don't think Tim has ever been this up front in the mix. He doesn't relegate himself to simple bass lines and you can hear him meandering (in a good way) all over this thing. Robert's drumming is right on target. It is frenetic when it needs to be...reserved when it needs to be...and ALWAYS in the pocket. I think it is his best performance...ever.<br /><br />While this album is still \\"overly produced\\" it pales in comparison to some the gimmicks and tricks used on To Hell With The Devil and In God We Trust. Those albums were super polished and (at times) sterile. No More Hell To Pay is a much more organic sounding effort and has more in common with Against The Law. It has enough of the glitz and glamour to recall the 80′s...but enough crunch and bite to notsound cheesy. It truly is one of their finest moments as a band.<br /><br />Now...the songs.<br /><br />Revelation opens up with a Black Sabbathesque vibe. It is dark and brooding...much like the book in the Bible. As I mentioned earlier... Michael's voice is in top form and the guitars are all over this track. The first single, No More Hell To Pay, is next and it continues the sonic assault. Tim's bass and Robert's drumming anchor down the groove and lay the foundation for Michael and Oz to jam on. Saved By Love is a frenetic hard rocker that reminds me of their cover of Van Halen's On Fire. It also features some of the strongest and most aggressive vocals Michael Sweet has ever done. A gassed up cover of Jesus Is Just Alright is next. I admit that I have never liked this song and was somewhat disappointed when I saw it was going to be on the album. That being said...they make it their own. You almost forget that the Doobies (among others) did this one first. The album's sole ballad, The One, is next. Stryper have always had a knack for writing soft, plaintive ballads bit this one has a bit more bite. It is closer to Lonely (from In God We Trust) than Honestly. It features a haunting vocal line that runs throughout the entire song. I give them a thumb's up for writing a darker ballad that fits the vibe of the album...instead of sticking anHonestly clone instead. Legacy is another barn burner featuring dueling guitars and Michael's aggressive vocals. It almost feels like he's channeling his inner Rob Halford at times. Marching Into Battle is another Sabbathesque tune with a monster drum/guitar combo that plods along until Michael's vocals pierce your eardrums. Te Amo has a killer opening lick with more of the dual guitar work that Stryper are famous for. I put them in the same sentence as Priest, Maiden, and the Scorpions when people start discussing the greatest two guitar bands. This song is just more evidence to support that claim. Sticks & Stones is currently my favorite track. It is probably the most modern sounding song on the album and it has the poppiest hook...but the interaction between bass and drums and the guitar solo just take it to another level. Water Into Wine goes in the exact opposite direction. It is a straight-up Sunset Strip glam rocker. It is also a favorite right now and brings up images of spandex and leather. It's in the vein of classic Dokken or Ratt and either of those bands would love to have a track like this on their recent albums. Sympathy is the second track to get a video and it continues to bring back memories of the 1980′s LA glam scene. It isn't done in a cheesy manner so there's no cringe when you hear the stacked backing vocals or finger-tapping in the solo. The final track is Renewed and it is a heavy rocker akin to The Way. It's as heavy as any song they've ever released and the guitar work is incredible. Once again...Tim and Robert lock into a groove and carry the song along at breakneck speed.<br /><br />I know I view this album through yellow and black tainted lenses...but it is one of the best hard rock releases of the year. It is a solid album that (in my opinion) is near the top of Stryper's recorded work. I would have to go back to their first three albums to find one the that delivers on such a consistent level. It is one of their finest.<br /><br />I give it five stars out of five stars. For me...it is near perfect. It also gets bonus points for having a killer cover.sound cheesy.

B007ZGBZHE|2.0|a bit over the top, while I like this type of book, the Jack reacher and other series, I had a bit of trouble on this with the suspension of disbelief with some of the things he does...yeah, I know, the Reacher stories push that boundary as well, I guess it's the way it is worded, and then about mid way through the story the book seemed to take off in multiple directions and I lost interest.
B00F8MIIKO|5.0|Great movie for kids as well as for adults. Don't mind watching it over and over like some kids movies
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The great twisted love story continues. Just when you think maybe their troubles are coming to an end more thrills and chills abound...Can't wait for the next book!!
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|This was a great movie!!! It was our family night movie. The kids loved it!!! Would watch it again for sure
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Product as advertised.  Have ordered before and am happy with product,  Noise is a expected characteristic. No vibration. Excellent cooling.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|as someone born in 1980 who was lucky enough to have parents that were into videogames before I was even born, this book is a like taking a trip back through some of the happiest moments in my life.  its like spending time with a lifelong friend and a reminder of all the friends ive had over the years who shared these memories with me.  the author has a way of inviting you into his world with his words and once you are there, you never want to leave.  I cant even begin to guess how many more times I will read this book...it will have to be dozens.  ive never felt so happy at the end of a book and so sad that its over.  I am in awe...and this book will be a part of my life forever.
B000V8A95C|5.0|Awesome show!!!  Fourth time seeing it for me,  third for my daughter.  Glinda's performance this time was our favorite. We love it!
B003B02O0A|5.0|John Grisham is a masterful storyteller. His characters are believable and we are drawn deeper into their lives with each page we read. Grisham makes us feel Carl Lee's anger and pain and question how we might react if we were in his situation. I found it very difficult to put this book down... I had to know what would happen next. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and would highly recommend it.
B001ANYDAO|3.0|After reading Outliers I have developed a strong opinion about success.  To give a little background the book is about different success stories and what certain thing caused that person to be successful.  For example one story was the reason The Beatles were so popular.The author said it is because they had practiced for more then 10,000 hours.  Same with Beethoven.  Sounds silly right?  Well, in fact it’s true with more practice the person gets more experience then after that they become successful.  Another example was why Asians are so good at math.  The answer was because of where they came from and what their culture is like.  Back in ancient China when people had to do the tedious job of harvesting rice they learned to be patient and to never give up on problems.  This was taught through generation and now today Asians are far more likely to work on a problem longer then Americans, who would give up after 2 minutes and decide that it is to hard for them.  Many of the success stories came off and silly to me but after reading the explanation behind it, things began to make sense.<br /> The reasons why I gave this book a 3 out of 5 stars was because I found the book boring at certain points.  I thought that the book was to old for me.  I thought to myself, I am young I don’t have to worry about my future why is this stuff relevant to me?  I believe this book is more targeted towards high school and college students, because they are the ones who have to worry about heir futures.  Also an adult would enjoy this book because they would like the different success stories and the philosophy behind it.  I also thought the author could have cut some of the chapters short I found that sometimes a certain topic would just go on and on and I would keep waiting for the chapter to be over.<br /> However there were some aspects of the book that I very much enjoyed.  I found it very interesting some of the author’s ideas on what he thought made a certain person successful.  For example the one story that I thought was totally ridiculous was in the first chapter where he describes how sometimes in sports it matters what month you were born in and whether your going to be successful.  He used Canadian Hockey as an example, and he described how the kids who were born in January, February and March are more likely to become successful.  After I read this I thought to myself, how is this possible?  Why should it matter what month you were born in?  Then he explained that certain cut off months could depend what age team you play on.  Therefore the kids who play on the older teams get better coaches and skills training then the kids who are the same age as them but didn’t make the cutoff.  Those kids therefore will begin to get better and have a better chance for playing professional hockey.  It was these stories that I found very interesting because many of these things people overlook but, in fact they play a huge role in how a person succeeds.  Overall, I thought this book was okay, but it left me with a lot to think about.
184794079X|5.0|Great book, really enjoyed reading it. It's a great motivator and ties things in really well. It has a lot of great points and examples to compare to
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This book was not up to Grisham's best.  I thought it was just average, and I can't recommend it.  Sorry bout that.
B00009ATIX|5.0|Sci fi movies in my book are ok but they often come off as to weird for me. I really enjoyed this one though. The actors all do a great job and i enjoy all the flashbacks b/c they give good insight into the main characters and why George loves his wife so much. I thought the ending was very goo. d
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Good book. A little more predictable than most of this author's books, but still an enjoyable read. Recommend to mystery buffs.
B00EY7LT9Q|2.0|Its not really a good series and it disappointments me . I have been with Marvel comics since I was a small boy..
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|This is kind of hard to follow because it goes back and forth between the different characters, until you get into the story a ways in.  Kind of predictable once she opens the letter. It is a good story tho.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I have had horses and this is a great substitute because I no longer have them :(...Great game I have only found 1gliche in the game.
B000000WJZ|5.0|This album has been a favorite of mine since it was first released. Every single song is a hit in my book.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I love Gillian Flynn books, you can't put them down once you start, suspenseful and unpredictable a little on the dark side.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is as addictive as real candy!!  I love that it is now available on my Kindle Fire HD
B007D2XSW0|2.0|Tried Lite version, really liked. Looked forward to using advanced  editing with full version but can ONLY SAVE  TO AMAZON CLOUD !<br />Read 2012 related review complaints, figured issues surrounding saving pics  would have been resolved.  Customer Service is just an option for app to &quot;autofix&quot;  technical issues.  TOO BAD really liked all editing options.
B005ZB91KY|3.0|Compared to other Marvel movies, this one, in my opinion, did not live up to my expectations. The direction and story, I thought, were a bit lacking, and had some &#34;holes&#34;. Other than that, the special effects were good, and the storyline flowed well.
B00G32QIEG|1.0|Basically, a poorly done attempt at a remake of the Men in Black franchise. Sorry, Jeff Bridges...guess you will have to do some  more Duracell commercials.
B009FXIICK|4.0|I have played this game on the gameboy system. While it is similar, this version is lacking just a bit. I prefer the version where you have 10 different challenges to complete to get hired as the Zookeeper. The game is fun, but it seems to only allow you to play one version and it can get a bit boring after a while.<br />The kids find it entertaining matching up the animals. And will play it until they lose
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This was an entertaining movie. I'm not a big fan of the CGI hulk but they did a decent job of it. It's one of the better blockbuster action/superhero movies.
1451666179|5.0|As a follower of her blog, I was extremely excited to finally get my mitts on her new book! Allie's storytelling is wonderfully relatable and hilarious!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|The Hunger Games is an excellent movie! Lots of supsense as well as an intriguing view of violence as entertainment. While I would not recommend this movie for really young audiences, I thought the movie did a great job on keeping the actual violence to a minimum (not a gorey movie.)
B00CHVIPP2|5.0|We laughed and giggled through the whole movie. Just terrific. Looking forward to watching it again. Very happy with it.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Excellent read, it keeps you going until the end and doesn't disappoint when it ends. I like everything I've read by this author and plan to keep reading her books.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It was too sad at the end. I cried when prim died.<br />It was great in the beginning, though.yay!yay!yay!<br /> From Alexandra!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Great for watching entertaining police work investigation it has some family values Alicia talks with her children that is very important to have I a show.  It needs more family values though
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Very good book was very happy with it . L loved reading it with my kids . We now have the set can't wait to start the next one.
B0007TKNII|5.0|I do not think I was really the target audience for this film, but I instantly fell in love with it the first time I watched Phantom of the Opera. The songs are amazing and sung incredibly well by everybody, however vague that is. Phantom of the Opera is my favourite musical and one of my favourite films. Anyone a fan of musicals should check this out.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I heard about Chromecast from a friend and was anxious to try it. It's easy to set up and extremely easy to use. Anything you can stream on your computer can be streamed to your TV set. Much more versatile and cheaper than Apple TV. We have both, but prefer Chromecast.
B007NU54H4|4.0|Secret of the the Wings-------my grand-daughter loves it.  Tinkerbell is the in thing for the 3-6 year olds for sure.  plan to order more.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Best book I have read in ages.  A must read!!!!  Could this really have happened in our history.  It did sadly to say.
B00E9A656K|5.0|AWESOME game I tried the other drag racing game but this one has better graphics and is better but I don't like the gas idea other than that it's fun
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Great app. I love how you can mix as many sounds as you like. I had problems staying and/or falling asleep, but this app really helps. I owe many hours of sleep to this app. It includes a lot of great sounds, but I wish they had baseball, or other sports, sounds.
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|This game was absolutely fun being able to go through levels that were were tricky but not to tricky to the part when I can't solve them I would definitely recommend this game
0767817710|5.0|Sharon Stone has shown how great a western actor she is. She has a real cool karma about her, and I only wish she would of kept on making more of the western type movies she has shown here. I watch this movie over and over, it is spellbinding!
B00FAIPDAE|5.0|Been waiting a long time for an app like clash of clans to come out for kindle and total conquest is not a let down. Highly recommend this app!!
B000ASATZ8|5.0|I simply love to watch the Tremors series, makes you really get involved in the drama and suspense! It is a great movie!
0316204366|5.0|Gladwell has a unique ability to see the 'Big Picture' and to pull disparate facts together to support his philosophy. Good Read.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Purchased this before I found out I could view on hulu! The quality of the programs on Amazon is excellent and if you can spend the extra money its nice not to have all the commercials.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was already playing this on my computer but now its even more fun & easier playing on my kindle.  I even played travelling by airplane which helped with the &#34;down&#34; time of flying.  And yes, it is addicting !
B004KKX814|4.0|These Japanese Beyblades are very nice for the boys. They like them better than the Hasbro type and they seem to be faster allowing them to win more battles over the Hasbro type.
B00FHAB3HW|2.0|A dire collection of cookie cutter pop songs performed just about acceptably by the tongue waggling nudist. In England, a banger is a nice tasty large sausage and that's much more inviting than this. As I said, she gets two stars because she performs it OK, but there's nothing mature, or even particularly enjoyable about these songs. She looks OK swinging nude on a wrecking ball though. Am I being sexist? I don't think so. She's the one who got her kit off! An attempt at maturity and an artistic statement? I don't think so.<br /><br />Lazy music, barely deserving the name 'Pop'.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|all of a sudden this app no longer works just keeps saying servers are currently not available please try again later
B001IXSU8M|4.0|I don't particularly like Gaga's public image and the attempts to shock in support of her 'art'. It's a bit boring really and others have done it so much better. I always wanted to get her in her meat dress and take her on a visit to Battersea dogs home.<br />Therefore, I wanted to hate this album badly and I did for a while. However, like a nasty rash, it starts to get under your skin and itch. It really is immaculately produced pop and is a great album. I guess it taught me something about preconceptions.<br />I still prefer Eric Cartman's version of Poker Face though :-)
B00F35BV64|5.0|Very enjoyable, and funny.  TRIBBLES!!!  I really hope they are going to make another one.  We really enjoyed the action too.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I use this charger at least every other day for the last month and so far it works great. It is a little longer than some of the other chargers that I've used but the build quality of it feels excellent compared to those others too. It charges my iPod and my s3 quickly and with no problems. At this price though I really haven't found a better one even up into the $20 range.<br /><br />I will update if anything changes but so far I am quite happy with this charger.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Great app.  I use it almost everyday for my work. It is especially helpful when I need to travel out of town.
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|This movie was probably great in the movie theater, but we watched it in Spain on my ipad, so I am sure it lost a lot of features.  Plot was ok.  Worthy of renting.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I thought this was a great book and it was always keeping me on the edge wondering what was going to  happen next and how every one came through for Agust and knew that just because he looked different doesn't mean that they could not be friends with him.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|Great challenging game however why does it say need network connection to play then close whenever I open it? I have 4g open and the game isn't restricted in my phone.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you so much for adding this game to your kindle fire HD list. This game is so addictive I can't put it down. I would highly recommend this game to everyone of all ages. its very simple for anyone to understand how to play. and the levels get more challenging as you go that's what keeps it fun and interesting. Happy Crushing Everyone.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I'm a big fan of these nonogram style puzzles.  The color adds a twist to the logic that I am still getting used to, but the resulting picture can be more satisfying in the end.  If you enjoyed the original, this is definitely a good choice.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Best headsets i have ever had . Fast shipping , five stars 👍👍👍👍 I recommand you buying these head sets you will not regret it .
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My six year old loves to play this game. Her favorite part of the game is being able to buy her own horses. There are lots of cute ones to choose from.
B00FOWX6NM|1.0|The cover was pathetic. The back portion is full of scratches. I cant even say that it was used. It was worst than used. There were 2 free back stickers but that does not mean the back portion should be so bad. Don't go by image, in the image the back looks crystal clear but thats not the case actually.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|My husband loved this weird, violent and funny first season. Love Brian Cranston......can't wait to watch the next season and the next, then the next...etc
B00CTT9646|4.0|The packaging was outstanding, from the cover art design to the enclosing support packing material. The movie is of course, most excellent and worth the price - getting the new (old?) phaser is just icing on the cake.<br />Had to drop one star because the stun-kill flip unit is a bit less positive in its two lock positions than it should be, but other than that an excellent prop.
1592402038|5.0|This author is an Englishwoman, but the problems she attacks apply equally well to us. I like her approach: stop being passive. When you see a sign that reads &#34;Shoe's for sale&#34;, whip out your marker pen and obliterate that illiterate apostrophe. Widespread illiteracy is not just confined to mistaking a possessive for a plural. She gives an easily understandable review of punctuation and grammar that you didn't get in school if you are less than 60.
B00EY7MFKS|5.0|Excellent story-line in keeping with the Marvel SHIELD agency creation, maintaining the juxtaposition with the movies and an interesting and believable extension of the characters lives.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Really enjoy this film and made yiu think abiut your own sourvior.this was realky well made and all the actors doing a good job.
B00846TTDG|5.0|This was great.  OK  at times a little contrived but overall very good.  Highly recommended.  Not the best ever made but a good effort
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I jumped on the hunger games bandwagon right before the movie came out. And I have stayed on it ever since. This is a fantastic story that really makes you feel for the characters and makes you continue reading even when you try to stop for the night. I have truly enjoyed this series.
B00A93ENX8|2.0|This is a digital recording that Kevin Gray attempted to make sound analog and the result is dark and muddy compared to the original Bob Ludwig master.
B00FWLSOOG|5.0|The movie was fast-paced from beginning to end, with a solid plot, great acting, and awesome special effects.  Although portions of Pacific Rim were obviously leveraged from a great many movies, its entirety was woven together to create a unique movie that was greater than the sum of its pieces.  The night I rented Pacific Rim, I enjoyed it so much that I purchased the HD digital copy for my video library and watched it again the very next night.
B00AAI7B7W|5.0|A good depiction of how evil works, insinuating itself into seemingly innocent places and sometimes hard to believe. The characters are believable and develop through the story. The story is in the forefront, not special effects.
B0002KVULG|5.0|This is the best Dracula still, Frank Langella was so elegant. You wanted to throw open the window, put on the black nightie and say yes!!!!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Best. Book. EVER!!! Don't wait, read it. Cannot believe they have not published the second book. Can we PLEASE move away from paper book publishing?!?

B004S4LAAS|2.0|I  love Ken Follett Books but this one seems to have been written by someone else. Gratuitous and cheap sexual content does not do him justice. I am only 50% through so far and maybe it will improve but at this stage it is like a cheap schoolboy thriller and compares most unfavourably to the majority of his other books - all of which I have enjoyed.
B005LAIHYU|3.0|It has an interesting spin on President Lincoln. Laced with history and draped in fiction I would rank it with the movie Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|You may loved the Shining, i like it, but compare to Doctor Sleep, the Shining is just a plain one chapter of horror and none chapter of action, thrilling and romance.<br /><br />Doctor Sleep has everything cover, from a very large set of characters, and most of them have a history behind them so you can love or hate or fear them.<br /><br />I want to say more, but i won't, you just have to read the book to find out!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|As others remarked, this version is much older than what is sold on GooglePlay.<br /><br />I contacted Popcap to ask them why they won't update the app on Amazon. I waited a week with no response so I contacted them again. This time I got a stock answer that didn't even relate to my question. I responded asking why I should ever spend money with Popcap again if money spent on Amazon is worth less than another app store, since I have to go buy it elsewhere to get an update. That time I got a human reply saying they understood and stay tuned, they have a lot in store in the near future.<br /><br />That was about 4 months ago. Still no update. I'd give this app a great rating if it weren't for their horrible attitude towards customers. This used to sell here for $6 and no update for past customers . It is updated on Google and is now $1 over there. Deplorable practices.
B000FA675C|4.0|Very suspenseful novel with twists on the truth to make it really interesting. Very thought-provoking. A bit graphic in spots.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|It is the best! I love helping them and not having them die but I also like watching them die from a new perspective.
B00FEHXISA|5.0|This was great! I love that Pepper Potts had more of a role this time. Loved the villain.  It really wrapped up the &#34;Iron Man&#34; series well.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Good game but lags (slows down) if there are too many farm animals with spawn eggs. OTHER THAN THAT GREAT GAME! For parents,I'll just say that your kid will like this game if they have Xbox or PC versions. The only other problem there is is that it is expensive. Hope you + your child will enjoy!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I absolutely love this game! It is much better than most free hunting games out there and the graphics are good :)
B002ZG97LK|5.0|I have always liked this movie now i own it.<br />I have seen this every time i get a chance too.i usually. see it with someone. different every. time.  thanks
B00C5R7F8G|4.0|This book tells the story of the US nuclear program from a mostly military point of view, but also includes some of the political story.  The central tale, about the Damascus incident in 1980, provides the backbone for this book as other chapters bounce back in time to bring the reader up to speed on US nuclear policy and procedure.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|great game for killing time and fun just when you think it is easy you thought wrong have fun and enjoy hours of gaming
B00D3Y1C8Y|5.0|Figuarts Zero does it again with this badass Battle Ver. Zoro figure, proving once again that One Piece figures are the best anime figures out there and this figure really proves it. It is a well detailed figure with a sweet paint job and awesome battle effects for Zoro's &#34;Rengoku Onigiri&#34; attack. I almost love this figure as much as I love the Luffy Battle Ver. figure. Getting Zoro on the stand was kind of tricky, but getting his swords in his hands was an even bigger pain in the ass (Wish they would've made his hand holes a little bigger). That's why you've got to be very careful when putting the swords in Zoro's hands or setting him up in general (Recommend taking it slow). Other than that, this is a badass figure and a must have for everyone's One Piece collection. Get this figure, you will get your money's worth! Can't wait for Sanji!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|very easy to play and very addicting! I love this game as much as I love piazza!! and I love piazza a whole lot!!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|It work for free. There are other apps that do not allow you to use the actions that this app does.
B00004RJ71|5.0|Great Oldie Movie. Life in the hood, reflects on the choices one can make and how life will be because of those choices. Talent can be used to the fullest or thrown out like rubbish. Entertaining long movie but worth it.
B00AFPTSI0|2.0|An interesting treatise on giving and taking.<br />I agree with the author's central philosophy, which can be summarized as follows -<br /><br />Be a giver, to everyone except takers. When you meet a taker, don't give freely, only match.<br /><br />I give the book 2 stars because the author doesn't back up his philosophy. For example, he talks about a writer for the Simpson's, who obtained a modicum of success by giving selflessly. However, we'll never know how successful the writer could have been if he'd taken credit for his contributions.<br /><br />Midler's book &#34;Influence: Why Some People Have It and Some People Don't&#34; is a more accurate description of the world.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It works great and amazing functionality for the price. I still use my roku mainly but when I want to stream something from an online website to my computer this is definitely the best way.
0670024856|5.0|This book is Elizabeth Gilbert at her best. I've been drawn in from the story from the very beginning and it hasn't lost my interest. It's a fascinating story - well written and touching so many points on the globe .
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was the best book I've read in a long time. I hate that it took me so long to get around to reading it!
B009XHAM8G|5.0|I first heard this story in 1996 and cried in front of my first graders.  It was difficult to explain my emotions, but I think they knew it made me happy and sad at the same time.  I StILL cry EVERY time I read  or hear it read. What a beautiful story!! I have a paper back copy packed away. I was so excited to find this Kindle copy. Thank you Robert Munsch and Amazon.  My own children listened as I raved about this story when they were younger. ( too young to appreciate it then)  I hope to be reading it to my grandchildren some day soon!  My very favorite children's book! If one reads this and<br /> doesn't enjoy it, he/she  has ice water for blood!  Wonderful story!
B006AN78XS|5.0|Great movie! Classic Woody Allen! Character development through dialogue against a beautiful city-Paris! It's in company with movies like Sideways
B00FWAZ87I|5.0|This album is a beautiful  and ingenious piece of audio art and adventure. Every Ayreon album has a signature sound that you can tell belongs to Arjen. Lots of wonderful collaborations and harmonies as usual. I never expected any less and my expectations were exceeded once again.
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|Very disappointed in this app.  I purchased this app,  played the game 1 time and the next time I went to play it,  it locks/freezes up then boots me out.  I've uninstalled and tried to reinstall and it won't let me.

B0054KLVRC|1.0|A very disappointing book. I always finish books I start but this one I just couldn't bring myself to finish.  I hated reading it.

B007REV4T8|5.0|I have a few complaints about this movie, but not enough for the reduction in stars.  Overall, I think this was the best Daniel Craig Bond film yet.  It was humorous, action-packed, and was brimming over with really good performances from everyone.  I'm happy to hear he's probably making at least one more film, though some of my minor complaints about this one make me nervous for the next installment.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|It does exactly what i want it to do! I suggest this app for everybody. Including y'all. Do it. Okay? Okay.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I recently added CC to my Fire original tablet.  The game has errors when you try to request the Train ticket from FB friends.  I had to eventually log into my pc to get that feature to work.  The game is so much fun to play while frustrating at the same time.  It is so addictive.
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|Thought provoking book about technology, social media and personal privacy.  Characters could have been developed alot more and halfway through the book I began to feel like the author is setting this up to be a series of books so the book doesnt actually have a ending. Still an interesting look into how far we let technology into our day to day living.

B0031Q5T10|5.0|First off this movie is the best I have ever seen. Second off, the film is an Aligory for racism in Africa, how can so many people not see this! The acting is amazing, the directing is great and the film is beautiful. And I feel bad for anyone who can't see that.this film is a work of art and I recomend it to everyone with a strong stomach for gore.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|Awesome , for years I didn't see this movie because it was older . But one of the best period piece movies I have seen for some time
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|a great beginning and introduction to the land off oz. I can't wait to read the rest of the books. strange that such a classic story I have grown up with turns a new leaf.

B003ODIZL6|1.0|I did not like it because I am a kid and it was boring<br /> And I hated so muck I broke my Xbox
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The game is a lot of fun. But I don't like being limited by time just because I can't get through a level. The only way to get more time is to buy it. This game is very enjoyable for kids and adults, but promotes gambling  by making you want to buy more time. I would rather have paid a one time fee and just be able to continue playing the game.<br /><br />to to cont
B0032FPVKE|5.0|The bag quite small, easily grippable with one average adult size hand.  It's well padded, with a soft-grip handle, one divider panel, and three external zippered pockets (two small, one large with net).  There's plenty of room in the pockets for as many spare batteries as you can carry/afford (at least 10 Sonys!), a USB cable, remote trigger, etc.<br /><br />Like the title says, it's as if this bag was made for the Sony NEX 6/7 (they share the same body).  Just got my NEX 6 + Sigma 30mm 2.8, and they sit in the bag perfectly.  Should be enough room to fit other mounted lenses, too, like the kit lenses or Sony/Sigma/Zeiss primes.  The Sony 55-210 and super zooms will probably be too tall, though.  In addition, there's enough extra room inside with the divider in place to fit another medium/short lens sideways, maybe with a lens cloth over it to keep the lens from contacting the camera's body.<br /><br />The only negative I can think of is maybe there should have been an added storage pocket inside the top of the bag, as well.  Brands like Lowepro or Case Logic will add as many pockets as they can fit on a bag, inside and out, regardless of if you'll ever use/find them.  But considering the price, I have no right to complain!<br /><br />If you have a Sony NEX camera or a mirrorless/compact of similar size, and don't want a huge, unwieldy bag to lug your tiny camera around with, this is what you've been looking for, at an unbeatable price!

B000PUV1ZI|1.0|We were half way through the movie and decided we wanted to finish it another day. Upon returning, prime instant video was no longer available for us to choose! Instead we would have to buy it. Didn't see that coming!<br /><br />Love the movie, but that was kinda silly. Forewarning though, I guess you never know which movie will only stream for free once.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is super epic. The graphics are incredible. When you go for the final shot in a hunt you have a bullet cam. The camera actually follows the bullet until it hits its target. How amazing is that. Ad free, perfect for anybody who can handle the challenge of getting attacked by a wolf or scoping out a deer or bear. 5/5 stars.
B00555X8OA|1.0|The reading experience of this book is terrible, no pleasure at all. The content is poorly organized. No conclusion  at the end of each section and chapter, and no summary in the beginnings. The length of sections are uneven, the writing style is inconsistent.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It's Oz, it's great. That's all I have to say about it but unfortunately you need to write twenty words to review a book so I can't just write the review I wanted which was... it's Oz, it's great.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|great family entertainment.  I enjoyed it the first time I saw it and when I ran across it here I had to have it<br />and enjoyed it again.  well written and filmed, plenty of action and special effects.  whats the next level down<br />from pg 13  - 7yr olds ?  there is a monster so watch it before the younger ones see it.

0375869026|4.0|As the synopsis suggests, Wonder is a novel about kindness, empathy, and compassion. And Bullying. But mostly, Wonder is a book about courage. The courage August needs to put a smile on his disfigured face everyday. The courage his friends show in loving and protecting August despite their own ambitions.<br /><br />Wonder is a middle grade novel, written specifically with middle school children in mind, but the lessons learned are valuable for all ages. Written from the alternating points of view of six adolescent children, Palacio takes her readers through August’s first year of real school. Until the fifth grade, because of the number of surgeries necessary to repair his cleft palette and facial disfigurements, August had been homeschooled by his mother. These alternating points of view add depth and insight into the plot.  While none of the secondary points of view are well developed, these voices are effective in validating Auggie’s character.<br /><br />At the beginning of every month, Auggie’s English teacher writes a precept on the blackboard, a rule to live by, for the children to contemplate before writing their response. The precepts I appreciated the most were the ones the students sent in to their teacher during the following summer.<br /><br />If your mother is anything like mine, she harped on you constantly about the proper use of pronouns. Never put yourself first! I beat on my children about their poor grammar all the time, to no avail. My hope is, one day they will finally hear it like I hear it when someone uses a pronoun incorrectly. It grates my nerves like someone running their fingernails down a chalkboard.<br /><br />My one beef with this novel is the improper use of pronouns. To make matters worse, the majority of the errors were made when the pronoun was the subject of the sentence. Fourteen instances, in fact, but who’s counting.<br /><br />I understand Palacio was hoping to authenticate the voices of her characters by adopting the language they speak. But as writers, we have a responsibility to set an example. To do otherwise is putting our stamp of approval on incorrect grammar.<br /><br />Interested in more of my book reviews?

B000KIPT30|3.0|Has some static, but works. We use this in our podcast studio so everyone get's a pair of headphones. The static is slight, and for spoken word doesn't cause a problem, but definitely not an audiophile piece of equipment.
B0035V35P8|4.0|Would have been 5 if they hadn't killed off Kang Sung's character.  There are no movies with his character dying that get a 5.  That being said, I can agree there is a lot of blood and gore in this movie.  However, the subject is killing by ninjas who use blades not guns.  Expect blood and gore.  The storyline is a young man forcibly trained as a ninja who runs away after his first assassination assignment.  Rain(Bi) was awesome in this movie.  To be able to do the things he did physically without training from a young age is pretty impressive.  I'm used to watching him to see those beautiful eyes and charming smile.  This guy scared the #$%^& out of me during the first part of the movie.  I found the movie very intense, but then I seldom agree with the critics about what makes a good movie.  I also don't have any prejudices about 'singers' acting.
1439102732|4.0|I really like most Jodi Picoult books and have read nearly all of them.  They are especially good for flights or travel, any time that you need time to pass quickly.  In that regard, this book lived up to my expectations.<br /><br />The main issue that I had with this book was the rushed timeline.  It felt as though Zoe went from being married to Max to being married to Vanessa within a year.  That did not make me feel hugely supportive of Vanessa and Zoe -- but not because they were lesbians.  I just felt like Zoe had a stillborn child, got a divorce, and remarried so quickly that I would question the second union even if it was with a man.<br /><br />The second issue with this book is that I would have like to have Lucy's ending flushed out a bit more.  Like most of Picoult's books, there is a twist at the end.  I admit that I usually read the books looking for the twist, but this one was fairly obvious.  Max came to the realization of what happened a few pages after I did, but I wished this process was flushed out a bit more.  Instead of a chapter at the end about Samantha, I would have liked a chapter from Lucy's perspective to see how the allegations of sexual abuse really happened.  Did Clive Lincoln plant the seed in her head?  Did Lucy come out to her family and Clive Lincoln assumed it was because of sexual harassment?  Did the math teacher report something?  I found this section to be very rushed and would have liked to hear more about what happened to Lucy and if she was okay after the allegations of sexual abuse.  For the whole book, it sounded like Zoe was the only person who really got through to Lucy, and now that Zoe is gone, I wonder how Lucy was able to cope.<br /><br />Thirdly, what happened with Reid and Liddy?  I'll admit that Reid was far from my favorite character in the book, but a betrayal from both his wife and his brother would have been a huge blow.  In the epilogue, Samantha indicated that Liddy and Max are getting married, but I would have liked to hear more about the fallout between Reid and Liddy.  As a side note, I didn't think people like Liddy (who did not work or even have a checking account) even existed anymore.<br /><br />Overall, this book falls within Picoult's wheelhouse:  controversial topic with many sides, court scene at the end, sarcastic attorney.  I was throughly entertained and enjoyed reading this book, but it was far from her best.

B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Denzel Washington was great in the starring role.  The supporting cast was excellent as well.  I recommend this movie for anyone who is an adult.  I wouldn't want teenagers or children watching it.  However, this movie does have a place among mature viewers.  The flight scene isn't to be missed!!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I'm getting tired of seeing that Facebook has update right away when I open my Facebook app then when I press update I'm prompted to my browser and it tells me it's installed. If there's no update that I can have then why waste my time having me go thru that? And please Amazon, just make Google Play accessible on the kindle fire hd. I'm gettin bored with the apps in the Amazon store and would like to access games I used to play on my phone.

B002ZG981E|5.0|This is one of the most amazing and movies ever made.  The complexity of the plot, the acting to bring these characters to life, and the special effects (which support, rather than overshadow) are all Oscar worthy.  I've watched it 3 times and still love it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game...nice graphics. I really enjoy playing this game with my two year old. He thinks it is so much fun!
B00C5R7F8G|4.0|I am a so-called post-war child. Now I understand I am really a cold-war child.<br />I was afraid for the thermonuclear armageddon for forty years and now understand that I had every reason for it.<br />This book also made me realize that I had been lied to during all those years - and still are.<br />If you think that the biggest threat to our survival comes from rising CO2-levels or asteroid collisions, please read this book.<br />May I also mention that the book is well researched, well written - and more exciting than any sci-fi novel?
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Simple, quick, easy, effective!!!  This app allows you to quickly and easily clean out cache for all apps (even system apps), increase battery life with task killer, backup/uninstall apps. Uses low system resourses, app is under 6 mb, can use as needed or set reminders or automatic tasks to help keep your device clean, lean and running smooth!
B00G32VYDG|2.0|I am easily entertained and this movie was just not great. I really like Ryan but....  Not a must see
B00CH26TL8|1.0|Pretty boring bubble game, especially compared to other bubble games like BubbleMania from TeamLava, it's even more of a letdown after playing Candy Crush.
B001F6ZIXW|2.0|If you are into badass white boys getting even with a world that opposes them, you might like this series. It has a strong anti-latino bias (i.e. racist) but again: &#34;your milage may vary&#34;. Acting and production are pretty good.
0061950726|3.0|It's an interesting read, though I suspect there are lots of  other books on this subject, some fiction and some non-fiction. I was familiar with this historical practice, so it wasn't a new subject. For someone unfamiliar with this part of our history, the book would be enlightening and therefore more interesting. I read this for a neighborhood book club, which may be an indication of the sophistication of the book. The story begins with the story of girl who comes to the US with her parents from Ireland and is subsequently orphaned. She is soon put on a train to the Midwest to be adopted by a loving family or put into indentured servitude by a less benevolent one. After that, the book flips back and forth in time and becomes more complicated. I fear that any real detail about the story line might give away too much. This is a fairly well written fast read. Good for the beach or a snowy afternoon.
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|The first time my wife and I tried to watch this film we agreed to turn it off after twenty minutes - it was that unsettling and touched all the obvious nerves: of losing each other, of losing children, of helplessness. A few weeks later I decided to try it out again myself. I found the first third of the film very difficult to handle (for the above reasons) and was glad to see it over. The terrible suffering I found unnerving. But when a few rays of hope showed themselves and the arc of the story made itself apparent I was glad to see it through. It is a rough ride. Brilliant acting.
B00EHMG358|5.0|I've always enjoyed the books of Preston and Child, particularly the Pendergast series.  White Fire promises to deliver an original, spine-tingling read.  I am also pleased with the return of the character of Corrie Swanson as I find the relationship between Pendergast and Swanson intriguing and original.  Stay tuned!
B005544V6A|4.0|Great Show, it was worth the time loading on my IPAD. Looking forward to the next season.  Keep up the good work
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|Very addictive.  I feel like Werner VonBraun.  Gives tutorials how to make a rocket ship, and then you try and best your previous flight.
B009O2XY12|4.0|It is another mindless bubblegame but has some different challenges so it has taken me awhile to work to the top (I am not sure if I am at the end or need to earn more stars).  I find that I can go back to different levels and its not boring.  The one thing I don't like is that it has an aboslute 5 lives with a long period of time between earning new ones and even if you pass a level you lose a life.
B0035LJY6C|5.0|They don't make comedies like this any more.  Over-the-top characters - the acting is great, the script is genius - watch it.
B0070YDOT8|1.0|after down loading ,  it did not work at all.  i guess you get what you pay for.removed from device
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is definitely the best puzzle game that I have ever played. I look forward to more games like this.
B00902AKK4|3.0|This is a scrolling platform game where you move a bug through a series of boxes with various maze-like interiors in order to save the kingdom from nasty evil spiders. The concept is cute and the game itself is interesting, however, the game pay leaves something to be desired. Your bug does not always respond when the jump \\"button\\" is pressed on the Kindle Fire HD. Sometimes, the boxes that are being turned with freeze before moving. The screen seems to lock up, but then it continues. It can get very frustrating to see what needs to be done in order to move the critter along, but not be able to do so since the response from the buttons can also be delayed.<br /><br />I did not see any strange permissions and there are not in-app purchases that I could see so it automatically scores 2 stars. The game is interesting and has potential for being a great time-waster, so I added another star.  However, the game play can be so difficult that I can't add any more. If the developer fixes these game play / button response issues, it will get more stars. The concept is good, it is just the response of the buttons can be so far off it is difficult to play.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|This trilogy started out great, but ended completely Flat!! If I had known book three was going to be so off path from the first two books I wouldn't have wasted the time reading it much less the money buying it. Very disappointed.
B008Q00PHY|5.0|Action packed the movie kept you in suspend. I totally enjoyed the movie. I recommend it to anyone. Thank you.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a really fun app.  A little challenging but not too hard to figure it out and find the items.  Found only one math screen in one of the levels that was a bit tricky.  But thinking about it for awhile and doing some figuring I was able to figure it out. Overall, I give this game 5 stars.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|This game is very entertaining.It has lots of games to play and a<br />lmost all of them are awesome!!!super cool!
B00FOU1O3S|1.0|It's boring.When I played it ads want to pop up and you pay to remove ads. Worse when I was unable to use wifi NONE of my apps wanted to work. I have always been able to play offline at work and suddenly I couldn't. I removed it and had no trouble.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I’m really enjoying the way it was written, the characters, the action, the atmosphere andthe world created and the language!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Actors are perfectly type-cast. Great script. Great story-lines. Lover Harvey's suits! Actor playing Louis Litt is great in his role.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Awesome little device!  Would love for Google to add more features in the near future (via firmware update).  Can't go wrong at this price.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Lots of fun. But the thing i dont like is once your past a certain point you have tp buy more to continue. Other than that's.its fun,
B00EO10M54|4.0|Exactly what I expected. All the songs I expected were on here.  a little weird threat she raps but not obscure.
B009CVRQLY|5.0|Celine's unmistakable talent always raises the quality of music above the mundane rabble of pop music. Lets hope that this a new beginning for an amazing artist. Six years is a long time to wait for a new Celine Dion English Album. The track &#34;Always Be your Girl&#34; is a heart tearing ballad full of emotion that only Celine can deliver with such feeling.
006202406X|1.0|I really wanted to love this book. I LOVED divergent and insurgent. This book was so disappointing. The writing was awful, the characters were poorly developed, the plot didn't make sense. The love story that really wasn't was such a let down. If you loved the first two you will not love this book.
B00G2SIW7M|5.0|Incredibly creative, different from Suburbs, yet still retaining the musical identity they have forged over several records. This record makes me want to dance and that is strange for me. The lyrics definitely have something to say but it may take a couple listens to arrive at your own conclusion. I should probably listen to this record another ten times before writing this revue. Reflektor is a deep work.
B00ECJ18HO|5.0|Still one of the most important novels in the genre! If you have not read any Holmes stories, this is the one to spark interest.
B00BG4RLF6|5.0|Oh my.  I'm not sure where to start.  When I first sampled this album, Overgrown,  it promised great things and once I purchased it, I was not disappointed in the least.  It's haunting and hip, dance worthy on a techno and contemporary level. Smooth with R&B flavor held up with a DJ beat mix support.  I've never heard such a diverse arrangement all in one place!  I sort of think of James Blake as the male version of Bjork – but milder.  Wildly unique and original.<br /><br />Love the album.  It’s one of my favorite purchases this year.
B00E3BK0QQ|3.0|I had fun with the little part of the game that is available. I didn't think that the description in the app store was very clear about this only being a demo. I was also expecting more hidden object type puzzles and if that is what you are looking for then this game isn't it. The puzzles are more figuring out where to find different items and how to use them in different ways.
B00D8HNR2K|3.0|Surprising to not rate this album with 5 stars.  I'm a HUGE Nine Inch Nails fan and have been for years...all the way back to when they were signed with TVT Records.<br /><br />Hesitation Marks is softer than I expected.  Mellow, rhythmic yes, but not the head banging hard rocking deep base rolling sounds that I've become acquainted with from NIN.<br /><br />It's a good album, some songs are top 40 worthy...which I have mixed feelings about:-).<br /><br />Check it out and tell us what you think!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I enjoy this game. Addictive to the max. Not fond of asking for help from friends. Keep seeing these images when resting
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have heard a lot of people talk about this game. So when it came out on my kindle I decided to try it. I love it: it is very addicting it is hard to wait sometimes when you lose and have to wait 5 or10 min. for more chances.
147676459X|2.0|This book is simply a recycle of the work on her blog with a couple of new posts added in, I am sure, to justify the print cost.  I was expecting more.
B00AXVIHBU|2.0|The longer this series goes on the more contrived-feeling and melodramatic it gets.  It's become less and less about real character growth and the history of the time.  Season 1 was excellent, but after the wedding at the beginning of this 3rd season, I called it quits before some long drawn out scandal, murder, explosion, mass disease, servant cutthroating, or all of those things went on.  However, Maggie Smith's character is awesome in all episodes, so an extra star for her.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great read, I didn't want to put it down.  The follow-up story of Danny Torrance and what happened after the Overlook hotel.
B006MW3V6U|3.0|Not worth buying the dvd to see the extra scenes cut out of the American version. Scenes were too short to be worth the money.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I am extremely surprised with the negativity of the reviews posted so far!<br />Here are my top 3 issues with the reviews that irritate me the most:<br />1) Reality check: Life is not easy, fun, and is not always happily ever after in the sense that everyone is undamaged and psychologically stable in the end.<br />2) The alternating \\"voices\\" of this book are a little different, but a neat experience. It is done well enough that for those of us reading with a healthy imagination, it actually does enhance the story. I much prefer it to the style that has been used in other major YA series in which books are sectioned off in big chunks when switching character voices. My children are 8 and 6, and when reading this to them, they can get it. If they can, I'm pretty sure the target YA audience will be able to figure it out.<br />3) This is YA SERIES!!! Do we really want all books our children read to give them the illusion that it is not possible to be happy unless you get a \\"fairytale\\" ending? I actually enjoyed the ending, in the sense that when the story started there were a bunch of miserable selfish kids that actually matured and learned to cope with life as it was handed to them, whether fair or not. AND, they learned to apologize, forgive, and hold themselves accountable. Bad ending??? I don't understand...<br />To sum it up, I think this series is a great addition to the YA genre. It is unique in the sense that it is more about mental survival than, for example, the Hunger Games. It is more believable than a life with vampires, and just adds its own flavor. If you as a ready enjoys these series, as well as the Harry Potter or the Gregor the Overlander series, I don't think you will be disappointed with this book. Kudos to Ms. Roth for keeping it different and interesting until the very end!
B00902AKK4|5.0|Every level presents a different puzzle. This is quite challenging and obviously designed for puzzle fans who like to think outside the box. A direct link is provided  to the solution on U-Tube.  Besides being original (not easy these days), this game is FUN.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I do not wach very much tv. Sports , thats about it.<br />I am hooked on this show. Well done!
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|Loved the references to the 80's! Brought back many memories of UHF and VHF shows that my children will never see.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Very good movie.  Not what you'd expect from Mr. Pitt.  I highly enjoyed it while taking notes for when zombies make their way into my town.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I've followed this story line since the first episode.  The story is attention keeping, the character surprising, the acting is pretty dadgum good.  I am looking forward to seeing all the happily ever afters eventually.
B00F031WB8|5.0|I'm studying guitar and a well documented look into the life of a pioneer into the discovery of individual style like this \\"Hear My Train A Comin'\\" is a valuable guideline to details like \\"he always had his guitar with him\\" and other comments by friends are helpful to my own study. This valuable documentary looks at the details of a life of one who was fully devoted to his craft and his desire. It's a story about passion and drive and how various twists and turns go together to make the outcome complete. In this case, Jimi Hendrix accomplished the things he set out to do and even excelled to the highest level of stardom. This story also shows that success takes sacrifice, hard work and focus. There are thrilling excerpts and music clips included so it is not bogged down in just information, I mean, a story like this is about the music, so we should hear it as well and the producers made sure there is enough included to make the point of the quality and excellence of Jimi's talent. This is a great video on many levels and I rate it as a full five stars.
B005EGXNLS|5.0|I bought this book when it was on sale and I'm very glad I did.  I really got to love the main character, Ulred.  So much so that now I'm going back to read the entire series starting at book one the last kingdom.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I read that at some point I will have to purchase the full version as I am playing the free version now. I this is true I will most certainly be buying it. I just started playing and already I don't want to stop. Great graphics and sound on my Kindle Fire hd.
B009CVRQLY|5.0|Love the album, especially incredible with Ne-Yo and of course Love Me Back to Life. Amazing job again Celine. You cease to amaze me.
B0094K1IPI|4.0|I went abroad and after seeing what's left of the amazing colosseum I wanted to experience once again through the eyes of Hollywood. Gladiator does a good and mostly accurate job of bringing it all back to life
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|What can I say, ADDICTIVE! If you want to past the time away, play this game. And for free, you can't beat that.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|BEST VERSION EVER! FABULOUS CASTING! I play the DVD just to listen to in the background (I'm too cheap to shell out extra $ for the soundtrack, which I'm sure is great, too).
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I cannot seem to put these books down. Hours and hours go by before I know it; and at that point it's hard to stop for the anticipation for what will happen next.<br /><br />One of the best series I have EVER stuck my nose into.<br /><br />I hear many people talk about how much they love the show on HBO. All I want to do is scream at them! (Dont get me wrong it is a good show) It doesn't even do the books justice. Every thought in every characters head comes to life. He paints such a good mental portrait at all times.<br /><br />I'm quite sad I will soon be done.<br /><br />All in all. 5 thumbs up.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|Was one of those books did not want to put down. Kept interest all the way through. Liked her writing and immediately ordered her next book.
B00EVW0VTI|5.0|Best action packed movie I have seen in years--Everything , casting--story line--flawless.  Kept me on edge of seat through whole movie.
B008Q0AP2E|5.0|A most excellent adaptation of Anne Rice's novel.<br />While I loved Kirsten Dunst and Brad Pitt in the movie, I believe there could have been a better choice than Tom Cruise for the Lestat role.
B00BEIYMAG|3.0|I could hardly wait for the movie to come out. I ordered it on pay per view for $5.99 .  I am now thankful that I didn't buy this on DVD because I was let down. My expectations were very high with all the hype and the previews looked great.  I have seen other movies that really scared me.  Haunting in Connecticut, is a true story with a lot more being scared for your money.
B0075MFS9Y|2.0|This record has no tracks that are as strong as Ho Hey.  If you buy it based on the strength of that track, you will be disappointed.  I am.<br /><br />Beyond that the engineering job on the recording itself leaves a lot to be desired.  There is this cheesy ever-present echo that ends up driving me crazy.  The mix lacks overall clarity.  It sounds like the lead singer is singing into a tin can and to fix it they ran the vocal through a budget echo loop (I mean seriously it sounds like the echo loop on the karaoke machine they have at Costco during the holidays).  I don't even enjoy listening to it the recording is THAT bad.  They should have skipped the effects and just straight up recorded the damn thing.  Someone went a bit too nuts with Pro Tools and it takes away from everything.<br /><br />Download Ho Hey and save the change.
B00EVW013E|4.0|Good movie!  I like all the action in it. I also liked the people in the movie . It is worth watching
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Good story, good twists, ending was a little flat though, would def recommend, but not a twice see. Good casting.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|It's one of the things I use to judge a book:Do I want to read the next one NOW? Or can I read a couple of others in between?  I want it now!
B002RKSZWG|5.0|Jane Austen writes a beautiful love story. Of all the classics I have read, Jane Austen is my favourite.<br />Thankful.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|This is the only music I have listened to for the past week. Still not bored of it!!!!! Very soothing.
B00CWX1HPA|5.0|Pay attention, this is a review of the BLU RAYE not the dvd or (gasp) vhs tape version. Can't believe that over 90 percent of the poor reviews are not from the BLU RAYE. If you're a fan of this old series, you'll about to cry for joy when you see the results of this BLU RAYE...this movie NEVER looked or sounded so good! It has at least twice the color and detail of the dvd (movie) version and do not even bother to compare it with the horrible pilot version from the dvd series set. Now remember this is the movie NOT the three hour pilot and because of that the story line of two of the major characters are completely different then in the series. And I'm not going to debate which of the two is better, only to say that this version has it's strong points and it shows them very well. The live action is razor sharp and for the first time the special effects are well truly special, with none of the fallouts or decomposer problems found in the complete series dvds. No you finally get to see effects that are as good, if not better then those found in the original Star Wars...check out the matt work, it's very clean and tight..good enough that I wouldn't doubt that a lot of the new CGI crowd would be impressed. The sound, while not 7.1 will also impress you, I had to back off the volume I usally play my movies at, as I thought my sud woofer might go terminal. One big problem with this release..there are NO EXTRAS...I'm sure Richard Hatch would have loved to do an audio track. That problem aside as a fan I couldn't be more pleased with this release and if you've never seen this show and are a sci fi fan...GIVE IT A TRY, you'll be glad you did.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This a really fun game to play if you need to waste time. I had a lot of fun with it.
1587143879|5.0|The author has a clear and direct. I'm sure that will help me in the certification exam. recommend buying. Thank you.
B007IHH4I4|3.0|I don't believe this is a 120 gram vinyl as they normally come with a 120 gram vinyl sticker.  The vinyl itself feels very light and do not match as per description.  Please review and change
B009Y6X65C|5.0|Been a fan of Joe Bonamassa for a long time now and this cd does not disappoint. If you are looking for some great guitar blues/rock...check it out.
B00650SSDU|5.0|This movie makes me giggle every time I watch it and it's alot. Justin and Mia do an amazing chemistry in showing you can be friends with Benefits.
B00881PTRC|5.0|I love the game graphics and I am learning to use my brain.  I enjoy changing the graphics from the hanging man to the snowman,  less scary for children.
B00F8MIIKO|4.0|This movie was very well done and it captures your attention from the start. We now get to see how Sullivan and Mike first met and became very close and great friends. A movie for the young and old.
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|I keep accidently press the use daimond button, needs to show do you want to spend daimonds otherwise exelent game
B00DW1WR14|4.0|I was not impressed with the album at first, but it grew on me in time. The opening song was probably the best opening to an album since 'Vs', but that is because of my background with religious ideologies being thrown at me, so getaway hits a little close to home. Mind your manners is one of the heavy tracks on the record but it still flaws flat to me, might be the mixing, might be the weak drums, it just doesn't have the punch that 'The fixer' had. My father's son I found distrubing and disliked it at first, but I found myself humming the chorus the other day. It is a unique song that will grow on you. Sirens is a beautiful song, mainly the lyrics hit home for anyone who has gone through a serious relationship (something greater than 5+ years). Whenever PJ take on the issue of personal relationships, (Black, Sirens, Just Breathe) they tend to knock it out of the park.  Lightening Bolt has the right beat and is hopefully the direction PJ goes next time around. Infallible is another very new sound from PJ and the pacing of lyrics and bass is what sells it for me. Deep down I want PJ to be this rock and roll band, but then I forget how diverse sounding they can be and maybe I should be grateful for what they offer. The last half of the record has a very mild manner to it. It seems to have a Riot Act sound to it with a grass-rootey-guitar feel, particular Yellow Moon and Future Days, both of which are the okay. So the tracks I tend to find myself listening to are<br />1.Getaway, 2. Infallible, 3. Lightning Bolt, 4. Swallowed Whole, 5. My Father's Son, 6. Sirens 7. Pendulum
B00001QEE6|5.0|Favorite movie ever, and the disc doesn't skip and isn't scratched. Considering most old Disney DVDs are like $20+ it's a steal
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|This amazing story about an even more amazing young woman should be required reading for every American student, perhaps for every American, period. Malala is an incredible young woman who, since a very early age, had been dedicated to achieving education for girls in her native Pakistan. I found my own education enhanced by the details about Pakistani history and more than once was stunned by the telling of events there which never made the news here. Malala herself put it well; we often do not appreciate something until it is taken away. I highly recommend this book to readers who care deeply about the state of our world and who are seeking hope in the midst of discouragement.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great twist at the end. I always like Grisham books but few can compare to a time to kill but this one is not bad. A great read!
0553386697|5.0|Great book recommended by my professor to help work and have a better understanding when working with children or adolescents.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I was very shocked at the end result in this book. I loved the rest of this book and I will always have this book on my mind!
B004HW7JI8|5.0|It's great to be able to sit down and have a watch-a-thon without commercials. It makes good for girls night.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! It's the only game I play. Keep updating it every so often. The only things I would do to make it more fun is to start over the hunt things. I like it to be challenging, so maybe starting that over with new rewards. Just a suggestion. Love it!  -Megan
B00CH26TL8|3.0|could be good but once you get to higher levels it is almost impossible to advance. would be better if you advanced when you beat the level using the bubbles but not needing some unreasonable score! wont be playing any more.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Awesome!! Very addicting game. Me and my kids play this and get so into this game, great family bonding<br /> tune
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love it. One of my favorite games to play when I'm traveling. Easy to play with one hand too .
B000056N8X|4.0|Loved seeing these two together. Always been a Lambert fan. The DVD trivia games was kinda neat too. Highly recommended.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is amazing, it woke me up right away. It took me 10 math problems to snooze, but I didn't want to go back to sleep. Just saying: buy this app, it is the best alarm app on  the AutoZone app store.
B004478AS4|5.0|Chinua Achebe's &#34;Things Fall Apart&#34; is a classic. It is kind of book you return to read over, every few years. If your goal is to know the truth about what Africa looked like before colonization, Things Fall Apart is the book. Achebe is a unique writer, his ability to communicate special incidents and events in a way that takes a permanent space in a reader's mind is incredible. Most importantly, Achebe's Things Fall Apart is a book that is wrtten to accommodate all levels of readers; you do not have to be very educated to read and understand Things Fall Apart.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Just by sheer enormity of it, this is the BIGGEST Zombie movie EVER. If you can &#34;get into it&#34;, then this will scare the crap out of you!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I cannot remember where I first heard about this book, but when I checked it out at the bookstore, I could not get past the first couple of pages.  When I saw the trailer for the upcoming movie, which intrigued me, I decided to give it another chance, and I am glad I did.  The author has a unique style, which I guess is not for everyone, but I liked it--could not wait to get back to it when I reluctantly had to eat or sleep.
B00FEHXISA|3.0|Not nearly as good as Iron man 1 & 2, hoping for a better movie when Iron man 4 comes out this one was just ok but good enough to keep the series rolling.
B003Y5H5F6|5.0|Big fan for Kate B.  Love everything Underworld - and this does not disappoint.  Both video and audio encodes are fantastic.  The bass LFE shakes the foundation for me.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I loved this whole trilogy of books. I cried right in the middle of my classroom when I read that Tris died. I hated how short the book was but that's just the way it is with good books.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|I don't have high expectations when it comes to headphones or earbuds or anything aside from a floorstanding speaker.<br /><br />Aside from that these sound great, think a amp would make them 10x better though.<br /><br />Good build quality and it looks great.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Excellent book !  Wish I could find more books as interesting as this one !  Loved it ! Can't wait for the authors next book
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|My Samsung Galaxy Note 3 can really consume a lot of power when the screen is running at full brightness, LTE is pulling down data for Pandora and Waze, the GPS is keeping tabs on location, and Bluetooth makes everything work with my car.  This unit not only keeps everything from depleting the phones battery, but also quickly charges my phone.  It also can charge (albeit at a slower rate) a Samsung Galaxy S3 (on, but merely waiting for a call).  This is what I'm looking for, and the clear labels help you find the right choice based on device (Android and Apple use different ways to draw excess power).
B00112GVFO|4.0|Good clean family entertainment full of action, adventure, comedy and little romance.  I have purchased this dvd because it is worth viewing yearly, it is something the whole family can watch together.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Allegiant is a departure from the first two books in the series but then there was actually a DEPARTURE.  The main characters are literally and figuratively in a new place.  It reads very differently.  They are having to process a lot of new information and figure out the best way to act.  So, there is a lot of mental activity and less action.  I liked this book but it IS different from the first two.  And, I felt like the ending was very fitting even though it was a bit unexpected.  Tris thought things out, assessed the situation and made a decision that she could 'live' with.  She was always the heroine of this series anyway.  Maybe the title of Allegiant should have been Divergent since it was really a departure from the first two books, but then divergent is good, isn't it?
B00G32VYDG|3.0|Not bad. The talent is top notch, but the story line could of been better. It was a fun movie overall though.
0756666937|5.0|Great Book for the Lego lover.  My husband and son pour over the book discussing the pieces in their collection and making wish lists of pieces they want.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This app is honestly the best I've ever used. Because the Kindle fire HD  hasn't come with anything that allows you to make your own videos this is ideal. I love it, hopefully you will too.
0345803485|5.0|What can I say...beat me, kick me, show me that you love me, Christian! Just kidding...I really loved this entire series. Lots of folks put it down - &#34;mommy porn&#34;, &#34;glamorizing abuse of women&#34;, etc. Lighten up. It's not Tolstoy. It's a sexy, fun escape and I absolutely loved the vacation.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It stimulates the brain to go beyond its daily usual and work harder. You must think with this game. I love it.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Game is fun...but like many others have commented...I don't like the pushing you to post on social media. If people want to play they will. I played before but quit when I couldn't seem to get any further without paying.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Wishing it was easier to move on sometimes.  Love game. Addicting. Keep losing lives though.  Hoping to continue playing through many mire levels but not sure.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Thank goodness he stuck to his strengths. Eminem at his best, with a terrific mix of tracks and flow. More tempered use of his yelling-rap style than in recent years. Just missing a Dre track or two.
B00FG1Q5J8|4.0|This game has amazing gameplay and replay ability. The mechanics are also cool with decision making and controlling the ship is very active and intense. The only complaint is that it needs more then what it has already, but none the less it is a must have for this game has great potential.
B008S6B41C|5.0|DEEP PURPLE'S MACHINE HEAD Album is the best Deep purple album ever equally as Good as IN ROCK, no doubt about it<br />all tracks on this album are fantastic just like all tracks on IN ROCK are fantastic<br /><br />the 25th Anniversary edition is 2 Disc set which has the Original album remastered<br /> and Disc 2 is the album remixed by Roger Glover<br />now i have this CD anyway both Discs sound similar in my opinion<br />but Disc 2 does sound a little bit different cause it's been remixed by Roger Glover<br />but everyone has an opinion, some fans will love the new Remix or hate it and prefer the Remastered version<br />i Grew up listening to the Original album done by Martin Birch so i prefer the Remaster<br />each track is emotional when i listen to it especially the intro in Lazy, best Organ intro ever<br />very tragic loss Jon Lord passing away<br /><br />Now fast forward years later over 10 years later and EMI releses this 40th Anniversary edition<br />which contains 4 Discs in a DVD Audio Disc<br />Disc 1 and 2 are both the Original album remastered and Roger Glover's remix of the album<br />that was released on the previous Anniversary edition<br />Disc 3 is the all new Quadraphonic stereo mix of the album<br />Disc 4 is the LIVE IN CONCERT 1972-PARIS THEATRE CONCERT that was released on Vinyl back in 1980<br />this Live concert has been given a a new 2012 remix, not a remaster, this was remastered by Spitfire back in 2001<br />i have the spitfire release and this new 2012 remix does sound better<br />and Disc 5 which is DVD Audio Disc of the whole album, which means you play this Disc on your DVD player<br />and the whole album plays like a CD player and you might get old vintage Photos of the band displayed on the screen<br />i never played the DVD audio so i don't know if it sounds Good or terrible<br />i thought what's the point of this DVD just another Marketing Gimmick i think, i couldn't see the point of it<br />i'm happy with the first 4 Discs anyway i've rip them to my Ipod<br />especially the new LIVE IN CONCERT 1972 2012 remix sounds really Good<br />plus in this 40th Anniversary boxset you get an all new Book,<br />thick book explaining the Legacy of Machine Head, the making of Machine Head, interviews with some of the band members and other Musicians that love the album<br />rare Photos aswell<br /><br />this album will live on for years to come, it's on the list as one of the best Hardrock classic album's ever in History<br />and this 40th Anniversary edition is definitely worth the money, better than the previous anniversary edition<br />cause both the Original remastered album and Roger Glover's remix of the album are included in this box set<br />so you get your money's worth for sure<br />and this box set Definitely deserves 5 stars
B003TSEEDY|5.0|it was a good story and i felt that i could have been one of the girls in the book. also it felt as if the story was taking place right here in the small town that i live in.
B000005RQT|5.0|One of my favourite Deep purple albums ever IN ROCK equally as Good as Machine head<br />The first Deep purple album with the Gillan, Glover, Lord, Paice and Blackmore Lineup<br />the band is fresh than ever when they made this album<br />that's why all tracks are killer hardrock songs and i am still listening to it today<br /><br />and with this new 25th Anniversary edition released in 1995 sounds even better<br />this album is that Good that Deep purple or EMI should've released a 35th Anniversary edition of the Album back in 2005<br />but for some reason it did not happen so Deep purple fans will have to accept this 25th Anniversary edition anyway<br /><br />this CD contains all new Liner notes with Gillan Glover Lord and Paice about the making of the album, very interesting reading<br />apart from the original 7 tracks from the album Digital remastered<br />there's also extra 12 bonus tracks<br />some of the tracks are just studio chat and Outtakes aswell as remixes done by Roger Glover<br />one of the remixes is Speed king which does sound better than the original album version in my opinion<br />other remixes are Flight of the rat and Black night, Black night is remixed longer version than the single version<br />it's just longer solos in the song and Ian paice experiments a bit more with his Drum fills<br />i prefer the Extended version than the single cut<br />but you get both the original Black night single cut and the extended remix of Black night aswell<br /><br />Jam stew which is an instrumental outtake sounds like a 1970 version of speedmetal but sounds Hardrock ofcourse<br />Blackmore starts the track with fast riff and the rest of the band kicks in full throttle<br />Deep purple did play this track LIVE in 1970 for the BBC it's on the DEEP PURPLE-BBC SESSIONS CD with Gillan making up the lyrics on the spot<br />the Lyrics are very pathetic and silly and there was no point for it in the song so i do prefer the instrumental<br />Cry free another outtake or single remixed by Roger Glover and sounds fantastic<br /><br />so this 25th Anniversary edition of this Classic album is the best version to get<br />that's why i gave it 5 stars
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I definitely suggest picking this book up and reading it when you have ample time; you will definitely not want to put this book down once you've started it.  Deborah Harkness does such a good job of drawing a person into the story that you really don't notice the passage of time as you read.
B000005RRP|5.0|Deep purple's 2nd album FIREBALL released 1 year after IN ROCK is pretty Good classic album<br />which means not as Good as IN ROCK in my opinion<br />only most of the songs from the album are really Good Hardrockin' classics<br />title track Fireball is the best track on the album<br />for the original 7 songs<br />the track Fireball is like a 70'S version of speedmetal with an Organ describes the track<br />Demon's eye, No no no, strange kind of woman, The Mule and No one came are pretty Good Hardrock classics<br />Anyone's Daughter is lame and Fools is 8mins too long which should've been edited<br />cause there's alot of breaks during Fools that weren't necessary<br />so the song drags on as if the band didn't know where to end the song<br />so most of the album is excellent except for Fools and anyone's Daughter.<br />in my opinion, but everyone has opinions so don't get offended<br /><br />this 25th Anniversary edition of Fireball released 1996<br />is the best version any fan will get of the album<br />you obviously get all original tracks from the album Digitally remastered<br />plus another 8 extra tracks<br />the single I'm Alone which is alright<br />2 album outtakes Freedom and Slow train which sound excellent my 2 favourite tracks from the<br />Fireball sessions Freedom, slow train are 2 Great fast Hardrockin' track<br />these 2 outtakes should've been on the album to replace<br />anyone's Daughter and Fools in my opinion<br />it's anybody's guess why Freedom and slowtrain weren't on the album<br />but they're both on this 25th anniversary remaster and both tracks kick ass<br /><br />you also get remixes of Strange kind of woman, Demon's eye and No one came<br />which do sound better than the Original tracks,<br />there's an Instrumental version of Fireball and backwards piano<br /><br />you also get a booklet with new liner notes about the making of Fireball<br />and what happened during the recording sessions etc, very interesting reading<br /><br />sothis new 25th Anniversary edition is definitely worth the money for sure<br />even thou the actual album is not as Good as IN ROCK<br />i still gave this 25th anniversary remaster 5 stars anyway cause of the extra tracks<br />and brand new Liner notes
B00B2V66VS|5.0|my 5 year old grandson loves this game..he calls it &#34; the running jumping game&#34; and is currently in the 42% global leaderboard...not bad for a little guy!  ;)
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|The game was free! Awesome for those long train rides to and from work. I always catch the people next to me wanting to play!! Download your own! The game is way better than the original. All the characters are funny an entertaining.
B000TU16GS|5.0|This book was really interesting and really pulled me in when I started to read it. I would recommend this book to whoever because it was really good!
B00499QUK2|5.0|Getting to enjoy all of Sherlock series. Didn't know of this series until I was browsing in Amazon TV Series.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Well written, heart wrenching story! Jodi Picoult never disappoints with her clear, relatable characters and interesting story lines. Great book!
B0081336FO|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the series and looking forward to more episodes. BBC Television have some interesting detective and mystery programs, and Sherlock is at the top of the must see list.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Thoroughly reacher. I've read most of Le child's works and enjoyed them all.just waiting for the next great piece in his writing.
B0089LOG02|5.0|A very interesting read about a subject I knew little about.  The book was well crafted the characters full developed and the story line compelling.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book and have recommended it to our book club for the 2014 list of books to be read.
3836538725|5.0|the most outstanding photographer of our times!  The photographs are exceptional, printing gorgeous, a treasure to own and look at again and again.
B00FPH6M82|3.0|somehow boring in-between and dragging out to fill the time, the PC generated effects have been well done and the end came too quickly.
B00DU74U74|5.0|I was just sitting around picking out a few movies to watch and was very surprised when I watched this movie.  It's low key, with some intense moments but with a very nice story.  Most of the actors were very good.  I rented this movie, but wish I had bought it, since I rented it twice.  It does appear as if this movie was going to try to be a TV series.  Wish it had.  The movie does have closure but leaves an opening for sequels.  It's a kind of feel good movie.  Though with SciFi, I usually like the action flicks with lots of special effects.  This was a pleasant surprise with some very nice special effects.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|It was great to learn what happened to Danny after the Overlook Hotel! Good characters and compelling plot. Thanks again Stephen King!
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Good app for weather. Works well with kindle HD.  I have looked at many weather apps and this one fills the bill.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Brilliant writing.  I loved the simplicity and decisiveness of Alma.  How many Alma's existed to bring us to where we are in 2013.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|OMG what a great movie.  Kept me glued to the screen right from the start to the finish.  Brad Pitt did a great job on this movie.  Highly recommend
B009JZSC9S|5.0|It just keeps getting better and better!  I don't know when I've more enjoyed a TV series!  You'll get hooked too!
B00G32OER4|5.0|I like good horror movies and this one kept me glued to the screen.  I would highly recommend this to my horror loving friends.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Like a bag of chips.  You can't just eat one!  At this point, I'll have to go on a diet=)
B00E8S2KV2|1.0|I received movie today, and digital copy expired yesterday!!! How is it possible? Also this is unfair, I bought the movie with digital copy, I could buy it in store, but I ordered from amazon, and that's a second movie I receive with expired digital version
B00G32OER4|5.0|great movie a lot of detail will watch it again! Love the house it took place in, based on real events makes it better!
B005AVIZ6U|5.0|Lee Child never fails to impress as a thriller writer.  This book is no exception.  Could not put it down.  'Jack Reacher' at his best
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This was an amazing game to challenge your self and beat you and your friends record. Must download it is fun
B00499NHLC|5.0|Fantastic update of Sherlock, Benedict Cumberbatch  and his partner are great together, locations in and around London, excellent storyline with the added on screen writing so you know what Sherlock has noticed around a crime scene and suspects, Great. love it hoping they do series 3.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Creative and challenging.  Kept me interested and wanted to keeping playing.  One of the better games I have downloaded.  Will recommend it to friends.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The author departs from his usual formula of legal strategy and courtroom drama and produces what is essentially an adventure/crime novel.  It may disappoint those searching for the usual Grisham fare, but this is a page-turner nonetheless.  There is a great twist, but it becomes somewhat predictable well before it should.  Overall, a very entertaining read, but I would expect nothing less from one of my favorite mass appeal authors.
B000OCXIDK|4.0|rating the book I'd give it 4 stars.  Since I saw the original painting in Belgium a couple of years ago, I was impressed by the girl's narration of her life as a servant in the household of Vemeer the painter.  She mentioned the old church, and the meat market and other locations which I saw when I was there.  I liked the book so well that I ordered the Movie and was terribly disappointed in it.  It followed the story line, but the narration could have been much better.  Martha
B009XHAM8G|5.0|Made me cry each time I read it. If you are a mom, you can relate to this in all levels.
B00ARI9CDQ|5.0|You can get up to the minute news all in one place without having to jump from site to site.<br />It is convenient. informative and a time saver.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|This book is awesome!!! Is there going to be another sequal?<br />JUST PURE AWESOMENESS! So please tell me if there is going to be another sequeal
B00B0NDF26|5.0|Great addition to the Tegan and Sara collection. I liked this album better than Sainthood by a long shot. I saw them in concert performing the entire Heartthrob album and it was every bit as incredible as I thought it would be. I look forward to what Tegan and Sara have for us in the future.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Got it today and already watched the Alien *(the first disk) with pleasure @ the slight differences and reasoning behind what made this the ultimate Alien(s) movie (grouping) ever!  I had to check it out because I wanted to get it for someone for Christmas this year and wanted to know exactly how good (or bad) of a choice I made! Man was I ever surprised @ how Outstanding this movie is/was back when it first came out (1978/9-- 2003!) I'm surprised it didn't win more recognition back in it's day! Because the Alien movie was exquisite and I expect the rest to follow suit! I'm a BIG fan of this genre or rather all the Alien movies and this deal was too much 2 pass up! So I went 4 It and was seriously WoWed!! ! !! Thanks Always Amazon for providing such fantastic memories and movies and entertainment to fully satisfy and fulfill old past dwellers such as myself by offering such items @ GR8 deals and PRICES 2 Match!<br /> Always,<br />  LeAnne M Pruitt
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|My son has been wanting this since a preview from comiccon and even though it was officially released a couple of months ago, I have not been able to find it anywhere. This is a great price all the sites that have had it were very expensive.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|great entertainment; great acting and writing; they've gotten a ggod balance of human interest without making it into an LA Law type soap opera
B005DOL0R0|5.0|Bought this for my Husband for his new Kindle.  It's really nice and it has good padding, just incase you drop it.  He is very pleased with it.
B000VI12ZS|5.0|I have seen many movies that feature Nicolas Cage as the main actor. War movies are my thing. Nicolas film this movie with a lot of zeal and veracity. I was able to watch the movie in my new 37&#34; tv, enjoying the music and the scenery as an all time experience. I never knew about the Navajo language been used as a code. The two actors that portrayed the Navajo coders acted their parts effortlessly.
B00ESY77LO|4.0|Cinematography is amazing.  Interesting movie.  Never read the book, so can't really compare, but I found it to be thought provoking with good performances.
B001J1K5IG|5.0|This movie is an extreme good example of American film. I have always loved Western movies and Wyatt Earp has deepen even more my love for this movie genre. Kevin Costner, and the rest of the cast display an excellent chemistry between them. It is amazing to me how authentically Dennis Quaid portrays Doc Holliday by loosing a great amount of weight and looking so emaciated and ill. Kevin Costner is a great director. Who does not enjoy the landscapes, trains, clothing, and how real it all looks.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Truly Inspiring, especially for a young woman like myself, getting ready to launch her career.  It is a great perspective to have in one's back pocket.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|Do not get this app! I got it, played it for about a half of an hour, then deleted it. It is junk! I tried to give it another chance, but it sucks. I repeat: DO NOT GET THIS APP!
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|great movie for kids that still believe me and the kids really liked it but its more for Christmas time glad i bought it.
B00915G6MG|5.0|Love this show!!  Full of action, drama, intrigue and humor.  Great cast who completely get into their characters.  Great writing and story lines.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Loved it , so enjoying the current season. Sundays are Dead to me! l Love this series!! So creatively done
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Excellent. Exceptional plot twists, spot-on writing. Enthralling! Writing that exceeds all our hopes but is still the least we expect from such a franchise.
B00G32QIEG|4.0|I heard a lot of bad reviews but My GF and I laughed our butts off was very entertaining movie
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is one of my favorite apps!!! I actually someone playing this game on their phone in the  theatre  right before despicable me 2 started. I really like how the creators changed the residential level for Halloween:)
B005PK56TA|4.0|Chilling, but well written Drama/ Horror. Addictive, attraction for an aquired taste. Not for children under 18 or the immature.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham has gone back to his forte, the courtroom drama. Character development is excellent. Great insight into the workings of the courtroom.  Interesting plot twist at end.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is by far the funniest and saddest book I have ever read. I laughed and I cried very hard. Very good
B00E0SX118|5.0|This was a very good movie, kids stayed into it the whole time and they love watching it over and over.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|good movie, exciting very enjoyable to watch,didnt have no problems enjoying the movie,DONT MISS A GOOD MOVIE I WOULDUY IT AGAIN
B00F8MIIKO|5.0|A must see with all the family, we have seen it several times and it never gets old, the movie is funny and very cute, i woulds recommend for anyone to see no matter the age.
B008PUF3VS|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone got is close to exact to the movie but overall this is a neat book to read
B005544TRQ|5.0|Intriguing and intelligent- this show keeps me on my toes and really stimulates the mind! Its brilliantly written and the actors are phenomenal. Nothing but good things to say about this show.
B00F4PM6WG|5.0|My two year old loves trains, so I pretty much download any train app but my son plays this app by far the most!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This show keeps getting better and better- its addictive! I have recommended it to everyone I know and they have loved it just as much. The plot twists and character development makes the show feel fresh- I look forward to the next season!
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This game is just so addicting and so awesome!! If you rack up enough points you can see the video and get new characters for your train station!! SO MUCH FUN. YOU WILL NOT REGRET GETTING THIS GAME.
B00F8MI9NK|5.0|Love this movie! So cute and funny! This movie is so good that adults and children will love it! A must watch!
0307730700|5.0|I love this book.  Eric Blehm did a great job capturing the courage and life of Adam Brown.  Godspeed brother!
B0058P7KUA|5.0|One word, AWESOME<br />But I also love the survival words, endless zombies and the waves always get harder to beat.
B007XAYKX8|4.0|A well made documentary on the European Grand Prix motorcycle road racing world, following the top racers. Excellent racing footage and some real excitement in the competition. Crashes are a part of GP racing but the film emphasizes a bit too much of those.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I love Downton Abbey and it is great getting it early. Not only do we watch the DVD but we watch the program on tv. We get twice the enjoyment of the program.
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|This is, without a doubt, the WORST TREK MOVIE ever released. It was written, directed and produced by a bunch of CLODS that probably never had an original thought in their lives. This  current version of Trek movies is supposed to predate The Original Series (TOS), but we have Kahn, Tribbles, Radiation Accidents and a myriad of other things introduced in TOS and TNG series, Did these idiots have a hand in remaking the Battlestar Galactia series that changed Starbuck into a female or the Ironside series that arbitrarily transformed Chief Ironside into a black man? I really wish that the powers to be in Hollywood would have the sack to prevent this kind of crap from being released in the future. May the people that made this film \\"Live Short and Go Broke\\".
B004FRX0MY|1.0|I have HTC Rezound, and I don't know why, but this app does not work. I've updated it, reinstalled it completely and it still will not show my songs. If I flip back and forth (with the buttons) between store and music player/cloud, it will flash the song for half a second (I can see the album art), but there's no way to play it. My music just doesn't show up in the app. My husband also played with it, trying to get it to work, and had no more success than I.
B00D2ZF3GQ|1.0|This is, undoubtedly, the WORST Will Smith movie ever made. It might even rival the worst Ed Wood movies for the worst movie ever made! At least in the Ed Wood movies you could laugh at the bad acting and plots. Here the acting and the plot are equally bad but you just sit there in wonderment at how boring it really is.  Jaden Smith should consider a different career path as he has almost no acting skill. And will Smith sucks in this supporting (or non supporting - as you may see it) role. The entire premise of the movie is that the blind alien creature can track you down and kill you based solely on your fears. I guess that means he can smell you. I would suggest that the backpack Jaden wears should include some deodorant, or better yet, fumigate the entire movie and forget it was ever made.<br />Don't waste your money on this film.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This book started off slow, but once I got into it, I couldn't put it down.  It really opened my eyes to what North Koreans are dealing with. It's very good reading, but scary.
B00G0KY1UO|3.0|This game is sorta fun, albeit a little repetitive.  The controls are a bit challenging for my 6 year old. It is easier for my adult thumbs to maneuver. It's not a bad game.
B009CVRQLY|5.0|5 stars - Easily one of her best....you wouldn't be sorry if you purchase this album..  Don t miss Breakaway, thank you
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wish each of us had to walk in Auggie's shoes for a week. Quick and delightful read. A few happy tears at the end.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I started this book so that I could read it before seeing the movie, now there is no need to see the movie, no way it could ever compare.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Awesome story. The book does a great job at keeping the reader engaged. A lot more twists than I expected.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|This was bought as a gift for my son but he indicates he likes it very much and that it is very informative.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I like the Pendergast series and read them all. A bit far-fetched (but then they all are, and seem to be getting more so) but it is a page-turner and an enjoyable read. For a while I thought that the series had ended but P&C are keeping the franchise alive and I'm glad they are.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Really like this show. Great story line, great characters, all around fun entertainment. Keeps you guessing. Would recommend to anyone.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I was skeptical at first, but used it as leverage to get my wife to watch the Game of Thrones series. I was pleasantly surprised with the show. As someone who really doesn't like the Pride and Prejudice type of story this is really a more interesting behind the scenes look at the gritty detail behind the pomp and circumstance.
B000YJ54DU|4.0|The book keeps my beliefs in perspective that no-one is better than someone else. We might be different but equal. The book took some time to get fired up but it got going and did not stop.<br />Lee did a great job of keeping a lot of different stories going at the same time, but not losing the reader.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|This attaches to my tripod -- not that it had to -- and hold my camera and sound recorder snuggly and where I want them.  I'm very happy with this product.
1476727651|5.0|Stephen King is one of this century's premiere story tellers.  His latest book is up to his standards with interesting characters doing unforeseen things.  A page turner, which I have already recommended to several others.
B00124PXW8|5.0|It doesn't get any better than this! The exorcist is one of my favorite movies. I prefer the original version.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Much better than expected. Lots of action and excitement throughout the movie. I'd easily recommend this movie to family and friends
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is my first time playing Candy Crush. I have enjoyed it so far. The only con with the game is that it makes you wait for certain amount of time in order to continue when your lives are used up. Outside of that, cool game.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|I don't care for this game. Can't find what the attraction that my friends have been talking about.  I found it kind'a boring.  I may ask my friends about it and give it another try.  But will probably remove it from my device.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|When you buy Eminem's new album, and hopefully you will choose to buy it instead of just downloading it (I always buy albums from those who actually deserve it, and then download everything else), make sure you get the Deluxe version. Like many other people have said, this album is as great as the first three. I actually would put Recovery above a couple of those first three as well, but I'll keep the review on this album. I was a little worried when I heard he was returning to Marshall Mathers. I thought he might try to force something that wasn't necessarily a part of him anymore considering his recovery and mellow attitude. As soon as I heard the 7 minute intro song, &#34;Bad Guy&#34;, I was no longer worried. I would argue that this is the best opening song to one of his albums since &#34;White America&#34; on The Eminem Show (excluding the opening curtains skit). What I love about this album is that there really is something for everyone. The amount of musical genres he uses just goes to show how truly talented he is and how much better he is than everyone else in his profession. I enjoyed the references to The Marshall Mathers LP and songs on the other albums. The Deluxe songs on the album are fantastic as well. Usually, you are able to tell why songs on a deluxe version didn't make the cut for the orignal album. That is not the case with these songs. I would have probably replaced a couple of these songs with songs on the ablum, most notably &#34;Stronger Than I Was&#34;. Other than that, this album is fantastic. I can tell that this CD will remain in my car for months. I'm glad to see that most other reviewers loved the album as well.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead is by far one of the greatest shows on right now & this season with the &#34;governor&#34; is really intense!
B001BR7CZW|5.0|I liked the extra content that talks about the movie. haven't seen this movie in over 30 years. glad I bought it
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I got this for my son but I am loving it too!  Just wish I didn't need acorns for a lot of things.  Either I work on patience or buy them. Lol
B006PZBRCY|4.0|This is a great boy/dad growing up and bonding movie.  The robot and hence the actors are underdogs and you really want to cheer for them.  Too much boxing violence too give it a 5 star.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest! So many great ideas and recipes. I get a lot of inspiration for my projects from this.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Great story line. Attractive, attractive Sherlock Holmes. An intelligent series for the brain. After the first episode I am a hooked fan!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love to play this game, but I have gotten to level 35 and can't get to kevel 36. It doesn't  tell me what to do. I want to play further!!
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|I watched this film without knowing what to expect. I haven't read any of the books and I am not really a Tom Cruise fan. I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It is an action packed thriller that catches you from the opening scene and keeps you on the edge of your seat right up until the very end. The acting is very good - headlined by Tom Cruise. Cruise is great in this role. He portrays as Reacher a tough, and intriguing character. His performance is one of the main reasons I enjoyed this film so much. The action was exciting and the storyline kept me interested. Overall this movie was well made and a lot of fun. I would strongly recommend it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|The game is nice and fun but when you get it every few minutes it asks if you want to rate it that is boring the game is fun and you don't have to wait for things to be created they are built instantly
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Very addictive, but I wish it had instructions on how to play the new levels and how to best use the power plays.
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|Oh finally!! 8 ball play is my favorite game!!!  I have playing this game on facebook so I just bought my kindle fire and tried to apply 8 ball pool in kindle fire but no there. I was upset. Now I got this game finally...
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|c'mon ads on calc app? it's just silly. I'm not going to use app like that, there are plenty better made aps without ads.
B009TGXGJ8|5.0|This is a fun movie.  Being familiar with the plight of transgendered people, I was amazed at how accurately this condition is protrade in this movie.  I thoroughly enjoyed.  I highly recommend this movie for good entertainment, or a look in to a very plausible transgendered person's life.  ​
B00EQ30RVY|3.0|It sound like an ok cover of STP songs.  They don't sound the same without Scott obviously.  Blends in with other stuff I have.

B00EOO55GW|5.0|Awesome as always, AX7 is one of my favorite groups.  &#34;Hail to the King,&#34; &#34;Sheperd of Fire,&#34; &#34;This Means War&#34; are my favorites on this album.
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS GAME IS AWESOME AND I MEAN AWESOME. YOU BUILD WORLDS OF BLOCKS!! It is the only game I have played for 5 months.
B003XKPPOU|2.0|I was very disappointed that the package did not come with the digital copy code inside which was the whole point of me making this purchase.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|A classic.  This movie, based on the short lived TV series is great on many levels.  Most of the actors have gone on to make their mark in other TV series.  The story is a space western.  It is much more than standard SciFi.  If you like scif coupled with action, a love story and a few monsters then get Serenity.
B0050DIWFC|1.0|Really disappointed in this book, would not recommend.  Didn't care for any of the characters, thought the whole premise was rather lame.  Will probably be a Lifetime channel movie in the future.
B001OQCV2E|4.0|John Cusiak again proves that he can handle a major roll and an action movie.  This movie has great special effects.  Woody Harrilson provides a comic relief.  In all the special effects, mostly CG, are the real stars.  Good movie.
1843106698|5.0|This is an excellent resource for anyone working with or living with an Aspie.  He is the expert in this field.
B002ZG98J6|5.0|A great cast with both unknowns and established actors.  I suspect this is aimed at teens but adults can enjoy it too.  The effects are great and the mostly unknown young actors are fun to watch.  If you like  action with a mild love story thrown in this is your movie
B0040I09RM|5.0|Missed out on this show somehow.  Glad i can catch it now love it, family now waits to see next episode and love it more as each plays. Good action and bikes for those of us who want that and some drama for the rest.
1401323820|4.0|An interesting ABC marketing idea originally published to promote the Castle TV show.  As the show has been on the air for several<br />seasons and several more books published, the idea worked.  The actual book is cute, short and readable.  The TV characters are more interesting.  For fans of Castle it is a fun read.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|Great and entertaining game.  It makes you think and is not as easy as it first appears.  As you progress through the game it gets harder and more challenging.
B002CMLIJ6|4.0|The X Man Series continues.  This movie is well written, Hugh Jackman does a great job with the character.  If your a fan of the X Man ten you'll want to add this movie to your collection.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Perfect read for all, but even more so for the dog lover. I will miss these characters. I can see a sequel...
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|Not a whole lot that I can add to what has already been posted here...this is simply one of the greatest rock albums ever. This is one you can't pass on.
B00821OW8K|5.0|Love!!!!  I really enjoy this show. Hope it lasts a long time. Love Noah Wyle he is great. A MUST WATCH.
B00E1ZIZ3O|1.0|As a huge Peter Gabriel fan, it's disappointing to see this project so poorly executed. Most PG fans will cringe in horror at the off-key, dissonant, ill-conceived covers that fill this record. At best, a few cuts are benign but boring, sucking the life out of PG's compositions. Few of the artists attempt new arrangements; instead, there's just a lot of stoned, walking-dead karaoke. The last two tracks have some merit, as Lou Reed and Paul Simon both attempt new approaches to &#34;Solsbury Hill&#34; and &#34;Biko,&#34; but &#34;Biko&#34; is the only one I can ever imagine enjoying.  This is sad and unexpected because a number of artists have developed interesting covers of PG songs over the years (Richard Shindell's version of &#34;Mercy Street&#34; is masterful and a few artists have put an interesting spin on &#34;In Your Eyes&#34;), but sadly this album will just make most listeners ache to hear PG's original versions.
B000FC10HA|4.0|First published in 1993, \\"The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing\\" by Al Ries and Jack Trout has become an invaluable resource for both aspiring and established marketers.<br /><br />And no wonder: This little book is bursting at the spine with powerful, actionable marketing insights.<br /><br />Take for example Law #4: The Law of Perception.<br /><br />This law states that \\"Marketing is not a battle of products, it's a battle of perception.\\" The treatment given to this law - complete with real world examples and strategies for implementing it in your own business - is worth the book's asking price all on its own.<br /><br />That Ries and Trout offer so many additional marketing \\"bon mots\\" to go along with this one only increases the book's value.<br /><br />Throughout \\"22 Laws\\" Ries and Trout challenge commonly held marketing beliefs. They tackle - mercilessly but with a good dose of humor - such sacred cows as line extension, leadership, and - gasp! -- admitting product negatives.<br /><br />You'll be engaged from one page to the next.<br /><br /> And at just under 150 pages, \\"22 Laws\\" is a quick read. Work your way through the book over your morning cup of coffee and start implementing what you've learned after lunch.<br /><br />Do I have any complaints?<br /><br />Well, as some other readers have mentioned a fair few of the laws do seem to overlap considerably with others. This wasn't a problem for me. I felt like even those laws that were treading familiar ground offered up enough nuance to justify their inclusion.<br /><br />My biggest gripe isn't really even the book's fault.<br /><br />Like all books, \\"The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing\\" is a product of its time. Written nearly two decades ago this poses certain problems for today's reader.<br /><br />In terms of human behavior, twenty years is nothing. Folks are still looking to products to satisfy their needs for validation, excitement, security - whatever. And the savvy marketer is going to take full advantage of this.<br /><br />What has changed - and changed dramatically - since 1994 is our available technology.<br /><br />Ries and Trout couldn't have possibly envisioned the growth of the Internet and the impact it would have on the global marketplace.<br /><br />As a result, certain laws such as Law #22: The Law of Resources are challenged to the point of irrelevance.<br /><br />The Law of Resources states that \\"Without adequate funding an idea won't get off the ground.\\" This is okay in so far as it applies to major companies. If I'm planning to take on Apple in the smartphone market, yes, my coffers had better be plenty deep.<br /><br />However, in this era of e-commerce, digital distrobution, and social media - to name but a few channels - products can be launched for relatively little. Shoestring budget? Shoestrings have never stretched so far.<br /><br />More bothersome is Ries and Trout's assertion that \\"You'll get farther with a mediocre idea and a million dollars than with a great idea.\\"<br /><br />Thankfully, the advent of the Internet - and Web 2.0 in particular - ensures that this statement is now resoundingly false. Do plenty of crummy products still dominate the market thanks to big budget ad campaings? Absolutely. (I'm looking at you Justin Bieber.)<br /><br />But it's also never been easier for a product to command market share on its merit alone. If your product is truly special there are all sorts of ways to harness the power of blogs, social media, Amazon reviews, et al to build a receptive audience.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you release a turd to the market, well, prepare to have folks make a stink about it ... and that's going to cost you.<br /><br />We the people are the new kingmakers; not the mavens of Madison Avenue.<br /><br />Even with this caveat on the table, I highly recommend \\"The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing\\". While I believe \\"immutable\\" is stretching it - for some laws more than others - there's more than enough insight on offerin this little book to justify a purchase and close reading.<br /><br />I look forward to revisiting this book throughout my sales and marketing career.in this little book to justify a purchase and close reading.<br /><br />I look forward to revisiting this book throughout my sales and marketing career.
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|love this movie. nice to see a movie about women doing something other than chasing boys.  can't wait for the sequel.
1451666179|5.0|This book really is terrific.  The words are perfect, the pictures brilliantly simple, and it all comes together to tell the stories. Anyone can relate to the author and her adventures.  You won't be sorry.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|At first, I kept seeing the add everywhere and it was getting annoying so I gave up and decided to play.BEST IDEA YET. It is SO FUN AND ADDICTING.The only thing I don't like about it is that when you run out of lives you have to wait like 30 minutes to get ONE life.But I just overlook it now.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I loved Divergent and  Insurgent.  There was hope and possibility. there was love and friendship along with the chaos.  they were fighting for a purpose.  But Allegiant. Felt disconnected, the love and friendships were barely plot points. it was constant fighting & chaos.  The ending didnt add to the story, didnt help show how things were going to change.  I was so disappointed.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Not all that..can't use it as a stand alone. .Also caused conflict with home wifi..otherwise not a bad thing. .I think
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|cleaned a couple gigs in less than 5 mins. interface was clean and user friendly. if u need to clear some internal storage with the quickness, this is the right app......FINALLY!!!!!
B005VPRFSY|5.0|It was a gift for my grandson and he loves it. He needs some help from his father to assemble.
B00ARN0ZF0|3.0|Not what I would call a real thriller, very well suited for 10 to 14 year olds. Just enough to get th thinking but not too graphic although the language was a little more than I would recommend for a 10 year old. For adults it was not much to write home about but it had its moments.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I could not have asked for a better puzzle game. Mind blowing out of the box puzzles that can't be found anywhere else. A little short but fun and exciting. Can't wait for number 2.
B008JEJOCY|5.0|I purchased the Crocs Duet sport as my first pair of Crocs ever.  Man, I love these shoes! I bought them primarily to freshwater fishing from the shore.  But I have ended up using these for everything around the house.  Great product!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless by Colleen Hoover is the first book in the Hopeless series. This book is the story of how Sky met and fell in love with Holder, of secrets (his and hers) and how revealing them is more painful than any one of them imagined.<br /><br />A beautiful story with a devastatingly painful twist, this book will draw you in and keep you guessing along with your characters all the way until the reveal. This was light-hearted and funny in parts and heart-breaking in others. Sky is quirky and different and Holder is misunderstood and deeper than most people are aware.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book, even with all the angst. Just be prepared with tissues and chocolate when reading, there will be a few spots you'll need both.<br /><br />This is definitely a must read for any romance/new adult reader.<br /><br />Forget all the firsts, Sky. The only thing that matters to me with you are the forevers.<br />-Holden<br /><br />He pulls me to him and I let him. He feels safe. He feels like home when I’m wrapped up in him. He holds me and rubs my back, kissing the side of my head every now and then. He keeps saying, “Don’t worry,” over and over and he holds me for what feels like forever.<br />-Sky
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Extremely addicting! This one is difficult to put down and I find myself playing it whenever I have a free moment.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|this will be so much better when google adds more to it. great concept and awesome first run. I can cast from my laptop ANY webpage and some apps from my phone.  It does have issues when trying to watch videos on the web in full screen but I figure that will be worked out very soon.
B008OW1S3O|5.0|Great Album! It grows on you, every time I play it I enjoy it more. Made two more fans since I've gotten it.
B008DBF5Z8|2.0|First off the edges of the images were somewhat blurred. The center part of images were sharp but on the outer edges not  so much.  When I switched to lower resolution the camera would not focus to sharpness. Everything was fuzzy. I returned the camera for a refund. Maybe I just got a defective one!
B00902AKK4|5.0|Thankgoodness i found it again! Had this app for the HP touchpad and lost it when I upgraded to android. Loved this app!
B00A0ABQLM|4.0|I'm using a Lenovo Yoga with Kubuntu 13.04, and this adapter works great for working around the Yoga's finicky wifi card.<br /><br />NB: This adapter uses the Asix AX88179 chipset, but 13.04 does not include drivers for it since it is using Linux 3.8. You will need to get the drivers from some other source. (Newer versions of linux should have the driver built-in.) Since I use an Ubuntu distro, I was able to add a PPA to get the driver installed easily. I just added qji's AX88179 repo from Launchpad.<br /><br />You can look that up on Google, or enter these commands into a terminal:<br />sudo add-apt-repository ppa:qji/ax88179<br />sudo apt-get update<br />sudo apt-get install ax88179<br /><br />After a reboot, you can just plug in the adapter and it should work! I'm taking away one star because of the extra step involved in installing the driver.
B00594XOZU|1.0|random people were able to contact my daughter.  When we tried to remove the app it was super hard to figure out how to get rid of it and delete her profile.  After we deleted it the first time, a guy we didn't know kept trying to get in touch with her.  I would not recommend it.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Dual narratives about two women and how they affect each other's lives.<br />A great read! I really enjoyed it !
B00FKAA3MA|3.0|I rated this as a 3 and to come up with my rating I used a tier system.  5 Star albums are Slim Shady and MM lp, food and liquor,  illmatic,  follow the leader, college dropout and masters of the universe; 4 star albums are recovery,  its dark and hell is hot, me against the world, anghellic, and it was written; 3 star albums include everready, 400 degrees, Life and times of S Carter, and While MMLP2 is better than any 3 star album i listed,  inconsistencies kept it from being as good as the 4 star albums. Also, to be honest I expected a continuation of MM lp but instead received a look back at some scenes from the author's life.  This alone doesn't kill the album but combined with unfitting beats and sometimes lame lyrics this album gets drug down. Also, due to the name comparisons will be made to the first and I was disappointed that there was nothing on the level of criminal, way I am, kill you,  etc.  That's not to say this isn't good,  it reminds me of when Andre 3000 did his solo cd or when Common did electric circus, both of which I liked. There were moments of insane brilliance, moments of blandness, and a few moments of disappointment. I like that Em got in touch with his white side on some songs and even had a hook that sounded almost country on desperation. I've listened a few times and see this as an artistic achievement and fun album, but I'm not blown away. I'll be listening a few times and add a track by track break down.
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|I'll admit I'm not all of the way through things yet... but there is a heck of a lot on this set to get through!<br /><br />I've watched the film. I was certainly curious what new footage would be added to what was already a somewhat embellished (some less kind people may even say bloated) version of the tale of The Hobbit... The additions actually worked quite nicely. The addition of the Goblin Town song was worth the proverbial price of admission, alone!<br /><br />I haven't listened to the commentary track, but I look forward to it. It is a bit disappointing to only have one track, as I enjoyed the each of four that were on the various extended LOTR films... but I won't hold that against this release. I will enjoy what we do have rather then lament what I wish we could have had.<br /><br />What I have done is gotten part way through the appendices. I'm three hours into the roughly nine hours worth of documentary footage. This is what I was most looking forward to on this release, and most worried might not live up to my expectations.<br /><br />What were those expectations? Well, when it came to The Lord of the Rings, the excellent behind the scenes material within the appendices wove a tale that was, in my opinion, just as compelling as that within the narrative of the films. I felt like I got to know not only the usual suspects of the actors and the director, but many of the other usually invisible people who worked on the film. I felt like I was taken along on the journey with them. I became emotionally invested in their tale. I felt genuine sadness as the filming of The Return of the King came to the end, and everyone started saying goodbye to each other... I felt as if I was saying goodbye to them, as well. It had just the same, if not greater, emotional impact as within the film itself when Frodo was saying goodbye to Sam as he was preparing to pass into the west...<br /><br />This was a lot to live up to. Would the behind the scenes tale of The Hobbit be able to recapture that magic? Well, I am only three hours in, about a third of the way into what will theoretically be only a third of the final tale once the last part of The Hobbit comes out... And I am pleased to say that it looks like the magic has been recaptured. I feel like I am seeing old friends once again, and meeting new friends along with them. I feel like I am reliving fond memories and forming new ones.<br /><br />Their tale can still tug at me. And I am glad to be along for the ride once more.ble to recapture that magic?

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|it is definitely addicting.  hope it keeps our mind working  and challenging.  it's not always easy to get to the next step even when you win the level, but alas, just like gambling, you go back for more.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|My 9 year old loves these books.  He is reading the whole series. He also loves that he gets to read them on my Kindle.
B00932AA5G|5.0|I underestimate this movie but half way to the movie I love it. One thing about this movie, it's unpredictable. Well written, directed and well acted. There was alot of energy. I pause, rewind like 5times just to watch again. This is absolutely great. I mean it is great. I thought the ending will be ackward, but was wrong. Its a must watch.
B002AKPECW|4.0|This is an imaginative and satisfying work of science fiction. Reynolds creates a world that feels at once fantastic and believable. Both the character and plot arcs are well paced, and having resolutions that feel earned and complete. In particular, his desire to obey the constraints of relativistic speeds while still providing a galaxy-spanning opera leads to a number of novel and fascinating plot developments that seem to emerge organically from the universe he creates.<br /><br />I was gripped in particular by one theme that was endemic to the way Reynolds tells his story: that of the relationship between the value of a civilization and its longevity. The main characters in this book are part of a civilization who live lives that stretch millions of years, much of which is spent travelling at relativistic speeds in something like a coma. From their own perspective, this historical omnipresence makes them one of the greatest civilizations ever to have existed. Yet, unlike some relatively ephemeral civilizations, they have made few works which leave an enduring mark, and remain relatively disconnected from the politics and struggles of the rest of the galaxy. This provokes several questions: What's the mark of a truly great civilization? Is mere endurance sufficient, or must there be impact?<br /><br />Despite the engaging plot, and rich thematic exploration, the book is far from perfect. Reynold's work falters in the quality of the writing itself. He frequently falls back on bland, repetitive language and structure. The writing is, at times, amateurish. He misuses words, for example. On p. 97, he writes that no civilization is &#34;known to possess... sophistry in vacuum manipulation...&#34; Clearly he means &#34;sophistication,&#34; not &#34;sophistry&#34; (unless there are rhetorical requirements on manipulating vacuums that I don't understand). This isn't the only instance of this sort of mistake, and all are distracting.<br /><br />I should also note that theKindle version has numerous typos. Dozens and dozens. Either no one at the publisher read it after it was scanned into an electronic form, or worse, they didn't care. I don't want to take off any stars for this, but the publisher should be held accountable for quality control.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I know I'm not the only one who finds it tough to write a review of a fantastic book, so I'm just going to jump right in.<br /><br />Eleanor and Park were such a adorable, real couple. I loved how they started off—not speaking to each other on the bus, not even liking each other all that much—and I loved how their friendship steadily progressed—a shared comic book on the bus, no words at all, to more and more shared words, borrowing and lending comic books. The sweetest, most heart-melting, first hand-holding experience ever. A cute first kiss. Eleanor realizing little details about Park and Park realizing little details about Eleanor. A sweet and slow descent into first love that just made my. Heart. Melt.<br /><br />Eleanor & Park is a coming of age love story done right. It was a love story between two very average teenagers. It was a love story that didn't just feature the couple, but their insecurities, their hardships, and their families as well. It was a love story that wasn't padded with unnecessary fluff, and wasn't dressed up too fancily grand moments of swoon. The romance was simple—baby steps were taken and the smallest moments were the biggest.<br /><br />The romance stole the show for me in this book, but I also loved how the other pieces came into play. The themes of bullying, social pressures, and self-image stood out the most to me. They all went hand-in-hand with each other, and even meshed well with Eleanor and Park's relationship. When the two struggled, they learned to lean on one another, to help one another out. They learned how to become more comfortable with each other and with themselves.<br /><br />Overall, Eleanor & Park lived up to every expectation I had of it and more. It made my heart melt. It made my heart hurt. I loved the central couple and the struggles they went through and the journey of first love they went on together. I loved the beautiful writing that made so many little moments my favorites. I loved how real it felt, and ultimately, I just loved that I got to read it.<br /><br />Eleanor & Park can be loved and appreciated by many people, and I highly, highly recommend reading it and witnessing Eleanor and Park's wonderful journey yourself.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I think I liked the first book a bit better, but this one is good too.  I am looking forward to seeing how this series will be concluded.  I do get kind of tired of the constant change of heart, but this is about a teenager and they are prone to changing their minds.  The story is quite good, but sometimes doesn't seem consistent enough.

I am very strict when I write my reviews but this one is very easy to rate. It is very addictive. But not to where it's a problem. If you have watched the movie, you'll make bunches of connections and be able to say I remember that!Don't want to get it, fine, more fun for the rest of us. But I'm really trying to tell you, your missing out if you don't.<br />.

B000I8ES5C|5.0|Kung Fu Hustle is a very creative take on the Hollywood martial arts action film.  The characters are atypical, including a no-nonsense landlady who pimp-smacks her cheating husband around and fights off oppressing gangs with a devastating lion's roar.<br />The opening sequences, which played out like a West Side Story musical, gave way to many mind-blowing special effects from the beginning of the film all the way to the end.<br />Well written, well acted and expertly directed, I would recommend Kung Fu Hustle to any lover of great film.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green has an incite into being a teenage girl that is a bit frighteningly accurate.  As a person who has experienced the loss of a love, I completely related to the love and the loss that Hazel felt and to the passion that Augustus displayed.  This love story took my breath away.
B0081336FO|5.0|Alas, if only we could get the BBC channel.  Then we'd be watching Season 3 right now.<br />This is one of the best written, well-acted TV shows that I have ever seen.  And I love that each episode is an hour and a half long.  A Scandal in Belgravia was such a steamy piece it had me reapplying my roll-on deodorant midway through.<br />Most TV shows need to reach a five-year mark to avoid cancellation and be considered a success.  All I can say is that, come the end of Season 3, BBC better clear their calendar for Sherlock for the next couple of years -- or they'll be getting some serious hate mail from me.
B003EY62II|4.0|Technically this is not a good movie but I love Scooby Doo and so do my kids (3 and 4).  They loved seeing Scooby and the gang as real people.  Scooby is still animated which is always strange but I guess there probably aren't many options for him in this kind of film.  Really the best actor in this film is Matthew Lillard.  He plays Shaggy and he literally IS Shaggy.  To see him as Shaggy makes this movie worth it in itself.  All and all  the kids will love it but don't expect to be blown away.
B008JFUPOY|2.0|if you have to watch it...rent it. or wait until it's on tee vee.<br />nothing clever. no real laughs. a real disappointment.
B00C76076C|5.0|So glad this movie finally came back out of the vault.  I couldn't wait to get my hands on it.  As a mom of a 4.5 year old girl I wanted it, but also for myself as it's a great movie.  My son also enjoys watching it (3 years old).  It's a fun movie with great music and Ursula!  I don't know that I ever realized it before...but to me she is the best Disney villain!  She is so fun in her nastiness!  I love her songs and sassiness.  She is such a monster but somehow likable until the end anyway.  Sweet movie that is a lot of fun with many lovable characters.  There are the usual stereotypes at play but the entertainment is there and my kids laugh out loud at the scenarios between Sebastian and the chef.  I love hearing that laughter!
B008JFUNHI|1.0|what a waste of time and money this was the worst movie i had seen this year to some it all up don't expect any real space battles their is some but not a whole lot, not much action ether this movie was a MAJORRRRRR LETTTT DOWNNNN maybe i was going in with the notion that this was going to be something like star wars but i was wrong. if you like dramas in space this is for you if you want major space battles look some where else becasue you will be very very disapointed.
B000SEI230|5.0|A beautiful, lovely story that was an easy read and very entertainng.  The flow of the parallel stories was heart warming.
B00F8LPH90|5.0|Great game, but it does become repetitive after a while, but nonetheless it is gratifying to blow up zombies. I played this game on iphone and glad that is available now for the Kindle Fire.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Could not put it down. Sucked right in from the beginning. Would recommended to any one looking for a great read.
B008J05EL8|2.0|cant figure out why I bought this!  I thought it would add readability or something.  Wish I could return it.  Not worth the  price in my opinion!  That's just my opinion!
1449437524|5.0|Great book. I love The Oatmeal online and purchased this to support their efforts. I also knew that I was getting a great book written with great wit! Highly recommended.
B003G4W49C|4.0|A page turner, makes you feel sorry for Ender<br />Watch the movie first, to much detail for the big screen
B005VO6MYS|5.0|Not generally a fan of live albums, but this is great! The song selection pulls from some of his older albums, with a nice jazz vibe.
B004GF244K|5.0|I had the opportunity to meet George in 1976……briefly.He was known as the quiet beatle, during his tenure with beatlemania.I also remember taking a bus some forty minutes from where I lived in the English country, to see the first day release of the movie &#34; A Hard Day's Night&#34;(still in my top 10 movies).I hid under the seat after the first showing, and gratefully stayed for the second.<br />Everybody loved George.<br />He was inward, spiritual(genuinely), and his songs exuded it.<br />His guitar playing was emotional,pushing the boundaries of one note soloing, using the slide with deft, warm,sometimes melancholic beauty.<br />As to the concert DVD,…………hard for me to keep a dry eye.It starts with an East Indian ensemble, featuring Ravi Shankar's daughter, but I found myself anxiously awaiting musical director Eric Clapton, and what was to follow.<br />Great band, featuring guys who know how to play George's music-a bevy of guests, with soul,and a truly emotional night.<br />Honouring a passed on friend, sharing his music with the world.<br />I play this DVD several times every year.It is beautiful,haunting in a good way,and it's a keeper.<br /><br />Chris Ehrlich
B00EEPFLHE|5.0|This is definitely Stryper's best new work since THWTD.  The songs are all very unique and well thought out.  Most have a catchy pop metal vibe.  The three-part harmony that Stryper is known for is very good and well produced.  My favorite part is the bonus DVD that contains about 20 minutes of dialogue concerning each song on the album.  I also enjoyed being able to listen to two of the new songs via the videos.  It is a really great way to introduce new material.  I love the artwork.  The back cover seems to emulate the THWTD back cover some 25 years later.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this app!!!!! fun and interesting and much better graphics than the first temple run. my favorite part is the mine carts! fun!
B005544TRQ|5.0|First season is the best,  Simple and enjoyable to watch.  I am watching Season 2, and feel it is a bit repeated with no new ideas,  twists, and not enough wits.  Still enjoyable to watch.  I am not sure about Season 3.
